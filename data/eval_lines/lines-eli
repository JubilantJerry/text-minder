Mr. Dunn, thank you for joining us.
You're the final piece in the puzzle.
The world will soon have a new order.
- Mom, what are you doing?
- Don't be sad.
Everything is going to be fine.
- She's not your mom.
- Being that you are the key, the last piece of the puzzle and the one that started this,
I was planning something a bit more theatrical for you and Neron.
Neron's father wanted to be here, but time's being what they are.
' No!
- Allison, no.
Stay back.
- Bring me the dagger.
It's time for the new millennium.
- Fuck you, you home wrecking cunt.
- Don't do this sweetheart.
He's your son.
I'm mom.
- Mom.
- Mom.

We'll go to the park.

It's strange but it actually works.
- Um well, Ali isn't here, so you're just gonna have to settle for aspirin.

Ma'am, may I ask you a personal question?

- Did you have a natural delivery when you had him?
- Yeah.
Why, what's wrong?
- Nothing, it's just, it's just I just never hear him cry.
Never.
- Well, Maria he's fine.
I mean when a child is born they have to acclimate.
They're going through a lot of changes, their bodies, their behavior patterns, their sleeping patterns.
He's just adjusting.
- Did he hurt his head or neck when he was in delivery?
- No.
Why would you say that?
What's wrong with his head?
He's fine.
- Nothing, it's just that in Mexico, when a kid is born before his or her time,
it's not a good thing.
- Maria, we live in America.
Okay, you live in America and I don't mean this to sound rude, but, we don't have those superstitions in this country.
Okay?
- I understand.

Now Kevin and I are going out tonight.

All we know is the nurse's house was demolished by who knows what.

Why would he tell you that?
- [Grandmother] 'Cause he cares about you.
- No, that his wife is crazy?
I can't believe he would do that.
God.
- You know,
it took me a while to believe your father was dead.
For so long I was just mad at him for taking his own life.
Because I wanted it to be me instead of him.
There was nothing I thought your father couldn't do.
Ah, he was the perfect husband, father, friend.
There was no comparison to his work as a psychiatrist.
His patients all loved him.
Ancl as he continued to free them all from their mental health,
their health slowly became his.
- You can't blame yourself mom.
- It was my responsibility to give him strength when he needed it.
If ailed him.
That's why I commend Kevin for doing for you what I couldn't do for your father.

No really, don't worry about Neron.
I will take care of him and he'll be just fine.
This isn't the psychiatrist talking.
This is mom.
- Come here.
Thank you.
I love you.
- Oh honey I love you too.
I do.
(quiet chattering)
- Hey you.
I've missed you these past couple clays.
- (exhales) There's been a lot going on.
Our nanny's missing and cops can't find her anywhere.
- What, are you serious?
- [Kevin] Yeah.
- Maybe she just went back to Mexico or something.
- Maybe.
I hope that's what it is.
- What else would it be?
- (sighs) I don't know.
- You seemed really stressed.
I could take care of you.
- Tara.
When Ali gets back, we, we can't see each other like this.
- I don't like to be alone.
I like it better when you're there.
- Ali's going through a lot right now.
I can't just pick up and go.
Just give me a couple clays.
Okay?
- I could just stay with you at your house
, f, "\ y\/,f, 'w '
She'd call you before she gets home, right?
- Yeah, she has to.
She doesn't wanna come home to an empty house.
She said she's definitely gonna call.
Come here.

- [Grandmother] Who are you?
Ancl what are you doing in my house?
- [Maria] He was on the floor.
Not a good place for a young baby.
- [Grandmother] I'm calling the police.
- I have an appointment.
Allison scheduled it for me.
- My daughter doesn't schedule my appointments.
(crowd chattering)
- Some night on the town Mom.

- Oh yeah.
Oh, let me take him.

Do you ever think of me?
Do you know what it's like to rot in hell here?

Hmm.
(Helen laughs)
Do you know what you did to me?
- [Helen] What?
Do you know what it's like to feel here, you rot in hell.
- (gasps) Oh my God, Jim.
No.
- Well now you're gonna feel like me.
Look at me.

- Yes, yes.
- Are you okay?
What happened?
- Someone shot my mom.
Someone shot my mom.
- Did you get a description of the person?
- No, I just walked in and found her.
- Where's the body?
- Upstairs in the office room.
- Go check it out.
(whimpers)
(sighs)
Do you have any idea who coulda clone this?
Ké
- Ma'am.
- I'm gonna need you to stay here ma'am.
Step inside please ma'am.

Let me have the baby.

- Follow the lieutenant.
- Step inside ma'am.
- She was right here.
She was right here.
She was.
She was dead.
She--
- Listen ma'am.
There is no dead body.
There's not even evidence of a dead body.
If you're feeling stressed, go see a shrink.
Or next time we are going to arrest you for filing a false police report.
Are you on medication?
- Yeah but, I'm not crazy.
- We've got a 1282.
- Let's get outta here.
- I'm not crazy.
I'm not crazy!

- Hey babe, is that you?
Hey.
What's wrong baby, what happened?
Why are you back home so early?
Oh what's wrong?
- My mom.
My mom, she's dead.
She's--
- What are you talking about?
- Kevin, I need you to believe me.
- Why wouldn't I believe you?
- Okay, I walked into my mom's office
'(k'\ 'r {";{f
It looked like somebody had shot her.
Okay, but when I called the police, her body was missing.
- [Kevin] Okay, whoa, slow down.
- [Ali] Her body was missing.
- Missing?
- Yes.
- Okay baby, that doesn't make any sense.
- I know.
- Maybe you were hallucinating.
- No.
No, I wasn't fucking hallucinating, Kevin.
Okay?
I saw my mom dead in her office.
I saw it.
Ancl it was real.
- Okay, I'm not saying you didn't see it.
Okay, maybe someone moved her.
- No.
No.
- Hey, hey.
Everything will be fine.
I promise.
Okay, we'll figure this out.
- Look, you gotta get some rest.
Get some rest.
For me.

Oh God.

- Hey babe.
I can explain.
- [Ali] In our bedroom Kevin.
- (scoffs) What are you talking about?
- In our bedroom Kevin?
Did you do it?
- Ali, you've, you've been so different and...
- Well yeah, yeah.
I'm boring and bitchy.
What, so you go and fuck my best friend, is that it?
- Hey babe, babe, babe.
- No, no!
Don't, don't, don't even touch me.

You're sick.
- Ancl you're a pathetic unfaithful bastard.

I don't wanna live with you anymore.
Get out!
Get out!
- You're fucking crazy and paranoid.
You know what, I'm gonna leave now, but I'm coming back for my son.
This is not a good environment for him.
_ Go!
- You need help!
- Now!
(unsettling music)
- Father I've, I've come to you because I don't know what else to do.
I, I don't know why he's so restless.
- I know why you're here.
Your problem is not with you.
It's your child.
- Father?
- No harm will come to your son.
The sister will take him outside and watch over him.
It's okay.
Thank you sister.
You are surrounded by a terrible evil, an evil that'll keep a cloak over you.
It will smother you if you take no action.
See to your child.
- I don't understand.
- See to your child.

- Hi, I'm Detective Corrigan.
I've believe you've met my associates,
Detectives Kerr, Detective Ferry.
- [Ali] Is this about my mom?
You found her.
- (sighs) Ma'am, you mind if we come inside and talk?
- What, so you found my mom?
- Nothing yet.
But the forensics team did find evidence of a blood splatter.
Sorry.
Ancl there's also the matter of the disappearance of a doctor and a nurse.
I'm pretty sure you know who they are.
The ones that tended to you during your labor.
- Doctor Jones is missing?
- Yeah.
Any idea about their whereabouts?
- No.
No.
Why would I?
(phone rings)
I'm sorry, I'm sorry officers,
I have to take that.
- Wait.
Wait a minute.
Okay.
- What the hell was that?
- Hey you.
How are you today buddy?
- What do you guys make of her?
- [Kerr] She definitely knows more than she's telling us.
(Neron cries)
- I don't know about that.
Hi.
Hi.
- [Kerr] What the hell is that smell?
Damn.
- You smelled it first.
- No, oh, no.
Chief, it's not my job.
I'm not, I don't do, I don't do that.
- But could we just wait 'til she gets back?
- Oh my gosh, you guys are such babies.

Oh you're so adorable.

Huh, how did that happen?

(startling tone)
- How many have died?
Or have gone missing?
- Five, maybe five Father.
- He will be a mortal soon.
(unsettling music)
Once he is a mortal, his only agenda will be to rule this Earth for a dark millennium.
Ancl he will use all the power of satan to do it, believe me.
- My son?
- You must put that outta your mind.
He is not your son.
He has come to bring forth hell on Earth.
Who's his father?
- Why does that matter?
I...
- [Priest] Who is he?
- I can't do this.
It's making me crazy.
- You knew he was different from the time he was born.
You know what I say is the truth, you've seen it in your dreams.
- Who are you?
- I'm like you.
But I've been given a terrible task.
I dwell in the void between the terrestrial and the celestial realms.
I oversee the balance between good and evil.
But now evil has twisted the scale.
- Are you an angel?
- Oh no, no.
I am not an angel.
I'm a mortal like you with a mortal's heart.
You must be willing to accept the unacceptable.
He is not your son.
What you see is only a vessel to something dark and beyond evil.
Now, who's his father?
- Kevin, my husband.
We don't live together anymore.
- [Priest] Where is he?
- He's with another woman.
She was my best friend.
- Listen,
he is a conduit for supernatural forces.
He is capable of producing even more evil.
He must be stopped.
It must be stopped.

- What do you want Kevin?
- [Kevin] Where are you?
I wanna talk to you.

Too much.
- [Kevin] Where's my son?
- [Ali] He's here.
- [Kevin] Where are you?
I wanna come get him.
- No, you're not taking him.
- Fine, I at least wanna see him.
Can I come in?
Hey.
Hey.
Get over here my little linebacker.
Hi.
Hi.
I missed you.
How you doing?
- [Ali] We need to talk about our son.
(Kevin sighs) 1r W
Let's work this out.
- No, that's not what I'm talking about.
When did you go to Mexico?
- (laughs) Sit down.
Hey buddy.
Mexico?
Really?
I don't know.
I don't remember.
What difference does it make?
What does that have to do with this?
- You went to see some black magic guy in Mexico.
Ancl now so much is happening you can't even imagine.
- I'm thirsty, I'm gonna get some water.
- Something happened in Mexico.
Whatever happened is affecting our son!
- I know, motel water's disgusting.
You want me to get you a bottle of water?
- No.
(scoffs)
- Ali, do you have any idea how crazy you sound?
- People are dead Kevin.
- You need help.
You're not well, you haven't been well.
Ali!
Ali, hey.
Hey, hey, hey-
Let's go buddy.
It's time to go.

Time is tilted, but not in your favor Priest.
Like a bad clock, you must be reset.

I am their guardian.
- You're the guardian of nothing.
(explosion booms)
- Yeah, she's staying at a motel at the end of I-21.
- Yeah, she's alone.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
- Who was that?
- That was Doctor Jones, our cloctor who delivered Neron.
- What did he want?
- He wanted to know where Allison was.
He thinks he can help her out.
- How did he know you knew where she was?
- I don't know.
- [Priest] There's not much time.
You must end this now.
This dagger is from the holy land.
It was given to me by the one before me.
Ancl to him by the one before him.
So, it is made from the silver of the holy challis.
It'll protect you from evil.

- Who is it?

Stop!

In a moment everything'll be in its place.

- I took a phone call.
I thought it was you, then there was nobody there.
Then I looked over; and Tara was standing at the window.
Craziest eyes I've ever seen.
She was holding onto Neron and then she just fell out.
- Neron?
- He didn't have a scratch on him.
Where is he?
- I don't know.
He just disappeared.
He was gone, I couldn't even find him anywhere.
This is crazy.
- Yeah, it's crazy.

Where are you?
Okay.

She has Neron and she's at the house.
- Okay, we're five minutes away.

- Sir?
I just got a call from the morgue.
Two bodies were stolen.
- What bodies?
- One was just some Jane Doe hooker.
But the other was Detective Ferry.
- Someone stole Detective Ferry's body?
What the hell's going on?
- It gets stranger than that.
One of our units claimed they seen Detective Ferry steal a black a white from the motor pool.

You're the final piece in the puzzle.
The world will soon have a new order.
- Mom, what are you doing?
- Don't be sad.
Everything is going to be fine.
- She's not your mom.
- Being that you are the key, the last piece of the puzzle and the one that started this,
I was planning something a bit more theatrical for you and Neron.
Neron's father wanted to be here, but time's being what they are.

- Good morning, Dr Turner.
- Good morning, Sister.
Erm, I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me --
I'm on my way to a meeting.
I imagine that would be the meeting at the Board Of Health.
About Mr Powell's new Hospital Plan.
Yes, it is.
There are interesting implications for our district, I suspect.
Which is why I've decided that I ought to attend.
Well, I imagine you'd like a lift, Sister.
Thank you.
That would be appreciated.
Well?
Do we pass the test?
Approved for home birth.
Thanks, Nurse.
See, Ma, I told you she was nice.
Nurse Gilbert's from Liverpool like me.
We have to talk about your plan for afterwards, once baby's here.
After baby comes it's zuo yue zi.
It's the Chinese thing she wants me to do.
Zuo yue zi means "sitting the month".
It's confinement.
Me and the baby stuck in here for 30 days with my mother-in-law looking after us.
You don't sound terribly keen.
It's just strange to me, that's all, Nurse.
Me mam was English.
It's me dad who's Chinese and I've not seen him since I was five.
They deported him in '46.
That's awful.
Anyway, it's not how I was brought up.
But I've said I'll do it.
Well, so long as you're sure, we'll support you.
30 days is a very long time for bed rest, isn't it?
Proper hygiene after the birth though -- on that we must insist, no matter what Mrs Chen Sr says.
We don't want any nasty infections.
I have a feeling that Mrs Chen Sr might be a bit of a handful.
I really hope Lucy can cope.
That's my biggest worry, actually.
It's an awfully small flat.
Chinese customs are quite complicated.
I'm not sure Lucy feels particularly Chinese.
And that's at least part of the trouble.
- I hope I'm not late.
- Not at all.
Successful trip?
A couple of blouses, thank goodness.
Some of my clothes are barely decent now.
Including my uniform, which is rather embarrassing.
I also got this.
I wasn't going to buy anything yet.
It seemed like tempting fate.
But it was so lovely.
And I gave away most of Angela's baby things.
You're almost halfway through, Shelagh.
You should be starting to prepare.
Enjoy it.
Oh, hello.
How was your meeting?
Eventful.
They're trying to close us down.
What?
!
It appears that the new Hospital Plan For England And Wales wants to move women away from small maternity homes like this one
- and into big general hospitals.
- Oh, my goodness.
We're to be inspected, apparently, and then they decide our fate.
They can't shut us down, we're busy, there's obviously a need.
Enoch Powell thinks otherwise, as does Sister Ursula.
But we're not going down without a fight.
Shutting maternity homes across the country -- whatever next?
Only a man could think it's a good idea.
Quite apart from anything else, it's going to lead to an increase in hospital births.
Hospital is the best environment if specialist help is required.
And, if it is not, a woman's home should be perfectly adequate.
With the greatest respect, Sister Ursula, some of the homes in Poplar aren't adequate at all.
Exactly, Sister.
It's one of the reasons I opened the home in the first place.
And why it's still needed.
Desperately.
So... how long do we have and what are we going to do about it?
They haven't given us much notice, I'm afraid.
A little over a week.
But we have drawn up a plan of action.
The building itself needs some minor repairs, so Fred will be seeing to all of that.
On his own time, I assume.
As you will see from the sheet, we are then going to gather as many statistics on the maternity home as we can get our hands on and present the inspector with black and white evidence of our achievements so far.
And how can we help?
Just keep doing exactly what you've been doing since the home opened.
Providing our mothers and babies with the very best care.
We are very short of staff at present, Mrs Turner.
There have been departures and we still await the return of Nurse Franklin.
I'm afraid the maternity home cannot be our principle concern.
We too are under scrutiny.
I think she's done now.
Thank you, Mrs Evans.
You can come in now.
Morning, ladies.
It's this one here.
The wheel keeps sticking.
Sorry, Mrs Collier, we'll try not to get in your way.
That's all right.
I ain't going anywhere.
Any day now, Mrs Collier.
Well, it looks easy enough to fix, Mrs Turner.
Good.
Thank you, Fred.
Right.
Shall we see how that blood pressure is today?
You want to send that inspector in to me.
I'll tell him what I think of him.
Trying to get this place closed down.
I'm not sure that would do anyone's blood pressure much good, Mrs Collier.
This is much better, though.
135 over 85.
Good for you.
Not in uniform today, Mrs Turner?
No.
Not today.
Good morning, Sister.
Are you looking for something?
May I help you?
No, thank you, Nurse Crane.
I am merely making some improvements to the roster.
And what improvements might those be, Sister Ursula?
I'm introducing a 20-minute time limit to all antenatal, postnatal and district calls.
But, Sister, that's half the time we usually allow.
A 20-minute visit is ample time for checks and small procedures.
And it will enable each of you to see three extra patients in a day.
It may be ample time in a hospital situation, Sister, but not in district practice, I'm afraid.
Perhaps you would find it useful to come out with us, Sister?
My role here is to ensure the running of Nonnatus House is efficient.
Sadly, I have personal experience of what happens to institutions that are deemed otherwise.
20 minutes, please.
It's for the best.
I'm going to get a frame for this.
Put me mam and dad up beside your picture of Cyril.
The baby can grow up seeing them all together and work out who they look like.
Shall I get a new frame for this one too?
Going to fall to bits soon.
Nothing wrong with frame.
Leave it.
Are you sure?
Oh, Ma.
You kept a piece of his baby hair.
That's lovely.
I'm going to do that too.
I said leave it.
I will fix it.
I'm sorry, Sister, I realise this is an inopportune moment but I must speak with you.
Of course.
What is it?
This 20-minute ruling imposed on us by Sister Ursula is completely impractical.
We are not machines and nor are our patients.
District practice has variables that precludes such a rigid approach.
We're treading a very fine line here.
I am not certain that Sister Ursula is altogether fit to be making these decisions.
Nurse Crane...
Sister Ursula was matron at the Order's cottage hospital when it was closed for inefficient practice.
She took it very badly, blaming herself entirely.
I see.
Sister Ursula's ways are different.
But we must support her and show willing.
Who knows?
Maybe we'll all be surprised.

Oh, no.
Every "i" on these records is going to be dotted and every "t" crossed.
Dad, have they really started closing places down?
Not here.
Not yet.
But we can't take anything for granted.
Sister Ursula was Matron at a Cottage Hospital that closed.
That might have been because of her.
I'm sure it was more complicated than that.
Mrs Henderson is on her way in.
I'll go and get her settled.
Oh, looks like I'll be on Beatrix Potter duty tonight, young lady.
And make sure it's Mrs Tiggy-Winkle or the Flopsy Bunnies.
No Squirrel Nutkin.
Shelagh.
Shouldn't we call someone over from Nonnatus House?
I don't want you doing too much.
I'm in fine fettle, Patrick.
Besides, I don't want to give Sister Ursula the pleasure of saying no.
Can you wait, Nurse?
I'm really sorry but it'll get ruined.
It's me who should be sorry for being so late.
Oh, come and join us.
Please.
I've made plenty.
- Oh, er...
- Let me take this.
All right.
That's very kind.
I'll be late for my tea anyway.
What this?
Well, you're always complaining about me Chinese cooking, so I've made something English.
It's called... toad-in-the-hole.
Toad?
!
Well, not really.
It's a sausage.
What's she saying?
- Cyril?
- Nothing.
- It looks lovely.
It would appear that neither Nurse Gilbert nor Sister Monica Joan are intending to join us this evening.
I must say, it's most unlike Sister Monica Joan to miss an opportunity for Bakewell tart.
She mentioned a walk.
Another one?
I hope she's not becoming disorientated.
She's become very unsettled since the... .. television went.
Perhaps the time approaches for our Sister's retirement to the Mother House?
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
You had to deal with an emergency, I assume, Nurse Gilbert?
No.
Not an emergency.
The 20-minute rule is not optional.
Nor is it something which applies only to your colleagues
- and not to yourself.
- No, Sister.
I'm sorry.
Nonnatus House will not carry slackers, Nurse Gilbert.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, Sister.
It won't happen again.
Sister Winifred, would you be so kind as to pass the custard?
My mother is nothing like Mrs Chen, I promise.
She's going to adore you.
Like I do.
Well, she isn't going to have to live with me, is she?
Unless I've missed something?
No.
Just us.
I can't wait.
Me neither.
Coming through.
Young Nurse Busby is escaping her revision by offering all and sundry
- a cup of tea.
- And some toast.
She thinks I haven't spotted her cunning ruse.
- Violet's jam.
First of the year.
- Yes, please.
I believe there's similar excitement in France with the arrival of the Beaujolais.
Barbara's been telling me about her evening meal.
My "slacking".
Well, I don't think it's slacking to try and build up a patient's trust.
Of course it isn't.
You are a good midwife, Barbara, and I don't want you to forget it.
But for the moment we just have to do the best we can.
P'raps things will be easier for you all when Trixie gets back.
I hope so.
Right you are, Nurse Busby.
Chop chop.
Back to cephalopelvic disproportion for you.
- What?
What is it?
- Something's happening.
Ma.
Ma.
I don't need your mother, Cyril.
I need a midwife.
Go!
This WILL help with the pain.
Just hold the mask over your face like that.
That's it.
Lucy.
I'm going to ask your mother-in-law to come in and help.
Here we are, Mrs Evans.
I'm just going to get a wrench.
Do you want me to answer that?
No, I'll do it, thank you.
Isn't it always the way?
We need to open the surgery, it's already...
- Is no-one here to help you again?
- No.
Pass them nappies over 'ere, Dr Turner.
I got nothing else to do.
Don't you dare get out of bed, Mrs Collier.
We'll sort this out.
Another one like that, Lucy, now.
You're doing so well.
Isn't she, Mrs Chen?
Good, strong mother.
That's it.
Lucy, keep breathing... gentle, slowly.
That's it.
Head's born, Lucy.
One more gentle push.
That's it.
Congratulations.
You have the most beautiful daughter.
Oh, look at her, Ma.
That's it.
Oh, she's lovely.
What is it, Ma?
Do you wish she was a boy?
No.
Girls very special too.
Sister, my wife is spread too thinly.
And although she wouldn't thank me for the term, she is an elderly primigravida.
Even if I cannot appeal to your compassion, as a professional you must know that extra strain is unwise.
The Order Of St Raymond Nonnatus is all compassion, Dr Turner.
But what can I do?
The duties have been allocated.
There is only myself.
She's been out again.
The changes have unsettled her.
You don't think Sister Ursula meant what she said?
I hope not, Sister.
To leave all that is familiar would be the very worst thing for
Sister Monica Joan.
Sister Winifred?
May I have your bag, Sister Winifred?
You are to spend the morning at the Maternity Home with Dr Turner.
Mr Buckle.
I require you to furnish me with a bicycle.
Draught very bad for you and baby.
Careful with head!
I know, Ma, it's all right.
Do you have a name for her yet?
I want to call her Linda.
After me mam.
No, no, no, no.
Very bad luck to have same name as dead relative.
- Very bad.
- What?
!
Not here, Mrs Chen.
Here it's a lovely thing to do.
It's a mark of respect.
It's me mam, Cyril, please.
You want baby to have bad luck?
What about...
Lin?
A Chinese name and honours your mother.
I suppose.
But she'll always be Linda in here.
Hells bells!
Patrick.
I've told you.
I'll do that.
No, no.
You're busy.
Mending your dress.
It's not a dress, it's my uniform.
And I'm not mending it, I'm letting it out at the seams.
So that I can look cool, calm, collected and professional during the inspection.
We could try being cool, calm, collected and professional now, really.
Yes, we could but I'm not convinced that would speed up my mending, or your typing.
We'll pull through.
We always do.
I'll check on Lin in a minute.
Everything seems to be going nicely back into place, Lucy.
She seems to be having a nice nap.
At last.
Honestly, Nurse.
What a night.
I don't think I've ever felt so tired.
I've got this thumping bloody headache and all.
Ma, not again.
Fish soup.
Very good for milk.
Why you take covers off Lin?
No.
You'll wake her.
It...
It's lovely and warm in here, Mrs Chen.
I don't think Lin needs a blanket.
All right.
I go down to work.
Rest and keep warm.
Nurse...
I'm sick of that bloody fish soup.
Perhaps it's revenge for the toad-in-the-hole.
Oh, Lucy.
I could pour it away and open the window, if you like.
I won't tell if you won't.
Oh, Lucy, mothers often feel down in the dumps a few days after the birth.
It's horrid but it'll pass, I promise.
- It'll help if you can sleep.
- That's all I want to do.
Oh, I'm so sorry, Lucy.
But I think I'm going to have to wake Lin up.
I'm only allowed 20 minutes.
Oh, no.
Please, Nurse.
It took so long to get her down.
Let her sleep.
Please.
I'm so tired.
Oh, I really should be going anyway.
We'll be back in the morning.
- Present from Fred from the allotment.
- Ah.
- He says good luck.
- Oh, that's so kind.
Mrs Collier's had a show.
Things are definitely on the move, Mrs T.
Oh, that's good news, isn't it?
Oh.
Sorry, Mrs Collier.
I've got the most awful butterflies this morning.
It's so silly.
I thought it must just be a touch of heartburn, what with you being in the family way yourself.
- You can't just come out and say it.
- Why not?
Have you all been speculating?
Speculating?
She's been running a book.
Well, I certainly don't approve of gambling on the premises.
And, yes, I am expecting a baby and we're delighted.
- Congratulations.
- It's lovely.
No water on skin, only cloth.
Need to be calm.
Ma, I smell.
I've got a thumping headache and I'm too hot.
You've got the bloody fire on and it's June.
I put fire out when skin dry.
The skin hardly got wet.
I've had enough of this!
Now give me me baby.
You need to be calm.
Lin all right with me.
Give me me baby, Ma.
She's mine, not yours and I don't want you to have her.
I just think she's too hot, that's all.
I try to do right by you.
To keep you and baby safe and warm.
You such a spoilt, ungrateful girl.
You think lying in bed for a few weeks is hard?
You have no idea what hard is!
I go to work!
Ma?
This is Dr Turner.
- Doctor, Mr Greenwood from the Board Of Health.
- Dr Turner.
Nice to meet you, Mr Greenwood.
Welcome to the Maternity Home.
Right, er, shall I show you round?
Or would you like a cup of tea before we start?
We'll get going, shall we?
Quite a lot to do.
Excellent idea.
Please.
After you.
I might ask you a few questions about the background of the place as we go.
Is that all right?
Of course.
In fact, I've put together some information on just that.
I'm can write my own report, thank you, Dr Turner.
Of course.
Please.
This way.
Oh.
That one was a bugger.
This is Mr Greenwood, everyone.
We have a four-bedded ward, as you can see.
Three occupied at the moment.
We also have a delivery room, a nursery and a sterile area for autoclave and so forth.
It's a lovely place, Inspector.
It's home from home.
Better than MY home.
It don't have my old man in it for a start.
Mrs Henderson and Mrs Evans are postnatal patients.
And Mrs Collier -- well, we hope to meet Mrs Collier's baby later today.
- And this is Nurse Gilbert.
- Hello.
Nurse.
Quite an infrastructure, then, for only four beds.
To be perfectly honest, Dr Turner, four beds could be absorbed into a new general hospital in a blink.
You must see that?
Come on then, little one.
You're usually hungry by now.
Lin?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Ma?
Ma!
Ma?
Ma?
She's not moving!
Oh, God.
Oh, no!
Alive.
What...?
What do we do?
What do we do?
Ma!
In the four years we've been open, we've had just over 300 admissions.
Most of them have given birth on the premises.
Some have been admitted for postnatal care.
And a handful have been referred on to hospital for specialist attention.
The thing is, Dr Turner, the new hospitals will have beautiful facilities, the very latest equipment, access to all specialisms.
How can you compete with that?
Not moving!
- I'll take her in here.
- Why she no move?
The doctor will find out, Mrs Chen.
This way.
Mrs Chen?
Lucy?
Come on, little one.
You can do it.
Come on.
Shall we?
No response to painful stimuli.
Yes, let's try oxygen.
Pulse is very fast.
Mrs Chen's the same and she's just been sick.
Dr Turner, when I visited yesterday, Mrs Chen was poorly.
And the baby?
We're only allowed to stay for 20 minutes now.
The baby was asleep and I didn't have time to do all the checks.
What was wrong with Mrs Chen?
Bad headache but no fever.
Very out of sorts.
I thought it was being confined to the room.
It was so stuffy and hot with the fire on.
Look how red her gums are.
Mrs Chen, do you any have gas appliances?
Yes.
Fire.
Water heater.
Cooker.
We need an ambulance right away.
High pulse rate, headaches, irritability.
I think it's carbon monoxide poisoning.
Is there room for Mrs Chen to come too?
No problem, Nurse.
Come on, this way.
Good job with the quick diagnosis, Dr Turner.
Thank you.
Please...
It's not your fault, Barbara.
I should've checked the baby.
I might have seen something.
The headaches, the sealed room.
I-I should've thought of it but I didn't even smell gas.
Barbara, we don't know how it happened.
But we do know that you should never have been put in the situation where there wasn't time.
Look, do you want to go home?
I can manage here.
No.
No, I-I want to be here.
Why don't you go and see how Mrs Collier's getting on?
I'll catch you up.
These are patients currently registered and their due dates, here.
You can see we're busy.
If I didn't think the Maternity Home was needed,
I would close it down tomorrow.
So why do you think they chose to come to you?
Because they want to stay in the community.
They want the midwives who saw them through their pregnancy and they want their families close at hand.
Without the Maternity Home, many of our patients would have the choice between giving birth in damp, overcrowded housing, or a bus ride, while in labour, to a hospital where their children couldn't visit.
Personally, I don't think that's any choice at all.
Next question is about how you would respond to an emergency.
But I think that's been established.
Sadly, yes.
May I?
'Nonnatus House.
Midwife speaking.'
Hello, Nurse Crane.
It's Shelagh.
I need to get to St Cuthbert's.
Do you think you could give me a lift?
Don't worry, I'm on my way.
Goodness!
That was clever.
I didn't even ring the bell.
Welcome home, Nurse Franklin.
I trust you had a pleasant voyage.
I'm afraid I need you to man the phone.
Sister Julienne?
Lucy.
The doctor say that if she wakes soon she has a very good chance of getting better.
But if she doesn't?
Cyril?
Cyril?
- We're in the middle of an inspection, Patrick.
One of us has to...
- Shelagh.
I am taking you.
I'm sure Nurse Crane would be willing to hold the fort.
- More than willing, Dr Turner.
- Thank you.
Oh.
Where's Dr Turner?
Medical emergency, I'm afraid.
No matter.
We find the symbiotic relationship with Nonnatus House means there's always someone to take up the baton.
Phyllis Crane, SRN, SCM.
Pleased to meet you, Mr Greenwood.
Now, I believe you'd like to hear about postnatal care.
Why don't YOU hold her?
Good morning.
I'd like to run some tests...
Now, Nurse Gilbert.
Go home as soon as you're done.
You've had a long day, lass.
Thank you, Phyllis.
I'm dreading telling Sister Ursula about baby Lin.
No, you leave that to me.
Are you leaving us, Mr Greenwood?
Yes.
Shame Dr Turner isn't back yet.
He'll receive a copy of my report, of course.
I'll let him know.
Would it be completely inappropriate if one were to inquire as to any possible conclusions it may contain?
Look... it's a good little place.
Tightly run and serves its patients very well.
Dr Turner's arguments are persuasive and his passion and commitment are admirable.
Yet I sense a "but", Mr Greenwood.
Progress is marching on in a particular direction.
None of these small places will be here in ten years' time.
The Maternity Home won't be recommended for IMMEDIATE closure but I'm afraid that's the best I can do.
We will content ourselves with a stay of execution.
Thank you.
- Mr Turner?
- Mr Kenley.
- You did the right thing bringing your wife in.
We're going to admit her.
- Thank you.
The bleeding's stopped.
For now.
But even with full bed rest, she may still abort spontaneously.
You do know that?
Yes.
I'm a doctor.
It never makes it any easier...
where family are concerned.
No, it doesn't.
In war, when we run away from Japanese, I pregnant.
I give birth in rain at side of road.
A woman help me.
She put my daughter in my arms.
A daughter?
You had a daughter?
She beautiful.
So much black hair.
But we cannot stop.
We walk all night.
I hold her next to my skin to keep her warm.
But it rain so hard and she get so cold.
Colder and colder and then...
.. she gone.
But before they take her from me,
I bite off a piece of her beautiful hair and I put it in my pocket, here, next to my heart.
I still have it.
You saw it.
I just want to keep Lin safe and warm and I nearly lost her too.
Ma.
You got her here.
- Good evening, Nurse Crane.
- Good evening, Sister.
Might I trouble you for a moment of your time?
- You're back.
- Barbara!
I can't tell you how nice it is to see you.
You too.
But where's Patsy?
And what on earth has Sister Julienne done to her office?
What's the matter?
The baby remains unconscious.
I will pray for them.
I do not want Nurse Gilbert to face any blame or censure, Sister Ursula.
She was in a situation where her hands were tied.
20 minutes is enough time for postnatal checks, Nurse Crane.
We both know that.
It's enough time in a hospital where all you see is the patient and their symptoms.
But in district practice one must take in the bigger picture.
I'm afraid it wasn't enough time for Lucy and Lin Chen.
I thank you for your frankness, Nurse Crane.
You have given me much upon which to reflect.
Thank you, Sister Ursula.
No-one doubts your good intentions.
We all want a tight ship.
You should never have been put in a situation where you couldn't use your clinical judgment.
- Sister Julienne would never do anything like that.
- I know.
We'll have to say something.
Good evening.
Nurse Franklin, I presume.
Yes.
Good evening, Sister Ursula.
No, I won't interrupt.
I simply wish to commiserate with Nurse Gilbert.
I understand you had a difficult day.
I apologise.
Thank you, Sister.
The condition of Baby Chen remains unchanged, I'm afraid.
I will inform you if there's any news.
And the 20-minute appointment system will be reviewed.
Sister Monica Joan?
Sister?
Sister?
Ah, evening, Sister.
You're just in the nick of time.
Come on.
Sister?
What are you doing here?
It's very late.
(Silence.)
Is...?
Is that our television set?
Sh.
It's starting.
He really is very old.
- Who is?
- Mr Steptoe.
It's beautiful, Barbara.
Perfect.
Mmm.
Ah.
Tea tastes so much better in Poplar.
Nurse Franklin.
We are complete.
Iced buns.
Sister Monica Joan, where have you been?
I was getting very worried.
Let us simply say, the mystery of the television has been solved.
It was given to the Seaman's Mission.
Where's Sister Ursula?
We must ask her to join us for this happy gathering.
Sister Ursula appears to have embarked upon a regimen of prayer and fasting.
I'm sorry, Sister, would you prefer solitude?
No.
I would be grateful for your company and for your prayers.
Though I fear I am undeserving of both.
No-one is undeserving of a prayer, Sister.
A baby lies close to death in hospital.
But when I kneel to pray for her
I find I cannot stop the entreaties on my own behalf.
How will God hear the prayers for the child in all the clamour?
God hears it all, Sister.
You know that.
I failed in my last mission.
That is a fact.
I failed the Order.
And I failed Him.
In Nonnatus House I saw... a second chance.
I told myself I was making a gift of myself, to the Order, a gift of all the lessons I'd learned, so that it would not suffer any more losses.
But it was vanity, pure and simple.
And now I've failed again.
Failure is too strong a word, Sister.
Misjudgement, perhaps... from which we learn.
Will you pray with me for the child?
Excuse me?
Did you find the gas leak?
Was it the water heater?
Wasn't a leak, love.
Fitted without a proper flue.
'Bout time they pulled this lot down.
I don't trust my eyes any more.
You think you see a flicker and then...
I know, love.
She fighting on the inside.
She want to live.
She's coming to kick us out.
I don't want to leave her again, Cyril.
What if she...?
- She move!
- She's awake?
- I don't think so, Ma.
- She move.
I see it.
Baby Lin Chen is responding to stimulus.
Our prayers were answered.
Thank you, Sister Julienne.
I shall return to the Mother House.
You won't reconsider?
This is your mission, Sister Julienne.
I should never have usurped it.
Sister?
Sister?
There is a vanity in excess penance.
You must have sustenance.
Thank you, Sister Monica Joan.
Thank you.
Your carriage to the station, Sister.
And I will brook no argument.
You are very kind.
Come in.
- Oh.
- It's all looking very nice, Sister.
Thank you.
It has been an interesting few months.
Do sit down.
I wondered if you'd been given any news about Sister Mary Cynthia.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
But I do know that she is safe and being cared for at the Mother House.
I stayed at the Mother House the night that my ship docked.
I'd hoped I might see her but I didn't.
No-one would tell me anything about her.
Sister Julienne, I don't think she's there.
'Sometimes there is no map 'for the road we find ourselves upon.
'It lies ahead, uncharted, unfurling into mist.
'We are all travelling through one another's countries.
'But it is no matter if we meet as strangers, 'for we can join forces and learn to love.
'And where there is friendship and affection 'there is the place we can all call home.'
We've received permission and funds to engage a new midwife.
I don't want the kind of help you and Eugene are offering.
Do you hear me?
I don't want it.
Spectacular Chariot Race -- prams, carts, wheelbarrows.
Nursing treats young working class girls the way the world treats women.
Tell me, honestly.
Did I do the right thing?
You did the only thing you could.
We were happy enough before.
And we will be happy again, whatever happens.
'Each life is a journey 'defined by the turns we take and the roads we choose 'or which fate chooses for us.'
- Morning, Mr Chen.
- Morning, Miss Gilbert.
'Some travel geographically, trading home for home, 'and one language for another.
'But we all move from youth to maturity, 'childhood to parenthood, as if we were traversing continents.
'The world shifts and the climate alters.
'Safe passage cannot be bought 'and we have no holy passport to protect us.'
It will be your turn very soon, Mr Chen.
'And so we venture forward, fragile maps in hand 'flying our banners of courage and of hope.'
Oh, dear, Patrick
- Good morning, Dr Turner.
- Good morning, Sister.
Erm, I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me --
I'm on my way to a meeting.
I imagine that would be the meeting at the Board Of Health.
About Mr Powell's new Hospital Plan.
Yes, it is.
There are interesting implications for our district, I suspect.
Which is why I've decided that I ought to attend.
Well, I imagine you'd like a lift, Sister.
Thank you.
That would be appreciated.
Well?
Do we pass the test?
Approved for home birth.
Thanks, Nurse.
See, Ma, I told you she was nice.
Nurse Gilbert's from Liverpool like me.
We have to talk about your plan for afterwards, once baby's here.
After baby comes it's zuo yue zi.
It's the Chinese thing she wants me to do.
Zuo yue zi means "sitting the month".
It's confinement.
Me and the baby stuck in here for 30 days with my mother-in-law looking after us.
You don't sound terribly keen.
It's just strange to me, that's all, Nurse.
Me mam was English.
It's me dad who's Chinese and I've not seen him since I was five.
They deported him in '46.
That's awful.
Anyway, it's not how I was brought up.
But I've said I'll do it.
Well, so long as you're sure, we'll support you.
30 days is a very long time for bed rest, isn't it?
Proper hygiene after the birth though -- on that we must insist, no matter what Mrs Chen Sr says.
We don't want any nasty infections.
I have a feeling that Mrs Chen Sr might be a bit of a handful.
I really hope Lucy can cope.
That's my biggest worry, actually.
It's an awfully small flat.
Chinese customs are quite complicated.
I'm not sure Lucy feels particularly Chinese.
And that's at least part of the trouble.
- I hope I'm not late.
- Not at all.
Successful trip?
A couple of blouses, thank goodness.
Some of my clothes are barely decent now.
Including my uniform, which is rather embarrassing.
I also got this.
I wasn't going to buy anything yet.
It seemed like tempting fate.
But it was so lovely.
And I gave away most of Angela's baby things.
You're almost halfway through, Shelagh.
You should be starting to prepare.
Enjoy it.
Oh, hello.
How was your meeting?
Eventful.
They're trying to close us down.
What?
!
It appears that the new Hospital Plan For England And Wales wants to move women away from small maternity homes like this one
- and into big general hospitals.
- Oh, my goodness.
We're to be inspected, apparently, and then they decide our fate.
They can't shut us down, we're busy, there's obviously a need.
Enoch Powell thinks otherwise, as does Sister Ursula.
But we're not going down without a fight.
Shutting maternity homes across the country -- whatever next?
Only a man could think it's a good idea.
Quite apart from anything else, it's going to lead to an increase in hospital births.
Hospital is the best environment if specialist help is required.
And, if it is not, a woman's home should be perfectly adequate.
With the greatest respect, Sister Ursula, some of the homes in Poplar aren't adequate at all.
Exactly, Sister.
It's one of the reasons I opened the home in the first place.
And why it's still needed.
Desperately.
So... how long do we have and what are we going to do about it?
They haven't given us much notice, I'm afraid.
A little over a week.
But we have drawn up a plan of action.
The building itself needs some minor repairs, so Fred will be seeing to all of that.
On his own time, I assume.
As you will see from the sheet, we are then going to gather as many statistics on the maternity home as we can get our hands on and present the inspector with black and white evidence of our achievements so far.
And how can we help?
Just keep doing exactly what you've been doing since the home opened.
Providing our mothers and babies with the very best care.
We are very short of staff at present, Mrs Turner.
There have been departures and we still await the return of Nurse Franklin.
I'm afraid the maternity home cannot be our principle concern.
We too are under scrutiny.
I think she's done now.
Thank you, Mrs Evans.
You can come in now.
Morning, ladies.
It's this one here.
The wheel keeps sticking.
Sorry, Mrs Collier, we'll try not to get in your way.
That's all right.
I ain't going anywhere.
Any day now, Mrs Collier.
Well, it looks easy enough to fix, Mrs Turner.
Good.
Thank you, Fred.
Right.
Shall we see how that blood pressure is today?
You want to send that inspector in to me.
I'll tell him what I think of him.
Trying to get this place closed down.
I'm not sure that would do anyone's blood pressure much good, Mrs Collier.
This is much better, though.
135 over 85.
Good for you.
Not in uniform today, Mrs Turner?
No.
Not today.
Good morning, Sister.
Are you looking for something?
May I help you?
No, thank you, Nurse Crane.
I am merely making some improvements to the roster.
And what improvements might those be, Sister Ursula?
I'm introducing a 20-minute time limit to all antenatal, postnatal and district calls.
But, Sister, that's half the time we usually allow.
A 20-minute visit is ample time for checks and small procedures.
And it will enable each of you to see three extra patients in a day.
It may be ample time in a hospital situation, Sister, but not in district practice, I'm afraid.
Perhaps you would find it useful to come out with us, Sister?
My role here is to ensure the running of Nonnatus House is efficient.
Sadly, I have personal experience of what happens to institutions that are deemed otherwise.
20 minutes, please.
It's for the best.
I'm going to get a frame for this.
Put me mam and dad up beside your picture of Cyril.
The baby can grow up seeing them all together and work out who they look like.
Shall I get a new frame for this one too?
Going to fall to bits soon.
Nothing wrong with frame.
Leave it.
Are you sure?
Oh, Ma.
You kept a piece of his baby hair.
That's lovely.
I'm going to do that too.
I said leave it.
I will fix it.
I'm sorry, Sister, I realise this is an inopportune moment but I must speak with you.
Of course.
What is it?
This 20-minute ruling imposed on us by Sister Ursula is completely impractical.
We are not machines and nor are our patients.
District practice has variables that precludes such a rigid approach.
We're treading a very fine line here.
I am not certain that Sister Ursula is altogether fit to be making these decisions.
Nurse Crane...
Sister Ursula was matron at the Order's cottage hospital when it was closed for inefficient practice.
She took it very badly, blaming herself entirely.
I see.
Sister Ursula's ways are different.
But we must support her and show willing.
Who knows?
Maybe we'll all be surprised.

I hope you haven't put those out of alphabetical order.
Oh, no.
Every "i" on these records is going to be dotted and every "t" crossed.
Dad, have they really started closing places down?
Not here.
Not yet.
But we can't take anything for granted.
Sister Ursula was Matron at a Cottage Hospital that closed.
That might have been because of her.
I'm sure it was more complicated than that.
Mrs Henderson is on her way in.
I'll go and get her settled.
Oh, looks like I'll be on Beatrix Potter duty tonight, young lady.
And make sure it's Mrs Tiggy-Winkle or the Flopsy Bunnies.
No Squirrel Nutkin.
Shelagh.
Shouldn't we call someone over from Nonnatus House?
I don't want you doing too much.
I'm in fine fettle, Patrick.
Besides, I don't want to give Sister Ursula the pleasure of saying no.
Can you wait, Nurse?
I'm really sorry but it'll get ruined.
It's me who should be sorry for being so late.
Oh, come and join us.
Please.
I've made plenty.
- Oh, er...
- Let me take this.
All right.
That's very kind.
I'll be late for my tea anyway.
What this?
Well, you're always complaining about me Chinese cooking, so I've made something English.
It's called... toad-in-the-hole.
Toad?
!
Well, not really.
It's a sausage.
What's she saying?
- Cyril?
- Nothing.
- It looks lovely.
It would appear that neither Nurse Gilbert nor Sister Monica Joan are intending to join us this evening.
I must say, it's most unlike Sister Monica Joan to miss an opportunity for Bakewell tart.
She mentioned a walk.
Another one?
I hope she's not becoming disorientated.
She's become very unsettled since the... .. television went.
Perhaps the time approaches for our Sister's retirement to the Mother House?
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
You had to deal with an emergency, I assume, Nurse Gilbert?
No.
Not an emergency.
The 20-minute rule is not optional.
Nor is it something which applies only to your colleagues
- and not to yourself.
- No, Sister.
I'm sorry.
Nonnatus House will not carry slackers, Nurse Gilbert.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, Sister.
It won't happen again.
Sister Winifred, would you be so kind as to pass the custard?
My mother is nothing like Mrs Chen, I promise.
She's going to adore you.
Like I do.
Well, she isn't going to have to live with me, is she?
Unless I've missed something?
No.
Just us.
I can't wait.
Me neither.
Coming through.
Young Nurse Busby is escaping her revision by offering all and sundry
- a cup of tea.
- And some toast.
She thinks I haven't spotted her cunning ruse.
- Violet's jam.
First of the year.
- Yes, please.
I believe there's similar excitement in France with the arrival of the Beaujolais.
Barbara's been telling me about her evening meal.
My "slacking".
Well, I don't think it's slacking to try and build up a patient's trust.
Of course it isn't.
You are a good midwife, Barbara, and I don't want you to forget it.
But for the moment we just have to do the best we can.
P'raps things will be easier for you all when Trixie gets back.
I hope so.
Right you are, Nurse Busby.
Chop chop.
Back to cephalopelvic disproportion for you.
- What?
What is it?
- Something's happening.
Ma.
Ma.
I don't need your mother, Cyril.
I need a midwife.
Go!
This WILL help with the pain.
Just hold the mask over your face like that.
That's it.
Lucy.
I'm going to ask your mother-in-law to come in and help.
Here we are, Mrs Evans.
I'm just going to get a wrench.
Do you want me to answer that?
No, I'll do it, thank you.
Isn't it always the way?
We need to open the surgery, it's already...
- Is no-one here to help you again?
- No.
Pass them nappies over 'ere, Dr Turner.
I got nothing else to do.
Don't you dare get out of bed, Mrs Collier.
We'll sort this out.
Another one like that, Lucy, now.
You're doing so well.
Isn't she, Mrs Chen?
Good, strong mother.
That's it.
Lucy, keep breathing... gentle, slowly.
That's it.
Head's born, Lucy.
One more gentle push.
That's it.
Congratulations.
You have the most beautiful daughter.
Oh, look at her, Ma.
That's it.
Oh, she's lovely.
What is it, Ma?
Do you wish she was a boy?
No.
Girls very special too.
Sister, my wife is spread too thinly.
And although she wouldn't thank me for the term, she is an elderly primigravida.
Even if I cannot appeal to your compassion, as a professional you must know that extra strain is unwise.
The Order Of St Raymond Nonnatus is all compassion, Dr Turner.
But what can I do?
The duties have been allocated.
There is only myself.
She's been out again.
The changes have unsettled her.
You don't think Sister Ursula meant what she said?
I hope not, Sister.
To leave all that is familiar would be the very worst thing for
Sister Monica Joan.
Sister Winifred?
May I have your bag, Sister Winifred?
You are to spend the morning at the Maternity Home with Dr Turner.
Mr Buckle.
I require you to furnish me with a bicycle.
Draught very bad for you and baby.
Careful with head!
I know, Ma, it's all right.
Do you have a name for her yet?
I want to call her Linda.
After me mam.
No, no, no, no.
Very bad luck to have same name as dead relative.
- Very bad.
- What?
!
Not here, Mrs Chen.
Here it's a lovely thing to do.
It's a mark of respect.
It's me mam, Cyril, please.
You want baby to have bad luck?
What about...
Lin?
A Chinese name and honours your mother.
I suppose.
But she'll always be Linda in here.
Hells bells!
Patrick.
I've told you.
I'll do that.
No, no.
You're busy.
Mending your dress.
It's not a dress, it's my uniform.
And I'm not mending it, I'm letting it out at the seams.
So that I can look cool, calm, collected and professional during the inspection.
We could try being cool, calm, collected and professional now, really.
Yes, we could but I'm not convinced that would speed up my mending, or your typing.
We'll pull through.
We always do.
I'll check on Lin in a minute.
Everything seems to be going nicely back into place, Lucy.
She seems to be having a nice nap.
At last.
Honestly, Nurse.
What a night.
I don't think I've ever felt so tired.
I've got this thumping bloody headache and all.
Ma, not again.
Fish soup.
Very good for milk.
Why you take covers off Lin?
No.
You'll wake her.
It...
It's lovely and warm in here, Mrs Chen.
I don't think Lin needs a blanket.
All right.
I go down to work.
Rest and keep warm.
Nurse...
I'm sick of that bloody fish soup.
Perhaps it's revenge for the toad-in-the-hole.
Oh, Lucy.
I could pour it away and open the window, if you like.
I won't tell if you won't.
Oh, Lucy, mothers often feel down in the dumps a few days after the birth.
It's horrid but it'll pass, I promise.
- It'll help if you can sleep.
- That's all I want to do.
Oh, I'm so sorry, Lucy.
But I think I'm going to have to wake Lin up.
I'm only allowed 20 minutes.
Oh, no.
Please, Nurse.
It took so long to get her down.
Let her sleep.
Please.
I'm so tired.
Oh, I really should be going anyway.
We'll be back in the morning.
- Present from Fred from the allotment.
- Ah.
- He says good luck.
- Oh, that's so kind.
Mrs Collier's had a show.
Things are definitely on the move, Mrs T.
Oh, that's good news, isn't it?
Oh.
Sorry, Mrs Collier.
I've got the most awful butterflies this morning.
It's so silly.
I thought it must just be a touch of heartburn, what with you being in the family way yourself.
- You can't just come out and say it.
- Why not?
Have you all been speculating?
Speculating?
She's been running a book.
Well, I certainly don't approve of gambling on the premises.
And, yes, I am expecting a baby and we're delighted.
- Congratulations.
- It's lovely.
No water on skin, only cloth.
Need to be calm.
Ma, I smell.
I've got a thumping headache and I'm too hot.
You've got the bloody fire on and it's June.
I put fire out when skin dry.
The skin hardly got wet.
I've had enough of this!
Now give me me baby.
You need to be calm.
Lin all right with me.
Give me me baby, Ma.
She's mine, not yours and I don't want you to have her.
I just think she's too hot, that's all.
I try to do right by you.
To keep you and baby safe and warm.
You such a spoilt, ungrateful girl.
You think lying in bed for a few weeks is hard?
You have no idea what hard is!
I go to work!
Ma?
This is Dr Turner.
- Doctor, Mr Greenwood from the Board Of Health.
- Dr Turner.
Nice to meet you, Mr Greenwood.
Welcome to the Maternity Home.
Right, er, shall I show you round?
Or would you like a cup of tea before we start?
We'll get going, shall we?
Quite a lot to do.
Excellent idea.
Please.
After you.
I might ask you a few questions about the background of the place as we go.
Is that all right?
Of course.
In fact, I've put together some information on just that.
I'm can write my own report, thank you, Dr Turner.
Of course.
Please.
This way.
Oh.
That one was a bugger.
This is Mr Greenwood, everyone.
We have a four-bedded ward, as you can see.
Three occupied at the moment.
We also have a delivery room, a nursery and a sterile area for autoclave and so forth.
It's a lovely place, Inspector.
It's home from home.
Better than MY home.
It don't have my old man in it for a start.
Mrs Henderson and Mrs Evans are postnatal patients.
And Mrs Collier -- well, we hope to meet Mrs Collier's baby later today.
- And this is Nurse Gilbert.
- Hello.
Nurse.
Quite an infrastructure, then, for only four beds.
To be perfectly honest, Dr Turner, four beds could be absorbed into a new general hospital in a blink.
You must see that?
Come on then, little one.
You're usually hungry by now.
Lin?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Ma?
Ma!
Ma?
Ma?
She's not moving!
Oh, God.
Oh, no!
Alive.
What...?
What do we do?
What do we do?
Ma!
In the four years we've been open, we've had just over 300 admissions.
Most of them have given birth on the premises.
Some have been admitted for postnatal care.
And a handful have been referred on to hospital for specialist attention.
The thing is, Dr Turner, the new hospitals will have beautiful facilities, the very latest equipment, access to all specialisms.
How can you compete with that?
Not moving!
- I'll take her in here.
- Why she no move?
The doctor will find out, Mrs Chen.
This way.
Mrs Chen?
Lucy?
Come on, little one.
You can do it.
Come on.
Shall we?
No response to painful stimuli.
Yes, let's try oxygen.
Pulse is very fast.
Mrs Chen's the same and she's just been sick.
Dr Turner, when I visited yesterday, Mrs Chen was poorly.
And the baby?
We're only allowed to stay for 20 minutes now.
The baby was asleep and I didn't have time to do all the checks.
What was wrong with Mrs Chen?
Bad headache but no fever.
Very out of sorts.
I thought it was being confined to the room.
It was so stuffy and hot with the fire on.
Look how red her gums are.
Mrs Chen, do you any have gas appliances?
Yes.
Fire.
Water heater.
Cooker.
We need an ambulance right away.
High pulse rate, headaches, irritability.
I think it's carbon monoxide poisoning.
Is there room for Mrs Chen to come too?
No problem, Nurse.
Come on, this way.
Good job with the quick diagnosis, Dr Turner.
Thank you.
Please...
It's not your fault, Barbara.
I should've checked the baby.
I might have seen something.
The headaches, the sealed room.
I-I should've thought of it but I didn't even smell gas.
Barbara, we don't know how it happened.
But we do know that you should never have been put in the situation where there wasn't time.
Look, do you want to go home?
I can manage here.
No.
No, I-I want to be here.
Why don't you go and see how Mrs Collier's getting on?
I'll catch you up.
These are patients currently registered and their due dates, here.
You can see we're busy.
If I didn't think the Maternity Home was needed,
I would close it down tomorrow.
So why do you think they chose to come to you?
Because they want to stay in the community.
They want the midwives who saw them through their pregnancy and they want their families close at hand.
Without the Maternity Home, many of our patients would have the choice between giving birth in damp, overcrowded housing, or a bus ride, while in labour, to a hospital where their children couldn't visit.
Personally, I don't think that's any choice at all.
Next question is about how you would respond to an emergency.
But I think that's been established.
Sadly, yes.
May I?
'Nonnatus House.
Midwife speaking.'
Hello, Nurse Crane.
It's Shelagh.
I need to get to St Cuthbert's.
Do you think you could give me a lift?
Don't worry, I'm on my way.
Goodness!
That was clever.
I didn't even ring the bell.
Welcome home, Nurse Franklin.
I trust you had a pleasant voyage.
I'm afraid I need you to man the phone.
Sister Julienne?
Lucy.
The doctor say that if she wakes soon she has a very good chance of getting better.
But if she doesn't?
Cyril?
Cyril?
- We're in the middle of an inspection, Patrick.
One of us has to...
- Shelagh.
I am taking you.
I'm sure Nurse Crane would be willing to hold the fort.
- More than willing, Dr Turner.
- Thank you.
Oh.
Where's Dr Turner?
Medical emergency, I'm afraid.
No matter.
We find the symbiotic relationship with Nonnatus House means there's always someone to take up the baton.
Phyllis Crane, SRN, SCM.
Pleased to meet you, Mr Greenwood.
Now, I believe you'd like to hear about postnatal care.
Why don't YOU hold her?
Good morning.
I'd like to run some tests...
Now, Nurse Gilbert.
Go home as soon as you're done.
You've had a long day, lass.
Thank you, Phyllis.
I'm dreading telling Sister Ursula about baby Lin.
No, you leave that to me.
Are you leaving us, Mr Greenwood?
Yes.
Shame Dr Turner isn't back yet.
He'll receive a copy of my report, of course.
I'll let him know.
Would it be completely inappropriate if one were to inquire as to any possible conclusions it may contain?
Look... it's a good little place.
Tightly run and serves its patients very well.
Dr Turner's arguments are persuasive and his passion and commitment are admirable.
Yet I sense a "but", Mr Greenwood.
Progress is marching on in a particular direction.
None of these small places will be here in ten years' time.
The Maternity Home won't be recommended for IMMEDIATE closure but I'm afraid that's the best I can do.
We will content ourselves with a stay of execution.
Thank you.
- Mr Turner?
- Mr Kenley.
- You did the right thing bringing your wife in.
We're going to admit her.
- Thank you.
The bleeding's stopped.
For now.
But even with full bed rest, she may still abort spontaneously.
You do know that?
Yes.
I'm a doctor.
It never makes it any easier...
where family are concerned.
No, it doesn't.
In war, when we run away from Japanese, I pregnant.
I give birth in rain at side of road.
A woman help me.
She put my daughter in my arms.
A daughter?
You had a daughter?
She beautiful.
So much black hair.
But we cannot stop.
We walk all night.
I hold her next to my skin to keep her warm.
But it rain so hard and she get so cold.
Colder and colder and then...
.. she gone.
But before they take her from me,
I bite off a piece of her beautiful hair and I put it in my pocket, here, next to my heart.
I still have it.
You saw it.
I just want to keep Lin safe and warm and I nearly lost her too.
Ma.
You got her here.
- Good evening, Nurse Crane.
- Good evening, Sister.
Might I trouble you for a moment of your time?
- You're back.
- Barbara!
I can't tell you how nice it is to see you.
You too.
But where's Patsy?
And what on earth has Sister Julienne done to her office?
What's the matter?
The baby remains unconscious.
I will pray for them.
I do not want Nurse Gilbert to face any blame or censure, Sister Ursula.
She was in a situation where her hands were tied.
20 minutes is enough time for postnatal checks, Nurse Crane.
We both know that.
It's enough time in a hospital where all you see is the patient and their symptoms.
But in district practice one must take in the bigger picture.
I'm afraid it wasn't enough time for Lucy and Lin Chen.
I thank you for your frankness, Nurse Crane.
You have given me much upon which to reflect.
Thank you, Sister Ursula.
No-one doubts your good intentions.
We all want a tight ship.
You should never have been put in a situation where you couldn't use your clinical judgment.
- Sister Julienne would never do anything like that.
- I know.
We'll have to say something.
Good evening.
Nurse Franklin, I presume.
Yes.
Good evening, Sister Ursula.
No, I won't interrupt.
I simply wish to commiserate with Nurse Gilbert.
I understand you had a difficult day.
I apologise.
Thank you, Sister.
The condition of Baby Chen remains unchanged, I'm afraid.
I will inform you if there's any news.
And the 20-minute appointment system will be reviewed.
Sister Monica Joan?
Sister?
Sister?
Ah, evening, Sister.
You're just in the nick of time.
Come on.
Sister?
What are you doing here?
It's very late.
(Silence.)
Is...?
Is that our television set?
Sh.
It's starting.
He really is very old.
- Who is?
- Mr Steptoe.
It's beautiful, Barbara.
Perfect.
Mmm.
Ah.
Tea tastes so much better in Poplar.
Nurse Franklin.
We are complete.
Iced buns.
Sister Monica Joan, where have you been?
I was getting very worried.
Let us simply say, the mystery of the television has been solved.
It was given to the Seaman's Mission.
Where's Sister Ursula?
We must ask her to join us for this happy gathering.
Sister Ursula appears to have embarked upon a regimen of prayer and fasting.
I'm sorry, Sister, would you prefer solitude?
No.
I would be grateful for your company and for your prayers.
Though I fear I am undeserving of both.
No-one is undeserving of a prayer, Sister.
A baby lies close to death in hospital.
But when I kneel to pray for her
I find I cannot stop the entreaties on my own behalf.
How will God hear the prayers for the child in all the clamour?
God hears it all, Sister.
You know that.
I failed in my last mission.
That is a fact.
I failed the Order.
And I failed Him.
In Nonnatus House I saw... a second chance.
I told myself I was making a gift of myself, to the Order, a gift of all the lessons I'd learned, so that it would not suffer any more losses.
But it was vanity, pure and simple.
And now I've failed again.
Failure is too strong a word, Sister.
Misjudgement, perhaps... from which we learn.
Will you pray with me for the child?
Excuse me?
Did you find the gas leak?
Was it the water heater?
Wasn't a leak, love.
Fitted without a proper flue.
'Bout time they pulled this lot down.
I don't trust my eyes any more.
You think you see a flicker and then...
I know, love.
She fighting on the inside.
She want to live.
She's coming to kick us out.
I don't want to leave her again, Cyril.
What if she...?
- She move!
- She's awake?
- I don't think so, Ma.
- She move.
I see it.
Baby Lin Chen is responding to stimulus.
Our prayers were answered.
Thank you, Sister Julienne.
I shall return to the Mother House.
You won't reconsider?
This is your mission, Sister Julienne.
I should never have usurped it.
Sister?
Sister?
There is a vanity in excess penance.
You must have sustenance.
Thank you, Sister Monica Joan.
Thank you.
Your carriage to the station, Sister.
And I will brook no argument.
You are very kind.
Come in.
- Oh.
- It's all looking very nice, Sister.
Thank you.
It has been an interesting few months.
Do sit down.
I wondered if you'd been given any news about Sister Mary Cynthia.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
But I do know that she is safe and being cared for at the Mother House.
I stayed at the Mother House the night that my ship docked.
I'd hoped I might see her but I didn't.
No-one would tell me anything about her.
Sister Julienne, I don't think she's there.
'Sometimes there is no map 'for the road we find ourselves upon.
'It lies ahead, uncharted, unfurling into mist.
'We are all travelling through one another's countries.
'But it is no matter if we meet as strangers, 'for we can join forces and learn to love.
'And where there is friendship and affection 'there is the place we can all call home.'
We've received permission and funds to engage a new midwife.
I don't want the kind of help you and Eugene are offering.
Do you hear me?
I don't want it.
Spectacular Chariot Race -- prams, carts, wheelbarrows.
Nursing treats young working class girls the way the world treats women.
Tell me, honestly.
Did I do the right thing?
You did the only thing you could.
We were happy enough before.
And we will be happy again, whatever happens.
*CALL THE MIDWIFE* Season 06 Episode 03
'Each life is a journey 'defined by the turns we take and the roads we choose 'or which fate chooses for us.'
- Morning, Mr Chen.
- Morning, Miss Gilbert.
'Some travel geographically, trading home for home, 'and one language for another.
'But we all move from youth to maturity, 'childhood to parenthood, as if we were traversing continents.
'The world shifts and the climate alters.
'Safe passage cannot be bought 'and we have no holy passport to protect us.'
It will be your turn very soon, Mr Chen.
'And so we venture forward, fragile maps in hand 'flying our banners of courage and of hope.'
Oh, dear, Patrick
- Good morning, Dr Turner.
- Good morning, Sister.
Erm, I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me...
I'm on my way to a meeting.
I imagine that would be the meeting at the Board Of Health.
About Mr Powell's new Hospital Plan.
Yes, it is.
There are interesting implications for our district, I suspect.
Which is why I've decided that I ought to attend.
Well, I imagine you'd like a lift, Sister.
Thank you.
That would be appreciated.
Well?
Do we pass the test?
Approved for home birth.
Thanks, Nurse.
See, Ma, I told you she was nice.
Nurse Gilbert's from Liverpool like me.
We have to talk about your plan for afterwards, once baby's here.
After baby comes it's zuo yue zi.
It's the Chinese thing she wants me to do.
Zuo yue zi means "sitting the month".
It's confinement.
Me and the baby stuck in here for 30 days with my mother-in-law looking after us.
You don't sound terribly keen.
It's just strange to me, that's all, Nurse.
Me mam was English.
It's me dad who's Chinese and I've not seen him since I was five.
They deported him in '46.
That's awful.
Anyway, it's not how I was brought up.
But I've said I'll do it.
Well, so long as you're sure, we'll support you.
30 days is a very long time for bed rest, isn't it?
Proper hygiene after the birth though... on that we must insist, no matter what Mrs Chen Sr says.
We don't want any nasty infections.
I have a feeling that Mrs Chen Sr might be a bit of a handful.
I really hope Lucy can cope.
That's my biggest worry, actually.
It's an awfully small flat.
Chinese customs are quite complicated.
I'm not sure Lucy feels particularly Chinese.
And that's at least part of the trouble.
- I hope I'm not late.
- Not at all.
Successful trip?
A couple of blouses, thank goodness.
Some of my clothes are barely decent now.
Including my uniform, which is rather embarrassing.
I also got this.
I wasn't going to buy anything yet.
It seemed like tempting fate.
But it was so lovely.
And I gave away most of Angela's baby things.
You're almost halfway through, Shelagh.
You should be starting to prepare.
Enjoy it.
Oh, hello.
How was your meeting?
Eventful.
They're trying to close us down.
What?
!
It appears that the new Hospital Plan For England And Wales wants to move women away from small maternity homes like this one
- and into big general hospitals.
- Oh, my goodness.
We're to be inspected, apparently, and then they decide our fate.
They can't shut us down, we're busy, there's obviously a need.
Enoch Powell thinks otherwise, as does Sister Ursula.
But we're not going down without a fight.
Shutting maternity homes across the country... whatever next?
Only a man could think it's a good idea.
Quite apart from anything else, it's going to lead to an increase in hospital births.
Hospital is the best environment if specialist help is required.
And, if it is not, a woman's home should be perfectly adequate.
With the greatest respect, Sister Ursula, some of the homes in Poplar aren't adequate at all.
Exactly, Sister.
It's one of the reasons I opened the home in the first place.
And why it's still needed.
Desperately.
So... how long do we have and what are we going to do about it?
They haven't given us much notice, I'm afraid.
A little over a week.
But we have drawn up a plan of action.
The building itself needs some minor repairs, so Fred will be seeing to all of that.
On his own time, I assume.
As you will see from the sheet, we are then going to gather as many statistics on the maternity home as we can get our hands on and present the inspector with black and white evidence of our achievements so far.
And how can we help?
Just keep doing exactly what you've been doing since the home opened.
Providing our mothers and babies with the very best care.
We are very short of staff at present, Mrs Turner.
There have been departures and we still await the return of Nurse Franklin.
I'm afraid the maternity home cannot be our principle concern.
We too are under scrutiny.
I think she's done now.
Thank you, Mrs Evans.
You can come in now.
Morning, ladies.
It's this one here.
The wheel keeps sticking.
Sorry, Mrs Collier, we'll try not to get in your way.
That's all right.
I ain't going anywhere.
Any day now, Mrs Collier.
Well, it looks easy enough to fix, Mrs Turner.
Good.
Thank you, Fred.
Right.
Shall we see how that blood pressure is today?
You want to send that inspector in to me.
I'll tell him what I think of him.
Trying to get this place closed down.
I'm not sure that would do anyone's blood pressure much good, Mrs Collier.
This is much better, though.
135 over 85.
Good for you.
Not in uniform today, Mrs Turner?
No.
Not today.
Good morning, Sister.
Are you looking for something?
May I help you?
No, thank you, Nurse Crane.
I am merely making some improvements to the roster.
And what improvements might those be, Sister Ursula?
I'm introducing a 20-minute time limit to all antenatal, postnatal and district calls.
But, Sister, that's half the time we usually allow.
A 20-minute visit is ample time for checks and small procedures.
And it will enable each of you to see three extra patients in a day.
It may be ample time in a hospital situation, Sister, but not in district practice, I'm afraid.
Perhaps you would find it useful to come out with us, Sister?
My role here is to ensure the running of Nonnatus House is efficient.
Sadly, I have personal experience of what happens to institutions that are deemed otherwise.
20 minutes, please.
It's for the best.
I'm going to get a frame for this.
Put me mam and dad up beside your picture of Cyril.
The baby can grow up seeing them all together and work out who they look like.
Shall I get a new frame for this one too?
Going to fall to bits soon.
Nothing wrong with frame.
Leave it.
Are you sure?
Oh, Ma.
You kept a piece of his baby hair.
That's lovely.
I'm going to do that too.
I said leave it.
I will fix it.
I'm sorry, Sister, I realise this is an inopportune moment but I must speak with you.
Of course.
What is it?
This 20-minute ruling imposed on us by Sister Ursula is completely impractical.
We are not machines and nor are our patients.
District practice has variables that precludes such a rigid approach.
We're treading a very fine line here.
I am not certain that Sister Ursula is altogether fit to be making these decisions.
Nurse Crane...
Sister Ursula was matron at the Order's cottage hospital when it was closed for inefficient practice.
She took it very badly, blaming herself entirely.
I see.
Sister Ursula's ways are different.
But we must support her and show willing.
Who knows?
Maybe we'll all be surprised.

Oh, no.
Every "I" on these records is going to be dotted and every "t" crossed.
Dad, have they really started closing places down?
Not here.
Not yet.
But we can't take anything for granted.
Sister Ursula was Matron at a Cottage Hospital that closed.
That might have been because of her.
I'm sure it was more complicated than that.
Mrs Henderson is on her way in.
I'll go and get her settled.
Oh, looks like I'll be on Beatrix Potter duty tonight, young lady.
And make sure it's Mrs Tiggy-Winkle or the Flopsy Bunnies.
No Squirrel Nutkin.
Shelagh.
Shouldn't we call someone over from Nonnatus House?
I don't want you doing too much.
I'm in fine fettle, Patrick.
Besides, I don't want to give Sister Ursula the pleasure of saying no.
Can you wait, Nurse?
I'm really sorry but it'll get ruined.
It's me who should be sorry for being so late.
Oh, come and join us.
Please.
I've made plenty.
- Oh, er...
- Let me take this.
All right.
That's very kind.
I'll be late for my tea anyway.
What this?
Well, you're always complaining about me Chinese cooking, so I've made something English.
It's called... toad-in-the-hole.
Toad?
!
Well, not really.
It's a sausage.
What's she saying?
- Cyril?
- Nothing.
It looks lovely.
It would appear that neither Nurse Gilbert nor Sister Monica Joan are intending to join us this evening.
I must say, it's most unlike Sister Monica Joan to miss an opportunity for Bakewell tart.
She mentioned a walk.
Another one?
I hope she's not becoming disorientated.
She's become very unsettled since the... television went.
Perhaps the time approaches for our Sister's retirement to the Mother House?
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
You had to deal with an emergency, I assume, Nurse Gilbert?
No.
Not an emergency.
The 20-minute rule is not optional.
Nor is it something which applies only to your colleagues
- and not to yourself.
- No, Sister.
I'm sorry.
Nonnatus House will not carry slackers, Nurse Gilbert.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, Sister.
It won't happen again.
Sister Winifred, would you be so kind as to pass the custard?
My mother is nothing like Mrs Chen, I promise.
She's going to adore you.
Like I do.
Well, she isn't going to have to live with me, is she?
Unless I've missed something?
No.
Just us.
I can't wait.
Me neither.
Coming through.
Young Nurse Busby is escaping her revision by offering all and sundry
- a cup of tea.
- And some toast.
She thinks I haven't spotted her cunning ruse.
- Violet's jam.
First of the year.
- Yes, please.
I believe there's similar excitement in France with the arrival of the Beaujolais.
Barbara's been telling me about her evening meal.
My "slacking".
Well, I don't think it's slacking to try and build up a patient's trust.
Of course it isn't.
You are a good midwife, Barbara, and I don't want you to forget it.
But for the moment we just have to do the best we can.
P'raps things will be easier for you all when Trixie gets back.
I hope so.
Right you are, Nurse Busby.
Chop chop.
Back to cephalopelvic disproportion for you.
- What?
What is it?
- Something's happening.
Ma.
Ma.
I don't need your mother, Cyril.
I need a midwife.
Go!
This WILL help with the pain.
Just hold the mask over your face like that.
That's it.
Lucy.
I'm going to ask your mother-in-law to come in and help.
Here we are, Mrs Evans.
I'm just going to get a wrench.
Do you want me to answer that?
No, I'll do it, thank you.
Isn't it always the way?
We need to open the surgery, it's already...
Is no-one here to help you again?
No.
Pass them nappies over 'ere, Dr Turner.
I got nothing else to do.
Don't you dare get out of bed, Mrs Collier.
We'll sort this out.
Another one like that, Lucy, now.
You're doing so well.
Isn't she, Mrs Chen?
Good, strong mother.
That's it.
Lucy, keep breathing... gentle, slowly.
That's it.
Head's born, Lucy.
One more gentle push.
That's it.
Congratulations.
You have the most beautiful daughter.
Oh, look at her, Ma.
That's it.
Oh, she's lovely.
What is it, Ma?
Do you wish she was a boy?
No.
Girls very special too.
Sister, my wife is spread too thinly.
And although she wouldn't thank me for the term, she is an elderly primigravida.
Even if I cannot appeal to your compassion, as a professional you must know that extra strain is unwise.
The Order Of St Raymond Nonnatus is all compassion, Dr Turner.
But what can I do?
The duties have been allocated.
There is only myself.
She's been out again.
The changes have unsettled her.
You don't think Sister Ursula meant what she said?
I hope not, Sister.
To leave all that is familiar would be the very worst thing for
Sister Monica Joan.
Sister Winifred?
May I have your bag, Sister Winifred?
You are to spend the morning at the Maternity Home with Dr Turner.
Mr Buckle.
I require you to furnish me with a bicycle.
Draught very bad for you and baby.
Careful with head!
I know, Ma, it's all right.
Do you have a name for her yet?
I want to call her Linda.
After me mam.
No, no, no, no.
Very bad luck to have same name as dead relative.
- Very bad.
- What?
!
Not here, Mrs Chen.
Here it's a lovely thing to do.
It's a mark of respect.
It's me mam, Cyril, please.
You want baby to have bad luck?
What about...
Lin?
A Chinese name and honours your mother.
I suppose.
But she'll always be Linda in here.
Hells bells!
Patrick.
I've told you.
I'll do that.
No, no.
You're busy.
Mending your dress.
It's not a dress, it's my uniform.
And I'm not mending it, I'm letting it out at the seams.
So that I can look cool, calm, collected and professional during the inspection.
We could try being cool, calm, collected and professional now, really.
Yes, we could but I'm not convinced that would speed up my mending, or your typing.
We'll pull through.
We always do.
I'll check on Lin in a minute.
Everything seems to be going nicely back into place, Lucy.
She seems to be having a nice nap.
At last.
Honestly, Nurse.
What a night.
I don't think I've ever felt so tired.
I've got this thumping bloody headache and all.
Ma, not again.
Fish soup.
Very good for milk.
Why you take covers off Lin?
No.
You'll wake her.
It...
It's lovely and warm in here, Mrs Chen.
I don't think Lin needs a blanket.
All right.
I go down to work.
Rest and keep warm.
Nurse...
I'm sick of that bloody fish soup.
Perhaps it's revenge for the toad-in-the-hole.
Oh, Lucy.
I could pour it away and open the window, if you like.
I won't tell if you won't.
Oh, Lucy, mothers often feel down in the dumps a few days after the birth.
It's horrid but it'll pass, I promise.
- It'll help if you can sleep.
- That's all I want to do.
Oh, I'm so sorry, Lucy.
But I think I'm going to have to wake Lin up.
I'm only allowed 20 minutes.
Oh, no.
Please, Nurse.
It took so long to get her down.
Let her sleep.
Please.
I'm so tired.
Oh, I really should be going anyway.
We'll be back in the morning.
Present from Fred from the allotment.
Ah.
- He says good luck.
- Oh, that's so kind.
Mrs Collier's had a show.
Things are definitely on the move, Mrs T.
Oh, that's good news, isn't it?
Oh.
Sorry, Mrs Collier.
I've got the most awful butterflies this morning.
It's so silly.
I thought it must just be a touch of heartburn, what with you being in the family way yourself.
You can't just come out and say it.
Why not?
Have you all been speculating?
Speculating?
She's been running a book.
Well, I certainly don't approve of gambling on the premises.
And, yes, I am expecting a baby and we're delighted.
- Congratulations.
- It's lovely.
No water on skin, only cloth.
Need to be calm.
Ma, I smell.
I've got a thumping headache and I'm too hot.
You've got the bloody fire on and it's June.
I put fire out when skin dry.
The skin hardly got wet.
I've had enough of this!
Now give me me baby.
You need to be calm.
Lin all right with me.
Give me me baby, Ma.
She's mine, not yours and I don't want you to have her.
I just think she's too hot, that's all.
I try to do right by you.
To keep you and baby safe and warm.
You such a spoilt, ungrateful girl.
You think lying in bed for a few weeks is hard?
You have no idea what hard is!
I go to work!
Ma?
This is Dr Turner.
Doctor, Mr Greenwood from the Board Of Health.
Dr Turner.
Nice to meet you, Mr Greenwood.
Welcome to the Maternity Home.
Right, er, shall I show you round?
Or would you like a cup of tea before we start?
We'll get going, shall we?
Quite a lot to do.
Excellent idea.
Please.
After you.
I might ask you a few questions about the background
- of the place as we go.
- Is that all right?
Of course.
In fact, I've put together some information on just that.
I'm can write my own report, thank you, Dr Turner.
Of course.
Please.
This way.
Oh.
That one was a bugger.
This is Mr Greenwood, everyone.
We have a four-bedded ward, as you can see.
Three occupied at the moment.
We also have a delivery room, a nursery and a sterile area for autoclave and so forth.
It's a lovely place, Inspector.
It's home from home.
Better than MY home.
It don't have my old man in it for a start.
Mrs Henderson and Mrs Evans are postnatal patients.
And Mrs Collier... well, we hope to meet Mrs Collier's baby later today.
- And this is Nurse Gilbert.
- Hello.
Nurse.
Quite an infrastructure, then, for only four beds.
To be perfectly honest, Dr Turner, four beds could be absorbed into a new general hospital in a blink.
You must see that?
Come on then, little one.
You're usually hungry by now.
Lin?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Ma?
Ma!
Ma?
Ma?
She's not moving!
Oh, God.
Oh, no!
Alive.
What...?
What do we do?
What do we do?
Ma!
In the four years we've been open, we've had just over 300 admissions.
Most of them have given birth on the premises.
Some have been admitted for postnatal care.
And a handful have been referred on to hospital for specialist attention.
The thing is, Dr Turner, the new hospitals will have beautiful facilities, the very latest equipment, access to all specialisms.
How can you compete with that?
Not moving!
- I'll take her in here.
- Why she no move?
The doctor will find out, Mrs Chen.
This way.
Mrs Chen?
Lucy?
Come on, little one.
You can do it.
Come on.
Shall we?
No response to painful stimuli.
Yes, let's try oxygen.
Pulse is very fast.
Mrs Chen's the same and she's just been sick.
Dr Turner, when I visited yesterday, Mrs Chen was poorly.
And the baby?
We're only allowed to stay for 20 minutes now.
The baby was asleep and I didn't have time to do all the checks.
What was wrong with Mrs Chen?
Bad headache but no fever.
Very out of sorts.
I thought it was being confined to the room.
It was so stuffy and hot with the fire on.
Look how red her gums are.
Mrs Chen, do you any have gas appliances?
Yes.
Fire.
Water heater.
Cooker.
We need an ambulance right away.
High pulse rate, headaches, irritability.
I think it's carbon monoxide poisoning.
Is there room for Mrs Chen to come too?
No problem, Nurse.
Come on, this way.
Good job with the quick diagnosis, Dr Turner.
Thank you.
Please...
It's not your fault, Barbara.
I should've checked the baby.
I might have seen something.
The headaches, the sealed room.
I-I should've thought of it but I didn't even smell gas.
Barbara, we don't know how it happened.
But we do know that you should never have been put in the situation where there wasn't time.
Look, do you want to go home?
I can manage here.
No.
No, I-I want to be here.
Why don't you go and see how Mrs Collier's getting on?
I'll catch you up.
These are patients currently registered and their due dates, here.
You can see we're busy.
If I didn't think the Maternity Home was needed,
I would close it down tomorrow.
So why do you think they chose to come to you?
Because they want to stay in the community.
They want the midwives who saw them through their pregnancy and they want their families close at hand.
Without the Maternity Home, many of our patients would have the choice between giving birth in damp, overcrowded housing, or a bus ride, while in labour, to a hospital where their children couldn't visit.
Personally, I don't think that's any choice at all.
Next question is about how you would respond to an emergency.
But I think that's been established.
Sadly, yes.
May I?
'Nonnatus House.
Midwife speaking.'
Hello, Nurse Crane.
It's Shelagh.
I need to get to St Cuthbert's.
Do you think you could give me a lift?
Don't worry, I'm on my way.
Goodness!
That was clever.
I didn't even ring the bell.
Welcome home, Nurse Franklin.
I trust you had a pleasant voyage.
I'm afraid I need you to man the phone.
Sister Julienne?
Lucy.
The doctor say that if she wakes soon she has a very good chance of getting better.
But if she doesn't?
Cyril?
Cyril?
We're in the middle of an inspection, Patrick.
- One of us has to...
- Shelagh.
I am taking you.
I'm sure Nurse Crane would be willing to hold the fort.
- More than willing, Dr Turner.
- Thank you.
Oh.
Where's Dr Turner?
Medical emergency, I'm afraid.
No matter.
We find the symbiotic relationship with Nonnatus House means there's always someone to take up the baton.
Phyllis Crane, SRN, SCM.
Pleased to meet you, Mr Greenwood.
Now, I believe you'd like to hear about postnatal care.
Why don't YOU hold her?
Good morning.
I'd like to run some tests...
Now, Nurse Gilbert.
Go home as soon as you're done.
You've had a long day, lass.
Thank you, Phyllis.
I'm dreading telling Sister Ursula about baby Lin.
No, you leave that to me.
Are you leaving us, Mr Greenwood?
Yes.
Shame Dr Turner isn't back yet.
He'll receive a copy of my report, of course.
I'll let him know.
Would it be completely inappropriate if one were to inquire as to any possible conclusions it may contain?
Look... it's a good little place.
Tightly run and serves its patients very well.
Dr Turner's arguments are persuasive and his passion and commitment are admirable.
Yet I sense a "but", Mr Greenwood.
Progress is marching on in a particular direction.
None of these small places will be here in ten years' time.
The Maternity Home won't be recommended for IMMEDIATE closure but I'm afraid that's the best I can do.
We will content ourselves with a stay of execution.
Thank you.
- Mr Turner?
- Mr Kenley.
You did the right thing bringing your wife in.
- We're going to admit her.
- Thank you.
The bleeding's stopped.
For now.
But even with full bed rest, she may still abort spontaneously.
You do know that?
Yes.
I'm a doctor.
It never makes it any easier...
where family are concerned.
No, it doesn't.
In war, when we run away from Japanese, I pregnant.
I give birth in rain at side of road.
A woman help me.
She put my daughter in my arms.
A daughter?
You had a daughter?
She beautiful.
So much black hair.
But we cannot stop.
We walk all night.
I hold her next to my skin to keep her warm.
But it rain so hard and she get so cold.
Colder and colder and then... she gone.
But before they take her from me,
I bite off a piece of her beautiful hair and I put it in my pocket, here, next to my heart.
I still have it.
You saw it.
I just want to keep Lin safe and warm and I nearly lost her too.
Ma.
You got her here.
- Good evening, Nurse Crane.
- Good evening, Sister.
Might I trouble you for a moment of your time?
- You're back.
- Barbara!
I can't tell you how nice it is to see you.
You too.
But where's Patsy?
And what on earth has Sister Julienne done to her office?
What's the matter?
The baby remains unconscious.
I will pray for them.
I do not want Nurse Gilbert to face any blame or censure, Sister Ursula.
She was in a situation where her hands were tied.
20 minutes is enough time for postnatal checks, Nurse Crane.
We both know that.
It's enough time in a hospital where all you see is the patient and their symptoms.
But in district practice one must take in the bigger picture.
I'm afraid it wasn't enough time for Lucy and Lin Chen.
I thank you for your frankness, Nurse Crane.
You have given me much upon which to reflect.
Thank you, Sister Ursula.
No-one doubts your good intentions.
We all want a tight ship.
You should never have been put in a situation where you couldn't use your clinical judgment.
Sister Julienne would never do anything like that.
I know.
We'll have to say something.
Good evening.
Nurse Franklin, I presume.
Yes.
Good evening, Sister Ursula.
No, I won't interrupt.
I simply wish to commiserate with Nurse Gilbert.
I understand you had a difficult day.
I apologise.
Thank you, Sister.
The condition of Baby Chen remains unchanged, I'm afraid.
I will inform you if there's any news.
And the 20-minute appointment system will be reviewed.
Sister Monica Joan?
Sister?
Sister?
Ah, evening, Sister.
You're just in the nick of time.
Come on.
Sister?
What are you doing here?
It's very late.
(Silence.)
Is...?
Is that our television set?
Sh.
It's starting.
He really is very old.
- Who is?
- Mr Steptoe.
It's beautiful, Barbara.
Perfect.
Mmm.
Ah.
Tea tastes so much better in Poplar.
Nurse Franklin.
We are complete.
Iced buns.
Sister Monica Joan, where have you been?
I was getting very worried.
Let us simply say, the mystery of the television has been solved.
It was given to the Seaman's Mission.
Where's Sister Ursula?
We must ask her to join us for this happy gathering.
Sister Ursula appears to have embarked upon a regimen of prayer and fasting.
I'm sorry, Sister, would you prefer solitude?
No.
I would be grateful for your company and for your prayers.
Though I fear I am undeserving of both.
No-one is undeserving of a prayer, Sister.
A baby lies close to death in hospital.
But when I kneel to pray for her
I find I cannot stop the entreaties on my own behalf.
How will God hear the prayers for the child in all the clamour?
God hears it all, Sister.
You know that.
I failed in my last mission.
That is a fact.
I failed the Order.
And I failed Him.
In Nonnatus House I saw... a second chance.
I told myself I was making a gift of myself, to the Order, a gift of all the lessons I'd learned, so that it would not suffer any more losses.
But it was vanity, pure and simple.
And now I've failed again.
Failure is too strong a word, Sister.
Misjudgement, perhaps... from which we learn.
Will you pray with me for the child?
Excuse me?
Did you find the gas leak?
Was it the water heater?
Wasn't a leak, love.
Fitted without a proper flue.
'Bout time they pulled this lot down.
I don't trust my eyes any more.
You think you see a flicker and then...
I know, love.
She fighting on the inside.
She want to live.
She's coming to kick us out.
I don't want to leave her again, Cyril.
What if she...?
- She move!
- She's awake?
- I don't think so, Ma.
- She move.
I see it.
Baby Lin Chen is responding to stimulus.
Our prayers were answered.
Thank you, Sister Julienne.
I shall return to the Mother House.
You won't reconsider?
This is your mission, Sister Julienne.
I should never have usurped it.
Sister?
Sister?
There is a vanity in excess penance.
You must have sustenance.
Thank you, Sister Monica Joan.
Thank you.
Your carriage to the station, Sister.
And I will brook no argument.
You are very kind.
Come in.
Oh.
- It's all looking very nice, Sister.
Thank you.
It has been an interesting few months.
Do sit down.
I wondered if you'd been given any news about Sister Mary Cynthia.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
But I do know that she is safe and being cared for at the Mother House.
I stayed at the Mother House the night that my ship docked.
I'd hoped I might see her but I didn't.
No-one would tell me anything about her.
Sister Julienne, I don't think she's there.
'Sometimes there is no map 'for the road we find ourselves upon.
'It lies ahead, uncharted, unfurling into mist.
'We are all travelling through one another's countries.
'But it is no matter if we meet as strangers, 'for we can join forces and learn to love.
'And where there is friendship and affection 'there is the place we can all call home.'
We've received permission and funds to engage a new midwife.
I don't want the kind of help you and Eugene are offering.
Do you hear me?
I don't want it.
Spectacular Chariot Race...
prams, carts, wheelbarrows.
Nursing treats young working class girls the way the world treats women.
Tell me, honestly.
Did I do the right thing?
You did the only thing you could.
We were happy enough before.
And we will be happy again, whatever happens.

Unless Carl Brown was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Or is it the wrong place at the right time?
I guess being in the right place at the wrong time is not so good either.
Uh...
Wait.
Nell.
DEEKS:
So, suddenly, he pulls the stick out of the alligator's mouth and at the last possible second steps back right before the powerful jaws slam down.
He says, "I will give anybody 100 bucks to do this exact same trick."
And he looks around.
Everybody's shaking their head, like, "Hell no, there's no way I'm doing that."
Until this one skinny, tattooed arm raises into the sky, right?
And it's this old toothless hooker.
And she says, "You know what, I'll give it a go, but I'm not sure that stick's gonna fit in my mouth."
(chuckles)
Oh, come on, man!
That's hilarious!
Are you kidding me?
(clapping slowly)
Aw, the not-so-subtle, disingenuous slow clap.
Thank you, thank you.
I will be here all week.
I mean, that is your...
that is your plan, right?
Well, actually, that's up to you.
Actually, it's not up to me.
'Cause I'm not driving this train.
Neither are you.
But the difference being, of course, that I know that and you don't.
Which is exactly what the people who are actually responsible for this want-- your overzealous obsession with yours truly to keep me locked up in here.
So now you're part of a bigger conspiracy?
Yes. 10,000 times yes.
And I know it's crazy, but it's God's honest truth when I tell you that my team is in trouble and they need my help.
Please.
You're out of here.
What?
GUARD:
On your feet.
You're not gonna regret this.
Oh, I'm not talking to you.
Tiny, you're out of here.
Thanks for your help, man.
I'm sorry.
He's funny.
(chuckles)
Oh, my gosh, wait a minute, you were trying to use him as intimidation?
Oh, you amateur!
I can't believe you did that.
It's just... it's so sad for me to see you go to such great lengths to be such a rookie.
Bring 'em in.
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)
Bring who in?
All of you, step in.
What, this guy?
Oh.
Line up across...
Um... okay, you know what, there's actually strict laws against overcrowding, not to mention the unhygienic aspect of this whole ordeal.
(latch clicks)
GUARD (in distance):
Up against the wall, hands out of your pockets.
WHITING:
Enjoy your new friends.
Gentlemen,
LAPD Detective Deeks.
Hmm.
Mm-hmm.
I like your tattoos.
You guys in a band?
SAM:
Wake up.
Come on, man, this is important.
What's your operating budget?
Uh, I'm not sure exactly.
$2.8 billion last year.
What's the ATF's?
No?
$1.2 billion.
Oh, don't feel bad.
The FBI gets
$9.5.
You know what my agency gets?
Take a guess.
$1, $2 bil.
$780 million.
Yeah, that's with an "M."
To operate around the globe.
Seriously, man, don't you need to sleep?
Come on, Sanchez, stay with me.
This is where it gets interesting.
I'm here with you, right?
LAPD has my boss and one of my coworkers.
Now, think.
Who has more money than all our federal agencies combined?
The CIA.
They have a budget of $52.6 billion.
That we know of.
Who else has the power to manipulate both your Department of Justice and my Department of Defense?
You see it?
We're being played.
You need some more coffee.
And I need to speak to your special agent in charge.
(click) (door opens)
So, you feeling a little more talkative today?
(sighs)
I guess so.
Now that I've had some time to think about it.
I'll tell you everything, but you have to promise me you're not gonna tell anyone I confessed.
Take all the glory.
Just chalk it up to good detective work.
A deal?
Deal.
Hey!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, gun!
Gun!
I need help in here!
Go, go.
Hey, what are you doing?
Give me that!
Hand it over.
Release.
(groans)
Got it.
Lock him down.
I want belly chains, full restraints.
Now!
Yes, sir.
You're gonna pay for this.
It's gonna cost you.
I promise you that.
Sir, your weapon.
(phone ringing) Yeah?
Kens, it's me.
I'm in custody.
I don't got long.
Give me a sitrep.
All right, so Deeks is still being held by the LAPD.
Same goes for Sam at the DEA.
We have reason to believe
Heather has links to the CIA, but we're trying to contact Sabatino at the agency to confirm it, but no luck finding him.
Oh, and, um, Duggan's dead.
What?
!
Yeah.
A sniper got him outside the boatshed.
I'm almost sorry I asked.
So Hetty and the others are safe.
Do you have a plan?
Yeah, I'm working on it.
Look, we all need to be able to stay in touch.
Unfortunately, I'm not gonna have this phone very long.
I can handle that.
Well, what about Granger?
Well, last I heard, the doctors said that...
You're only making this worse for yourself.
I sexted your mom.
(sighs)
(monitors beeping steadily)
MAN:
So far the manhunt for the fugitives has come up empty, as both federal and local law expand their search.
So far the manhunt for the... (TV clicks off)
So this is how it ends.
Please release all nonessential personnel.
They'll be safer on their own away from here.
Where are you going?
The hospital.
ERIC:
Whoa, whoa.
We can't split up.
That's, like, the number one rule of horror movies.
The minute you're out the door, it'll be like, "Reeh, reeh,
"reeh, reeh, reeh, reeh." (clears throat)
The wolves are here for all of us.
Someone needs to watch over Granger.
Okay, then I'll go with you.
No.
I need you here.
So do they.
I no longer work for NCIS, remember?
You're in charge, dear.
What if they come for you and Granger first?
Well...
I will make them regret it.
This house must not fall.
Does anybody else feel like an abandoned puppy?
You got to suck it up, Beagle.
We've got work to do.
Eric, send everybody home.
Tell them to stay vigilant and remain on standby for further instruction.
Nell... don't let anybody gain access to the building, and that means sealing the burn room cubby.
Yup.
Wait, what are you gonna do?
It's time to lock and load.
Hey, where do we keep the hand grenades?
We don't have hand grenades.
Oh.
We should order some.
All right, maybe just take it down a notch, Rambeale.
Um, I prefer "Bulletproof."
(sighs)
What is that?
Flashbangs.
Beale.
Uh, I saved your life with one of these once, remember?
Clearly, I'll never hear the end of it.
Fine.
You can have flashbangs.
Yes.
Kens, really don't think that's the best idea.
What I think is a good idea is that we move.
Let's go.
Whoa, you guys.
This could be my new team name.
What do you like better, "Flashbang" or "Bulletproof"?
How about "Soundproof"?
What the hell is this?
End of the road, Carl.
Inside.
Oh, I'm not going in there.
Get in the damn cage, Carl.
Any problems?
No, went off without a hitch.
Good.
Mr. Garvey, what about our deal?
Word's already on the street.
Every headhunter from L.A. to Hoboken will know Brownie Boy's here within a matter of hours.
(Hetty laughs)
HETTY:
Oh, good.
You can get this one some lunch... before you return him safely to his facility.
You said I could see the beach.
Did I say that?
Take him to the beach... but shoot him... if he starts any funny business.
You got it.
Let's go.
See you around, Carl.
CARL:
Is this another one of your psych ops designed to break me, Hetty?
Oh, you've been broken for some time, sweetheart.
That's why you're here now...
for bait.
ERIC:
Okay.
Pistol, rifle, flashbang, rifle... knife, pistol, pistol, flashbang... knife.
That ought to do it.
Should probably get a few more flashbangs while I'm at it.
(computer beeps)
Hello.
And who are you?
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
We got a problem.
You noticed?
No, this is way worse.
(clears throat)
What's with the tablet knife, Ghetto Q?
Will you forget about the knife and look at the code?
KENSI:
What's going on?
ERIC:
I was going through everything we had on Sabatino, figure out how to contact him.
Okay.
Is this a Trojan horse?
Yes.
It was embedded in an e-mail he sent to Kensi when they were in Afghanistan.
What's the payload?
Spyware.
What?
How did we miss this?
I don't know.
There must have been a flaw in their security setup over there.
You think Sabatino knew about it?
I don't know if he did or if he didn't, but if he did...
You just found our mole.
(sighs) Yeah.
Two years too late.
Look, if there was a virus in Sabatino's e-mail, none of us were looking for it.
Man, I knew something was off about this guy.
I knew it.
I thought he helped save you.
I don't know.
Did he?
Or was he just saving himself, and maybe it was part of the setup?
Okay, it looks like it only infected our e-mail server, which is how they must have gotten access to our employees' information, which, in turn, allowed them to target someone like Carl Brown.
Well, Heather said the CIA was behind it.
This just confirms it.
Why are the CIA after us?
I don't know.
I don't know, but we have to get to the bottom of this.
Alert the team and get them back here.
Whoa, whoa, now you're leaving?
This may be the only place we're safe.
We're not safe anywhere.
Your lawyer's here.
Oh, thanks for letting me use your phone.
Thank you, Special Agent Morgan.
(clears throat)
I'd like to speak with my client in private, please.
And of course that means no recording of our conversation.
We'll still be watching this one.
Can you read lips?
(clears throat)
Well, Mr. Callen, I've reviewed the charges.
Honestly, I don't think they have much of a case.
So I've prepared a statement for you.
Please feel free to look it over while I get you the hell out of here.
Agent Morgan, I'd like to speak with you and your SAC.
You're crazy if you think you're getting him out of here.
He's already proven himself to be a flight risk.
Let's see what your boss has to say about that.
Shall we?
(object rattles)
That's my girl.
MAN:
I'm going to tear you open from the inside out.
Sh... she said that?
Man, my grandma didn't mess around, homie.
She was a real O.G.
Straight up, tough, but fair, and she always kept it real.
Damn, man, I miss my grandma, man, for reals.
Every day.
Listen, you got to know that-that she's up there right now, you know?
Looking down on you, watching out for you.
Amen to that, brother.
(smooches) Amen to that.
Deeks, you have a visitor.
Are they bigger than a bread box?
(lightly chuckles) Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
KENSI:
Detective Whiting said I could see you.
That is uncharacteristically kind of her.
Maybe my message of love is wearing off on you.
No, she just promised to tell me everything about the murder of your former partner,
Detective Frances Boyle.
My God, you're like a dog with a bone.
That case isn't cold;
it's frozen.
There's nothing left to tell...
especially from her.
She didn't even know me.
She might know now.
I just...
Hey, hey.
No contact with the prisoners.
Keep your hands behind your back.
What did I tell you?
Knock it off.
Hey.
Get off me.
You know what?
Just for that, I'm not talking anymore.
Well, you don't have a choice.
Your subpoena's already in the works.
Hmm.
Why don't you stick your subpoena?
Guard.
About time you shut up.
Oh, let's hope that was new in the box.
(clears throat) Beale.
ERIC:
Hey, Deeks.
Good to hear your voice again.
Yeah, what's up?
What's the plan?
What was that?
No, it was... you know, man, I'm just talking to my grandma.
MAN (over radio):
All units be advised, the suspect is in custody.
Deeks?
Deeks, I'm here.
Callen is, too.
We just got to get
Sam back online so we can communicate.
SULLIVAN:
Hey.
Special K.
Sullivan?
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh, hi.
Good to see you.
I didn't even recognize you with the beard.
You like it?
Yeah, um...
(chuckles)
I am in a huge rush, but, uh,
I thought you were being deployed.
Yeah, yeah, no, but I-I got in this thing and so... you know, but it's-it's not a big deal.
I really don't even need it.
See?
Look.
Oh.
Yeah.
(laughing):
Then why are you...
Yeah, in fact, it's for you.
What?
(grunts)
(groans) Hey.
There you go.
DEEKS:
Kensi.
Kensi, what's happening?
Kens?
!
Eric, you got eyes on Kens?
No.
CALLEN:
Well, get them.
Kensi.
What's the latest, Eric?
Looking.
I'm still looking.
(computer beeps)
Oh, geez.
Beale... what?
Beale, what is it?
Kensi was abducted by the guy she was talking to.
DEEKS:
Sullivan.
Who the hell's Sullivan?
He's a vet from rehab.
Listen, you need to get that footage to LAPD right now,
Detective Ellen Whiting.
Do you understand?
I'm on it.
What?
Those things'll kill you.
(grunts, coughs)
(coughs, gasps)
(vehicle approaches)
(tires screech)
(Morgan continues coughing)
Hello.
Hey.
(engine revs, tires squeal)
(phone ringing)
Hello.
Kensi's been kidnapped.
What?
How?
Some guy named Sullivan she met in rehab.
I'm still trying to figure out who the hell he is.
Callen is out of custody for the moment.
Still working on Deeks and Sam.
Are you at the hospital with Granger?
No.
I'm-I'm not.
(phone beeps)
Hetty?
What's wrong, Hetty?
Your little scheme not going as planned?
Oh, God.
Carl, shut up.
Or I'll kill you myself, honest to God.
DEEKS:
Are you seeing this?
'Cause I told you my team was in trouble.
Do you believe me now?
How do I know that this wasn't staged just to get you out?
It wasn't.
Oh, my God.
This-this is on you, and if anything happens to her, so help me God.
If she had stayed here and talked to me like she promised, she'd still be here.
If you didn't lock me up, she wouldn't be alone.
She'd have her partner.
Whose fault is that?
My God, you just don't get it, do you?
This is so much bigger than you and your witch hunt for dirty cops.
I help you find Kensi... you tell me the truth.
I told you the truth.
Yes or no?
Okay, you know what?
We find Kensi and I will tell you everything you want to hear.
But first we find Kensi.
Let's get you out of here.
How'd you get out?
I explained to the special agent in charge what was happening.
Why, how'd you get out?
Doesn't matter.
He... escaped.
He escaped?
What do you mean you escaped?
Why didn't you reason with them?
'Cause they weren't being very reasonable.
So you pulled a Houdini and now you're a fugitive.
Sometimes it's better to beg for forgiveness than ask for permission.
I thought Deeks was a bad influence.
Where are we?
Still looking for Sullivan and the vehicle.
Kensi's phone is offline.
CALLEN:
And what do we know about this Sullivan?
Not much.
Kensi and Deeks are the only ones that have met him.
Hospital rehab records lead nowhere.
Sullivan must have been an alias.
Oh, he's probably CIA, too.
CIA?
(sighs)
Oh, man, this just keeps getting worse.
Is Hetty still with Granger?
No.
Where is she?
Don't know.
She hung up on me.
Have you been able to contact Sabatino?
Uh, not yet.
But he may have been the first one to breach our security.
Sabatino's the mole?
It looks that way.
And now they got Kensi.
Yes, but why?
What are they gonna do with her?
I mean, what is the CIA's beef with us?
That's probably a question for Hetty.
You worked for the Agency.
You know what they're capable of.
SULLIVAN:
How we doing, Special K?
What the hell is this?
Well, what does it look like?
(sighs)
Well, it looks like you read Fifty Shades of Grey too many times.
I think you're gonna need a little more rehab.
Yeah, let me out of this chair and I'll show you who needs rehab.
Still feisty.
Okay, why are you doing this?
Wh-What is this?
Well, because you and your team have become a royal pain in the ass.
You're CIA, aren't you?
I'm actually the one who's going to be asking the questions.
I'm not telling you anything.
That's what they all say.
You're gonna feel a little prick.
Good night.
If Hetty isn't with Granger, then he's exposed.
LAPD still has him as a suspect.
They'll have a cop on him.
Yeah, but is that gonna be enough?
Maybe, maybe not, but we can't afford to send anyone else in.
We don't have the manpower.
Well, why the hell did Kensi send everyone home?
Hetty told her to.
Said they were safer spread out on their own.
Well, Anna had help.
ATF called her into Washington.
What about Nate?
Hetty sent him to Cuba on assignment last week.
Cuba?
And she knows Kensi was grabbed?
Yep, Eric told her.
And she didn't say where she is or what she was doing?
No, and she never checked back in.
Her phone's off, so is Kensi's.
So turn 'em back on.
I tried.
They must have removed their batteries.
Check her e-mails and phone messages.
I want to know what she's been doing and who she's been talking to.
Okay.
Yeah, and find out where she was the last time Eric spoke with her.
I'm on it.
Hey!
Who are you?
LAPD.
How'd you get in here?
She's with me.
Unfortunately.
This is Detective Ellen Whiting, Internal Affairs.
The old ball and chain.
As you remember, this is Special Agent Callen,
Special Agent Hanna.
Seriously, Deeks?
What?
She said she wouldn't let me go unless she came with me, so here she is.
Besides, we could probably use her help.
So, any idea why this guy would want to kidnap Agent Blye?
You want my help or not?
You want something?
(sighs) Oh.
Oh, I get it.
This is supposed to be one of your Yoda tricks.
(laughs)
Wait, so what?
You'll just sit there staring at me like a gargoyle, hoping I'll get so freaked out that I'll say something useful?
Or suddenly I'll have the urge to, to spill my guts and reveal the most important...
Oh, for God's sake, shut up, Carl.
God.
You know, I don't need you to talk.
I don't want you to talk.
I just want you to sit back there.
Just quietly, like a good little monkey.
(imitating monkey)
Oh, my Lord.
I only met him twice.
He was supposedly a Marine, clean-cut, 30s, fit, amputee-- left leg.
I mean, it could have been right leg, I don't remember.
That's a good place to start:
prosthetic labs and services.
See if there's more footage at the hospital.
DEEKS:
Tell me that you got something.
Yeah, but you're not gonna like it.
Ms. Lange, it's Agent Sanchez from the DEA.
We kept your man as long as we could, but he was getting adamant about being released and we were no longer comfortable holding him.
I'm sorry.
Hope it helped.
What the hell?
She knew they had me in custody and asked them to hold me there.
That's why they were treating us the way they did.
Wait, but nobody asked me to hold him.
SAM:
Yeah, but I'll bet someone tipped you off with new info so you would.
NELL:
On the same day
Carl Brown escaped from prison transport.
Something reeks of munchkin.
Eric?
She set us up.
Can someone please explain to me what the hell is going on?
Our operations manager had us arrested.
Why?
Well, either logic says that she's the mole or she wanted us off the streets.
She wanted us safe.
While she does God knows what.
WHITING:
She put a body in your trunk.
Along with several kilos of cocaine.
She put one in his house, too.
A body?
My guess is, she borrowed 'em from Rose.
L.A. Coroner's Office.
It was probably a John Doe.
You say this like you've all done this before.
Who are you people?
That's why she sent everyone home and told Nell and I to hunker down here with Kensi.
Yeah, we buggered up that plan, huh?
Yeah and now Kensi's in trouble.
We'll find her.
Even if we have to tear this city apart.
We don't even know where to begin.
Call SECNAV, we need her to put a full court press on the CIA, find out everything we can about Sullivan.
Where are we with Sabatino?
Nowhere.
We still can't find him.
What about Balinski?
What's his real name?
CIA Officer
Randall Sharov?
We pulled his sorry ass out of a Russian prison.
Yeah, is he still working for the agency?
It doesn't matter if he is or he isn't.
He still owes us.
CALLEN:
Well, maybe Arkady still has contact.
Yeah, lucky us.
What was Hetty's last known location?
I pinged my last call to her to a cell tower in South L.A.
that's two miles south of the Sports Center.
Yeah, well, let's search for any of Hetty's vehicles in that area.
Wait a minute, just because Hetty's there doesn't mean Kensi's gonna be there.
CALLEN:
No, but at his point, she knows more than we do.
(vehicle approaching)
(vehicle stops)
(vehicle door opens)
(vehicle door closes) Shh.
Lower.
She's small.
(grunts)
(sighs)
Carl... this a friend of yours?
No.
Wow.
MAN:
But he was a friend of mine.
Me, too.
HETTY:
Oh, bugger.
Ah.
Officers Sharov and Sabatino.
Has the CIA gone completely rogue?
No, just the cool kids.
Your turn.
You want to have the honors, Carl?
Oh, yes.
Did you get anything more, Eric?
ERIC:
Not yet.
You hear back from Arkady?
No, he's probably at a spa somewhere.
(camera shutter sound)
It's a longshot, Beale, but I'm sending you some tire tracks.
Got it.
SAM:
See if they match any of Hetty's vehicles.
LAPD turn up anything on the abduction yet?
They would've called me if they had anything.
That happened right in front of your precinct.
Should try getting some detectives that can detect.
So why did Hetty come out here?
It's isolated, it's empty.
It's a good place to set up a meeting with somebody you want to get rid of.
Yeah, let's see if she left anything behind.
CARL:
Now, you've heard of shooting fish in a barrel, right?
Well, this is shooting Hetty in a cage.
Don't gloat, Carl.
It's unprofessional.
No.
No, no.
Look at me.
See, my face is going to be the last thing you're ever gonna see.
The hell it is.
You.
I expected more from you.
You sound like my father.
Was he a traitor, too?
And you,
I should've left in that Russian prison.
I'm glad you didn't.
This is how you thank us?
Your job is to chase after drunk sailors and wayward Marines.
You were warned to stay out of the Middle East.
I was protecting my people.
SHAROV:
And in doing so, you undid months of our work and jeopardized the security of the entire region.
You have no idea what we're doing over there.
All right, enough talking.
Time to face the music.
At least tell me where Agent Blye is before you kill me.
You owe me that.
No, we don't.
I don't know where she is.
She's with Ferris, which... is unfortunate for her.
And why is that?
Because they have a personal history together.
From rehab?
Prior to that.
She just doesn't know it.
So Sullivan is really CIA Officer Ferris.
Thank you.
(yawns)
(groans)
(laughs)
What's so funny?
Men...
(chuckles) are so damn predictable.
Oh, you think so, do you?
Well, if we're so damn predictable, why are you the one in the cage?
(chuckles)
Oh, Carl.
(sighs)
I'm in the only safe place left here now.
(beeping, Hetty laughs)
What the hell was that?
I think we just found her.
We'd better hope not.
Hetty?
SAM:
This looks like a professional detonation.
Keep your eyes open for secondary devices.
I got a body.
He's got a bullet hole in his head.
Yeah, I got another body.
It's Sharov.
Hetty!
Yeah!
Did I get 'em all?
How many were there?
Uh, three, plus the one I shot.
The man holding Kensi is a CIA officer.
Sullivan.
Ferris is his real name.
All right, find their phones.
They got to have his number.
CALLEN:
I got Sabatino!
He's still alive.
Gun!
(gasps)
(groans, coughs)
DEEKS:
Whiting?
(groans)
Whiting!
Uh-oh.
(both grunt)
Okay, I got you, I got, I got you.
Hey, Sam!
SAM:
All right, keep pressure on her until I can get her bandaged.
I got you.
You're bad luck, Deeks.
Yeah, I know.
I know, but I need you to stay with me, okay?
You got to look at me.
Stay with me.
Otherwise, you're not gonna hear my confession.
I killed my ex-partner.
I killed Boyle.
You were right, okay?
You were right all along, he was a dirty cop.
And I shot him with his own gun 'cause he was gonna try to kill that girl.
You understand me?
You were right.
You're telling me 'cause you think I'm gonna die.
You're not gonna die.
Look at me, you're not gonna die.
I'm telling you this because we made a deal.
And I'm a man of my word, okay?
I'm not a bad guy.
I just did a very bad thing for a very good reason.
But you're gonna be fine.
(siren wailing in distance)
You understand?
You're gonna be fine.
(labored breath) I got you.
Ambulance is coming.
You're gonna be fine.
You got to trust me.
Eric, yeah, I got a cell phone.
I need you to get everything you can off it.
See if you can locate Ferris' phone.
I'm on it.
Hey, is Hetty okay?
She's fine.
Carl Brown and Sharov not so much.
They're dead.
Detective Whiting was shot in the neck.
She's in bad shape.
(ambulance horn honks)
(men shouting indistinctly)
(sighs)
SULLIVAN:
Hey, Sleeping Beauty.
How was your nap?
You've got one chance of surviving this.
Let me go and run for your life.
Mm...
I don't think so.
If you hurt me and my team, I'll hunt you like the dog you are.
Your team are a bunch of self-righteous, arrogant idiots.
And what's up with that little lady and the glasses?
It's like she's right out of The Wizard of Oz or something.
I mean, you got to admit, she's kind of creepy.
You know, she brought this on all of you.
What does that even mean?
What are you talking about?
Are you all completely clueless?
I mean, you want to run around Los Angeles like Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys, be my guest.
But you cannot interfere with global security.
That's a job for the big boys.
You're so delusional.
(soft chuckle)
No, honey.
It's actually you who doesn't know what she's talking about.
Hmm.
Have you ever heard of Lex talionis?
Eye for an eye.
Not just a pretty face.
I did not lose my leg from an IED.
No.
(sighs)
It was the day after Christmas-- the Brits and Canadians call it Boxing Day.
We'd been in the tribal regions for months brokering deals with the Hazaras, the Hezb-e-Islami, the Tajiks, you name it.
And we were this... close to getting Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour on board when we ran into some local heroes.
Nothing we couldn't handle.
Except they had some Americans helping them.
One minute I'm riding my horse, the next thing you know we're taking sniper fire.
And some bitch blows my leg off.
You and your team shouldn't have been there and you sure as hell shouldn't have been interfering with our operations.
So, you see, for the other guys, it's just business, but for me, it's... it's kind of personal.
We thought you were Taliban.
Well, you thought wrong.
We didn't know you were American.
It was a mistake.
A mistake!
That should've never happened if you hadn't have been meddling in things that don't concern you.
We tried to warn you a bunch of times.
But you just won't listen.
And you won't go away.
So here... we... are.
I am sorry.
I am sorry that I shot you in the leg.
I am so sorry.
Don't worry, Special K.
I'm not gonna kill you.
But I am... going to... pay you back... for what...
Come on, man.
you did...
Come on, man, no!
...to me.
(saw running) No!
No!
No, stop!
Stop, no!

The man Arkady knew as Balinski is actually
CIA Officer
Randall Sharov.
My voice doesn't sound familiar to you?
Hands up!
Granger's the least of your worries.
We've got new evidence in your cold case.
We're gonna do this dance again?
Cuff him.
You mind opening your trunk for us?
Stay on your toes.
Sam just got picked up by the DEA at Heather's.
Looks like they're coming after me.
All of us arrested on the same day by different law enforcement agencies?
This is an attack on NCIS.
You made the deal with the secretary of defense.
You had 90 days to find the mole, and your 90 days have expired.
Hands up!
I'm in charge here.
And I can explain what's going on.
Oh, my God.
Duggan's been shot.
Where are you taking me?
Disneyland.
Well, if it isn't Carl Brownnose.
Kiss any federal agent ass lately, Carl?
I can't ride with him.
He tried to kill me.
Aw.
Well, now you two can make up on the drive.
No, no, no, no, no.
There you go.
They're all yours, guys.
All right.
Lock it up.
Relax, Carl, this is your lucky day.
Why do you say that?
I got a surprise for you.
What?
Wait for it.
What's going on?
We're breaking you out, Carl.
Why?
Because you're worth $50,000 dead.
But twice that alive.
♪ NCIS:
LA 8x14 ♪ Under Siege Original Air Date on January 29, 2017
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
The escaped convicts are armed and considered extremely dangerous.
This is not good.
They are believed to be headed for the Los Angeles area or possibly on their way to Mexico.
If any of the public see or come into contact with any of these men...
No, this is very, very bad.
Unless Carl Brown was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Or is it the wrong place at the right time?
I guess being in the right place at the wrong time is not so good either.
Uh...
Wait.
Nell.
So, suddenly, he pulls the stick out of the alligator's mouth and at the last possible second steps back right before the powerful jaws slam down.
He says, "I will give anybody 100 bucks to do this exact same trick."
And he looks around.
Everybody's shaking their head, like, "Hell no, there's no way I'm doing that."
Until this one skinny, tattooed arm raises into the sky, right?
And it's this old toothless hooker.
And she says, "You know what, I'll give it a go, but I'm not sure that stick's gonna fit in my mouth."
Oh, come on, man!
That's hilarious!
Are you kidding me?
Aw, the not-so-subtle, disingenuous slow clap.
Thank you, thank you.
I will be here all week.
I mean, that is your...
that is your plan, right?
Well, actually, that's up to you.
Actually, it's not up to me.
'Cause I'm not driving this train.
Neither are you.
But the difference being, of course, that I know that and you don't.
Which is exactly what the people who are actually responsible for this want-- your overzealous obsession with yours truly to keep me locked up in here.
So now you're part of a bigger conspiracy?
Yes. 10,000 times yes.
And I know it's crazy, but it's God's honest truth when I tell you that my team is in trouble and they need my help.
Please.
You're out of here.
What?
On your feet.
You're not gonna regret this.
Oh, I'm not talking to you.
Tiny, you're out of here.
Thanks for your help, man.
I'm sorry.
He's funny.
Oh, my gosh, wait a minute, you were trying to use him as intimidation?
Oh, you amateur!
I can't believe you did that.
It's just... it's so sad for me to see you go to such great lengths to be such a rookie.
Bring 'em in.
Bring who in?
All of you, step in.
What, this guy?
Oh.
Line up across...
Um... okay, you know what, there's actually strict laws against overcrowding, not to mention the unhygienic aspect of this whole ordeal.
Up against the wall, hands out of your pockets.
Enjoy your new friends.
Gentlemen,
LAPD Detective Deeks.
Hmm.
Mm-hmm.
I like your tattoos.
You guys in a band?
Wake up.
Come on, man, this is important.
What's your operating budget?
Uh, I'm not sure exactly.
$2.8 billion last year.
What's the ATF's?
No?
$1.2 billion.
Oh, don't feel bad.
The FBI gets
$9.5.
You know what my agency gets?
Take a guess.
$1, $2 bil.
$780 million.
Yeah, that's with an "M."
To operate around the globe.
Seriously, man, don't you need to sleep?
Come on, Sanchez, stay with me.
This is where it gets interesting.
I'm here with you, right?
LAPD has my boss and one of my coworkers.
Now, think.
Who has more money than all our federal agencies combined?
The CIA.
They have a budget of $52.6 billion.
That we know of.
Who else has the power to manipulate both your Department of Justice and my Department of Defense?
You see it?
We're being played.
You need some more coffee.
And I need to speak to your special agent in charge.
So, you feeling a little more talkative today?
I guess so.
Now that I've had some time to think about it.
I'll tell you everything, but you have to promise me you're not gonna tell anyone I confessed.
Take all the glory.
Just chalk it up to good detective work.
A deal?
Deal.
Hey!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, gun!
Gun!
I need help in here!
Go, go.
Hey, what are you doing?
Give me that!
Hand it over.
Release.
Got it.
Lock him down.
I want belly chains, full restraints.
Now!
Yes, sir.
You're gonna pay for this.
It's gonna cost you.
I promise you that.
Sir, your weapon.
Yeah?
Kens, it's me.
I'm in custody.
I don't got long.
Give me a sitrep.
All right, so Deeks is still being held by the LAPD.
Same goes for Sam at the DEA.
We have reason to believe
Heather has links to the CIA, but we're trying to contact Sabatino at the agency to confirm it, but no luck finding him.
Oh, and, um, Duggan's dead.
What?
!
Yeah.
A sniper got him outside the boatshed.
I'm almost sorry I asked.
So Hetty and the others are safe.
Do you have a plan?
Yeah, I'm working on it.
Look, we all need to be able to stay in touch.
Unfortunately, I'm not gonna have this phone very long.
I can handle that.
Well, what about Granger?
Well, last I heard, the doctors said that...
You're only making this worse for yourself.
I sexted your mom.
So far the manhunt for the fugitives has come up empty, as both federal and local law expand their search.
So far the manhunt for the...
So this is how it ends.
Please release all nonessential personnel.
They'll be safer on their own away from here.
Where are you going?
- The hospital.
- Whoa, whoa.
We can't split up.
That's, like, the number one rule of horror movies.
The minute you're out the door, it'll be like, "Reeh, reeh,
"reeh, reeh, reeh, reeh."
The wolves are here for all of us.
Someone needs to watch over Granger.
Okay, then I'll go with you.
No.
I need you here.
So do they.
I no longer work for NCIS, remember?
You're in charge, dear.
What if they come for you and Granger first?
Well...
I will make them regret it.
This house must not fall.
Does anybody else feel like an abandoned puppy?
You got to suck it up, Beagle.
We've got work to do.
Eric, send everybody home.
Tell them to stay vigilant and remain on standby for further instruction.
Nell... don't let anybody gain access to the building, and that means sealing the burn room cubby.
Yup.
Wait, what are you gonna do?
It's time to lock and load.
Hey, where do we keep the hand grenades?
We don't have hand grenades.
Oh.
We should order some.
All right, maybe just take it down a notch, Rambeale.
Um, I prefer "Bulletproof."
What is that?
Flashbangs.
Beale.
Uh, I saved your life with one of these once, remember?
Clearly, I'll never hear the end of it.
Fine.
You can have flashbangs.
Yes.
Kens, really don't think that's the best idea.
What I think is a good idea is that we move.
Let's go.
Whoa, you guys.
This could be my new team name.
What do you like better, "Flashbang" or "Bulletproof"?
How about "Soundproof"?
What the hell is this?
End of the road, Carl.
Inside.
Oh, I'm not going in there.
Get in the damn cage, Carl.
Any problems?
No, went off without a hitch.
Good.
Mr. Garvey, what about our deal?
Word's already on the street.
Every headhunter from L.A. to Hoboken will know Brownie Boy's here within a matter of hours.
Oh, good.
You can get this one some lunch... before you return him safely to his facility.
You said I could see the beach.
Did I say that?
Take him to the beach... but shoot him... if he starts any funny business.
You got it.
Let's go.
See you around, Carl.
Is this another one of your psych ops designed to break me, Hetty?
Oh, you've been broken for some time, sweetheart.
That's why you're here now...
for bait.
Okay.
Pistol, rifle, flashbang, rifle... knife, pistol, pistol, flashbang... knife.
That ought to do it.
Should probably get a few more flashbangs while I'm at it.
Hello.
And who are you?
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
We got a problem.
You noticed?
No, this is way worse.
What's with the tablet knife, Ghetto Q?
Will you forget about the knife and look at the code?
What's going on?
I was going through everything we had on Sabatino, figure out how to contact him.
Okay.
Is this a Trojan horse?
Yes.
It was embedded in an e-mail he sent to Kensi when they were in Afghanistan.
What's the payload?
Spyware.
What?
How did we miss this?
I don't know.
There must have been a flaw in their security setup over there.
You think Sabatino knew about it?
I don't know if he did or if he didn't, but if he did...
You just found our mole.
Yeah.
Two years too late.
Look, if there was a virus in Sabatino's e-mail, none of us were looking for it.
Man, I knew something was off about this guy.
I knew it.
I thought he helped save you.
I don't know.
Did he?
Or was he just saving himself, and maybe it was part of the setup?
Okay, it looks like it only infected our e-mail server, which is how they must have gotten access to our employees' information, which, in turn, allowed them to target someone like Carl Brown.
Well, Heather said the CIA was behind it.
This just confirms it.
Why are the CIA after us?
I don't know.
I don't know, but we have to get to the bottom of this.
Alert the team and get them back here.
Whoa, whoa, now you're leaving?
This may be the only place we're safe.
We're not safe anywhere.
Your lawyer's here.
Oh, thanks for letting me use your phone.
Thank you, Special Agent Morgan.
I'd like to speak with my client in private, please.
And of course that means no recording of our conversation.
We'll still be watching this one.
Can you read lips?
Well, Mr. Callen, I've reviewed the charges.
Honestly, I don't think they have much of a case.
So I've prepared a statement for you.
Please feel free to look it over while I get you the hell out of here.
Agent Morgan, I'd like to speak with you and your SAC.
You're crazy if you think you're getting him out of here.
He's already proven himself to be a flight risk.
Let's see what your boss has to say about that.
Shall we?
That's my girl.
I'm going to tear you open from the inside out.
Sh... she said that?
Man, my grandma didn't mess around, homie.
She was a real O.G.
Straight up, tough, but fair, and she always kept it real.
Damn, man, I miss my grandma, man, for reals.
Every day.
Listen, you got to know that-that she's up there right now, you know?
Looking down on you, watching out for you.
Amen to that, brother.
Amen to that.
Deeks, you have a visitor.
Are they bigger than a bread box?
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Detective Whiting said I could see you.
That is uncharacteristically kind of her.
Maybe my message of love is wearing off on you.
No, she just promised to tell me everything about the murder of your former partner,
Detective Frances Boyle.
My God, you're like a dog with a bone.
That case isn't cold;
it's frozen.
There's nothing left to tell...
especially from her.
She didn't even know me.
She might know now.
I just...
Hey, hey.
No contact with the prisoners.
Keep your hands behind your back.
What did I tell you?
Knock it off.
Hey.
Get off me.
You know what?
Just for that, I'm not talking anymore.
Well, you don't have a choice.
Your subpoena's already in the works.
Hmm.
Why don't you stick your subpoena?
Guard.
About time you shut up.
Oh, let's hope that was new in the box.
Beale.
Hey, Deeks.
Good to hear your voice again.
Yeah, what's up?
What's the plan?
What was that?
No, it was... you know, man, I'm just talking to my grandma.
All units be advised, the suspect is in custody.
Deeks?
Deeks, I'm here.
Callen is, too.
We just got to get
Sam back online so we can communicate.
Hey.
Special K.
Sullivan?
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh, hi.
Good to see you.
I didn't even recognize you with the beard.
You like it?
Yeah, um...
I am in a huge rush, but, uh,
I thought you were being deployed.
Yeah, yeah, no, but I-I got in this thing and so... you know, but it's-it's not a big deal.
I really don't even need it.
See?
Look.
Oh.
Yeah.
Then why are you...
Yeah, in fact, it's for you.
What?
Hey.
There you go.
Kensi.
Kensi, what's happening?
Kens?
!
Eric, you got eyes on Kens?
- No.
- Well, get them.
Kensi.
What's the latest, Eric?
Looking.
I'm still looking.
Oh, geez.
Beale... what?
Beale, what is it?
Kensi was abducted by the guy she was talking to.
Sullivan.
Who the hell's Sullivan?
He's a vet from rehab.
Listen, you need to get that footage to LAPD right now,
Detective Ellen Whiting.
Do you understand?
I'm on it.
What?
Those things'll kill you.
Hello.
Hey.
Hello.
Kensi's been kidnapped.
What?
How?
Some guy named Sullivan she met in rehab.
I'm still trying to figure out who the hell he is.
Callen is out of custody for the moment.
Still working on Deeks and Sam.
Are you at the hospital with Granger?
No.
I'm-I'm not.
Hetty?
What's wrong, Hetty?
Your little scheme not going as planned?
Oh, God.
Carl, shut up.
Or I'll kill you myself, honest to God.
Are you seeing this?
'Cause I told you my team was in trouble.
Do you believe me now?
How do I know that this wasn't staged just to get you out?
It wasn't.
Oh, my God.
This-this is on you, and if anything happens to her, so help me God.
If she had stayed here and talked to me like she promised, she'd still be here.
If you didn't lock me up, she wouldn't be alone.
She'd have her partner.
Whose fault is that?
My God, you just don't get it, do you?
This is so much bigger than you and your witch hunt for dirty cops.
I help you find Kensi... you tell me the truth.
I told you the truth.
Yes or no?
Okay, you know what?
We find Kensi and I will tell you everything you want to hear.
But first we find Kensi.
Let's get you out of here.
How'd you get out?
I explained to the special agent in charge what was happening.
Why, how'd you get out?
Doesn't matter.
He... escaped.
He escaped?
What do you mean you escaped?
Why didn't you reason with them?
'Cause they weren't being very reasonable.
So you pulled a Houdini and now you're a fugitive.
Sometimes it's better to beg for forgiveness than ask for permission.
I thought Deeks was a bad influence.
Where are we?
Still looking for Sullivan and the vehicle.
Kensi's phone is offline.
And what do we know about this Sullivan?
Not much.
Kensi and Deeks are the only ones that have met him.
Hospital rehab records lead nowhere.
Sullivan must have been an alias.
Oh, he's probably CIA, too.
CIA?
Oh, man, this just keeps getting worse.
Is Hetty still with Granger?
No.
Where is she?
Don't know.
She hung up on me.
Have you been able to contact Sabatino?
Uh, not yet.
But he may have been the first one to breach our security.
Sabatino's the mole?
It looks that way.
And now they got Kensi.
Yes, but why?
What are they gonna do with her?
I mean, what is the CIA's beef with us?
That's probably a question for Hetty.
You worked for the Agency.
You know what they're capable of.
How we doing, Special K?
What the hell is this?
Well, what does it look like?
Well, it looks like you read Fifty Shades of Grey too many times.
I think you're gonna need a little more rehab.
Yeah, let me out of this chair and I'll show you who needs rehab.
Still feisty.
Okay, why are you doing this?
Wh-What is this?
Well, because you and your team have become a royal pain in the ass.
You're CIA, aren't you?
I'm actually the one who's going to be asking the questions.
I'm not telling you anything.
That's what they all say.
You're gonna feel a little prick.
Good night.
If Hetty isn't with Granger, then he's exposed.
LAPD still has him as a suspect.
They'll have a cop on him.
Yeah, but is that gonna be enough?
Maybe, maybe not, but we can't afford to send anyone else in.
We don't have the manpower.
Well, why the hell did Kensi send everyone home?
Hetty told her to.
Said they were safer spread out on their own.
Well, Anna had help.
ATF called her into Washington.
What about Nate?
Hetty sent him to Cuba on assignment last week.
Cuba?
And she knows Kensi was grabbed?
Yep, Eric told her.
And she didn't say where she is or what she was doing?
No, and she never checked back in.
Her phone's off, so is Kensi's.
So turn 'em back on.
I tried.
They must have removed their batteries.
Check her e-mails and phone messages.
I want to know what she's been doing and who she's been talking to.
Okay.
Yeah, and find out where she was the last time Eric spoke with her.
I'm on it.
Hey!
Who are you?
LAPD.
How'd you get in here?
She's with me.
Unfortunately.
This is Detective Ellen Whiting, Internal Affairs.
The old ball and chain.
As you remember, this is Special Agent Callen,
Special Agent Hanna.
Seriously, Deeks?
What?
She said she wouldn't let me go unless she came with me, so here she is.
Besides, we could probably use her help.
So, any idea why this guy would want to kidnap Agent Blye?
You want my help or not?
You want something?
Oh.
Oh, I get it.
This is supposed to be one of your Yoda tricks.
Wait, so what?
You'll just sit there staring at me like a gargoyle, hoping I'll get so freaked out that I'll say something useful?
Or suddenly I'll have the urge to, to spill my guts and reveal the most important...
Oh, for God's sake, shut up, Carl.
God.
You know, I don't need you to talk.
I don't want you to talk.
I just want you to sit back there.
Just quietly, like a good little monkey.
Oh, my Lord.
I only met him twice.
He was supposedly a Marine, clean-cut, 30s, fit, amputee-- left leg.
I mean, it could have been right leg, I don't remember.
That's a good place to start:
prosthetic labs and services.
See if there's more footage at the hospital.
Tell me that you got something.
Yeah, but you're not gonna like it.
Ms. Lange, it's Agent Sanchez from the DEA.
We kept your man as long as we could, but he was getting adamant about being released and we were no longer comfortable holding him.
I'm sorry.
Hope it helped.
What the hell?
She knew they had me in custody and asked them to hold me there.
That's why they were treating us the way they did.
Wait, but nobody asked me to hold him.
Yeah, but I'll bet someone tipped you off
- with new info so you would.
- On the same day
Carl Brown escaped from prison transport.
Something reeks of munchkin.
Eric?
She set us up.
Can someone please explain to me what the hell is going on?
Our operations manager had us arrested.
Why?
Well, either logic says that she's the mole or she wanted us off the streets.
She wanted us safe.
While she does God knows what.
She put a body in your trunk.
Along with several kilos of cocaine.
She put one in his house, too.
A body?
My guess is, she borrowed 'em from Rose.
L.A. Coroner's Office.
It was probably a John Doe.
You say this like you've all done this before.
Who are you people?
That's why she sent everyone home and told Nell and I to hunker down here with Kensi.
Yeah, we buggered up that plan, huh?
Yeah and now Kensi's in trouble.
We'll find her.
Even if we have to tear this city apart.
We don't even know where to begin.
Call SECNAV, we need her to put a full court press on the CIA, find out everything we can about Sullivan.
Where are we with Sabatino?
Nowhere.
We still can't find him.
What about Balinski?
What's his real name?
CIA Officer
Randall Sharov?
We pulled his sorry ass out of a Russian prison.
Yeah, is he still working for the agency?
It doesn't matter if he is or he isn't.
He still owes us.
Well, maybe Arkady still has contact.
Yeah, lucky us.
What was Hetty's last known location?
I pinged my last call to her to a cell tower in South L.A.
that's two miles south of the Sports Center.
Yeah, well, let's search for any of Hetty's vehicles in that area.
Wait a minute, just because Hetty's there doesn't mean Kensi's gonna be there.
No, but at his point, she knows more than we do.
Shh.
Lower.
She's small.
Carl... this a friend of yours?
No.
Wow.
But he was a friend of mine.
Me, too.
Oh, bugger.
Ah.
Officers Sharov and Sabatino.
Has the CIA gone completely rogue?
No, just the cool kids.
Your turn.
You want to have the honors, Carl?
Oh, yes.
Did you get anything more, Eric?
Not yet.
You hear back from Arkady?
No, he's probably at a spa somewhere.
It's a longshot, Beale, but I'm sending you some tire tracks.
Got it.
See if they match any of Hetty's vehicles.
LAPD turn up anything on the abduction yet?
They would've called me if they had anything.
That happened right in front of your precinct.
Should try getting some detectives that can detect.
So why did Hetty come out here?
It's isolated, it's empty.
It's a good place to set up a meeting with somebody you want to get rid of.
Yeah, let's see if she left anything behind.
Now, you've heard of shooting fish in a barrel, right?
Well, this is shooting Hetty in a cage.
Don't gloat, Carl.
It's unprofessional.
No.
No, no.
Look at me.
See, my face is going to be the last thing you're ever gonna see.
The hell it is.
You.
I expected more from you.
You sound like my father.
Was he a traitor, too?
And you,
I should've left in that Russian prison.
I'm glad you didn't.
This is how you thank us?
Your job is to chase after drunk sailors and wayward Marines.
You were warned to stay out of the Middle East.
I was protecting my people.
And in doing so, you undid months of our work and jeopardized the security of the entire region.
You have no idea what we're doing over there.
All right, enough talking.
Time to face the music.
At least tell me where Agent Blye is before you kill me.
You owe me that.
No, we don't.
I don't know where she is.
She's with Ferris, which... is unfortunate for her.
And why is that?
Because they have a personal history together.
From rehab?
Prior to that.
She just doesn't know it.
So Sullivan is really CIA Officer Ferris.
Thank you.
What's so funny?
Men... are so damn predictable.
Oh, you think so, do you?
Well, if we're so damn predictable, why are you the one in the cage?
Oh, Carl.
I'm in the only safe place left here now.
What the hell was that?
I think we just found her.
We'd better hope not.
Hetty?
This looks like a professional detonation.
Keep your eyes open for secondary devices.
I got a body.
He's got a bullet hole in his head.
Yeah, I got another body.
It's Sharov.
Hetty!
Yeah!
Did I get 'em all?
How many were there?
Uh, three, plus the one I shot.
The man holding Kensi is a CIA officer.
Sullivan.
Ferris is his real name.
All right, find their phones.
They got to have his number.
I got Sabatino!
He's still alive.
Gun!
Whiting?
Whiting!
Uh-oh.
Okay, I got you, I got, I got you.
Hey, Sam!
All right, keep pressure on her until I can get her bandaged.
I got you.
You're bad luck, Deeks.
Yeah, I know.
I know, but I need you to stay with me, okay?
You got to look at me.
Stay with me.
Otherwise, you're not gonna hear my confession.
I killed my ex-partner.
I killed Boyle.
You were right, okay?
You were right all along, he was a dirty cop.
And I shot him with his own gun 'cause he was gonna try to kill that girl.
You understand me?
You were right.
You're telling me 'cause you think I'm gonna die.
You're not gonna die.
Look at me, you're not gonna die.
I'm telling you this because we made a deal.
And I'm a man of my word, okay?
I'm not a bad guy.
I just did a very bad thing for a very good reason.
But you're gonna be fine.
You understand?
You're gonna be fine.
I got you.
Ambulance is coming.
You're gonna be fine.
You got to trust me.
Eric, yeah, I got a cell phone.
I need you to get everything you can off it.
See if you can locate Ferris' phone.
I'm on it.
Hey, is Hetty okay?
She's fine.
Carl Brown and Sharov not so much.
They're dead.
Detective Whiting was shot in the neck.
She's in bad shape.
Hey, Sleeping Beauty.
How was your nap?
You've got one chance of surviving this.
Let me go and run for your life.
Mm...
I don't think so.
If you hurt me and my team, I'll hunt you like the dog you are.
Your team are a bunch of self-righteous, arrogant idiots.
And what's up with that little lady and the glasses?
It's like she's right out of The Wizard of Oz or something.
I mean, you got to admit, she's kind of creepy.
You know, she brought this on all of you.
What does that even mean?
What are you talking about?
Are you all completely clueless?
I mean, you want to run around Los Angeles like Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys, be my guest.
But you cannot interfere with global security.
That's a job for the big boys.
You're so delusional.
No, honey.
It's actually you who doesn't know what she's talking about.
Hmm.
Have you ever heard of Lex talionis?
Eye for an eye.
Not just a pretty face.
I did not lose my leg from an IED.
No.
It was the day after Christmas-- the Brits and Canadians call it Boxing Day.
We'd been in the tribal regions for months brokering deals with the Hazaras, the Hezb-e-Islami, the Tajiks, you name it.
And we were this... close to getting Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour on board when we ran into some local heroes.
Nothing we couldn't handle.
Except they had some Americans helping them.
One minute I'm riding my horse, the next thing you know we're taking sniper fire.
And some bitch blows my leg off.
You and your team shouldn't have been there and you sure as hell shouldn't have been interfering with our operations.
So, you see, for the other guys, it's just business, but for me, it's... it's kind of personal.
We thought you were Taliban.
Well, you thought wrong.
We didn't know you were American.
It was a mistake.
A mistake!
That should've never happened if you hadn't have been meddling in things that don't concern you.
We tried to warn you a bunch of times.
But you just won't listen.
And you won't go away.
So here... we... are.
I am sorry.
I am sorry that I shot you in the leg.
I am so sorry.
Don't worry, Special K.
I'm not gonna kill you.
But I am... going to... pay you back... for what...
Come on, man.
you did...
Come on, man, no!
...to me.
No!
No!
No, stop!
Stop, no!

40.
40.
"Hi.
I'm 40."
"How old are you, Ricky?"
"Oh, I'm 40."
"Nah, nah, Ricky can't be 40."
"Rick is 40."
"Macho, cool Rick.
He's 40."
"40-year-old Rick."
Yeah.
40 seems so old.
Totally, but Papi's in great shape.
Agreed.
A perfect 40-year-old specimen.
"I'm a professional ball player."
Thanks, Mir.
No problem.
I hope we're doing the right thing.
I know.
We are.
Daddy needs our help.
We have our strategy, we have our talking points, and we have each other.
Let's do this.
Go, team!
Oh!
Buenos días, chicas.
Must have been some game.
You look really overdressed for bingo, Abuela.
There was dancing!
Was it The Forbidden Dance?
Did you sleep at bingo, Abuela?
I did.
The game ran late.
There were cots, and now I'm going upstairs to change.
Ay caramba.
Feliz cumpleaños, gringo.
Ah, gracias, Rosa.
Worst accent ever.
What are you wearing?
Sequins.
That's an interesting choice for 8:00 a.m. on a Saturday.
That's why I'm here.
I don't want it to happen again.
It's not that bad.
I mean, it's a little form-fitting, but, you know...
Escuchame.
Listen.
I do not want to have to do the walk of shame in front of my granddaughters if I feel like staying out late.
What are you saying?
I am finding my own place.
It's time.
Oh, ho-ho-ho!
Nope.
No, no, no, no, no.
Not happening.
I do not accept your resignation.
I need you.
They need you.
I can't do it without you.
You know, soon they're going to be dating... and boys... and more dating and make-up and prom dresses and then they're going to want to drive... cars!
Cars and boys!
Obviously, nuh-uh.
You're not going anywhere.
Watch me.
No, this has got to be the worst birthday ever.
Happy Birthday, Daddy!
Oh!
Best birthday ever!
Make a wish, Daddy.
Don't leave.
Wishes are meant to be secret, but we're not going anywhere.
Oh, my life is over.
Don't be silly, Papi.
Well, I mean, you're old, but not that old.
Life expectancy is climbing, Daddy.
You've got plenty of time.
Oh.
Today is the first day of the rest of your life.
Bye, all.
Oh-ho-ho...
Wait.
What's with the nod?
It's go time.
Oh.
Daddy, we have to talk to you.
It's important.
Muy.
What up, my pretty posse?
What?
I can't say that?
Which part?
Both parts.
"What up" and "pretty posse".
Both.
Okay.
Okay, I got it.
What's going on?
It's your 40th birthday and you're not getting any younger.
We've seen the Rogaine.
And the last shred of dignity bites the dust.
Another no on "bites the dust".
Oh.
Daddy, we want you to be happy.
We want you to fall in love.
We also want you to get a haircut, lose the "dad jeans", and buy a blue blazer.
Wow.
Wow.
It's going to be a busy day, and, you know, I don't wear "dad jeans".
It's been three years since mom died.
You need to get out there.
I met your mom in the ninth grade.
I don't even know where "out there" is.
She was my girl.
As hard as it is to imagine, there are other girls... maybe not like Mom, but there are.
Plenty of fish.
Yeah, okay, okay.
Yeah, I got it, I got it.
I got it.
I hear you.
Okay.
Whoo.
Wait.
What's your take-away, Daddy?
Eight-year-olds don't say "What's your take-away?"
That's my take-away!
Now, go deliver a TED Talk or something.
I'm going to go brush my teeth and put on my Rogaine.
I think that went well.
What?
Ugh.
Gigi?
I'm fairly certain these belong to you.
Why are they in here?
They're at a spa retreat from their high-stress, yet fulfilling executive positions at Fortune 500 companies.
They were taking a Jacuzzi, and later, they have Pilates.
Right.
Makes perfect sense.
It's important to work hard, but they also have to relax.
Everyone's so scheduled these days, we all just need to slow down.
Of course.
Carry on.
Wow.
You see that one, Isabella?
And she might be our easiest.
How am I going to raise our girls on my own?
You don't have to.

Still here.
What...
What...
What is going on?
What is going on?
You talk to me all the time.
Today, I answered.
No biggie.
No biggie?
Oh, ho-ho, Au contraire, no, it's... it's an enormous b-biggie, mainly because I...
I'm sitting on my bathtub talking to my dead wife.
Huhu...
Sorry.
Forgot their juice cleanser.
Huh.
And early-onset dementia is upon us...
Happy birthday, boss.
Whatever.
- Really?
- I'm in a mood.
Yes, I see that.
It's very endearing.
How about a "Hey, Steph, how's school going?"
Ah, I'm sorry.
How's it going, Steph?
Well, since you asked,
I should have my Ph.D. in clinical sports psychology in, oh, about eight years.
Come on, don't be dramatic.
Try four.
Has my brother come in yet?
Uh, yeah.
He's in the locker room.
Could you go get him for me, please?
- No.
- Excuse me?
Ricky, he's in the locker room.
The men's locker room!
Right, and it's Rick... from now on.
Okay.
Rick.
There he is!
The birthday boss!
He's right there.
And may I just say how especially young you look this morning.
I'm going to stop you right there.
Not in the mood.
Go get my brother for me.
- Sure.
Yeah.
- Please.
Yeah, okay.
Okay.
All right.
Whoo, someone's a little Snippy McSnippersons this morning, huh?
- Go on.
- Yeah, I'm going to get him now.
Good.
It's official.
I've lost my mind on my 40th birthday.
Yay, me.
We need to talk.
No, I can't hear you.
I can't hear you.
I can't hear my dead wife.
♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪
♪ La, la, la!
♪
The girls are right.
It's time...
Time you move on.
Hey.
I'm having a medical thing.
Why?
What's going on?
Do you see that?
What?
I hit my head this morning.
I...
I feel strange.
I'm seeing things.
Maybe I have a brain tumor.
Oh, well, sure, yeah, that's it.
Calm down.
Kidding.
All right, on your feet, little brother.
Dr. Bill is in the house.
Oh!
I'm not one of your patients.
I'm not five.
Okay, okay.
All right, where'd you bang it?
- What, right there?
- Mm.
Ow, that hurts my neck.
Okay, uh, how many fingers?
Three.
- Now?
- Two.
- Now?
- One.
- Now?
- Four.
- Now?
- Look...
Listen, I'm... seeing things.
What kind of things?
Dead wife things.
Stop!
S-sorry.
It's nothing.
Just...
I don't feel well.
Uh, okay.
Rick, um...
Let's talk about stress.
What's going on?
Well, uh... this morning, Rosa, who you know I rely on for every moment of every day, told me that she's moving out, and the girls want me to start dating, and as you also know,
today is my 40th birthday, and oh, right, I use Rogaine.
Rick, you don't have a brain tumor.
You're having "a day", like Mom likes to call it.
I suggest maybe going for a run or for a swim or a steam, or maybe some Xanax.
Kidding.
Look, Jackie and I were talking about you this morning, and... and 40 is a big one.
I mean, that milestone can be daunting, especially alone.
I have the girls and Rosa and you and Jackie.
That's not enough.
Look, I know life hasn't been the same for you since Isabella died, and probably will never be, and that's normal, but the thing is, there are a lot of happy memories ahead,
and there will be love, in the form of a woman.
I know this, and I guess the girls do too.
Ha, ha.
Really.
I've got to tell you, and don't think I haven't thought about it, and as much as I do think about it, it always ends the same way with the same thought...
I can't imagine ever being as in love or happy or comfortable with a woman like I was with Isabella.
Over 20 years, my entire adult life.
Look, stress, anxiety, lack of sleep, dehydration, they can all cause hallucination, you know, the "seeing" things.
The remedy, Rick, is life.
Get out there, man, and live it.
I hate you.
I hate you too.
See you at 7:00.
What do you mean?
You know about the surprise party?
They throw me one every year.
It's no longer a surprise.
I don't get it.
I'm telling you, you're not gonna bulk up.
You just need to do cardio, and then weights.
Okay.
Thanks.
Sorry I was cranky.
I'm hoping you'll relax.
I put a shot of Cuervo in there.
Of course I didn't.
Okay, you have a client at 10:00, and then you're free to spend the rest of your birthday with your girls.
So why are you cranky?
The girls want me to start dating.
Wow.
Wow!
Wow!
That's a lot of wows, Steph.
Mm.
Do you have a blue blazer?
What is it with the blue blazer?
Very versatile.
Looks good with jeans or slacks... khakis too, but no pleats.
Smart girl.
I hate pleats.
Got it.
No pleats.
You think I can't date?
I'm not the dating type?
No, that's not it... at all.
Ricky,
I have worked for you for two years, and you haven't gone out on one date, at least that I've known about.
There's been no dating, and we all can't be as socially active as you, Steph.
A woman's got to kiss a lot of frogs to meet a prince... or a guy with a job... or a car.
You are a catch.
Go on.
Well, you're an ex-professional baseball player, handsome, fit, you own your own business, and you have a really nice house... and you have three amazing daughters.
You're like a killer whale in a sea of plankton.
You're right.
I am a catch!
Guys, look what I found on eBay.
You were marked down to $3.99, and there are more if we want 'em, like a whole warehouse full of these things.
Way to go.
What?
Oh, I...
Uh, Ricky!
Boss, boss!
No, no.
I'm sorry.
Shh.
Thank you all for coming.
You will find water bottles and fruit on the credenza.
That means dresser.
You always think I don't know things.
Did you know it?
Maybe.
Back to the task at hand, please.
Look, he's never going to do this on his own.
We're going to take matters into our own hands, right here, right now.
I think we're right on target with our strategy.
We're going to need a sign-up sheet, with columns, for all of their information.
I've taken the liberty of printing some out.
Mirabel?
Mirabel!
He's at the wrong window.
You two are clearly made for one another.
Hey, Cole.
Hey, yourself.
We're doing a lemonade stand.
Come by.
Will do, beautiful.
The "will do, beautiful" is a little cheesy, don't you think?
You're just jealous.
Yes, I've always wanted a boyfriend who wears the same shirt every day.
What could you possibly be doing?
I'm trying to see how I look, like, upside down.
You know, to Cole, when I'm leaning out the window.
Not like Juliet on the balcony, I can tell you that much.
Who?
Above your pay grade.
You know what's above your pay grade?
A boyfriend.
That's what.
At least I have one.
I'm sorry, Elisa.
Lo siento.
You'll find a boyfriend, I promise.
How do you get one?
A boyfriend.
It's weird.
They just come to me.
Not helping.
Boy lesson number one.
Don't be nice.
What?
That's crazy.
Daddy always says the thing that attracted him to Mom was that although she was the smartest and most popular girl in ninth grade, she was also the nicest.
And you believed him?
Mom was hot.
Mom was nice.
Well, I'm not.
Not with boys.
They like it when you're mean to them, ignore them, and don't care.
She may have a point.
Males of most species, except for lions and eagles, like to hunt, to chase.
They like to prove that they're Alpha.
Animal Planet.
Hello.
Okay, enough.
Task at hand, like the mini-genius said.
Task at hand.
Hey.
Hey, what's up for this afternoon?
Batting practice?
Can't.
We have plans.
On my birthday?
We're going to have a lemonade stand.
To raise money.
For charity.
Not for any other purpose at all.
Well, I guess if it's for charity...
We need your help, Papi.
Will you put together the table in the rec room?
Sure.
What exactly are you raising money for?
Children in Sudan.
- My school.
- A new sweater for children in Sudan.
They need sweaters.
Ah.
I see, I see.
I need to go speak to your grandmother.
I'll put the table together afterwards, okay?
Really?
Sweaters in Sudan?
The girls are up to something.
I hope it's not a surprise party.
Well, look around.
We're having a party for you.
It's no surprise.
Everyone will be here at 7:00.
Later, you eat.
Not now.
I am making a very special dinner for you.
More like a last supper.
Oh, please, Chico.
Rosa, don't leave.
You know, if you move out, there's no more family dinners.
People who don't live together can have dinner, Ricky.
You're a relatively smart man.
You know this.
Yeah, yeah, but what about movie night?
Game night?
Poker night?
Hmm?
I want more "bingo" nights.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Just a little Botox around the eyes.
No, not about that, and I know it's not just Botox.
You want me to leave before dinner?
No, no.
Sorry.
You're gorgeous.
You know this.
I do.
It's just...
I'm a little freaked out, and I wanted to ask you...
And don't think I'm crazy...
But, um... do you believe... in spirits?
Of course.
Of course?
I am Latina.
Did you not notice this?
Okay, okay.
Do you ever talk to them?
I do.
It's good for the soul.
I talk to my mother, my husband, my daughter...
Okay.
Do they ever, um...
I can't believe I'm saying this out loud.
Do they ever talk back?
Uh-huh...
Listen.
How can I put this?
If a spirit comes to you, it's because you need help.
Your need calls to them, and you definitely need help, hijo.
Go on.
I'm listening.
Well, it's not about them.
It's about you.
They only exist to guide us, like our subconscious, and they live here, right here.
So are they, um, are they real?
Oh, they are real to you, and that's all that matters.
They exist for you, and not without you, and the good part is, hijo, they will come if you need help.
What do I need help with?
Seriously, seriously, you have a list?
Oh, I've been working on that for some time.
Listen, listen, what if there was a way that you could stay here and have your own place?
What if I built you a guest house?
Then I'd be a guest.
No.
Now, just leave.
Go on.
I am trying to make dinner here.
Man, there are some bossy women in this house.
Ay!
Happy Beer-day, dude!
Hi.
I think it's still "birthday", Todd.
Is it, though?
I like a birthday, but I prefer a beer day.
No?
Am I wrong with this?
I mean, where would we be without beer?
Not happy, I can tell you that, but you take birthdays away, and we just stay young and hot.
Is that the way you see yourself?
Young and hot?
I do.
Okay.
I, however, am 40 today.
No longer young.
No longer hot.
No, dude, I get it.
So you've got a few years on me.
I know how that must feel, but if you take care of yourself like I do, you could get the hot back.
Ricky Cooper at 40, gets the hot back.
Mm, help me out with this table.
I'm old and weak.
Lemonade stand?
You know it.
Our lives are so predictable.
Well, my life became a little less predictable today.
Bring it.
The girls want me to start dating.
Whoa, whoa, wha...
What's happening over there?
It looks like someone just gave you a puppy.
Someone did, man, someone just did.
Okay, okay, Todd, Todd...
Todd, you're dancing.
This is some danceworthy news, my friend... and I finish with a twirl.
Okay, okay, enlighten me.
This is just the opportunity that we have been waiting for.
We?
The world, my 40-year-old friend, is our oyster.
Todd, you're married.
You...
You have no oysters.
Oh, but there's where you're mistaken, Ricardo.
From now on, from this moment going forward,
I get to live vicariously through you.
How...
How do you figure?
You are the king of the world, my friend.
Go forth and conquer... a lot, and tell me about it... in detail.
You can't forget the details.
The details are of the utmost importance.
Copy that.
Utmost.
Uh, Todd, Todd?
The table.
I just need you to help me flip it over.
- Right.
- Yeah.
Never do that twirl thing again.
It was an impulse thing.
It was...
Yeah, kind of weird.
You know what?
Hold the phone.
We do not do manual labor.
Kids!
Cooper house, stat!
May I say one of the few perks of having two kids under the age of 15 is that I never have to lift a finger again.
Okay, dudes, your mission is as follows.
Grab the table, turn it over, take it to the garage.
Cooper's Angels are lemonade-ing it.
You know what?
Let's do this right.
Go the extra mile.
Grab a tablecloth and throw it on there, maybe some flowers too.
You can pick them from our lawn, but do not tell your mother.
Go!
They're good kids.
I don't understand.
How do you get them to do things?
Elisa is the only one that actually does anything.
The other two, forget about it.
Uh, it's a monetary thing.
I pay them... under the table, and there is nothing wrong with child labor, nothing wrong at all.
Please don't tell Maggie.
Todd!
They're picking my flowers!
Todd!
King of the world, my friend.
Did you say they could do that?
King of the world.
Todd, where are you?
- Coming!
- Todd!
So, uh, Gigi, are you taking recorder this year?
Violin.
Wow, you're so athletic.
That's the best you got?
Apparently, she knows what to do with boys.
What doesn't she know?
Mom would be so proud of her.
She would have been very proud of you too.
You're so caring and nice.
You take care of us.
What?
You think I don't notice?
All right, let's do this thing.
You guys are going to get into so much trouble.
Oh, how was your nap?
I had a nightmare you moved out.
All packed.
Moving mañana.
Tomorrow?
Now you understand my language.
Okay, okay.
How much do you want?
Name your price.
I'll take three grand, hmm?
Okay.
Gracias.
Oh, still moving, but this should cover the hardwood floors.
What the heck is that?
Yeah.
There he is!
Girls, what's going on?
We told you.
Lemonade stand.
There's a lot of people here, and they're all... women people.
It seems we've made some very good lemonade.
Yeah.
Like, the best lemonade ever.
I'm going to ask you one more time, and then I'm going to get mad.
What is going on, Mirabel, Elisa, Georgina?
It's safe to surmise, given the age range of these lovely ladies, they remember you from your pro-ball days.
Do I need to list my occupation as well as my hobbies?
Ugh.
Sir, you realize it's illegal to operate a business in a residential area without the proper permits?
Oh, uh, no disrespect whatsoever, officer, but this is a children's lemonade stand for charity.
This is a dating service.
Yeah...
A what?
There was an email posted on the community Web site and there are signs throughout the county.
The...
The county?
Mm-hmm.
A dating service?
I don't know what you're talking about, officer.
You really don't know, do you?
Poor guy.
I suggest you look behind you, pal.
I am terribly sorry, officer.
It's over right now.
Ha ha.
Inside.
But we're making a book with all their pictures.
Now!
I'm Annie.
My number's right here.
Wednesday and Thursdays are best.
Hello, ladies.
- Todd!
- Coming!
- May I just say...
- No.
What you girls did up there was truly unacceptable, humiliating, and, more importantly, you lied to me.
- We didn't mean...
- No.
You cannot make up your minds that something is going to be, and then just do it.
But isn't that the definition of tenacity and ambition?
Aren't these characteristics you encourage?
That is not the point.
No, you did what you did without any regard for me, and that is very, very wrong.
It was for you, Papi, so you can have a life.
I didn't mean...
I have a life, with the three of you and Abuela.
That's my life, and it's a life that I love and I cherish.
It's not enough.
You three don't get to decide what is enough for me and what is not.
You're children!
My children.
You need to go upstairs now.
It's too much on my own, Isabella.
I think that's why I'm here.
It's to help you move on so you don't have to do it alone, so that you're ready to be with someone else, so that you can have someone to love.
Uh-oh... the girls are very upset, hijo.
Rosa, you saw what they did.
They did it because they love you, and you weren't going to do it on your own.
Don't you think I would be the first one to tell you if the timing wasn't right?
She was my daughter, and she will always be a part of this family, and she is here with us, every day.
Oh, you have no idea.
Isabella was kind, generous, and giving.
She would want you to move on now.
It's time.
How long are you going to keep them up there?
Just give me a few minutes to calm down, because right now,
I could sell them on eBay.
I'll go get them.
Oh, hey!
You can't keep doing that!
You know, popping in and out.
It's not up to me.
You needed me.
I'm here.
Ish.
You're here ish.
Daddy?
Get down here.
Have you read any Mark Twain?
You know, I never know what you're going to say, and it kills me.
This morning it was dolls, and now it's American literature.
What can I say?
I'm an enigma.
So have you read Twain or not, Daddy?
Yeah, a bit.
Well, it's my feeling that it's fear that holds us back, across the board.
Are you sure you're eight?
Oh, Daddy.
Yes, I'm eight!
The thing is
Twain wrote, "20 years from now",
"you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do"
"than by the things you did do'"
"so throw off your bowlines"
"sail away from the safe harbor, and catch trade winds in your sails."
Wow.
That was, uh, that was something.
Essentially, Twain is saying to leave safety behind and to go forge into the unknown.
Women, Dad...
New experiences are the unknown.
It's time to forge.
You got your mother's brain, Gigi.
No doubt about that.
Fiesta time!
But it was a success!
We have sheets of names and numbers.
I'm sorry I missed it.
Wait a minute.
How many women were there?
A lot.
Some of them were really cute.
Well, I mean, for older women.
Older women?
Yeah, like in their 30s.
Oh, yeah, that's very old.
I've got to tell you, when my girls put their mind to something, they do it.
It was quite the scene, but, you know, not the way I want to go about it.
How are we going to go about it?
You know, we could go with the former baseball pro/ business owner angle.
Or the single dad.
That always works.
No, "we" are not doing anything, and "we" are not working any angles.
Okay.
Go online, like me.
What?
I'm not dead yet.
Where do you think I do every Friday night?
Bingo?
Please.
Abuela, you lied to us.
It happens.
Get over it.
Hey.
Hi.
You care to join me?
Sure.
What are you drinking?
I don't care.
Oh, then make mine a double.
Okay.
Remember that party in Cabo when Isabella ate...
Yeah.
The squid nachos with the cheesy spray stuff.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
I miss her.
You were best friends.
Yeah.
To Isabella.
To Isabella.
What are you looking for?
Huh?
Oh... nothing.
What's going on with you?
I can't even begin to explain.
Celebrations are tough.
Jackie, I love you, you're my sister-in-law and a great doctor, but aneurysms don't work that way.
There was nothing you could do.
I know, I know.
I didn't say anything.
Not a word.
Nothing.
No.
You didn't need to.
Drink up.
You know, it's been a tough day, but this cocktail is really working for me.
Oh, oh, oh!
Oh!
Your age is showing, Daddy.
Oh, give me a break, little girl.
Aah!
I am so wiping the floor with you.
Oh, settle down there.
I am so...
Oh, no, no!
No, no, no!
Crap.
I'm going in for the kill, and there I am, bounding over tall buildings and, oh, a nice rooftop flip, if I do say so myself.
I don't want you to grow up.
I'm sorry.
That's not fair.
I know you have to grow up, and I know I'm lame for wanting you to be a little girl.
I get it.
Little kids are cute.
You were so cute!
We got Gigi.
She's super cute.
The cutest... besides you and Mirabel.
Are you too old to cuddle?
Nope.
Do you remember what I asked you on your 8th birthday?
You asked me if I'd promise to always hold your hand when I crossed the street.
And you said yes.
I meant it, Daddy.
I love you...
But I will end you in a New York minute!
Oh, honey, come here.
Come here.
I miss her so much, and she would always wear these.
I'm sorry, Papi.
I'll put them back.
Do you try them on a lot?
They're yours.
Thank you, Papi.
I'll treasure them forever.
You have your mother's beauty, Mirabel, and that's no small thing, but, more importantly, you have her heart... and mine.

I can still pick you all up.
Tricky Ricky's still got it.
I'm still really strong, like, seriously strong.
And it's gone!
Over the wall!
The crowd goes wild!
Tricky Ricky has done it again.
Huh?
That's it?
Come on, what...
Check out these guns.
Look at that.
Like Popeye.
That appeals to women.
It's a visceral thing.
I don't even know what that means.

I can't believe this is happening.
I cannot believe I let you do this.
- We all agreed.
- I didn't.
- We decided it was worth the risk.
- This is a mistake.
This is how amateurs get caught.
Nomi, help.
Will, it's going to be fine.
The ID held up.
In England.
Outgoing.
It is never the same as Incoming.
We're inside the TSA, watching for any alert.
Any better?
Unh-unh.
You're in the woods.
You barely have Wi-Fi.
- Bug's on it.
- Color the Bug totally clustered.
Hi, Bug.
What's up, Neets?
Can I get you anything?
Earplugs.
Okay.
I heard that.
And they're not gonna work because I'm talking inside your head.
She knows.
She didn't mean it literally.
And you know he's only freaking out because he loves you so much.
You can't do anything now.
Let's let her sleep.
Okay, dinner's ready.
Oh, we're coming.
Bug, anything happens, no matter how small, you call me.
Bug's on duty.
You know, this whole visiting thing?
It's a little like FaceTime without a phone.
Ha!
That's what I said!
Uh-oh.
What?
Wait, what?
- TSA bumped up its warning level.
- Why?
Another mass shooting.
At this point, aren't mass shootings just business as usual in America?
Please be careful.
I will.
Ma'am!
He's in a meeting.
This is more important.
- Less humid in those countries.
- Oh, my God.
- Kala.
- I'm interrupting again.
No, no, no, no.
You've just turned an unbearably boring piece of business into another rare pleasure.
- I will come back.
- Mrs. Rasal, the priority is obvious here.
And Raj, I must say, you're spending too much time with me when you have a bride this beautiful right here in the very same building.
It makes me think I taught you nothing at school, my friend.
One of us has to work, Ajay.
See you later.
- Mrs. Rasal.
- Come, Kala.
These shipping reports have been falsified.
Everything.
Everything that the controller is approving has been doctored.
The manifests are complete lies!
My God, Kala, you are even more beautiful when you're upset.
Rajan, please.
We're shipping out old antibiotics, discontinued HIV inhibitors.
We're selling old, useless, defective, and possibly poisonous drugs to people whose lives depend on them.
I know this is not easy to hear for the first time, but this is all standard procedure.
We have to vacate our storage space.
And our profit margins, like every pharma company, depend on not wasting every drug that's slightly below standard.
You know?
This is how this business works.
We all do it.
Some of those drugs can still work.
We are selling the only kind that those people can afford.
You have to trust me.
This is the way to serve the greater good.
What if your father or what if I went to a hospital and was given improper, expired drugs?
- That won't happen.
- Why not?
Because these products are shipped to distant places.
We would never risk the lives of our own people.
Which places?
Out of India.
You know, like China or Africa, faraway places.
Like Kenya?
Could be.
Why?
Kala?
Have you seen this?
So many terrible things going on.
I used to wonder if there was something I could do to try to change the world... before I understood such thoughts were unskilled.
Trying to change the world only leads to suffering.
All we can change is ourselves.
I'm not sure I agree.
I know.
That's why I can't help you.
You weren't sitting in that seat before, were you?
I hope one day we can visit again... when your thinking does not reflect their thinking.
No, please, talk to me.
You were at the rave.
I don't understand.
Why can't I see where you are?
You may feel gravity without knowing how it works.
There are forces acting upon every life that remain beyond our control or comprehension.
I think we can all agree that things were much different back then.
Oh, so different.
There were none of these mass shootings.
- Oh, God.
Did you see the terrible news?
- We just heard about it.
They always want to blame it on a religion, an ethnic group, or a skin color, but the one thing no one ever wants to say...
- It's always a man.
- Some fucking dude not getting any.
Violence has a gender.
Oh, my God.
I love your dads.
I find it fascinating how every generation believes in different things.
We believed in pot.
And sex.
We were Black Panthers.
- Oh, bad motherfuckers.
- Now we cook quinoa.
Oh, come on now.
You all were more interested in pussy than politics.
And what was the nice Jewish girl from Santa Barbara interested in?
I wanted to end patriarchal control over women's bodies.
"Copulation for a better nation."
By having sex with every homie in Oakland.
- By any means necessary.
- Mom!
They exaggerate, honey.
Oh, I just think it's amazing that none of you ever cared that you didn't know who her biological dad was.
Well, what can you do when this thing smiles at you?
Oh, I know.
We're here, we're queer!
Get used to it, get used to it!
We're here, we're queer!
Get used to it, get used to it!
Ha!
Ha!
That's the most fun I've had in my entire life.
That's what you told me once.
Joaquin, what are you doing here?
I wanted nothing to do with you.
Nothing.
And I did my best to convince them that you were beyond saving.
- They wanted to see it by themselves.
- Ay, no.
Dad, Mom... what are you doing here?
You're our daughter.
We've come to take you home.
Daddy, I'm happy here.
I want to stay.
Look what you're doing to your mother, huh?
This?
This...
is what I was trying to explain.
They changed her.
They've made me realize that I can't be with an asshole
- that uses my face as a punching bag.
- Enough!
Joaquin... get her bag.
Huh...
Want to go again... faggot?
Only if you want your ass kicked by a faggot.
Again.
Thank you.
Stop it.
I'm not going anywhere with you.
Don't be a child, Daniela.
Don't treat me like one.
Everything I built in this world, I built for you.
But if you force me,
I will cut you out of that world and I'll never look back.
I know this is hard for all three of you to understand, but I have a relationship with these two men that isn't based on threats, or control, or money.
You're not allowed to be sanctimonious when you're living off a trust fund.
Keep your money.
She doesn't need it.
Daniela, please... come home with us.
Sorry, Mom.
I am home.
I'm home.
Hey!
Whoo-hoo!
- Hi.
- One sec.
- Is it Will again?
- Yeah.
Listen, I just want to know what the plan is in case the ID doesn't work out.
I'm telling you, it's the best one I've ever done.
And by the way, how do you know so much about fake IDs?
Every trans person needs a new ID.
And when the government makes them too hard to get, I make it easy.
She's not through yet.
It'll be fine.
♪ So, if you feel like giving me A lifetime of devotion ♪
I know you feel we can trust Hoy, but if I were BPO, I would be waiting for you here.
If they know I'm here, I don't think it will be because of Hoy.
Someone's following me.
Excuse me.
Diego!
God, you're a sight for sore eyes.
So... you're the chick with the weird accent.
I am.
I didn't think he was gonna come.
I probably shouldn't be here.
Both Will and I are so grateful.
He said he was gonna explain, oh, a few little things.
Like why he just disappeared for over a fucking year without explaining shit to his best fucking friend.
D, I'm sorry.
He's very sorry.
Yeah, sure.
You know what?
I don't know why I'm complaining to you.
Not like he can hear me, right?
Come on.
Oh, my God.
Really?
Makes sense.
What does?
Coming here.
You know Superdawg?
Whenever he gets nervous, he needs to eat.
I gotta get something to eat.
You want anything?
I'm okay.
I really miss the malts.
Actually, I'll try a malt.
That's what he always orders.
Five, six, seven, eight!
Mama?
- Ah.
Hello, my son.
- Hi, Mom.
- This is Zakia, the girl I was...
- Ah!
Yes, of course.
It's wonderful to finally meet you.
It's great to meet you, too.
Capheus told me about the work that you do here with the kids.
It is amazing.
These children do far much more for us than we could ever do for them.
So the school focuses on teaching kids different kinds of art?
Yes.
Art is fundamental to the development of a child's imagination.
One cannot create or achieve anything unless they imagine it first.
My son tells me that you were educated in London?
- Yes.
- What a gift.
It was.
He said that you were offered many jobs but you decided to come back home.
I know there's a lot of work to do here.
There's too much injustice, too much corruption, too much poverty.
But I love Kenya, like your son does.
My future is my country.
Which is why I am so excited about him running for office.
What?
Uh...
Mama, I've been meaning to tell you something.
I used to sit here and think so much about the future... trying to picture what my life would be like.
I never imagined anything like this.
I don't think anyone knows what life they will live.
- That's what makes life feel alive.
- Hm...
Do you think that is also true for people, and if it is, does that mean that you can never really know your own husband?
Or your own brother.
I have to admit, I'm very uncomfortable with this level of uncertainty.
No, but what is the alternative?
Kala?
You have a visitor.
We can stay with you.
No, it's all right.
We need to talk.
- Hm?
- Hm.
So you got these different voices in your head, and one of them is Will?
I know it sounds strange.
If he's in your head listening, does that mean he can hear everything I'm saying?
- Yeah.
- Yes.
So when I say, "Go take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut, Gorski,"
he can hear that?
Yeah.
I deserve it.
He says he deserves it.
Damn right he does.
Ask him why should I give a shit about him or his crazy-ass "I hear voices" girlfriend when he obviously doesn't give a shit about me?
Your phone is about to ring.
Huh?
Listen, D, I'm sorry.
You can't just apologize for something like this, man.
Will you please just let me try to explain, okay?
All I'm asking for is two minutes.
I don't have two minutes for you.
Okay.
All right, that's fine.
Will you just answer me one question?
What?
How many times did the Feds or Homeland Security call you in for questioning?
I don't think I can count that high, man.
Well, you didn't tell them anything because you didn't know anything.
And that is why I couldn't call, because I know you, D.
I know how much you love being a cop.
And a big part of why I love being a cop is being in that hot stinky car every day with my best friend.
I also know my best friend is the shittiest liar I've ever met.
If you lost your job lying to protect me, you couldn't be a cop anymore.
I...
I couldn't forgive myself for that.
Part of being a best friend, man, is caring more about them than you care about a damn job.
Yeah, but you got a wife.
You got two beautiful kids.
Yeah, and they fucking miss you, too.
I miss them.
I miss you.
I miss my life.
I'm trying to get it back.
But I need your help.
Okay.
All right.
What do you want me to do?
You were right.
I don't say this as an excuse, but only in trying to understand it myself.
I have been working in this company since I was a child.
I packed boxes when other kids were playing football.
As soon as I understood math, my father taught me how to crunch margins.
I was raised to believe in this company the way other people believe in God.
The more devout I was, the more I sacrificed, the more I expanded my faith, then the more my god would protect me and my family.
Nothing has been more important.
And this focus has caused me to lose sight of... things that a man in my position should never lose sight of.
But I've changed everything now.
This company is going to do things differently from now on.
Kala, the look in your eyes made me see what you saw.
And I hated it, too.
You are my life.
Everything else is... belongings.
And more than anything...
I want to be the man you believed me to be.
No, no, no!
I forbid it!
- Mama, I thought we were discussing it.
- There's nothing to discuss.
Politics turns people into fools and fools into thugs.
Politics killed your father and it's going to kill you.
- I understand how you feel.
- Then why are we discussing it?
I don't know.
Maybe I've been looking around and seeing things that are wrong... and wondering if there is anything I can do to help fix them.
Maybe I have too much of my father in me.
Maybe I'm just as foolish as he was.
We had the very same argument.
Just tell me why.
- I already said I will tell them no.
- But you want to tell them yes.
I do.
Tell me why, when you know it's so dangerous.
Because we cannot escape hope.
The only hope we have of making this country a better place is if we do it ourselves.
I'm sorry.
The last thing I want to do is cause you pain.
I will tell them I have to withdraw.
You will do no such thing.
All I ask is that you remember that you are all I have left of him.
Father, I'm sorry.
If you hadn't come to the prison... if you hadn't cared about me... maybe you would still be alive.
I feel lost.
Everything I considered my home... is gone.
Every time I begin to feel I belong somewhere...
I have to leave.
I'm trapped between what I want and what I know I can't have.
Mom...
I miss you.
I measure so much of my life against one afternoon with you.
I'm sorry, Mama.
I lost the match.
You fought someone almost twice your age.
But I lost and made you sad.
I'm not sad, Sun.
Then why are you crying?
Mothers worry for their daughters.
I'm always afraid for you when I come to these matches.
But I'm not afraid.
I know.
That's why I'm crying.
Your teacher told me he's never seen a fighter as fearless as my daughter.
When I watch you and I see your fierce determination...
I know that your life will not be like mine... and that makes me very, very happy.
That was the day you took me to the Spring Festival.
There is much of her in you.
I was nourished by her.
But Joong-Ki was too young.
It was my duty to raise him in her place.
But I failed.
What happened was not your fault.
A lot of people never get the kind of love you got from your mother.
I certainly didn't.
But it didn't turn me into a murderer.
That may be true.
But it doesn't change the feeling inside of me.
I know feelings and emotions can overwhelm our logic, and at the same time, logic can ruin the emotions that make life worth living.
My brother killed my father because of me.
This is not a feeling.
It is a fact.
For many years after my father was killed...
I believed it was my duty to avenge him.
I stole a gun.
I imagined myself shooting the men who killed him many times.
But you never did.
No.
Why?
My mother.
Come.
Sit with me.
I want to talk to you about your father.
I asked her if she hated the men who killed him...
- and she said...
- I have no room in my heart for hate.
I don't have a mother to give such advice.
Maybe not.
But you have us.
Are you going to tell me...
I should trust in the law?
No.
My father was like your brother.
The world is better off without them.
I think I'm more confused than I was before.
There's no easy answer, Sun.
Whatever you decide to do... just know you won't have to do it alone.
I don't care where she is.
Mr. Rodriguez, hi.
- You cut your hair!
- Excuse me.
You don't have an appointment with him.
Sir!
Did you see it?
Listen, I gotta call you back.
Did you watch it?
- Oh, yeah, I watched it.
- It has almost two million hits!
Oh, can you believe it?
- It is incredible.
- Lito, this is a bit awkward.
I thought your lawyer was gonna talk to you.
I know.
He said that I needed to talk to you.
Oh, he did, did he?
Okay.
Let's do this.
Before you start, I know I've been having trouble finding the right project.
- It's not that.
- I really think I needed to do this before I was ready.
Well, I wish you would have talked to us first.
Why?
Look, I'm not gonna coddle you.
This agency no longer represents you.
- What?
- Look, it has nothing to do with me.
I mean, I even fought for you.
You know, I think that what you're doing is very, you know...
It's important.
- What are you talking about?
- There are certain high-level clients here at CMA who just, you know, they just simply don't agree with your, um...
I don't know, what do you want to call it?
Your lifestyle?
- It's not a lifestyle.
- Whatever.
Look, they told management in no uncertain terms that it was either them or you.
Okay?
Who?
Look, obviously this conversation never took place, okay?
I mean, we just decided to part ways, and, you know, wish each other the best, and, uh, explore other opportunities, et cetera.
Blah, blah, blah.
You said I was your guy.
Well, you lied to us, too.
Thank you.
Can I offer an opinion?
I came alone.
I just want to talk.
That's all.
How did you know I would be here today?
Well, I didn't.
I've been here every morning before my shift.
I guessed if you did come, it would be early.
I knew it'd be important for you to visit them.
I'd have felt the same way if my father committed suicide.
My father did not commit suicide.
He was murdered.
That is a strong allegation, Ms. Bak.
It's not an allegation, it is a fact, Detective.
Do you then have evidence to prove it?
I know what my brother has done.
And I do not require you or the law to believe me.
Yeah?
Why?
Because I have seen your legal system from inside and out.
And the last thing I would expect from it is justice.
Look, Ms. Bak...
I meant what I said to your teacher, okay?
I'm on your side.
We know that your brother is not the man the media believes him to be.
We suspect a lot of illegal money is flowing through his company.
We're just not able to prove it yet.
Listen to yourself, Detective.
Is this the system you serve?
Yeah.
The law is imperfect.
I'm asking you to trust me and I swear I will protect you.
I don't need anyone's protection.
Are you sure about that?
I promised I only wanted to talk, so I'm not gonna stop you if you prefer to leave.
But... this today, may be my last chance for a rematch.
May I propose a test to your invulnerability, Ms. Bak?
A quick spar.
If you win, you leave as you wish.
But if I win... you come with me and tell your story on the record.
If you're not going to stop me, I have no need to fight you.
No, you don't need to.
But I am hoping you want to.
I have thought about our fight at Mrs. Cho's apartment.
A lot.
I haven't thought about it at all.
All right.
Show me what you've learned, Detective.
When was the last time you lost a fight, Ms. Bak?
I can't remember.
I remember that move from your fight with King Kong Kim.
He was the best fighter from our dojo and you just cut him down like you were chopping a tree.
Like that?
Exactly like that.
Had enough?
No, Ms. Bak.
Oh, no.
You're thinking too much, Detective.
My teacher says the same thing.
After I lost an important match, he told me that I worry too much about what I should or shouldn't do.
He says fighting is not something you do with your head, it's something you do with your heart.
You agree with him, Ms. Bak?
I think you will profit by spending more time with your teacher and less time pestering me.
But this is much more fun.
Come on.
Let's go.
I think I know why you never remember your fights.
You're not fighting a person.
You're fighting something else.
You used a false identity to fight because of your father.
I think he refused to see you... to understand how special you are.
Ah!
You have improved, Detective.
It was almost a year ago you kissed me right here.
Riley, I, uh...
I, uh...
I know I've been acting... crazy lately.
I don't mean to be.
- I know.
- It's just...
I've never loved anyone, anyone... the way that I love you.
I promise I will come back to you.
It's the waiting that's the hard part.
- I know.
- It's, uh...
Do you think it's gonna be much longer?
No.
It could be tomorrow...
it could be next week.
Or it could be right now.
Which it so happens it is.
He's here?
The Archipelago has spoken.
I've been given an address.
You must go there.
You must go now.
- Oh!
What?
Whispers.
Where?
- Oh!
Sorry.
Sorry.
So sorry.
But you are gonna freak out, too.
- What?
- I couldn't sleep.
I was curious about the shooting everyone's been talking about.
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.
And one of the people killed was this British politician, Mitchell Taylor.
He was giving a speech when it happened.
This is not out of some woolly desire to sit in a circle and sing Lennon's "Imagine."
This is to remind people that free societies... are stronger societies.
- Is he speaking at a mosque?
- Uh-huh.
Is he Muslim?
No.
It was some kind of peace congregation with all kinds of people,
Jews, Muslims, Christians, Atheists.
Since the invention of cities, open, multicultural societies are the places that the world's best and brightest have wanted to go to, while mono-cultural, repressive societies are the places they've wanted to escape from.
Oh, my God.
Oh, those poor people.
It's horrible.
What happened to the killer?
He tries to shoot himself.
How much better would the world be if these guys would just start with themselves?
Right?
But look, just before he shoots.
Good.
They caught him.
Yeah.
But the whole thing seemed so sad.
I mean, this guy Taylor trying to do something about our fear of otherness, then I got drawn in.
I started reading all of his tweets, and posts, and interviews, and I was thinking how the Internet is a kind of psycellium, like what you experienced in the woods with Angelica, where memories and moments of our lives exist beyond us... when I saw this...
Ruth El-Saadawi?
Freaky enough?
Then I started thinking like you're thinking, maybe a coincidence is not a coincidence, when my phone pinged and I screamed.
They put the killer in jail, but they didn't release his identity until now.
Todd.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, no.
Of course.
You gotta be shitting me.
Come on.
Riley.
Okay, I'm officially creeped out.
I don't like this, Riles.
We'll find another way to get to Whispers.
Will!
Riley!
I know why Whispers has been missing.
He's been trapped in prison.
He Bolgered Todd and used him to murder a politician named Mitchell Taylor.
Holy shit.
The church?
Why?
This is where the meeting is supposed to be.
Okay, this is getting weirder and weirder.
Riley?
Oh, my God.
- He said I had to go down the stairs.
- Who did?
Mr. Hoy.
If you want my professional police opinion,
I say there's no way in hell I'd go down there.
Yes, thank you.
Especially because if this was a movie, this would be the scene where the funny but annoying sidekick gets whacked.
He said I have to go alone.
Well, that solves my problem.
- I'll be in the car.
- D!
Will, BPO doesn't work like this.
This is someone who's very frightened.
And if I was gonna do what they're about to do, then I'd be scared, too.
I did a scene like this in Forgive Us Our Trespasses.
What happened?
Everyone died.
Not helpful.
No.
It is a test.
They need to know that I'm alone.
No.
Five minutes.
In five minutes, I send in Diego.
I needed to know how far you would go.
I needed to know if I could trust you.
I understand.
It's strange to finally meet.
In a way, you and your cluster exist because of me.
You work with Professor Kolovi.
You helped Angelica escape.
We both realized she was going to birth another cluster.
After what happened to her first...
I knew she would die before she let that happen again.
Why here?
Angelica heard me singing one day and asked where I'd learned.
And I told her about this church.
It was her idea to come here.
Why did Angelica work with BPO?
She was searching for her children.
What happened to them?
None of us fully realized how fast BPO was changing.
When I first started, it was very, very different.
Dr. El-Saadawi was a visionary.
I met her at Stanford.
And the work I did with her felt like something... sacred.
When she died, I hoped Professor Kolovi would continue what she began.
I don't know.
Maybe he believed in her work once, but... not now.
Not since he met Dr. Milton Bailey Brandt.
That's the first name I knew him by.
When he came to the university, he had research, data on the development of the sensorium frontal lobe that we were all desperate for.
Of course, we all suspected how he came about this information, but nobody wanted to ask.
But still, Brandt never would have solved the problems of the neural graft without Angelica.
Neural graft?
It's mimics the connection of a cluster, overriding the consciousness of one sensorium onto another.
Why?
I'm an academic.
Even when I heard you coming down the stairs,
I wasn't sure I would be able to go through with this.
But I know what happened in New York.
When I watched those poor, innocent people killed...
If it's within our power to keep something that terrible from happening... shouldn't we?
Do you know what Angelica called Brandt?
Whispers.
She told me, the voice in your head that tells you to cut your wrists, or to take a handful of pills, or to jump from a height... that voice never shouts.
It only whispers.
Thank you.
He sleeps on blockers.
I couldn't reach him a few hours ago.
So you don't know for certain if he's in there?
No.
Every moment we stand here, he could wake.
She's right.
This is it.
Are you really ready to kill a man in cold blood?
Jonas?
Hello, Will.
[theme music playing]
Why don't they make trains like this anymore?
Our generation's not allowed to have nice things.
[chuckles] [beeping]
Time for another.
Never thought I'd say this, but these make me miss the heroin.
- God, I miss...
- ...this.
Me, too.
Life on beta blockers...
is no life at all.
What?
- We're not alone.
- From last night?
Aye, from last night.
Though what drove me to such recklessness, I can't say.
- I'm Riley and this is Will.
- Oh, nice try.
But you can just call me...
the Old Man of Hoy.
What's his name?
He doesn't trust us.
[Mr. Hoy] Of course I don't trust you.
I barely escaped with my frontal lobes from your wee disco.
[Riley] So did we.
It seems like you took your blockers at the same time we took ours.
Aye, maybe it's true that you got out like me by the hair on your chinny-chin.
Or maybe, just maybe, you were supposed to get out.
He thinks the concert was a BPO trap.
I've seen more than my fair share of snares.
[sighs] You do not remain free for 30 years by being the trusting kind.
Now, whether I'm right or wrong about you,
I suspect we'll be seeing each other again soon enough.
He's gone.
[Sun] I have to go.
I know.
I prepared this.
Food, some clothes, money.
I do not know how to thank you.
Nothing I have done in my life exceeds the honor to have been your teacher.
[dog whining]
Sometimes, I find her staring at the gate.
I know she's waiting for you.
I promise I will come back.
We will be here.
- I'm starving, but...
- But what?
You were out all day, you slept on the couch...
Are you mad at me?
No.
Or me?
I've been mad at many things these days.
Mostly myself.
No, it's my fault.
It's...
I push too much.
- I get too excited about things.
- No, no, no.
No, this is on me.
I shouldn't have made an issue out of the letter.
No one needs to apologize.
Please, Dani, sit.
[squeals] Thank God!
It smells so freaking good!
I did it again, didn't I?
We love how excited you get.
We do.
Family, I have something very important to say.
This is my mother's special omelet.
She would cook this for my father whenever he was missing Spain.
You both know me well enough to know that when I am upset,
I cannot listen to anyone or anything.
Oh, yeah.
But last night, I heard a voice... and that voice was speaking to me as clear as a bell.
What did it say?
It said, "Pack your bags, family.
Because we're going to São Paulo!"
- [all shouting]
- Yes!
[laughing]
- You.
- What do you mean?
[laughing]
Hello.
- Hello.
- I'm...
looking for some courage.
I heard I had a visitor at the office the other day.
- I shouldn't have come.
- No.
The guys you met are assholes.
They're sons of the rich who play at journalism because it makes for a good chat-up line.
Believe me, your left thumb has more value
- than the three of them all together.
- [laughs] Thanks.
They told me that when you were at college... you...
Yes, I loved a woman.
It's true.
I've also loved men.
I fall in love with the person, not their genitals.
Which may sound weird to you.
No.
Not at all.
Look, I'm not someone who usually talks like a greeting card, but... lately, I've come to see that luck is something that reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
Which is the part where I may need some courage.
I've not felt so lucky since I met you.

[sighs]
Not too bad for a machine, huh?
[laughs]
What?
You just push a button and... this?
- This is a miracle.
- [both laugh]
Good morning.
Thank you.
[sighs] I love our coffee.
It's one of the few things Kenya does really well.
In England, I missed it.
Yes, but they have really good tea.
You've been to England?
I've seen many movies.
- You hungry?
- Yes.
[humming]
Good morning, my love.
I have to get to work.
Last night was a dream come true.
- See you later.
- [gasps]
So they came to my house, they talked to me about it, and they left.
[chuckles]
Wait, you're telling me the DRP actually came to your door
- and asked you to run on their ticket?
- Yeah.
Crazy, right?
And you haven't met with them again?
I'm sorry, I thought you would find the story funny.
I've interviewed Koman Nyagah.
He's a serious and very intelligent man.
Why wouldn't you meet with him?
Zakia, I'm a matatu driver.
Which is exactly why you should run and why people would vote for you.
I was at the protest.
I saw the look on their faces.
They trusted you, Capheus.
It's ridiculous.
I pay a fraction of what it costs you or everyone who lives in Kibera for running water or electricity.
We say there's nothing as expensive as being poor.
Why?
Because our government, like every other government, doesn't care about poor people or places like Kibera.
But you do.
- Zakia, I'm...
- At the very least, you can agree to meet with them.
Hear them out.
[crowd] Lito!
[shouting]
- That's a big welcome.
- Hello.
[man] Lito Rodriguez!
- Hello.
- [man] Hello.
Oh, my God.
How are you?
Hello.
- Thank you!
- My God!
I'm one of your biggest fans!
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, where...
Oh, yes.
- I love you so much!
- Thank you.
There is a schedule of events in your packet.
Okay.
The parade kicks off after your address.
My address?
Only if you want.
It is for you to decide.
- Okay.
- Okay. [laughs]
- Lito!
- Lito Rodriguez!
- Hello.
- Hello.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
- Can you take a selfie?
- Yes.
- [woman] Thank you!
- [Lito] It's our pleasure.
Hey, Van Damn.
Hey, your son is here.
Hey, I saw you on YouTube.
You are amazing, just amazing.
But be careful, Van Damn, people are noticing.
Well, uh... [mother clears throat]
Hello, Mom.
Hello, son.
Hmm...
I see the dinner I prepared for you is still there.
It would appear neither of us spent the night at home, again.
- Should I be worried?
- No.
Should I?
[both laugh]
I'm surprised.
You don't think your mother can turn a head anymore?
- My mother is as beautiful as ever.
- Then why?
Kenyan men... we both know they're not very open-minded.
That's true.
So... a little surprising.
Not as much as you think.
Did you ever wonder why Silas had such easy access to the drugs that I needed?
We both have the virus.
And what's more, he told me that very soon, they may have a cure.
Now why are you crying?
Because I sometimes forget that... life's not just full of surprises.
It's also full of gifts.
Yes.
Oh, man.
What?
It's amazing.
Whole underground world of abandoned places people use like their hotel rooms.
It's more like camping.
The same rules, you try to leave it better than how you found it.
If I had a good show, I'd always try and leave a little gift somewhere.
- Like what?
- Mm...
Money.
Drugs.
Music.
Where did you get those?
[Riley] Train station.
Thought we could use them to cover the windows.
Confuse anyone dropping in.
Have I mentioned how in love with you I am?
It really isn't the same, is it?
Well... it's not bad.
It could be the way that older couples who've been together a long time feel like when they kiss.
Yeah, I like the idea of a long life spent kissing you.
Mm-hm.
Eh... this is some stomach-churning domesticity.
Seriously.
This is factory-farming shit.
Oh, no.
Another visitor?
Did the blockers wear off early?
Take your complaint to the FDA, mate.
- It's Puck.
- From the lab?
Oh, sharp as a bowling ball.
I don't understand.
If you're a sensate, why didn't we connect?
- Three guesses.
- Must've been on blockers when we met.
Ding.
Bowling ball continues to impress.
Hey, ask him how he avoids BPO.
Oh!
Ask him if you and I can have just a quick fuck.
- [groans] - [Puck moaning]
What did he say?
- He's not being very helpful.
- Why, am I supposed to be?
At Vincent's, you knew what blockers were and you didn't tell me.
- Oh, I told you enough.
- Tell him that we need help.
If nothing changes, if no one figures out how to stop BPO, then one day he's gonna need the same kind of help.
Over here, hero.
Free advice:
if you bump into one of our kind, assume that they are BPO collaborators.
Be particularly suspicious if you hear about their daring escape from The Rock in Iceland, while also appearing live on stage at an underground EDM concert.
He doesn't trust us either.
- Can you blame me?
- Why come to the concert?
What can I say?
The dick wants what the dick wants.
Sex... can be such a good trust-builder.
I don't think so.
Oh...
Hard To Get dot com.
That is my domain.
Give me a call when you get bored of [whispers] you-know-who.
[speaking Italian]
Can you tell me where you get your blockers?
I make them myself, puttanella.
Listen, the hardest part is getting the samples without a leash around my neck.
But lucky you seem to already have yours, the latest ones with less side effects.
Seems like somebody might have a friend at BPO.
Wait.
Blockers aren't gonna keep you safe forever, Riley Blue.
Not from BPO.
And not from me.
What did he say?
I think I just picked up the equivalent of a sensate STD.
[indistinct shouting] [drum and bass music playing]
[shouting]
Whoo!
Let them gloat.
Hey, Monsieur Gorilla, where's the ball?
Where did the ball go?
Oh, it's in your goal!
Come on, Felix, stop trash-talking.
Let's play!
[exhales]
Wolfie!
Here!
Where are you?
Here!
Ah!
- [Wolfgang] Hey, you all right?
- I'm fine.
- That's what I'm talking about!
- You all right?
- You all right?
- [Fuchs] Everybody, calm down!
[shouts]
- [Felix] Come on!
Stand up!
- [shouting]
[shouts] [cheering]
That's what I'm talking about!
That was fucking real!
Do you have to do everything so intensely?
No.
Just the things that matter.
[gasps] Oh...
These are the last year reports from the controller general.
Yeah, you can just put them there.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Um...
About last night...
I... needed you and you were there for me.
But it was wrong.
Why?
You know why.
You weren't in my bed any more than I'm sitting on this desk here.
It's in our heads, like a fantasy.
Last night was not a fantasy.
What's true is that married women like to fantasize.
- It's what keeps marriages together.
- No.
I don't.
I...
I must not.
Okay, you're in Bombay, I'm in Berlin.
I think you're safe.
Please.
Last night made me realize that
I can't be trusted with my thoughts.
Come on, Wolfie!
Let's finish Fuchs' Fucks!
I need help and you have to help me.
I'm trying to make a life.
Hmm.
Pretending isn't a life.
- [Felix] Wolfie!
- Yeah!
Coming!
So... big day tomorrow.
Do you know what you're gonna say?
What...
Do you think I should say something?
You don't have to do it if you don't feel comfortable.
Yes.
Absolutely.
But... you're so good when you speak from your heart.
Baby, the interview you did at the premiere was incredible.
I think it had a lot to do with these people inviting you.
Of course.
I mean, it has over a million views.
- Really?
- You haven't watched it?
I'm banned from social media.
You just love to look at the bad stuff.
- Yeah, that is true.
- [Hernando] Mm-hmm.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Look!
Look!
[clapping, laughter]
[woman shouting]
[upbeat music playing]
[cheering]
Now... a man who needs no introduction, but I'll introduce to you anyhow.
I give you the Grand Marshall of this year's Pride Parade...
Lito Rodriguez!
[cheering]
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, São Paulo!
Thank you.
I wanted to say that I am very honored to be here.
[cheering]
That isn't the truth.
To be honest with you, I...
I have never been as scared as I am right now.
All of my life, I've had to pretend to be something I wasn't.
And to become what I wanted to become...
I couldn't be what I am.
[mouthing words]
I am a gay man.
[cheering]
I've never said those words in public before.
- I am a gay man!
- [cheering]
- I am a gay man!
I am a gay man!
- [cheering]
Oh.
Why did I have to be so afraid to say that?
Because I know that people are afraid of people that are different from them.
And admitting that I am different and refusing to pretend to be something I am not, may cost me a career of pretending to be things that I am not, which is kind of crazy when you think about it.
But I did.
I did.
For years, I was living inside the fake world of a movie set, never daring to imagine that one day...
I might be brave enough to do something like this.
Come with me.
[cheering]
Hi.
This is Hernando.
He is the love of my life.
[cheering]
I am a better and braver person because of him.
And whatever it costs for me to be able to do this...
I know in my heart that it is worth it.

That was fun.
It was.
- Last time we were here...
- ...we both felt trapped.
You were afraid of going to prison.
Now I miss it.
You wanted so badly to see your father.
And you felt like you were making a terrible mistake.
We've switched places.
Which means, in a way, we're in the same place.
Is there a way out of this?
Or is this just how life always feels?
So you've had no other issues with that brain syndrome thing?
Oh, no, not any health issues.
Everything has been fine.
That is such a relief.
I told Tom I am so happy that you're gonna be there after what happened last year.
Me, too.
Even though I know Mom and
Dad must be giving you hell for this.
No.
They're okay.
Come on, T, don't lie.
What did Dad say?
He said I would regret it.
But why?
I can take it.
Because he said that your narcissism is a black hole and that you would do something to make my wedding all about you.
But I told him he was wrong, and more importantly,
I couldn't imagine getting married without my sister being there.
Come here.
Oh, I love you.
Thank you for sticking up for me.
I won't let you down, and if you need anything...
Actually, there is one thing I could really use some help on...
Nom!
It's the cabin!
- What?
- I emailed Abrasax Electronics.
They found an old shipping report and, oh, my God!
- What?
- It's up near Dancing Water.
- That's weird.
- What's Dancing Water?
Um, that's the commune where Neets grew up.
- Um...
- Mom is gonna freak!
- Okay, we gotta get up there.
- I'm sure she'll want to come.
- I'm gonna text her.
Bye, sweetie.
- Bye.
I'm...
I love you.
But I gotta...
I gotta go.
Okay, just call me.

[Elizabeth's voice overlapping] Come on, sleepy.
The world isn't going to save itself.
[Chelsea, voice echoing] Daddy, look what I made!
Now this line describing the flank, that is sublime.
Come, let Daddy get dressed.
[line ringing] [man] Good morning, Milton.
Good morning, Mr. Secretary.
The Chairman is very excited.
It's a very big day for us.
- It is.
- We are counting on you.
How are you feeling?
Are you all right?
Something's about to happen.
Something bad.
Ah!
What the fuck?
I was bored.
Don't bother on my account.
Where have you been?
Did you miss me?
I know you want to tell her to fuck off, but we need information.
You use blockers.
Everyone does.
- Where do you get them from?
- My contact.
- Does he have a name?
- Yeah. "My Business."
I thought you said we could help each other.
Not that.
Ask something else.
Show her the picture.
Do you know who this guy is?
- Walk away, Lila.
- [Wolfgang] Hmm?
You do know him.
Walk away now.
Love to talk, but my date's arrived.
[Wolfgang] I wouldn't.
- Why?
- Two of the goons were rentals.
They'll go in, sweep the room, then head back out here.
Ah...
Ms. Facchini.
Mr. Bohm.
I was hoping it'd be you.
Why?
Fuchs doesn't see what you are.
He doesn't know.
But I do.
You are just like me.
You're in luck...
Was he right about you?
If you're trying to find a difference between us, you're wasting your time.
I'm not the one with a leash around my neck.
Lila, why are you still talking to him?
I know what I'm doing.
You said we needed each other, but as soon as I ask you for something, you walk away.
Be smart.
- How long has he been after you?
- A year.
- A year?
- That has to be a lie.
- Maybe the Cannibal is getting slow.
- The Cannibal?
Clustercide.
Story is he ate his own.
- Do you know his real name?
- No one does.
Someone must.
This cluster is dead.
Is this one of yours?
Yeah.
He thought you were as hot as I do.
But right now, all he thinks is that you're lying.
What do you think?
We'll see.
You know, you never think about how ubiquitous immigrant food like General Tso's chicken and pepperoni pizza has become...
Until you realize you're a different human species on the run from an evil organization trying to lobotomize you?
Exactly.
Did we make a mistake doing the concert?
No.
It just proved there's a whole bunch more of us out there than we thought, and that there must be some kind of an intelligence network because they all seemed to know who you were.
We just have to try and figure out a way to get them to trust us.
Aye, that's the rub, laddie.
Mr. Hoy is back.
What a charming little empty box you've chosen here.
All the modern amenities of a prison cell.
Where are you visiting from?
I call it my speakeasy 'cause you can speak easy in here.
Soundproofing.
Eighteen inches thick.
All the modern amenities of a coffin.
Aye.
So, Miss Blue, if you and your laddie are not a pair of headhunters, putting on your show was a terrible risk.
Care to explain what possessed you?
Well, Mr. Hoy, if you're not a BPO headhunter, then leaving your coffin to come to my show was a terrible risk.
- What possessed you?
- Huh...
Maybe... after 30 years of surviving... not living, mind you, but surviving... maybe after 30 years of blockers, and coffins, and boxes... maybe I realized...
I'm slowly dying of survival.
[sighs]
I'm sick of this.
- I'm done playing by the rules.
- What are you doing?
- What's going on?
- Mr. Hoy needs a reason to trust us.
There you are, Mr. Hoy.
Aye, well, you do not need to be Sherlock Holmes.
If you're a headhunter or looking to make a deal with BPO, you know where to find me.
Ach!
You've gone and done it now, Miss Blue.
You've done it now.
I'm not about to be out-trusted by a DJ from Iceland.
[chuckles] With hair the color of a Smurf!
Come on now, Miss Blue.
Let's get out of here.
Come on, Miss Blue!
My library.
And this is my laboratory.
This way.
Welcome to the Highlands of Scotland, Miss Blue.
[Riley] It's beautiful.
Reminds me of home.
[woman] Dinner's ready.
Aye, just a moment.
Has another of your invisible friends dropped by?
Aye, Kirsty.
This is Miss Blue.
She's from Iceland.
A lady invisible friend, is it?
Well, now, there's a turn-up for the book.
Invite her in.
There's stovies and mushy peas,
- and fried Mars bar for dessert.
- [chuckles]
She's lovely.
She's a sweet old bird, all right.
- Is she family?
- More than most.
She was the wife of one of my cluster.
I was with him when he died.
He asked me to take care of her.
But the funny thing is, I think I'm looking after her, and she thinks she's looking after me.
But who's to know who's right, eh?
[Amanita grunts] This is where the dads said it should be.
I really love your dads.
Just the fact that they all wanted to take care of you and be a part of your life.
People used to give me shit when I used to use all three of their names on my school forms.
But I think I knew I was pretty lucky in the dad department.
Do you think what my dad said about me to Teagan is true?
That you're a black hole of narcissism?
Look, most of us either have our heads stuck in the sand or stuck up our own ass.
It's human nature to think our problems are the only problems.
Neets...
God, I'm sorry.
I've been...
let's be generous and say not entirely myself and focused on many other things.
You mean besides your amazing girlfriend?
Who's been beyond amazing.
Like, approaching saint status.
[laughs]
I would look good as a statue.
I'm serious.
I know I could not survive any of this crazy shit without you.
What?
It's her.
Angelica?
[both chuckle]
[Mr. Hoy] Spring of '52.
A very, very covert conference was convened at the British airbase on Cyprus.
Authorities from NATO, the Warsaw Pact, China, and the Arab League sat locked in a room debating reality.
After weeks of haggling, walk-outs, and bullying, the Biologic Preservation Organization was born.
How do you know all of this?
I was there.
I assisted Ruth El-Saadawi in drafting the initial charter and guidelines for research into sensacity.
Signatories guaranteed human rights to sensoriums and agreed not to deploy them for military needs.
That's Ruth there.
Is that you?
Handsome bugger, eh?
[chuckles]
Where did it all go?
This is crazy cool.
It's exactly what I read in that book by the woman who started BPO.
- Ruth El-Saadawi.
- Yes.
She talked about psycellium as a morphogenic field and how it made connections like the synapses in our brain, storing them the way memories are stored.
She's the mother of this claid.
- What's a claid?
- A cluster.
Sequoias are like us, polypliotic.
- Can you still see her?
- Yeah.
She lived here.
The cabin is beautiful.
- She looks so different.
- How do you mean?
She looks happy.
Why didn't the charter just announce to the world that Homo sensoriums exist?
Look, we all know sapiens.
I mean, some of my best friends are sapiens.
When sapiens feel safe, they're the nicest people you could meet.
However, feed their inner demons, frighten them, find reasons for them to divide themselves from otherness, and then watch those selfsame sapiens drop bombs on whole cities, drive planes into buildings and happily herd millions of their own kind
into gas chambers.
And that's just what they would do to each other.
What wouldn't they do to a totally different species?
That's why Ruth herself advocated total secrecy.
Was Ms. El-Saadawi a sensate?
No, but her twin sister was.
They came from a village in Egypt.
Not long after her sister's cluster birth, she was stoned to death for immorality and witchcraft.
Ruth went from being a doctor one day to a crusader the next, and did everything she could to prevent it from happening to someone else's sister.
If she was alive today... she'd look at what BPO has become and she would weep.
[Nomi] Wait.
- [Amanita] What?
- Something's wrong.
The research might be helpful.
[man] That's what the Nazis said!
You fucking hide out in Walden while they herd the rest of us into cattle cars.
[Angelica] Do you think they might be right?
[Jonas] I'll go to Iceland.
She's fighting with her cluster.
[Angelica] Be careful.
Can I ask you about one of the BPO hunters?
Do you know him?
If he's the one that's after you,
I must say, I underestimated either your recklessness or your courage.
What's his real name?
I don't know myself.
Not sure I want to know.
When our kind have nightmares about BPO, they're usually about him.
- Where do I find him?
- Huh!
I do not ken where you get your brass goolies from, but maybe I'll be able to give you what you want.
But fair warning, it comes with a price, like as not.
I'll pay it.
There's a network of us, strung out about the world.
The Archipelago, we're called.
Isolated above, but connected below.
I ask someone I know, who asks someone they know, who asks...
Well, you get the gist.
Sapiens invented Google in the 1990s.
We've had it since the Neolithic.
[chuckles]
How long does it take?
I'm looking for Cannibal.
Get him on the phone now!
I don't know what he thinks he's doing.
This is my research, this is my project.
Tell him I'm gonna straighten him out!
I've got the answer, but I don't think you're going to like it.
I was getting nervous.
I'm all right.
I learned a lot.
About BPO and how it changed over the years.
There's someone on the inside who knows Whispers.
Did you get a name?
- Not yet.
- Why not?
Mr. Hoy said I have to go to Chicago.
But I have to go alone.
Nom!
[Nomi] Dr. Metzger.
I don't know what they taught you in med school, but the word "helping" doesn't mean handcuff people and chop up their brains.
Prep her for surgery.
Nomi, what have you done?
Is he in there?
What is he doing?
I told you, he's trying to destroy my work.
I love you.
You really believe that neurografting is possible?
God save us from this idiot.
All that work lost.
- What will we do now?
- I'll start over.
What happened?
I don't know.
But everything started to go wrong when Angelica went to Chicago.
Why don't they make trains like this anymore?
Our generation's not allowed to have nice things.
Time for another.
Never thought I'd say this, but these make me miss the heroin.
- God, I miss...
- ...this.
Me, too.
Life on beta blockers...
is no life at all.
What?
- We're not alone.
- From last night?
Aye, from last night.
Though what drove me to such recklessness, I can't say.
- I'm Riley and this is Will.
- Oh, nice try.
But you can just call me...
the Old Man of Hoy.
What's his name?
He doesn't trust us.
Of course I don't trust you.
I barely escaped with my frontal lobes from your wee disco.
So did we.
It seems like you took your blockers at the same we took ours.
Aye, maybe it's true that you got out like me by the hair on your chinny-chin.
Or maybe, just maybe, you were supposed to get out.
He thinks the concert was a BPO trap.
I've seen more than my fair share of snares.
You do not remain free for 30 years by being the trusting kind.
Now, whether I'm right or wrong about you,
I suspect we'll be seeing each other again soon enough.
He's gone.
I have to go.
I know.
I prepared this.
Food, some clothes, money.
I do not know how to thank you.
Nothing I have done in my life exceeds the honor to have been your teacher.
Sometimes, I find her staring at the gate.
I know she's waiting for you.
I promise I will come back.
We will be here.
- I'm starving, but...
- But what?
You were out all day, you slept on the couch...
Are you mad at me?
No.
- Or me?
- I've been mad at many things these days.
Mostly myself.
No, it's my fault.
It's...
I push too much.
- I get too excited about things.
- No, no, no.
No, this is on me.
I shouldn't have made an issue out of the letter.
No one needs to apologize.
Please, Dani, sit.
Thank God!
It smells so freaking good!
I did it again, didn't I?
We love how excited you get.
We do.
Family, I have something very important to say.
This is my mother's special omelet.
She would cook this for my father whenever he was missing Spain.
You both know me well enough to know that when I am upset,
I cannot listen to anyone or anything.
Oh, yeah.
But last night, I heard a voice... and that voice was speaking to me as clear as a bell.
What did it say?
It said, "Pack your bags, family."
"Because we're going to São Paulo!"
Yes!
- You.
- What do you mean?
Hello.
- Hello.
- I'm...
looking for some courage.
I heard I had a visitor at the office the other day.
- I shouldn't have come.
- No.
The guys you met are assholes.
They're sons of the rich who play at journalism because it makes for a good chat-up line.
Believe me, your left thumb has more value
- than the three of them all together.
- Thanks.
They told me that when you were at college... you...
Yes, I loved a woman.
It's true.
I've also loved men.
I fall in love with the person, not their genitals.
Which may sound weird to you.
No.
Not at all.
Look, I'm not someone who usually talks like a greeting card, but... lately, I've come to see that luck is something that reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
Which is the part where I may need some courage.
I've not felt so lucky since I met you.

What?
You just push a button and... this?
This is a miracle.
Good morning.
Thank you.
I love our coffee.
It's one of the few things Kenya does really well.
In England, I missed it.
Yes, but they have really good tea.
You've been to England?
I've seen many movies.
- You hungry?
- Yes.
Good morning, my love.
I have to get to work.
Last night was a dream come true.
See you later.
So they came to my house, they talked to me about it, and they left.
Wait, you're telling me the DRP actually came to your door
- and asked you to run on their ticket?
- Yeah.
Crazy, right?
And you haven't met with them again?
I'm sorry, I thought you would find the story funny.
I've interviewed Koman Nyagah.
He's a serious and very intelligent man.
Why wouldn't you meet with him?
Zakia, I'm a matatu driver.
Which is exactly why you should run and why people would vote for you.
I was at the protest.
I saw the look on their faces.
They trusted you, Capheus.
It's ridiculous.
I pay a fraction of what it costs you or everyone who lives in Kibera for running water or electricity.
We say there's nothing as expensive as being poor.
Why?
Because our government, like every other government, doesn't care about poor people or places like Kibera.
But you do.
- Zakia, I'm...
- At the very least, you can agree to meet with them.
Hear them out.
Lito!
- That's a big welcome.
- Hello.
Lito Rodriguez!
- Hello.
- Hello.
Oh, my God.
How are you?
Hello.
- Thank you!
- My God!
I'm one of your biggest fans!
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, where...
Oh, yes.
- I love you so much!
- Thank you.
There is a schedule of events in your packet.
- Okay.
- The parade kicks off after your address.
My address?
Only if you want.
It is for you to decide.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Lito!
- Lito Rodriguez!
- Hello.
- Hello.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
- Can you take a selfie?
- Yes.
- Thank you!
- It's our pleasure.
Hey, Van Damn.
Hey, your son is here.
Hey, I saw you on YouTube.
You are amazing, just amazing.
But be careful, Van Damn, people are noticing.
Well, uh...
Hello, Mom.
Hello, son.
Hmm...
I see the dinner I prepared for you is still there.
It would appear neither of us spent the night at home, again.
- Should I be worried?
- No.
Should I?
I'm surprised.
You don't think your mother can turn a head anymore?
- My mother is as beautiful as ever.
- Then why?
Kenyan men... we both know they're not very open-minded.
That's true.
So... a little surprising.
Not as much as you think.
Did you ever wonder why Silas had such easy access to the drugs that I needed?
We both have the virus.
And what's more, he told me that very soon, they may have a cure.
Now why are you crying?
Because I sometimes forget that... life's not just full of surprises.
It's also full of gifts.
Yes.
Oh, man.
What?
It's amazing.
Whole underground world of abandoned places people use like their hotel rooms.
It's more like camping.
The same rules, you try to leave it better than how you found it.
If I had a good show, I'd always try and leave a little gift somewhere.
- Like what?
- Mm...
Money.
Drugs.
Music.
Where did you get those?
Train station.
Thought we could use them to cover the windows.
Confuse anyone dropping in.
Have I mentioned how in love with you I am?
It really isn't the same, is it?
Well... it's not bad.
It could be the way that older couples who've been together a long time feel like when they kiss.
Yeah, I like the idea of a long life spent kissing you.
Mm-hm.
Eh... this is some stomach-churning domesticity.
Seriously.
This is factory-farming shit.
Oh, no.
Another visitor?
- Did the blockers wear off early?
- Take your complaint to the FDA, mate.
- It's Puck.
- From the lab?
Oh, sharp as a bowling ball.
I don't understand.
If you're a sensate, why didn't we connect?
- Three guesses.
- Must've been on blockers when we met.
Ding.
Bowling ball continues to impress.
Hey, ask him how he avoids BPO.
Oh!
Ask him if you and I can have just a quick fuck.
What did he say?
- He's not being very helpful.
- Why, am I supposed to be?
At Vincent's, you knew what blockers were and you didn't tell me.
- Oh, I told you enough.
- Tell him that we need help.
If nothing changes, if no one figures out how to stop BPO, then one day he's gonna need the same kind of help.
Over here, hero.
Free advice:
if you bump into one of our kind, assume that they are BPO collaborators.
Be particularly suspicious if you hear about their daring escape from The Rock in Iceland, while also appearing live on stage at an underground EDM concert.
He doesn't trust us either.
- Can you blame me?
- Why come to the concert?
What can I say?
The dick wants what the dick wants.
Sex... can be such a good trust-builder.
I don't think so.
Oh...
Hard To Get dot com.
That is my domain.
Give me a call when you get bored of you-know-who.
Can you tell me where you get your blockers?
I make them myself, puttanella.
Listen, the hardest part is getting the samples without a leash around my neck.
But lucky you seem to already have yours, the latest ones with less side effects.
Seems like somebody might have a friend at BPO.
Wait.
Blockers aren't gonna keep you safe forever, Riley Blue.
Not from BPO.
And not from me.
What did he say?
I think I just picked up the equivalent of a sensate STD.
Whoo!
- Let them gloat.
- Hey, Monsieur Gorilla, where's the ball?
Where did the ball go?
Oh, it's in your goal!
Come on, Felix, stop trash-talking.
Let's play!
Wolfie!
Here!
Where are you?
Here!
Ah!
- Hey, you all right?
- I'm fine.
- That's what I'm talking about!
- You all right?
- You all right?
- Everybody, calm down!
Come on!
Stand up!
That's what I'm talking about!
That was fucking real!
Do you have to do everything so intensely?
No.
Just the things that matter.
Oh...
These are the last year reports from the controller general.
Yeah, you can just put them there.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Um...
About last night...
I... needed you and you were there for me.
But it was wrong.
Why?
You know why.
You weren't in my bed any more than I'm sitting on this desk here.
It's in our heads, like a fantasy.
Last night was not a fantasy.
What's true is that married women like to fantasize.
- It's what keeps marriages together.
- No.
I don't.
I...
I must not.
Okay, you're in Bombay, I'm in Berlin.
I think you're safe.
Please.
Last night made me realize that I can't be trusted with my thoughts.
Come on, Wolfie!
Let's finish Fuchs' Fucks!
I need help and you have to help me.
I'm trying to make a life.
Hmm.
Pretending isn't a life.
- Wolfie!
- Yeah!
Coming!
So... big day tomorrow.
Do you know what you're gonna say?
What...
Do you think I should say something?
You don't have to do it if you don't feel comfortable.
Yes.
Absolutely.
But... you're so good when you speak from your heart.
Baby, the interview you did at the premiere was incredible.
I think it had a lot to do with these people inviting you.
Of course.
I mean, it has over a million views.
- Really?
- You haven't watched it?
I'm banned from social media.
You just love to look at the bad stuff.
- Yeah, that is true.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Look!
Look!
Now... a man who needs no introduction, but I'll introduce to you anyhow.
I give you the Grand Marshall of this year's Pride Parade...
Lito Rodriguez!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, São Paulo!
Thank you.
I wanted to say that I am very honored to be here.
That isn't the truth.
To be honest with you, I...
I have never been as scared as I am right now.
All of my life, I've had to pretend to be something I wasn't.
And to become what I wanted to become...
I couldn't be what I am.
I am a gay man.
I've never said those words in public before.
I am a gay man!
I am a gay man!
I am a gay man!
Oh.
Why did I have to be so afraid to say that?
Because I know that people are afraid of people that are different from them.
And admitting that I am different and refusing to pretend to be something I am not, may cost me a career of pretending to be things that I am not, which is kind of crazy when you think about it.
But I did.
I did.
For years, I was living inside the fake world of a movie set, never daring to imagine that one day...
I might be brave enough to do something like this.
Come with me.
Hi.
This is Hernando.
He is the love of my life.
I am a better and braver person because of him.
And whatever it costs for me to be able to do this...
I know in my heart that it is worth it.
♪ And I've been everywhere And nothing is new ♪

That was fun.
It was.
- Last time we were here...
- ...we both felt trapped.
You were afraid of going to prison.
Now I miss it.
You wanted so badly to see your father.
And you felt like you were making a terrible mistake.
We've switched places.
Which means, in a way, we're in the same place.
Is there a way out of this?
Or is this just how life always feels?
So you've had no other issues with that brain syndrome thing?
Oh, no, not any health issues.
Everything has been fine.
That is such a relief.
I told Tom I am so happy that you're gonna be there after what happened last year.
Me, too.
Even though I know Mom and Dad must be giving you hell for this.
No.
They're okay.
Come on, T, don't lie.
What did Dad say?
He said I would regret it.
But why?
I can take it.
Because he said that your narcissism is a black hole and that you would do something to make my wedding all about you.
But I told him he was wrong, and more importantly,
I couldn't imagine getting married without my sister being there.
Come here.
Oh, I love you.
Thank you for sticking up for me.
I won't let you down, and if you need anything...
Actually, there is one thing I could really use some help on...
Nom!
It's the cabin!
- What?
- I emailed Abrasax Electronics.
They found an old shipping report and, oh, my God!
- What?
- It's up near Dancing Water.
- That's weird.
- What's Dancing Water?
Um, that's the commune where Neets grew up.
- Um...
- Mom is gonna freak!
- Okay, we gotta get up there.
- I'm sure she'll want to come.
- I'm gonna text her.
Bye, sweetie.
- Bye.
I'm...
I love you.
But I gotta...
I gotta go.
Okay, just call me.
Come on, sleepy.
The world isn't going to save itself.
Daddy, look what I made!
Now this line describing the flank, that is sublime.
Come, let Daddy get dressed.
Good morning, Milton.
Good morning, Mr. Secretary.
The Chairman is very excited.
It's a very big day for us.
- It is.
- We are counting on you.
How are you feeling?
Are you all right?
Something's about to happen.
Something bad.
Ah!
What the fuck?
I was bored.
Don't bother on my account.
Where have you been?
Did you miss me?
I know you want to tell her to fuck off, but we need information.
You use blockers.
Everyone does.
- Where do you get them from?
- My contact.
- Does he have a name?
- Yeah. "My Business."
I thought you said we could help each other.
Not that.
Ask something else.
Show her the picture.
Do you know who this guy is?
- Walk away, Lila.
- Hmm?
You do know him.
Walk away now.
Love to talk, but my date's arrived.
I wouldn't.
- Why?
- Two of the goons were rentals.
They'll go in, sweep the room, then head back out here.
Ah...
Ms. Facchini.
Mr. Bohm.
I was hoping it'd be you.
Why?
Fuchs doesn't see what you are.
He doesn't know.
But I do.
You are just like me.
You're in luck...
Was he right about you?
If you're trying to find a difference between us, you're wasting your time.
I'm not the one with a leash around my neck.
- Lila, why are you still talking to him?
- I know what I'm doing.
You said we needed each other, but as soon as I ask you for something, you walk away.
Be smart.
- How long has he been after you?
- A year.
- A year?
- That has to be a lie.
- Maybe the Cannibal is getting slow.
- The Cannibal?
Clustercide.
Story is he ate his own.
- Do you know his real name?
- No one does.
Someone must.
This cluster is dead.
Is this one of yours?
Yeah.
He thought you were as hot as I do.
But right now, all he thinks is that you're lying.
What do you think?
We'll see.
You know, you never think about how ubiquitous immigrant food like General Tso's chicken and pepperoni pizza has become...
Until you realize you're a different human species on the run from an evil organization trying to lobotomize you?
Exactly.
Did we make a mistake doing the concert?
No.
It just proved there's a whole bunch more of us out there than we thought, and that there must be some kind of an intelligence network because they all seemed to know who you were.
We just have to try and figure out a way to get them to trust us.
Aye, that's the rub, laddie.
Mr. Hoy is back.
What a charming little empty box you've chosen here.
All the modern amenities of a prison cell.
Where are you visiting from?
I call it my speakeasy 'cause you can speak easy in here.
Soundproofing.
Eighteen inches thick.
All the modern amenities of a coffin.
Aye.
So, Miss Blue, if you and your laddie are not a pair of headhunters, putting on your show was a terrible risk.
Care to explain what possessed you?
Well, Mr. Hoy, if you're not a BPO headhunter, then leaving your coffin to come to my show was a terrible risk.
- What possessed you?
- Huh...
Maybe... after 30 years of surviving... not living, mind you, but surviving... maybe after 30 years of blockers, and coffins, and boxes... maybe I realized...
I'm slowly dying of survival.
I'm sick of this.
- I'm done playing by the rules.
- What are you doing?
- What's going on?
- Mr. Hoy needs a reason to trust us.
There you are, Mr. Hoy.
Aye, well, you do not need to be Sherlock Holmes.
If you're a headhunter or looking to make a deal with BPO, you know where to find me.
Ach!
You've gone and done it now, Miss Blue.
You've done it now.
I'm not about to be out-trusted by a DJ from Iceland.
With hair the color of a Smurf!
Come on now, Miss Blue.
Let's get out of here.
Come on, Miss Blue!
My library.
And this is my laboratory.
This way.
Welcome to the Highlands of Scotland, Miss Blue.
It's beautiful.
Reminds me of home.
Dinner's ready.
Aye, just a moment.
Has another of your invisible friends dropped by?
Aye, Kirsty.
This is Miss Blue.
She's from Iceland.
A lady invisible friend, is it?
Well, now, there's a turn-up for the book.
Invite her in.
There's stovies and mushy peas, and fried Mars bar for dessert.
She's lovely.
She's a sweet old bird, all right.
- Is she family?
- More than most.
She was the wife of one of my cluster.
I was with him when he died.
He asked me to take care of her.
But the funny thing is, I think I'm looking after her, and she thinks she's looking after me.
But who's to know who's right, eh?
This is where the dads said it should be.
I really love your dads.
Just the fact that they all wanted to take care of you and be a part of your life.
People used to give me shit when I used to use all three of their names on my school forms.
But I think I knew I was pretty lucky in the dad department.
Do you think what my dad said about me to Teagan is true?
That you're a black hole of narcissism?
Look, most of us either have our heads stuck in the sand or stuck up our own ass.
It's human nature to think our problems are the only problems.
Neets...
God, I'm sorry.
I've been...
let's be generous and say not entirely myself and focused on many other things.
You mean besides your amazing girlfriend?
Who's been beyond amazing.
Like, approaching saint status.
I would look good as a statue.
I'm serious.
I know I could not survive any of this crazy shit without you.
What?
It's her.
Angelica?
Spring of '52.
A very, very covert conference was convened at the British airbase on Cyprus.
Authorities from NATO, the Warsaw Pact, China, and the Arab League sat locked in a room debating reality.
After weeks of haggling, walk-outs, and bullying, the Biologic Preservation Organization was born.
How do you know all of this?
I was there.
I assisted Ruth El-Saadawi in drafting the initial charter and guidelines for research into sensacity.
Signatories guaranteed human rights to sensoriums and agreed not to deploy them for military needs.
That's Ruth there.
Is that you?
Handsome bugger, eh?
Where did it all go?
This is crazy cool.
It's exactly what I read in that book by the woman who started BPO.
- Ruth El-Saadawi.
- Yes.
She talked about psycellium as a morphogenic field and how it made connections like the synapses in our brain, storing them the way memories are stored.
She's the mother of this claid.
- What's a claid?
- A cluster.
Sequoias are like us, polypliotic.
- Can you still see her?
- Yeah.
She lived here.
The cabin is beautiful.
- She looks so different.
- How do you mean?
She looks happy.
Why didn't the charter just announce to the world that Homo sensoriums exist?
Look, we all know sapiens.
I mean, some of my best friends are sapiens.
When sapiens feel safe, they're the nicest people you could meet.
However, feed their inner demons, frighten them, find reasons for them to divide themselves from otherness, and then watch those selfsame sapiens drop bombs on whole cities, drive planes into buildings and happily herd millions of their own kind
into gas chambers.
And that's just what they would do to each other.
What wouldn't they do to a totally different species?
That's why Ruth herself advocated total secrecy.
Was Ms. El-Saadawi a sensate?
No, but her twin sister was.
They came from a village in Egypt.
Not long after her sister's cluster birth, she was stoned to death for immorality and witchcraft.
Ruth went from being a doctor one day to a crusader the next, and did everything she could to prevent it from happening to someone else's sister.
If she was alive today... she'd look at what BPO has become and she would weep.
Wait.
- What?
- Something's wrong.
The research might be helpful.
That's what the Nazis said!
You fucking hide out in Walden while they herd the rest of us into cattle cars.
Do you think they might be right?
I'll go to Iceland.
She's fighting with her cluster.
Be careful.
Can I ask you about one of the BPO hunters?
Do you know him?
If he's the one that's after you,
I must say, I underestimated either your recklessness or your courage.
What's his real name?
I don't know myself.
Not sure I want to know.
When our kind have nightmares about BPO, they're usually about him.
- Where do I find him?
- Huh!
I do not ken where you get your brass goolies from, but maybe I'll be able to give you what you want.
But fair warning, it comes with a price, like as not.
I'll pay it.
There's a network of us, strung out about the world.
The Archipelago, we're called.
Isolated above, but connected below.
I ask someone I know, who asks someone they know, who asks...
Well, you get the gist.
Sapiens invented Google in the 1990s.
We've had it since the Neolithic.
How long does it take?
I'm looking for Cannibal.
Get him on the phone now!
I don't know what he thinks he's doing.
This is my research, this is my project.
Tell him I'm gonna straighten him out!
I've got the answer, but I don't think you're going to like it.
I was getting nervous.
I'm all right.
I learned a lot.
About BPO and how it changed over the years.
There's someone on the inside who knows Whispers.
Did you get a name?
- Not yet.
- Why not?
Mr. Hoy said I have to go to Chicago.
But I have to go alone.
Nom!
Dr. Metzger.
I don't know what they taught you in med school, but the word "helping" doesn't mean handcuff people and chop up their brains.
Prep her for surgery.
Nomi, what have you done?
Is he in there?
What is he doing?
I told you, he's trying to destroy my work.
I love you.
You really believe that neurografting is possible?
God save us from this idiot.
All that work lost.
- What will we do now?
- I'll start over.
What happened?
I don't know.
But everything started to go wrong when Angelica went to Chicago.
[theme music playing]
I can't believe this is happening.
I cannot believe I let you do this.
- We all agreed.
- I didn't.
- We decided it was worth the risk.
- This is a mistake.
This is how amateurs get caught.
Nomi, help.
Will, it's going to be fine.
The ID held up.
In England.
Outgoing.
It is never the same as Incoming.
We're inside the TSA, watching for any alert.
[Amanita] Any better?
Unh-unh.
You're in the woods.
You barely have Wi-Fi.
- Bug's on it.
- Color the Bug totally clustered.
[Amanita] Hi, Bug.
What's up, Neets?
Can I get you anything?
Earplugs.
Okay.
I heard that.
And they're not gonna work because I'm talking inside your head.
She knows.
She didn't mean it literally.
And you know he's only freaking out because he loves you so much.
You can't do anything now.
Let's let her sleep.
Okay, dinner's ready.
Oh, we're coming.
Bug, anything happens, no matter how small, you call me.
Bug's on duty.
You know, this whole visiting thing?
It's a little like FaceTime without a phone.
Ha!
That's what I said!
- [beeping]
- Uh-oh.
What?
Wait, what?
- TSA bumped up its warning level.
- Why?
Another mass shooting.
At this point, aren't mass shootings just business as usual in America?
[sighs]
Please be careful.
I will.
Ma'am!
He's in a meeting.
This is more important.
[Rajan] ...
less humid in those countries.
[Kala] Oh, my God.
- Kala.
- I'm interrupting again.
No, no, no, no.
You've just turned an unbearably boring piece of business into another rare pleasure.
I will come back.
Mrs. Rasal, the priority is obvious here.
And Raj, I must say, you're spending too much time with me when you have a bride this beautiful right here in the very same building.
It makes me think I taught you nothing at school, my friend.
One of us has to work, Ajay.
See you later.
- Mrs. Rasal.
- [Rajan] Come, Kala.
These shipping reports have been falsified.
Everything.
Everything that the controller is approving has been doctored.
The manifests are complete lies!
My God, Kala, you are even more beautiful when you're upset.
Rajan, please.
We're shipping out old antibiotics, discontinued HIV inhibitors.
We're selling old, useless, defective, and possibly poisonous drugs to people whose lives depend on them.
I know this is not easy to hear for the first time, but this is all standard procedure.
We have to vacate our storage space.
And our profit margins, like every pharma company, depend on not wasting every drug that's slightly below standard.
You know?
This is how this business works.
We all do it.
Some of those drugs can still work.
We are selling the only kind that those people can afford.
You have to trust me.
This is the way to serve the greater good.
What if your father or what if I went to a hospital and was given improper, expired drugs?
- That won't happen.
- Why not?
Because these products are shipped to distant places.
We would never risk the lives of our own people.
Which places?
Out of India.
You know, like China or Africa, faraway places.
Like Kenya?
Could be.
Why?
Kala?
Have you seen this?
So many terrible things going on.
I used to wonder if there was something
I could do to try to change the world... before I understood such thoughts were unskilled.
Trying to change the world only leads to suffering.
All we can change is ourselves.
I'm not sure I agree.
I know.
That's why I can't help you.
You weren't sitting in that seat before, were you?
I hope one day we can visit again... when your thinking does not reflect their thinking.
No, please, talk to me.
You were at the rave.
I don't understand.
Why can't I see where you are?
You may feel gravity without knowing how it works.
There are forces acting upon every life that remain beyond our control or comprehension.
[sighs]
I think we can all agree that things were much different back then.
Oh, so different.
There were none of these mass shootings.
Oh, God.
Did you see the terrible news?
We just heard about it.
They always want to blame it on a religion, an ethnic group, or a skin color, but the one thing no one ever wants to say...
- It's always a man.
- Some fucking dude not getting any.
Violence has a gender.
Oh, my God.
I love your dads.
I find it fascinating how every generation believes in different things.
- We believed in pot.
And sex.
- [laughter]
We were Black Panthers.
- Oh, bad motherfuckers.
- Now we cook quinoa.
Oh, come on now.
You all were more interested in pussy than politics.
And what was the nice Jewish girl from Santa Barbara interested in?
I wanted to end patriarchal control over women's bodies.
"Copulation for a better nation."
By having sex with every homie in Oakland.
- By any means necessary.
- Mom!
They exaggerate, honey.
Oh, I just think it's amazing that none of you ever cared that you didn't know who her biological dad was.
Well, what can you do when this thing smiles at you?
- [Nomi] Oh, I know.
- [laughter]
We're here, we're queer!
Get used to it, get used to it!
We're here, we're queer!
Get used to it, get used to it!
- Ha!
Ha!
- [laughter]
That's the most fun I've had in my entire life.
That's what you told me once.
Joaquin, what are you doing here?
I wanted nothing to do with you.
Nothing.
And I did my best to convince them that you were beyond saving.
- They wanted to see it by themselves.
- Ay, no.
Dad, Mom... what are you doing here?
You're our daughter.
We've come to take you home.
Daddy, I'm happy here.
I want to stay.
Look what you're doing to your mother, huh?
[laughs] This?
This...
is what I was trying to explain.
They changed her.
They've made me realize that I can't be with an asshole
- that uses my face as a punching bag.
- [father] Enough!
Joaquin... get her bag.
Huh...
Want to go again... faggot?
Only if you want your ass kicked by a faggot.
Again.
Thank you.
Stop it.
I'm not going anywhere with you.
Don't be a child, Daniela.
Don't treat me like one.
Everything I built in this world, I built for you.
But if you force me,
I will cut you out of that world and I'll never look back.
I know this is hard for all three of you to understand, but I have a relationship with these two men that isn't based on threats, or control, or money.
You're not allowed to be sanctimonious when you're living off a trust fund.
Keep your money.
She doesn't need it.
Daniela, please... come home with us.
Sorry, Mom.
I am home.

So... you're the chick with the weird accent.
I am.
I didn't think he was gonna come.
I probably shouldn't be here.
Both Will and I are so grateful.
He said he was gonna explain, oh, a few little things.
Like why he just disappeared for over a fucking year without explaining shit to his best fucking friend.
D, I'm sorry.
He's very sorry.
Yeah, sure.

That's what he always orders.
[indistinct chatter]
[indistinct singing]
[woman] Five, six, seven, eight!
[Capheus] Mama?
- Ah.
Hello, my son.
- Hi, Mom.
- This is Zakia, the girl I was...
- Ah!
[laughs]
Yes, of course.
It's wonderful to finally meet you.
It's great to meet you, too.
Capheus told me about the work that you do here with the kids.
It is amazing.
These children do far much more for us than we could ever do for them.
So the school focuses on teaching kids different kinds of art?
Yes.
Art is fundamental to the development of a child's imagination.
One cannot create or achieve anything unless they imagine it first.
My son tells me that you were educated in London?
- Yes.
- What a gift.
It was.
He said that you were offered many jobs but you decided to come back home.
I know there's a lot of work to do here.
There's too much injustice, too much corruption, too much poverty.
But I love Kenya, like your son does.
My future is my country.
Which is why I am so excited about him running for office.
What?
Uh...
Mama, I've been meaning to tell you something.
I used to sit here and think so much about the future... trying to picture what my life would be like.
I never imagined anything like this.
I don't think anyone knows what life they will live.
- That's what makes life feel alive.
- Hm...
Do you think that is also true for people, and if it is, does that mean that you can never really know your own husband?
Or your own brother.
I have to admit, I'm very uncomfortable with this level of uncertainty.
No, but what is the alternative?
[Priya] Kala?
You have a visitor.
We can stay with you.
No, it's all right.
We need to talk.
- Hm?
- Hm.
So you got these different voices in your head, and one of them is Will?
- I know it sounds strange.
- [chuckles]
If he's in your head listening, does that mean he can hear everything I'm saying?
- Yeah.
- Yes.
So when I say, "Go take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut, Gorski,"
he can hear that?
Yeah.
I deserve it.
He says he deserves it.
Damn right he does.
Ask him why should I give a shit about him or his crazy-ass "I hear voices" girlfriend when he obviously doesn't give a shit about me?
Your phone is about to ring.
- Huh?
- [phone rings]
Listen, D, I'm sorry.
You can't just apologize for something like this, man.
Will you please just let me try to explain, okay?
All I'm asking for is two minutes.
I don't have two minutes for you.
Okay.
All right, that's fine.
Will you just answer me one question?
What?
How many times did the Feds or Homeland Security call you in for questioning?
I don't think I can count that high, man.
Well, you didn't tell them anything because you didn't know anything.
And that is why I couldn't call, because I know you, D.
I know how much you love being a cop.
And a big part of why I love being a cop is being in that hot stinky car every day with my best friend.
I also know my best friend is the shittiest liar I've ever met.
If you lost your job lying to protect me, you couldn't be a cop anymore.
I...
I couldn't forgive myself for that.
Part of being a best friend, man, is caring more about them than you care about a damn job.
Yeah, but you got a wife.
You got two beautiful kids.
Yeah, and they fucking miss you, too.
I miss them.
I miss you.
I miss my life.
I'm trying to get it back.
But I need your help.
Okay.
All right.
What do you want me to do?
[Rajan] You were right.
I don't say this as an excuse, but only in trying to understand it myself.
I have been working in this company since I was a child.
I packed boxes when other kids were playing football.
As soon as I understood math, my father taught me how to crunch margins.
I was raised to believe in this company the way other people believe in God.
The more devout I was, the more I sacrificed, the more I expanded my faith, then the more my god would protect me and my family.
Nothing has been more important.
And this focus has caused me to lose sight of... things that a man in my position should never lose sight of.
But I've changed everything now.
This company is going to do things differently from now on.
Kala, the look in your eyes made me see what you saw.
And I hated it, too.
You are my life.
Everything else is... belongings.
And more than anything...
I want to be the man you believed me to be.
No, no, no!
I forbid it!
Mama, I thought we were discussing it.
There's nothing to discuss.
Politics turns people into fools and fools into thugs.
Politics killed your father and it's going to kill you.
- I understand how you feel.
- Then why are we discussing it?
I don't know.
Maybe I've been looking around and seeing things that are wrong... and wondering if there is anything I can do to help fix them.
Maybe I have too much of my father in me.
Maybe I'm just as foolish as he was.
We had the very same argument.
[mother] Just tell me why.
I already said I will tell them no.
But you want to tell them yes.
I do.
[mother] Tell me why, when you know it's so dangerous.
Because we cannot escape hope.
The only hope we have of making this country a better place is if we do it ourselves.
I'm sorry.
The last thing I want to do is cause you pain.
I will tell them I have to withdraw.
You will do no such thing.
All I ask is that you remember that you are all I have left of him.
Father, I'm sorry.
If you hadn't come to the prison... if you hadn't cared about me... maybe you would still be alive.
I feel lost.
Everything I considered my home... is gone.
Every time I begin to feel I belong somewhere...
I have to leave.
I'm trapped between what I want and what I know I can't have.
Mom...
I miss you.
I measure so much of my life against one afternoon with you.
[cheering]
I'm sorry, Mama.
I lost the match.
You fought someone almost twice your age.
But I lost and made you sad.
I'm not sad, Sun.
Then why are you crying?
Mothers worry for their daughters.
I'm always afraid for you when I come to these matches.
But I'm not afraid.
I know.
That's why I'm crying.
Your teacher told me he's never seen a fighter as fearless as my daughter.
When I watch you and I see your fierce determination...
I know that your life will not be like mine... and that makes me very, very happy.
That was the day you took me to the Spring Festival.
There is much of her in you.
I was nourished by her.
But Joong-Ki was too young.
It was my duty to raise him in her place.
But I failed.
What happened was not your fault.
A lot of people never get the kind of love you got from your mother.
I certainly didn't.
But it didn't turn me into a murderer.
That may be true.
But it doesn't change the feeling inside of me.
I know feelings and emotions can overwhelm our logic, and at the same time, logic can ruin the emotions that make life worth living.
My brother killed my father because of me.
This is not a feeling.
It is a fact.
For many years after my father was killed...
I believed it was my duty to avenge him.
I stole a gun.
I imagined myself shooting the men who killed him many times.
But you never did.
No.
Why?
My mother.
Come.
Sit with me.
I want to talk to you about your father.
I asked her if she hated the men who killed him...
- and she said...
- I have no room in my heart for hate.
I don't have a mother to give such advice.
[Will] Maybe not.
But you have us.
Are you going to tell me...
I should trust in the law?
No.
My father was like your brother.
The world is better off without them.
I think I'm more confused than I was before.
[Lito] There's no easy answer, Sun.
Whatever you decide to do... just know you won't have to do it alone.
[man] I don't care where she is.
[Lito laughing]
Mr. Rodriguez, hi.
- You cut your hair!
- Excuse me.
You don't have an appointment with him.
Sir!
Did you see it?
Listen, I gotta call you back.
Did you watch it?
- Oh, yeah, I watched it.
- It has almost two million hits!
[laughs]
Oh, can you believe it?
- It is incredible.
- Lito, this is a bit awkward.
I thought your lawyer was gonna talk to you.
I know.
He said that I needed to talk to you.
Oh, he did, did he?
Okay.
Let's do this.
Before you start, I know I've been having trouble finding the right project.
- It's not that.
- I really think I needed to do this before I was ready.
Well, I wish you would have talked to us first.
Why?
Look, I'm not gonna coddle you.
This agency no longer represents you.
- What?
- Look, it has nothing to do with me.
I mean, I even fought for you.
You know, I think that what you're doing is very, you know...
It's important.
- What are you talking about?
- There are certain high-level clients here at CMA who just, you know, they just simply don't agree with your, um...
I don't know, what do you want to call it?
Your lifestyle?
- It's not a lifestyle.
- Whatever.
Look, they told management in no uncertain terms that it was either them or you.
Okay?
Who?
Look, obviously this conversation never took place, okay?
I mean, we just decided to part ways, and, you know, wish each other the best, and, uh, explore other opportunities, et cetera.
Blah, blah, blah.
You said I was your guy.
Well, you lied to us, too.
[indistinct chatter]
[elevator bell dings]
Thank you.
- Can I offer an opinion?
- [gasps]
I came alone.
I just want to talk.
That's all.
How did you know I would be here today?
Well, I didn't.
I've been here every morning before my shift.
I guessed if you did come, it would be early.
I knew it'd be important for you to visit them.
I'd have felt the same way if my father committed suicide.
My father did not commit suicide.
He was murdered.
That is a strong allegation, Ms. Bak.
It's not an allegation, it is a fact, Detective.
Do you then have evidence to prove it?
I know what my brother has done.
And I do not require you or the law to believe me.
Yeah?
Why?
Because I have seen your legal system from inside and out.
And the last thing I would expect from it is justice.
Look, Ms. Bak...
I meant what I said to your teacher, okay?
I'm on your side.
We know that your brother is not the man the media believes him to be.
We suspect a lot of illegal money is flowing through his company.
We're just not able to prove it yet.
Listen to yourself, Detective.
Is this the system you serve?
Yeah.
The law is imperfect.
I'm asking you to trust me and I swear I will protect you.
I don't need anyone's protection.
Are you sure about that?
I promised I only wanted to talk, so I'm not gonna stop you if you prefer to leave.
But... this today, may be my last chance for a rematch.
May I propose a test to your invulnerability, Ms. Bak?
- [scoffs]
- A quick spar.
If you win, you leave as you wish.
But if I win... you come with me and tell your story on the record.
If you're not going to stop me, I have no need to fight you.
No, you don't need to.
But I am hoping you want to.
I have thought about our fight at Mrs. Cho's apartment.
A lot.
I haven't thought about it at all.
[exhales]
All right.
Show me what you've learned, Detective.
When was the last time you lost a fight, Ms. Bak?
I can't remember.
I remember that move from your fight with King Kong Kim.
He was the best fighter from our dojo and you just cut him down like you were chopping a tree.
Like that?
Exactly like that.
Had enough?
No, Ms. Bak.
Oh, no.
You're thinking too much, Detective.
My teacher says the same thing.
[sighs]
After I lost an important match, he told me that I worry too much about what I should or shouldn't do.
He says fighting is not something you do with your head, it's something you do with your heart.
You agree with him, Ms. Bak?
I think you will profit by spending more time with your teacher and less time pestering me.
But this is much more fun.
Come on.
Let's go.
I think I know why you never remember your fights.
You're not fighting a person.
You're fighting something else.
You used a false identity to fight because of your father.
I think he refused to see you... to understand how special you are.
Ah!
[both grunt]
You have improved, Detective.
It was almost a year ago you kissed me right here.
Riley, I, uh...
I, uh...
I know I've been acting... crazy lately.
I don't mean to be.
- I know.
- It's just...
I've never loved anyone, anyone... the way that I love you.
I promise I will come back to you.
It's the waiting that's the hard part.
- I know.
- It's, uh...
Do you think it's gonna be much longer?
No.
It could be tomorrow...
it could be next week.
Or it could be right now.
Which it so happens it is.
He's here?
The Archipelago has spoken.
I've been given an address.
You must go there.
You must go now.
- Oh!
What?
Whispers.
Where?
- Oh!
Sorry.
Sorry.
So sorry.
But you are gonna freak out, too.
- What?
- I couldn't sleep.
I was curious about the shooting everyone's been talking about.
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.
And one of the people killed was this
British politician, Mitchell Taylor.
He was giving a speech when it happened.
This is not out of some woolly desire to sit in a circle and sing Lennon's "Imagine."
This is to remind people that free societies... are stronger societies.
- Is he speaking at a mosque?
- Uh-huh.
Is he Muslim?
No.
It was some kind of peace congregation with all kinds of people,
Jews, Muslims, Christians, Atheists.
Since the invention of cities, open, multicultural societies are the places that the world's best and brightest have wanted to go to, while mono-cultural, repressive societies are the places they've wanted to escape from.
[screaming]
Oh, my God.
Oh, those poor people.
[Amanita] It's horrible.
What happened to the killer?
He tries to shoot himself.
How much better would the world be if these guys would just start with themselves?
Right?
But look, just before he shoots.
Good.
They caught him.
Yeah.
But the whole thing seemed so sad.
I mean, this guy Taylor trying to do something about our fear of otherness, then I got drawn in.
I started reading all of his tweets, and posts, and interviews, and I was thinking how the Internet is a kind of psycellium, like what you experienced in the woods with Angelica, where memories and moments of our lives exist beyond us... when I saw this...
[Nomi] Ruth El-Saadawi?
Freaky enough?
Then I started thinking like you're thinking, maybe a coincidence is not a coincidence, when my phone pinged and I screamed.
They put the killer in jail, but they didn't release his identity until now.
Todd.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, no.
Of course.
You gotta be shitting me.
Come on.
Riley.
Okay, I'm officially creeped out.
I don't like this, Riles.
We'll find another way to get to Whispers.
Will!
Riley!
I know why Whispers has been missing.
He's been trapped in prison.
He Bolgered Todd and used him to murder a politician named Mitchell Taylor.
Holy shit.
The church?
Why?
This is where the meeting is supposed to be.
Okay, this is getting weirder and weirder.
Riley?
Oh, my God.
- He said I had to go down the stairs.
- Who did?
Mr. Hoy.
If you want my professional police opinion,
I say there's no way in hell I'd go down there.
Yes, thank you.
Especially because if this was a movie, this would be the scene where the funny but annoying sidekick gets whacked.
He said I have to go alone.
Well, that solves my problem.
- I'll be in the car.
- D!
Will, BPO doesn't work like this.
This is someone who's very frightened.
And if I was gonna do what they're about to do, then I'd be scared, too.
I did a scene like this in Forgive Us Our Trespasses.
What happened?
Everyone died.
Not helpful.
No.
It is a test.
They need to know that I'm alone.
No.
Five minutes.
In five minutes, I send in Diego.
I needed to know how far you would go.
I needed to know if I could trust you.
I understand.
It's strange to finally meet.
In a way, you and your cluster exist because of me.
You work with Professor Kolovi.
You helped Angelica escape.
We both realized she was going to birth another cluster.
After what happened to her first...
I knew she would die before she let that happen again.
Why here?
Angelica heard me singing one day and asked where I'd learned.
And I told her about this church.
It was her idea to come here.
Why did Angelica work with BPO?
She was searching for her children.
What happened to them?
None of us fully realized how fast BPO was changing.
When I first started, it was very, very different.
Dr. El-Saadawi was a visionary.
I met her at Stanford.
And the work I did with her felt like something... sacred.
When she died, I hoped Professor
Kolovi would continue what she began.
I don't know.
Maybe he believed in her work once, but... not now.
Not since he met Dr. Milton Bailey Brandt.
That's the first name I knew him by.
When he came to the university, he had research, data on the development of the sensorium frontal lobe that we were all desperate for.
Of course, we all suspected how he came about this information, but nobody wanted to ask.
But still, Brandt never would have solved the problems of the neural graft without Angelica.
Neural graft?
It's mimics the connection of a cluster, overriding the consciousness of one sensorium onto another.
Why?
I'm an academic.
Even when I heard you coming down the stairs,
I wasn't sure I would be able to go through with this.
But I know what happened in New York.
When I watched those poor, innocent people killed...
If it's within our power to keep something that terrible from happening... shouldn't we?
Do you know what Angelica called Brandt?
Whispers.
She told me, the voice in your head that tells you to cut your wrists, or to take a handful of pills, or to jump from a height... that voice never shouts.
It only whispers.
Thank you.
He sleeps on blockers.
I couldn't reach him a few hours ago.
So you don't know for certain if he's in there?
No.
Every moment we stand here, he could wake.
She's right.
This is it.
Are you really ready to kill a man in cold blood?
Jonas?
Hello, Will.
Is it true?
Jonas is dead.
What do we do now?
- Yes?
- My name is Koman Nyagah.
I'm head of the Kenyan Democratic Reform Party.
May we have a word?
We are tired.
We're tired of bosses, thieves and thugs.
- We're tired of corruption.
- It's endemic, systemic.
We can no longer ignore the injustice.
- We want to end it.
- We need your help.
- We want to fight.
- Just as Van Damn would.
We want you to run for office.
Did Jela put you up to this?
No, my friend.
This is not a prank.
- We're dead serious.
- We saw you on Kobi Kihara.
- You were amazing.
- We believe that with your help, we can effect some real meaningful change here.
And what do you know about here?
Are you from Kibera?
I thought not.
I think you should leave before my mother returns.
I'm not from here.
But I don't need to be to see the unfairness, the injustice.
Please, just give our proposal some thought.
I'm not a politician.
We're not looking for a politician.
We're looking for a leader.
Welcome home.
And you can probably taste a few new spices.
Trying it out to see if customers like it.
Try.
Try this one.
Hmm...
Tastes good.
I've added a little bit of saffron and, uh, some... black spiders.
Some shoe leather.
So good.
And a pinch of horse shit.
- My favorite.
- Your favorite?
Hmm?
You can taste it?
Sorry.
You want to talk about it?
I would, but there's nothing to talk about.
Everything's perfect.
My...
My house, my job, my husband...
Your bodyguard.
A very small price to pay for all of this good fortune.
- A-ha!
- What?
Here's a connection.
The manufacturer of Angelica's equipment.
How did you get that?
The photos Lito sent from Raoul's room.
God, you're smart.
Abrasax Electronics, still in business, and still supplying technology to guess-what-school's R and D lab?
University of Chicago.
Which could mean the research Angelica was doing at the cabin she took with her to Whispers and Kolovi.
- But why would she help them?
- Angels!
I bring glad tidings.
I have the solution... to your problem.
Oh, which one?
The one that brought you to Chateau Bug in the middle of the night.
Bendix.
Ugh!
The cops are never gonna leave us alone.
True.
As long as you're alive, yes.
But they'd stop pretty quick if you were dead, wouldn't they?
- What are you talking about, Bug?
- I'm talking E-Death.
But E-Death is just a rumor.
It's real.
Though I use that word cautiously in this post-Homo sensorium relativity of realities.
What's E-Death?
Supposedly something cooked up by the NSA and CIA...
It's a redaction protocol.
They use it when someone's been renditioned or black-sited and they want zero accountability.
- Bug...
- I've seen it, buddy.
They erase warrants, records, anything that might make one agency trip over another one.
They just go poof.
And so do you.
If you can do this, why haven't you?
I didn't say I could do it, but I just reached out to the guy that can.
What guy?
Not just any guy.
The guy.
Okay, can we stop with the whole pregnant pause-y thing?
Right.
Sorry.
Right.
Okay.
I'll set it.
Up.
Sometimes all my good fortune makes we wonder whether I'm actually appreciating it enough.
And if I'm honest, I have to admit that, no, I'm not sure I am.
Which then makes me think that there must be some flaw in my personality or my brain chemistry, which means I just have to get used to the fact that no matter what happens, I'm never going to be a person
who can ever just... feel happy.
No, that's not true.
Few children in the world ever smiled as easily as my daughter did.
What happened to that girl?
Do you remember the doll you wanted so badly on your birthday?
Uh, it had red hair.
Anna.
God, how you prayed and prayed for that doll.
On your birthday, the whole family had come over.
There was this huge pile of presents on the table, but none of that mattered.
It was like you had this x-ray vision.
You went straight to it, ripped it open and that was it.
Party over.
I loved that doll.
As adults, we learn to carefully open all the rest of the presents.
We are taught to smile and to pretend that all are equally important to us.
But our heart... always knows the truth.
But what if the truth is something that can cause people to feel unhappy or... or disappointed or... hurt?
There are times I wish I could go back to being that little girl.
My life was much easier then.
But I'm a woman now, and part of being a woman is understanding that hearts are complicated things.
They are.
They are indeed.
What you need is a good meal.
Come.
Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now be making a short stop.
Buy some peanuts, stretch your legs, admire the view, drink in this wonderful morning.
We'll be leaving in 15 minutes.
Good?
I guess so.
Hello.
I would like to go to NTV.
Turn it up.
Your sister has murdered three more people.
Do you care to comment?
It's just, uh...
I just wish people could know my sister the way I know her.
It's very hard to connect these terrible crimes with the person I thought of as my big sister.
If your big sister is listening, what would you like to say to her?
Big sister... please, do the right thing.
Please turn yourself in before anyone else gets hurt.
Sorry.
If you didn't, I would have.
Come, let's get you back where you belong.
I would like to speak with a journalist, Miss Zakia Asalache.
Please.
You're Van Damn, isn't it?
Your interview was amazing.
Hey.
The one and only Kung Fu King of Kibera.
Vanquisher of crime lords.
- Provider of water to the thirsty masses.
- And Internet viral sensation.
Though, I'll be honest, that speech of yours sounded suspiciously like Zakia herself.
Yeah, come on, Van Damn.
Your secret is safe with us.
Zakia invented you, didn't she?
Invented me?
She may have come up with the story, but there's no way she came up with that jacket.
- That's definitely authentic.
- You mean antique.
Yeah, I'm guessing early Bronze Age.
Last worn during the reign of Seyyid Said.
I don't know you and I'm sorry if you have a problem with me.
It's not us who have the problem, if you're interested in Zakia Asalache.
- Yeah.
- Why?
Do we tell him the truth?
A bit of a sordid tale here, but when Zakia was studying in London, a story broke out that she preferred lunchboxes to baguettes.
I'm sorry...
She'd rather slurp on a mango than chomp on a banana.
You know, she prefers pussies to puppies.
- Dude, she likes girls.
- It was a huge scandal for the family.
You know, her father's a serious muckety-muck.
All we're saying is...
If you've got a dick in those pants, you've got no chance, bro.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Miss Zakia is in meetings all day and cannot be disturbed.
I'm sorry.
- Stop.
- Could you let her know that...
No, never mind.
Thank you.
Oh!
Are you okay?
Prison was good for you.
Tell me you have a war plan.
I have no plan.
I have an enemy.
And I won't stop until he's dead.
Or I am.
Good plan.
Good morning, Will.
I love watching a woman wake.
A glimpse of her innocence before she begins assembling herself.
Riley.
Is he here?
True beauty is in that moment of vulnerability.
- I have the blockers.
- Yeah.
You won't need them.
This isn't a trick, Will.
That game's over for me.
Thanks to you,
I have the most secure position I've ever had in the organization.
Then what do you want?
I was hoping we could be honest with each other.
I guess it's safe to say you're in London.
When I did my PhD in medicine, I came here for the first time.
I'm in awe of this building.
As much a work of art as it is a fortress.
Soaring, beautiful vertical lines.
The style is called Perpendicular Gothic, widely used after the Black Plague destroyed much of Europe.
Is this gonna be on the test?
The Black Plague revealed our vulnerabilities and it terrified people.
So what did they do?
They built temples to the immortal like this.
Vertical lines descend from heaven, with all the might of the Lord bearing down on a single point until it is utterly and irrevocably crushed.
Let me guess...
I'm that single point.
No.
I am.
I don't expect you to understand me or my work.
Another misunderstood psychopath.
I am trying to engineer a future with a species that is more violent, intolerant and possessive than any species in the history of this planet.
Sapiens live in a world designed by their worst fears.
And nothing terrifies them like difference.
You save your fucking justifications.
You murdered an innocent girl.
I know you killed Sara Patrell.
Who?
There will always be unfortunate necessities during the construction of a monument such as this.
I thought a cop would understand that.
Angelica did.
She saw our work as the key to the future for both our species.
This building is a symbol.
Its powerful vertical lines are the assurance of authority.
She believed in what we were doing as much as I did.
Then why did she put a gun in her mouth and blow her brains out?
Why do soldiers kill themselves?
Or cops?
People who bear the full weight of the truth sometimes break, Will.
Angelica broke.
Just like one day you or I might break.
But then you know all about breaking, don't you?
You watched it happen to your father, day after day... though he chose booze instead of a bullet.
Let me show you what I know about breaking.
Will.
Are you okay?
These extremists won't be happy until they've dragged the entire world back to Dark Ages.
I'm not sure that's what they're after, but I do take your point.
Maybe we should just discuss a more pleasant subject.
- Good point.
- Mm.
- This Banjari Gosht is incredible.
- Yes, it's wonderful.
The balance between spice and masala...
Sanyam, you've totally outdone yourself.
- Thank you.
- If you don't mind...
Sanyam, do you understand the kind of the future world these terrorists hope to build with their bombs?
It's not for me to speak for them.
Well, somebody should.
Somebody should because they themselves obviously can't speak any other language besides violence.
Maybe that was the language that was taught to them.
Oh...
Don't tell me you're one of those liberals who really believes these psychopaths who murder innocent civilians,
- they themselves are the victims.
- No, no, no.
I'm one of those silly people who believe that if you kill someone, you should be tried for it, whether you're a psychopath, a policeman or a president.
You're worse than a liberal.
Oh, Daya, may I have some of the Dal?
Dad, the Dal... phenomenal.
One second, one second.
Hold on, hold on.
Let me ask you something, Manendra.
As a government insider, tell me, since the British left, the structure of power, the distribution of wealth, these things remain almost identical.
And sometimes, I ask myself... why?
Maybe a man as smart as you can finally answer this question for me.
You know, I think I'll have a bit more Dal myself.
Yes, yes.
It's very good, right?
- Really, I'm having so much of the Dal.
- Mm.
Try some, Father?
In my humble opinion, Sanyam, societies remain unchanged because the human beings remain unchanged.
Not everyone is born to be a great leader, just as not everybody's born to be a cook.
Okay, I see.
Well, spending a lifetime in the kitchen learning how to cook was my destiny, just as inheriting a fortune was yours.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Look at the time!
The conversation has been so stimulating that the evening has just flown by.
- Yeah.
You have a meeting.
- I have a meeting, yes.
I don't know about the rest of you, but Kala and I are really beginning to love these family dinners.
Best part of the week.
- Sadly, we have to head home now.
- Yeah.
- Bye.
- Good evening.
Bye, Mum.
Bye.
Mm?
This one...
This one's not bad.
- How many pages?
- Nine.
But it's good.
It's the hero's brother.
- Let me guess, the sensitive brother.
- Lifelong bachelor.
- But at least he doesn't die from AIDS.
- So he does die.
Drug overdose.
I don't know.
It's still a notch up from...
"serial killer who talks with a soft lisp and wears mascara."
You think that's bad?
Listen to this.
"The Hispanic coke dealer is about to give another kind of blow job when he finally gets the bullet he deserves."
I told you.
I told you.
This is it.
This is how careers end.
You either take the roles you hate or you sit at home
- until you're completely forgotten.
- Lito, you're not gonna be forgotten.
Your films are so good and you have so many fans.
Had.
I had fans, Dani.
- Look at my Twitter feed.
- Hey, you promised no social media.
But it's evidence.
It's evidence, Hernando.
It proves no one wants anything to do with me.
Well, that is not true.
Somebody wants you and here's the proof.
An all-expenses-paid trip to São Paulo.
São Paulo?
I've never been.
- Is it an offer?
- Yes.
Is it a...
Is it a movie offer?
As the grand master of the São Paulo Gay Pride parade.
- Oh, my God!
That's amazing!
- Come on, guys.
What?
What?
Last year they had over five million people.
- Are you serious?
- It sounds so fun.
Come on, Lito.
You have to go.
Maybe this is just what you need.
To remember how many people are affected by what you did.
Yeah, great idea.
Then El Tempo can publish pictures of me with five million people in thongs, leather and feathers.
I can't wait for the scripts we get after that.
Family, please, try to understand what is happening here.
I've been typecast.
This is prison for an actor.
I'm trapped here not because of what I did, but because of who I am.
This is painful enough to think about.
But worse... is facing the idea that...
there may be no way out of it.
What the fuck?
What?
It's Lito.
What the fuck?
You know Lito Rodriguez?
He's in my cluster.
Lito Rodriguez...
is one of the voices in your head?
- Shh!
Bug!
- Right.
Sorry.
Shh!
All good.
I've seen this film, like, ten times.
Okay.
The Bug does not do fanboy, but if you wanted, you could tell him, you know, nice work.
Really?
- Tell him yourself.
- What?
He's sitting right there.
Holy shit.
Be cool, Bug.
Perdón?
Major honor, Mr. Rodriguez.
Thank you.
You speak Spanish?
The language of love is the Bug's native tongue.
I thought that was French.
Love this part.
"No more lies."
- "No more lies!"
- No more lies!
Always gets me.
This is where it belongs.
This is it.
Mm.
I love it.
Ah!
The light of my life.
- You remember Ajay.
- Of course.
Ajay is laying out the plans for the new tower.
21st Century India.
And we are building it right here.
Yeah.
Very impressive.
- You texted?
- I did.
Um, excuse us, please.
- I'll be back.
- My office.
Could be up there someday.
Now, how can I help?
I wanted to go over the reports.
I'm finding inconsistencies between our drug samples and the quality reports, and I'm very confused by some of the data from the controller general.
I wouldn't really stress out about it.
I mean, all the CG really wants from us is for us to say that we are doing the best we can.
I've been through it a million times with the lawyers.
Really.
I mean, these reports are mostly done for the sake of appearances.
- But...
- What matters is that we ship on time.
Our clients are depending on us, as I am depending on you.
Come, let's go.
So, Bug, where is he?
Who?
You said we were meeting your guy here.
Not my guy, the guy.
Well, where is he?
Etvoilà.
I'm the guy.
- Holy shit.
- Shh!
Be cool.
Hello, Nomi Marks.
You know who I am?
We've had our eyes on you.
That's kind of cool and kind of creepy.
Yeah, it sounded a little stalkery.
Didn't mean it like that.
What did you mean?
Bug's been a bud for a while.
We know what you did for him.
When he told us about your troubles, we looked into it, shall we say...
anonymously.
- And what did you find?
- How many languages do you speak?
Seven.
And, you know, some shitty French from high school.
You're Homo sensorium.
You know about us?
Anyone that's interested in the truth knows about Homo sensorium.
And those three unpleasant letters.
BPO.
Who are they?
Another secret security organization that needs to be taken down.
- How?
- We don't know.
They have more money and more autonomy than any other group we've come across.
But ultimately, all that power testifies to one thing.
- What?
- How afraid they are of people like you.
Right now, all we can offer you is a little... invisibility.
E-Death.
If you accept this offer, there may come a day when we ask something of you.
What?
Nothing venal, vile or vainglorious.
Rather a vital vertex of virtue, valor and virtuosity in the name of veracity.
Wow.
Did you just come up with that yourself?
- No.
There's an app for it.
- Ah.
Hello?
Fuchs?
Anybody home?
Felix?
Hello?
Where the fuck is everybody?
Pretty, isn't it?
Where's Fuchs?
Shanghai.
So there was no meeting.
I thought it was time for us to get to know each other a little better.
What do you want from me?
Am I being too subtle?
- Playing hard to get?
- I'm not interested in playing at all.
Wolfgang, I'm sorry I lied about the Fuchs meeting, but it's getting very complicated.
You know what's going on, don't you?
Fuchs left town.
You're following Volker.
It's not rocket science.
He's going after the other kings.
That's his choice.
Maybe it will work out for Sebastian, maybe it won't.
What I'm going to make sure is that it works out for me.
Hm.
- And maybe...
- Me.
It's been a while since I've met one of us as tempting as you.
I told you, I'm not interested.
You might not want to admit it...
but we need each other.
You're wrong.
I don't need anyone.
Hello.
Mun.
From Seoul Metropolitan Police.
I was hoping to talk to you about Sun Bak.
Hope is undiscovered disappointment.
I hope to keep her alive.
Do you?
- Come on.
- Thank you.
You, uh...
Oh, thank you.
You know her well, don't you?
I was her teacher.
When I was a young man, I fought her once.
But she used a different name.
Her father did not approve of women fighting.
Ah.
I was stupid like him, too.
I was cocky.
And then she kicked my ass.
She did that a lot.
I never forgot it.
But I became better because of her, though.
Many people have made up their mind about Ms. Bak, and I was wondering about you.
Do you think she has done all the things that she's been accused of?
The person I trained?
The person I know?
This is not the same person the TV talks about.
Just between the two of us, something stinks in the story of her escape.
For some reason, the security camera covering her cell was out, as was the one in the laundry hall.
And the guards, they were not from the prison.
They came from Seoul.
Mm.
The tea is still warm.
Did you just have a guest?
A friend.
I figured.
Ms. Bak, I think, could use a friend.
Look, what she's trying to do, as good as she is...
she cannot do alone.
Thanks for the tea.
- How long will it take?
- I don't know.
I never redacted anyone before.
Uh-oh.
What was that?
- Oh, my God.
- What?
I alarmed the police reports on you and...
Jesus.
- What?
- They're gone.
BOLO's gone, wants and warrants gone, person of interest gone.
Shit.
It's official.
I'm dead.
Hello.
It's good to see you.
Good to see you, too.
Tequila?
- Please.
- Squared?
Cubed.
Eight?
Eight.
I've been hoping you would come back, so I could say thank you.
Why?
When you burst in here the last time, you were so full of fire and with a sense of fearlessness.
And then you kissed me and...
Well, let's just say I was... inspired.
I got home that night and I proposed to my boyfriend, and we got married.
That's my Pepe there.
Hello, Pepe.
How are you?
We had the best year of our lives.
But I know I would have never been brave enough to do it... without that kiss.
Courage.
It is contagious.
Well, the drink's on us.
Thank you.
He's right.
Nothing changes if we keep playing it safe.
Look at me.
Look at us.
We're hiding in holes.
Whispers has turned me into a fugitive.
He's got me acting like one and thinking like one.
I'm not.
I'm a cop.
A fugitive runs because he's alone.
A cop knows he's not.
Whispers showed me something.
Something I've been missing.
It's the scale of this fight.
Why does BPO have so many resources?
It has to be because there is a lot more of us out there than we thought.
- We need...
- ...to find them.
Vincent, this is Riley.
We risked so much to get you free, Riley.
It seems very dangerous to me, exposing ourselves like this.
Vincent offered us protection.
Guys, are we really going to put our lives in the hands of someone like Vincent?
What do you mean someone like Vincent?
- Someone who...
- Doesn't like his movies.
Nah.
Nah.
Well, I mean, taste in movies says a lot about someone.
Sun?
You can't win a fight protecting yourself.
Nomi?
A coded media alert can make it almost impossible for cops to respond fast enough.
Not just the plan.
What do you think about the risk itself?
Your life is either defined by the system... or by the way you defy the system.
Wolfgang?
Fear never fixed anything.
To courage.
The one and only Riley Blue!
Uh... hi.
I don't usually talk up here.
But I need to say something I should have said a year ago.
I wasted a lot of my life with my eyes looking down.
Afraid of anything beyond the next step.
And then something happened to me.
Someone reminded me to look up.
And I wanted to tell that someone thank you.
I wanted to tell you that I love you.
I love you.
Tonight, I want everyone in this room to know... that I see you.
I believe in you.
And as long as we're together...
I know that there's nothing we can't do.
Holy shit!
This was careless, Will.
No.
This was amazing.
- The cops are coming.
- Cops are coming.
We gotta get her out.
See you soon, Milt.
- Sorry, love.
Fun's over.
- He's the club owner.
Come on.
- Gotta go.
- Cops are coming.
Gotta go!
Gotta go!
Oh!
No!
You idiots!
No!
Outside!
Outside!
I can't believe this is happening.
I cannot believe I let you do this.
- We all agreed.
- I didn't.
- We decided it was worth the risk.
- This is a mistake.
This is how amateurs get caught.
Nomi, help.
Will, it's going to be fine.
The ID held up.
In England.
Outgoing.
It is never the same as Incoming.
We're inside the TSA, watching for any alert.
Any better?
Unh-unh.
You're in the woods.
You barely have Wi-Fi.
- Bug's on it.
- Color the Bug totally clustered.
Hi, Bug.
What's up, Neets?
Can I get you anything?
Earplugs.
Okay.
I heard that.
And they're not gonna work because I'm talking inside your head.
She knows.
She didn't mean it literally.
And you know he's only freaking out because he loves you so much.
You can't do anything now.
Let's let her sleep.
Okay, dinner's ready.
Oh, we're coming.
Bug, anything happens, no matter how small, you call me.
Bug's on duty.
You know, this whole visiting thing?
It's a little like FaceTime without a phone.
Ha!
That's what I said!
Uh-oh.
What?
Wait, what?
- TSA bumped up its warning level.
- Why?
Another mass shooting.
At this point, aren't mass shootings just business as usual in America?
Please be careful.
I will.
Ma'am!
He's in a meeting.
This is more important.
...less humid in those countries.
Oh, my God.
- Kala.
- I'm interrupting again.
No, no, no, no.
You've just turned an unbearably boring piece of business into another rare pleasure.
I will come back.
Mrs. Rasal, the priority is obvious here.
And Raj, I must say, you're spending too much time with me when you have a bride this beautiful right here in the very same building.
It makes me think I taught you nothing at school, my friend.
One of us has to work, Ajay.
See you later.
- Mrs. Rasal.
- Come, Kala.
These shipping reports have been falsified.
Everything.
Everything that the controller is approving has been doctored.
The manifests are complete lies!
My God, Kala, you are even more beautiful when you're upset.
Rajan, please.
We're shipping out old antibiotics, discontinued HIV inhibitors.
We're selling old, useless, defective, and possibly poisonous drugs to people whose lives depend on them.
I know this is not easy to hear for the first time, but this is all standard procedure.
We have to vacate our storage space.
And our profit margins, like every pharma company, depend on not wasting every drug that's slightly below standard.
You know?
This is how this business works.
We all do it.
Some of those drugs can still work.
We are selling the only kind that those people can afford.
You have to trust me.
This is the way to serve the greater good.
What if your father or what if I went to a hospital and was given improper, expired drugs?
- That won't happen.
- Why not?
Because these products are shipped to distant places.
We would never risk the lives of our own people.
Which places?
Out of India.
You know, like China or Africa, faraway places.
Like Kenya?
Could be.
Why?
Kala?
Have you seen this?
So many terrible things going on.
I used to wonder if there was something
I could do to try to change the world... before I understood such thoughts were unskilled.
Trying to change the world only leads to suffering.
All we can change is ourselves.
I'm not sure I agree.
I know.
That's why I can't help you.
You weren't sitting in that seat before, were you?
I hope one day we can visit again... when your thinking does not reflect their thinking.
No, please, talk to me.
You were at the rave.
I don't understand.
Why can't I see where you are?
You may feel gravity without knowing how it works.
There are forces acting upon every life that remain beyond our control or comprehension.
I think we can all agree that things were much different back then.
Oh, so different.
There were none of these mass shootings.
Oh, God.
Did you see the terrible news?
We just heard about it.
They always want to blame it on a religion, an ethnic group, or a skin color, but the one thing no one ever wants to say...
- It's always a man.
- Some fucking dude not getting any.
Violence has a gender.
Oh, my God.
I love your dads.
I find it fascinating how every generation believes in different things.
We believed in pot.
And sex.
We were Black Panthers.
- Oh, bad motherfuckers.
- Now we cook quinoa.
Oh, come on now.
You all were more interested in pussy than politics.
And what was the nice Jewish girl from Santa Barbara interested in?
I wanted to end patriarchal control over women's bodies.
"Copulation for a better nation."
By having sex with every homie in Oakland.
- By any means necessary.
- Mom!
They exaggerate, honey.
Oh, I just think it's amazing that none of you ever cared that you didn't know who her biological dad was.
Well, what can you do when this thing smiles at you?
Oh, I know.
We're here, we're queer!
Get used to it, get used to it!
We're here, we're queer!
Get used to it, get used to it!
Ha!
Ha!
That's the most fun I've had in my entire life.
That's what you told me once.
Joaquin, what are you doing here?
I wanted nothing to do with you.
Nothing.
And I did my best to convince them that you were beyond saving.
- They wanted to see it by themselves.
- Ay, no.
Dad, Mom... what are you doing here?
You're our daughter.
We've come to take you home.
Daddy, I'm happy here.
I want to stay.
Look what you're doing to your mother, huh?
This?
This...
is what I was trying to explain.
They changed her.
They've made me realize that I can't be with an asshole
- that uses my face as a punching bag.
- Enough!
Joaquin... get her bag.
Huh...
Want to go again... faggot?
Only if you want your ass kicked by a faggot.
Again.
Thank you.
Stop it.
I'm not going anywhere with you.
Don't be a child, Daniela.
Don't treat me like one.
Everything I built in this world, I built for you.
But if you force me,
I will cut you out of that world and I'll never look back.
I know this is hard for all three of you to understand, but I have a relationship with these two men that isn't based on threats, or control, or money.
You're not allowed to be sanctimonious when you're living off a trust fund.
Keep your money.
She doesn't need it.
Daniela, please... come home with us.
Sorry, Mom.
I am home.
I'm home.
Hey!
Whoo-hoo!
- Hi.
- One sec.
- Is it Will again?
- Yeah.
Listen, I just want to know what the plan is in case the ID doesn't work out.
I'm telling you, it's the best one I've ever done.
And by the way, how do you know so much about fake IDs?
Every trans person needs a new ID.
And when the government makes them too hard to get, I make it easy.
She's not through yet.
It'll be fine.
I know you feel we can trust Hoy, but if I were BPO, I would be waiting for you here.
If they know I'm here, I don't think it will be because of Hoy.
Someone's following me.
Excuse me.
Diego!
God, you're a sight for sore eyes.
So... you're the chick with the weird accent.
I am.
I didn't think he was gonna come.
I probably shouldn't be here.
Both Will and I are so grateful.
He said he was gonna explain, oh, a few little things.
Like why he just disappeared for over a fucking year without explaining shit to his best fucking friend.
D, I'm sorry.
He's very sorry.
Yeah, sure.
You know what?
I don't know why I'm complaining to you.
Not like he can hear me, right?
Come on.
Oh, my God.
Really?
Makes sense.
What does?
Coming here.
You know Superdawg?
Whenever he gets nervous, he needs to eat.
I gotta get something to eat.
You want anything?
I'm okay.
I really miss the malts.
Actually, I'll try a malt.
That's what he always orders.
Five, six, seven, eight!
Mama?
- Ah.
Hello, my son.
- Hi, Mom.
- This is Zakia, the girl I was...
- Ah!
Yes, of course.
It's wonderful to finally meet you.
It's great to meet you, too.
Capheus told me about the work that you do here with the kids.
It is amazing.
These children do far much more for us than we could ever do for them.
So the school focuses on teaching kids different kinds of art?
Yes.
Art is fundamental to the development of a child's imagination.
One cannot create or achieve anything unless they imagine it first.
My son tells me that you were educated in London?
- Yes.
- What a gift.
It was.
He said that you were offered many jobs but you decided to come back home.
I know there's a lot of work to do here.
There's too much injustice, too much corruption, too much poverty.
But I love Kenya, like your son does.
My future is my country.
Which is why I am so excited about him running for office.
What?
Uh...
Mama, I've been meaning to tell you something.
I used to sit here and think so much about the future... trying to picture what my life would be like.
I never imagined anything like this.
I don't think anyone knows what life they will live.
- That's what makes life feel alive.
- Hm...
Do you think that is also true for people, and if it is, does that mean that you can never really know your own husband?
Or your own brother.
I have to admit, I'm very uncomfortable with this level of uncertainty.
No, but what is the alternative?
Kala?
You have a visitor.
We can stay with you.
No, it's all right.
We need to talk.
- Hm?
- Hm.
So you got these different voices in your head, and one of them is Will?
I know it sounds strange.
If he's in your head listening, does that mean he can hear everything I'm saying?
- Yeah.
- Yes.
So when I say, "Go take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut, Gorski,"
he can hear that?
Yeah.
I deserve it.
He says he deserves it.
Damn right he does.
Ask him why should I give a shit about him or his crazy-ass "I hear voices" girlfriend when he obviously doesn't give a shit about me?
Your phone is about to ring.
Huh?
Listen, D, I'm sorry.
You can't just apologize for something like this, man.
Will you please just let me try to explain, okay?
All I'm asking for is two minutes.
I don't have two minutes for you.
Okay.
All right, that's fine.
Will you just answer me one question?
What?
How many times did the Feds or Homeland Security call you in for questioning?
I don't think I can count that high, man.
Well, you didn't tell them anything because you didn't know anything.
And that is why I couldn't call, because I know you, D.
I know how much you love being a cop.
And a big part of why I love being a cop is being in that hot stinky car every day with my best friend.
I also know my best friend is the shittiest liar I've ever met.
If you lost your job lying to protect me, you couldn't be a cop anymore.
I...
I couldn't forgive myself for that.
Part of being a best friend, man, is caring more about them than you care about a damn job.
Yeah, but you got a wife.
You got two beautiful kids.
Yeah, and they fucking miss you, too.
I miss them.
I miss you.
I miss my life.
I'm trying to get it back.
But I need your help.
Okay.
All right.
What do you want me to do?
You were right.
I don't say this as an excuse, but only in trying to understand it myself.
I have been working in this company since I was a child.
I packed boxes when other kids were playing football.
As soon as I understood math, my father taught me how to crunch margins.
I was raised to believe in this company the way other people believe in God.
The more devout I was, the more I sacrificed, the more I expanded my faith, then the more my god would protect me and my family.
Nothing has been more important.
And this focus has caused me to lose sight of... things that a man in my position should never lose sight of.
But I've changed everything now.
This company is going to do things differently from now on.
Kala, the look in your eyes made me see what you saw.
And I hated it, too.
You are my life.
Everything else is... belongings.
And more than anything...
I want to be the man you believed me to be.
No, no, no!
I forbid it!
Mama, I thought we were discussing it.
There's nothing to discuss.
Politics turns people into fools and fools into thugs.
Politics killed your father and it's going to kill you.
- I understand how you feel.
- Then why are we discussing it?
I don't know.
Maybe I've been looking around and seeing things that are wrong... and wondering if there is anything I can do to help fix them.
Maybe I have too much of my father in me.
Maybe I'm just as foolish as he was.
We had the very same argument.
Just tell me why.
I already said I will tell them no.
But you want to tell them yes.
I do.
Tell me why, when you know it's so dangerous.
Because we cannot escape hope.
The only hope we have of making this country a better place is if we do it ourselves.
I'm sorry.
The last thing I want to do is cause you pain.
I will tell them I have to withdraw.
You will do no such thing.
All I ask is that you remember that you are all I have left of him.
Father, I'm sorry.
If you hadn't come to the prison... if you hadn't cared about me... maybe you would still be alive.
I feel lost.
Everything I considered my home... is gone.
Every time I begin to feel I belong somewhere...
I have to leave.
I'm trapped between what I want and what I know I can't have.
Mom...
I miss you.
I measure so much of my life against one afternoon with you.
I'm sorry, Mama.
I lost the match.
You fought someone almost twice your age.
But I lost and made you sad.
I'm not sad, Sun.
Then why are you crying?
Mothers worry for their daughters.
I'm always afraid for you when I come to these matches.
But I'm not afraid.
I know.
That's why I'm crying.
Your teacher told me he's never seen a fighter as fearless as my daughter.
When I watch you and I see your fierce determination...
I know that your life will not be like mine... and that makes me very, very happy.
That was the day you took me to the Spring Festival.
There is much of her in you.
I was nourished by her.
But Joong-Ki was too young.
It was my duty to raise him in her place.
But I failed.
What happened was not your fault.
A lot of people never get the kind of love you got from your mother.
I certainly didn't.
But it didn't turn me into a murderer.
That may be true.
But it doesn't change the feeling inside of me.
I know feelings and emotions can overwhelm our logic, and at the same time, logic can ruin the emotions that make life worth living.
My brother killed my father because of me.
This is not a feeling.
It is a fact.
For many years after my father was killed...
I believed it was my duty to avenge him.
I stole a gun.
I imagined myself shooting the men who killed him many times.
But you never did.
No.
Why?
My mother.
Come.
Sit with me.
I want to talk to you about your father.
I asked her if she hated the men who killed him...
- and she said...
- I have no room in my heart for hate.
I don't have a mother to give such advice.
Maybe not.
But you have us.
Are you going to tell me...
I should trust in the law?
No.
My father was like your brother.
The world is better off without them.
I think I'm more confused than I was before.
There's no easy answer, Sun.
Whatever you decide to do... just know you won't have to do it alone.
I don't care where she is.
Mr. Rodriguez, hi.
- You cut your hair!
- Excuse me.
You don't have an appointment with him.
Sir!
Did you see it?
Listen, I gotta call you back.
Did you watch it?
- Oh, yeah, I watched it.
- It has almost two million hits!
Oh, can you believe it?
- It is incredible.
- Lito, this is a bit awkward.
I thought your lawyer was gonna talk to you.
I know.
He said that I needed to talk to you.
Oh, he did, did he?
Okay.
Let's do this.
Before you start, I know I've been having trouble finding the right project.
- It's not that.
- I really think I needed to do this before I was ready.
Well, I wish you would have talked to us first.
Why?
Look, I'm not gonna coddle you.
This agency no longer represents you.
- What?
- Look, it has nothing to do with me.
I mean, I even fought for you.
You know, I think that what you're doing is very, you know...
It's important.
- What are you talking about?
- There are certain high-level clients here at CMA who just, you know, they just simply don't agree with your, um...
I don't know, what do you want to call it?
Your lifestyle?
- It's not a lifestyle.
- Whatever.
Look, they told management in no uncertain terms that it was either them or you.
Okay?
Who?
Look, obviously this conversation never took place, okay?
I mean, we just decided to part ways, and, you know, wish each other the best, and, uh, explore other opportunities, et cetera.
Blah, blah, blah.
You said I was your guy.
Well, you lied to us, too.
Thank you.
Can I offer an opinion?
I came alone.
I just want to talk.
That's all.
How did you know I would be here today?
Well, I didn't.
I've been here every morning before my shift.
I guessed if you did come, it would be early.
I knew it'd be important for you to visit them.
I'd have felt the same way if my father committed suicide.
My father did not commit suicide.
He was murdered.
That is a strong allegation, Ms. Bak.
It's not an allegation, it is a fact, Detective.
Do you then have evidence to prove it?
I know what my brother has done.
And I do not require you or the law to believe me.
Yeah?
Why?
Because I have seen your legal system from inside and out.
And the last thing I would expect from it is justice.
Look, Ms. Bak...
I meant what I said to your teacher, okay?
I'm on your side.
We know that your brother is not the man the media believes him to be.
We suspect a lot of illegal money is flowing through his company.
We're just not able to prove it yet.
Listen to yourself, Detective.
Is this the system you serve?
Yeah.
The law is imperfect.
I'm asking you to trust me and I swear I will protect you.
I don't need anyone's protection.
Are you sure about that?
I promised I only wanted to talk, so I'm not gonna stop you if you prefer to leave.
But... this today, may be my last chance for a rematch.
May I propose a test to your invulnerability, Ms. Bak?
A quick spar.
If you win, you leave as you wish.
But if I win... you come with me and tell your story on the record.
If you're not going to stop me, I have no need to fight you.
No, you don't need to.
But I am hoping you want to.
I have thought about our fight at Mrs. Cho's apartment.
A lot.
I haven't thought about it at all.
All right.
Show me what you've learned, Detective.
When was the last time you lost a fight, Ms. Bak?
I can't remember.
I remember that move from your fight with King Kong Kim.
He was the best fighter from our dojo and you just cut him down like you were chopping a tree.
Like that?
Exactly like that.
Had enough?
No, Ms. Bak.
Oh, no.
You're thinking too much, Detective.
My teacher says the same thing.
After I lost an important match, he told me that I worry too much about what I should or shouldn't do.
He says fighting is not something you do with your head, it's something you do with your heart.
You agree with him, Ms. Bak?
I think you will profit by spending more time with your teacher and less time pestering me.
But this is much more fun.
Come on.
Let's go.
I think I know why you never remember your fights.
You're not fighting a person.
You're fighting something else.
You used a false identity to fight because of your father.
I think he refused to see you... to understand how special you are.
Ah!
You have improved, Detective.
It was almost a year ago you kissed me right here.
Riley, I, uh...
I, uh...
I know I've been acting... crazy lately.
I don't mean to be.
- I know.
- It's just...
I've never loved anyone, anyone... the way that I love you.
I promise I will come back to you.
It's the waiting that's the hard part.
- I know.
- It's, uh...
Do you think it's gonna be much longer?
No.
It could be tomorrow...
it could be next week.
Or it could be right now.
Which it so happens it is.
He's here?
The Archipelago has spoken.
I've been given an address.
You must go there.
You must go now.
- Oh!
What?
Whispers.
Where?
- Oh!
Sorry.
Sorry.
So sorry.
But you are gonna freak out, too.
- What?
- I couldn't sleep.
I was curious about the shooting everyone's been talking about.
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.
And one of the people killed was this
British politician, Mitchell Taylor.
He was giving a speech when it happened.
This is not out of some woolly desire to sit in a circle and sing Lennon's "Imagine."
This is to remind people that free societies... are stronger societies.
- Is he speaking at a mosque?
- Uh-huh.
Is he Muslim?
No.
It was some kind of peace congregation with all kinds of people,
Jews, Muslims, Christians, Atheists.
Since the invention of cities, open, multicultural societies are the places that the world's best and brightest have wanted to go to, while mono-cultural, repressive societies are the places they've wanted to escape from.
Oh, my God.
Oh, those poor people.
It's horrible.
What happened to the killer?
He tries to shoot himself.
How much better would the world be if these guys would just start with themselves?
Right?
But look, just before he shoots.
Good.
They caught him.
Yeah.
But the whole thing seemed so sad.
I mean, this guy Taylor trying to do something about our fear of otherness, then I got drawn in.
I started reading all of his tweets, and posts, and interviews, and I was thinking how the Internet is a kind of psycellium, like what you experienced in the woods with Angelica, where memories and moments of our lives exist beyond us... when I saw this...
Ruth El-Saadawi?
Freaky enough?
Then I started thinking like you're thinking, maybe a coincidence is not a coincidence, when my phone pinged and I screamed.
They put the killer in jail, but they didn't release his identity until now.
Todd.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, no.
Of course.
You gotta be shitting me.
Come on.
Riley.
Okay, I'm officially creeped out.
I don't like this, Riles.
We'll find another way to get to Whispers.
Will!
Riley!
I know why Whispers has been missing.
He's been trapped in prison.
He Bolgered Todd and used him to murder a politician named Mitchell Taylor.
Holy shit.
The church?
Why?
This is where the meeting is supposed to be.
Okay, this is getting weirder and weirder.
Riley?
Oh, my God.
- He said I had to go down the stairs.
- Who did?
Mr. Hoy.
If you want my professional police opinion,
I say there's no way in hell I'd go down there.
Yes, thank you.
Especially because if this was a movie, this would be the scene where the funny but annoying sidekick gets whacked.
He said I have to go alone.
Well, that solves my problem.
- I'll be in the car.
- D!
Will, BPO doesn't work like this.
This is someone who's very frightened.
And if I was gonna do what they're about to do, then I'd be scared, too.
I did a scene like this in Forgive Us Our Trespasses.
What happened?
Everyone died.
Not helpful.
No.
It is a test.
They need to know that I'm alone.
No.
Five minutes.
In five minutes, I send in Diego.
I needed to know how far you would go.
I needed to know if I could trust you.
I understand.
It's strange to finally meet.
In a way, you and your cluster exist because of me.
You work with Professor Kolovi.
You helped Angelica escape.
We both realized she was going to birth another cluster.
After what happened to her first...
I knew she would die before she let that happen again.
Why here?
Angelica heard me singing one day and asked where I'd learned.
And I told her about this church.
It was her idea to come here.
Why did Angelica work with BPO?
She was searching for her children.
What happened to them?
None of us fully realized how fast BPO was changing.
When I first started, it was very, very different.
Dr. El-Saadawi was a visionary.
I met her at Stanford.
And the work I did with her felt like something... sacred.
When she died, I hoped Professor
Kolovi would continue what she began.
I don't know.
Maybe he believed in her work once, but... not now.
Not since he met Dr. Milton Bailey Brandt.
That's the first name I knew him by.
When he came to the university, he had research, data on the development of the sensorium frontal lobe that we were all desperate for.
Of course, we all suspected how he came about this information, but nobody wanted to ask.
But still, Brandt never would have solved the problems of the neural graft without Angelica.
Neural graft?
It's mimics the connection of a cluster, overriding the consciousness of one sensorium onto another.
Why?
I'm an academic.
Even when I heard you coming down the stairs,
I wasn't sure I would be able to go through with this.
But I know what happened in New York.
When I watched those poor, innocent people killed...
If it's within our power to keep something that terrible from happening... shouldn't we?
Do you know what Angelica called Brandt?
Whispers.
She told me, the voice in your head that tells you to cut your wrists, or to take a handful of pills, or to jump from a height... that voice never shouts.
It only whispers.
Thank you.
He sleeps on blockers.
I couldn't reach him a few hours ago.
So you don't know for certain if he's in there?
No.
Every moment we stand here, he could wake.
She's right.
This is it.
Are you really ready to kill a man in cold blood?
Jonas?
Hello, Will.
"Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced,"
a James Baldwin quote Reggie Green's father often imparted to his son.
Reggie heard the message loud and clear.
Hey, see you at practice tomorrow.
Uh, I'm not on your team, Coach.
Good one, Marcus.
Despite the divisive hashtags that would have you believe otherwise, our great nation is built on that most famous of declarations:
"All men are created equal."
Equal?
You could only vote if you owned land and didn't have a vagina.
Well, uh...
She had him at "vagina."
Reggie, often a lone soldier on campus, had finally found his comrade-in-arms.
As the outrage over the blackface party gave way to campus-wide apathy,
Reggie found himself looking for ways to reignite the revolution.
What Reggie didn't realize was the revolution would find him.
So a student's picture pops up,
Coco Conners.
Not woke.
Woke.
- Woke.
- Cosby.
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm, I'm sorry.
Lady McRib.
Really?
Now look.
The entire campus ranked by whether they is woke or not woke.
Your boy's number four, for now, but once this blows up,
Sam, you better watch yo back.
Mm, you mad scientist.
This is based on my last Dear White People rant.
You Steve Jobs'd me.
I Steve Jobs'd you.
Yo, Steve Jobs was a monster who used Chinese slave labor to make his products.
What?
Those kids make a fantastic phone.
Hey, who that, Sam?
- Mm.
- Ooh, that's white bae.
- Nuh.
- What y'all finna do?
Go on a hike just for the Instagrams?
- Play hacky sack?
- Open an Etsy shop like that's a real job?
Wow, I'm really sad I have to go too, assholes.
Wait.
I love/hate your shirt.
Well, what's to hate?
I can't wear it.
I have cream.
Bitch, get out of here.
Bye.
- Have fun being booed up, girl.
- Thank you.
Reggie, you're a genius.
- I know.
- Bye, Sam.
Bye, Al.
All right, y'all, who do we get this "Woke or Not" app to, to make it a thing?
The revolution is running on embers.
It's Saturday, Reggie.
The revolution can wait.
I heard the ASU's having a cook-in.
Hard pass.
People have completely forgotten about this blackface party.
The whole thing, it's like they just...
Reggie.
Sometimes being carefree and black is an act of revolution.
She's right, man.
Saturday's a day of rest.
You ain't Jewish, man.
You don't know my life.
But you let the ladies walk all over you.
Why?
Because you know your mama didn't love you.
What we need now is a man.
That's what the ladies want, and that's what the mama in your heart wants.
I've been an author, psychic,
Yelp reviewer, bus driver, former Yelp reviewer who got banned for using too many obscenities in a review for a children's theater, and a reader of half of one of Iyanla Vanzant's books.
I've done the work, and for some reason, these people have given me a show to help you do yours.
Oh, I'm sorry, Reg.
Were you watching TV while the revolution dies?
Sorry.
Dereca got me caught up.
Dereca's a hot mess.
God, I want her to set me straight.
Shasta.
Pulled out all the stops.
Sorbet, did you make some new friends?
Aww, this is Sorbet, and she's so glad you were able to make it to our little cook-in.
Well, we wanted to have a cookout, but real grills are banned on campus.
- Like dogs, right?
- Technically, yes.
But after the blackface party, I was so traumatized.
I mean, racism here?
I still can't believe it.
No one could have seen it coming.
I thought President Obama fixed all that.
I know, so I went to the campus psychiatrist, and I told him that I'd kill myself if I could not have a support animal, and they let me get one.
Well, you're the real hero, Kelsey.
Aw, Al.
Thank you.
Would you guys like a veggie dog?
- No.
- Hell no.
Sorbet, come back here.
No!
- She's something else.
- Ugh.
That girl.
All right, what...
They made free food bad.
Fuck these guys.
- French exit?
- Wait.
Wannabe pastor Kordell got the homie hemmed up.
And if you think about it, Rashid,
Africa owes a lot to Christian missionaries.
- If they hadn't brought Jesus...
- I love the Lord, but Pastor Kordell be doing the most.
- He's in me?
- He's in you right now.
- So that mean I'm Jesus.
- You're Jesus-like.
- We're all Jesus-like...
- Rashid.
Thank God I found you.
I just got a call about your mom.
It's bad.
We gotta go right now.
Is she okay?
No, we cannot talk about this right now.
We should leave right now for this very real emergency.
We'll pray for her, man.
Right now.
Give me your hand.
Jesus, bless this grape soda as we take this as your blood...
- Was the mom thing too much?
- No, that was fine.
My mom died when I was very young, so I knew she was not on the phone.
What a fool that man was.
Well, good, I guess.
Hey, y'all wanna go to a tailgating party?
- It's free.
- It's only free 'cause they suck.
We boring you, Reg?
Who goes to the botanical gardens?
It's like a fucking zoo for plants.
Are you cyberstalking Sam and her new love interest?
Nah, man.
I'm just looking at this horrible audio lag...
Thane forever, man!
I could fix this bullshit in ten minutes.
Sure, you're definitely upset exclusively about that and not about that video of Sam and Gabe.
Shit just popped up.
Couldn't give a fuck what they thinkin'.
So we're all cool with Sam dating a Abercrombie model?
I mean, you two practically share panties, Jo.
What's your take?
I mean, Sam's my girl.
If she likes it, I love it.
You know that shit is weird.
I was surprised at first.
I admit.
I mean, I'm not sure I could let a white man colonize my body, and I never thought Sam would either.
So do you feel personally betrayed?
No.
I mean, it's complicated.
I know the heart wants what it wants, and we're all one and all that shit, but... how many times we've had the narrative that black men aren't good enough and that we need a white savior?
I mean, I can't help but feel a little...
Disappointed.
- I didn't say that.
- Didn't have to.
Tell you one thing.
I plan to marry me a dark-skinned sister.
Have the ashiest, blackest babies possible.
Won't catch me in these streets
- with a white V.
- Well, I can say, having conducted multiple blind taste tests, you can't tell a white pussy from a black one.
Friends, in American popular culture, many black men seem obsessed with white girls.
What is this about?
Anal.
To Thane!
They forgot "student most likely to pass out drunk in a public fountain."
Not feeling the school spirit, Reg?
Nah, not really.
Football is the only time a black face gets celebrated on this campus.
Never mind their brain slowly getting pounded into mush.
Right, my brother.
Furthermore, these burgers come from cows that were packed in pens same way we was packed into slave ships.
They want us to eat our ancestors.
No, that's not how Reggie talks.
It's more like...
"Weed is a tool of the government...
- Mm.
- ...to anesthetize black minds into complacency."
Oh, oh.
My name is Reggie, and 9/11 was a inside job.
Fuck y'all, man.
It was.
What's up?
You guys talking shit about everyone?
No, just me.
Damn, 'cause, you know, present company excluded,
I hate everyone else here.
One, I'm obsessed with you.
Deal with it.
Two, who are you?
I'm the girl you guys are gonna share your weed with.
Ikumi, your new catchall Asian friend.
- All right.
- Okay, girl.
Yes.
My people.
Hey, nice app, Reggie.
Thanks.
Glad you like it.
- What, so I'm not woke?
- So say the people.
Maybe because you betrayed us for your buddy Kurt.
He's doing his best.
How about you do something productive, instead of trying to make a Wokémon Go?
- It's actually a solid name.
- We will catch them all.
No, don't try to pun your way out of this conflict.
- We're upset.
- Feel free to register your complaints in the comment section.
Excuse us.
Clarence Thomas pumpkin pie eating motherfucker.
Are we really gonna stay and watch these losers play?
Can't we go see a movie or something?
Yes, movie or something.
Man, I am not about this long line life.
Hey, is that Lionel?
Or a really skinny lesbian?
- Excuse me.
- Oh, hey, Lionel.
Thanks for holding a spot for us.
Oh, hey, guys.
I've been waiting here for you, my friends.
- In fact, I was texting you...
- You can stop talking now.
- No one is listening.
- What you seeing?
Crayons:
The Movie.
No, your black ass isn't.
I hear it's delightful.
Ooh, how about Oh, No She Didn't?
That cannot be a real movie.
How many times did they have to use "get her off" as a double entendre?
We get it.
They worked at a law firm
- and they had sex.
- Those were our choices.
Cheap urban drama or tragedy porn.
Man, we could have watched porn?
And when they do accidentally give us a quality movie, they think that gives them a pass to double down on this shit.
Classic moral license.
Like with Tarantino.
Just because he let Jamie Foxx kill a bunch of racists in Django, he thinks he can parade around every painful historical black stereotype.
And we gave him a NAACP Image Award for that shit.
Swear to God, he gets off on putting Sam Jackson in his movies just so all the white characters can call him "nigger"
- for three hours.
- Hard R too.
Yeah, must really suck to only have two movies this month with people that look like you.
Try having the same two options since 2000.
All I got is The Joy Luck Club and Crouching Tiger.
And kind of Kung Fu Panda.
I like you, but fuck you.
You do realize all we do is complain about things.
It is as though Americans would have no identity if not for their near-constant outrage.
I know so much about what you don't like.
What do you all like, eh?
- Breakfast for dinner?
- Waller House has breakfast for dinner.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, yeah.
Omelets, things like that.
A good scramble, maybe avocado.
- Get it, get it.
- Yeah.
See?
We like stuff.
I am going back to Kenya.
- Rashid.
- Ah, come on, 'Shid.
- You going the wrong way.
- To the left.
- This way?
- Yes.
- Okay.
- He'll be back.
A little... a little fruit salad.
Whoever decided pancakes had to be confined
- to certain hours?
- Whoever it was, that person is a piece of shit.
Ah, you are rubbing off on me, yo.
Al, just let him be African today.
- Okay?
- Hey, everyone on Yik Yak's talking about some party tonight.
It says lots of booze and a great playlist.
How can y'all party when there's shit like this going on?
"Make Campus Safe Again"?
From who?
Y'all know who they're talking about.
We need to wake this campus up.
Yeah, but when you say "we,"
we're not the "we" you're talking about.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you've been checking your Snapchat all day.
Look, she's with Gabe.
She said it on the fucking radio.
- Deal with it.
- Who wants bacon?
I do.
Sorry.
You just... seemed so stressed, and I thought maybe I could make you smile again the way she does, but...
- that was stupid, so...
- Nah, nah, nah, nah.
You're right.
I needed a distraction, so... thank you for... dragging me out of my rut.
What do you say we honor Thane by doing what he did best?
Yep.
Let's get white girl wasted.
Okay, now, that shit, you can rant about.
Nope.
We're here to have fun.
Wow.
Wow.
Oh, look.
Turns out there's three lawn jockeys at this party.
Sorry.
Having fun.
So much fun.
Oh, look.
Your teeth are showing.
Ha-ha.
They're so cute.
- Yeah, I brushed 'em today.
- Good.
- Sam.
- What up, y'all?
Hey, I didn't know you'd be here.
I's here.
- What y'all doing?
- Not much.
Terrible AASU party, uh... football tailgate, a Sanaa Lathan movie.
Y'all hate-watched Oh, No She Didn't without me?
I fought it at first, but, you know, Joelle made me stick it out.
She's a good friend.
She really is.
I need drinks.
- We missed you.
- You missed me?
- Yes.
- I was busy.
Busy?
Here you go, babe.
- Busy.
- Reggie.
- Oh, uh...
- Mm...
The botanical gardens.
Yeah, that looked fun.
Yeah, I mean, it's... more like a zoo without the animals.
- Hmm.
- Or the cages.
Or the animals dragging kids away from their mothers.
Fun.
Fun.
So much fun.
Uh...
Al, could I get a drink?
- Ah.
- That's, like, number five.
It's not disgusting.
It's hypothetical.
Man, just answer the question.
Fuck, marry, kill.
Me, Rashid and Reggie.
You all seem lovely.
- But you'd kill Rashid, right?
- No way.
Everyone knows I am marriage material.
Lionel, don't answer these motherfuckers.
But you'd marry me, right?
- Yes.
- Ah, come on, nigga.
We could go antiquing in Vermont and shit.
"Antiquing in Vermont and shit."
- Reggie!
My man.
- Thank God.
What you need, brother?
Hey!
Reggie's with me.
Dude's in my data structures class.
He's smart as shit.
No one's ever been as fucked as you guys are about to be.
Who we fucking?
I mean, I'm up for it.
I'm just asking.
I need a partner for tipsy trivia.
- You in?
- Yeah.
Come on.
We got some ass to kick.
You ain't the only one with a secret white friend.
Mmm.
Oh.
- He's talking about me.
- Yeah.
All right, all right, all right.
After the first round,
Reggie and Addison are on top with ten, and the Johnson twins have zero.
Zero!
Are all twins this dumb?
Do y'all gotta split one brain between you?
Okay, okay, hands up.
Hands up, ready to ding in.
All right, when did the French Revolutio... 1789.
Correct!
Who was the man that went into...
Martin Van Buren.
Correct!
What is osmosis?
Ace of Spades.
Lake Titicaca.
Hyperhidrosis.
All right, what team came to the US in 19...
"Rockin'" Robin Yount and the Milwaukee Brewers.
Boom!
Come on, y'all.
This game is culturally biased against me, and I'm still whooping that ass.
I know y'all's shit and my shit.
We are winning too hard.
Can one of y'all cheat so we can drink?
All right, how about everyone shots in the kitchen, except the Johnson twins?
- Ooh.
- Tits.
Kill 'em with all that intellectual bullshit.
You're the fucking man.
- The boss man!
- Okay, okay, okay.
Get drunk!
So you decided you're the master in trivia now?
See, the thing about me is, I'm smart as fuck.
I see.
Um, so since you got all the answers, what makes me such a good friend?
Oh!
Ooh.

Yeah, man, I know, but, uh...
I just really heard you say it, though.
And now he won't anymore.
We all learned something today.
Wait, so it's bad if I'm just repeating what's in the song?
- Dude, seriously?
- No, I know.
I'm sorry.
But it's not like I'm a racist.
Never said you were a racist.
Just don't say "nigga."
Like, you didn't have to say it just then.
I guess it just felt kind of weird to censor myself.
It felt kind of weird to hear you say it.
I mean, how would you feel if I started rapping to songs, you know, that say "honky" and "cracker"?
I wouldn't care at all.
Exactly, that's the difference.
The fact that you don't care and I do.
Like... you get it?
Reggie getting in a fight about racism.
- I'm shocked.
- Somebody said "nigga" and here come Kurt.
Hey, Addison, heads up.
Just hide anything you don't want destroyed in a riot.
- Bro.
- Speaking of.
Has anyone seen Sam?
This really feels like something she would plan to make a point.
Kurt, I'm good.
I just don't like being called a racist.
Again, he never said you were a racist.
He said "don't say that word."
I'm not some redneck.
Is that what you think of me, Reggie?
Yeah, Reggie.
You call your friend a racist and yet you're surprised when he's upset.
We're friends, but suddenly,
I'm supposed to give you nigga dispensation?
Dude, I didn't do anything wrong.
It's a song.
Hell, it's in the title.
What am I supposed to do?
Hum?
- Yes, nigga.
- Come on, Reggie.
You don't want him using his white privilege to rewrite black art, do you?
Come on, man, I been good to you.
You're at a party at my house, drinking my booze, and now you attack me?
It's...
Can nobody just have fun anymore?
Oh, I sorry, massa.
We didn't mean to ruin your fun, now.
Sure, back to slavery.
It always comes back to slavery.
Okay, now I'm calling you a racist.
- Yeah?
- Okay, let's all just calm down and have a good time.
- Troy, stay out of it.
- Even our black president thinks you guys are being ridiculous.
Yo, "you guys" sounds like a real "you people" substitute.
This is what happens when a country refuses to address its history with slavery.
We need to do here what they did in Germany.
- What?
- I meant the educating kids about the nation's horrible past part, not the, um, concentration camp part.
- Okay.
- 'Cause I was about to say.
- I was just miming the song.
- You are saying...
I didn't mean to offend you in any way.
Where's y'all camera at?
See?
This is why you don't say "nigga."
- This is what happens.
- Man, this is not my fault.
You and your friends show up places uninvited and cause others fucking problems.
What the fuck?
!
Get your fuckin' hands off of me!
Everybody, stay where you are.
- Get off him.
Get off of him!
- Ah, what the fuck?
Are you a student here?
- What?
- We've had some complaints.
- Are you a student here?
- Yeah, my tuition pays your salary.
He's a student here.
We just got into a little tiff.
That's all.
This is my house.
I'm gonna need to see your ID.
- Why you need to see my ID?
- Son, I said ID.
- I'm not your son.
- Reggie, do what he says.
- Officer, he's a student...
- I'm not talking to you.
Fuck these pigs, man.
- I said show me some ID!
- Yo, he's a student!
He's a student here.
Why the fuck do you guys have guns?
Did I stutter?
Show me some ID!
Okay.
I'm going in my wallet.
Okay.
If you'd shown me that when I asked, we could have avoided all that.
Okay, party's over.
If you don't live here, go home.
Come on.
It's awful.
Think we should walk together.
It's crazy.
Reggie... are you okay?
Jesus, are you okay?
Are you okay, Reggie?
Talk to me.
Reggie, s...
Reggie?
Reggie, are you there?
I was thinking about what happened all night.
We gotta clap back... strong.
Reggie.
Reggie?
Reggie, are you there?
Reggie?
Reggie.
And the senator was forced to suspend his campaign when officials discovered it was a,
"Weekend at Bernie's" situation.
Chuck?
Dozens hospitalized as a serial arsonist strikes again in New York City.
We go now to our field reporter,
Kevin Herkins, who's been on top of this story from the beginning.
Kevin?
That's right, Chuck.
This Quiznos may be toasted, but tonight, nobody's saying "Mmm."
Witnesses saw a white male fleeing the scene.
He's described as 30s, red hair, wearing a grey suit, and a pink tie.
However, police are warning that the description is wrong and the guy probably looks the opposite to that.
There he is!
We now go live to over there!
No!
Well, I'm sure that's some sort of strange coincidence.
Kevin is a beloved member of the MMN family.
- He obviously didn't...
- I did it!
I set all the fires!
Redheads unite and kill all the other hair colors!
Back to you, Chuck.
There's my little star!
All my friends saw you on TV!
Oh, I'm exhausted.
I was up all night recording vocals for DJ Snake's brother, DJ Worm, and my voice is already shot from doing that TED Talk on the power of chillaxing.
Tonight, I'm serving as a celebrity referee at Susan Sarandon's ping pong nightclub.
Huh.
That last one sounds made up.
Are you working on any dope side projects, Chuck?
Well, actually, in June,
I am giving the commencement address at the Braithwaite School for Troubled Boys.
Wonderful news, everyone.
Kevin has been indicted for serial arson.
- Oh, my God.
- Obviously, we need a new field reporter ASAP, so if anyone has any ideas...
We don't need someone with a ton of experience.
Basically, if they can string four words together, the job is theirs.
Me could go camera.
Katie could do it.
Ha!
That's an interesting idea.
Who said that?
I did.
I'm a talent scout.
Well, what are you doing at our morning meeting?
Do you want to do it, Katie?
Just for today?
No, thanks.
- Good.
- What?
Why?
You've got nothing going on.
I read your texts.
They're all from the Domino's Pizza Tracker.
Because I would like to produce a story.
I've been working a source at the NRA, and I think he's finally willing to do an interview.
Okay.
That does sound better than your last piece about the cat who dialed 912 and everyone died.
There is one more thing.
The network has received quite a few angry phone calls from older viewers about our theme song.
Really?
I think our theme song's zazzy.
Unfortunately, elderly people who complain about things are our key demographic.
We're gonna need a new theme song.
New theme song, eh?
You know, I play... guitar.
But I think you'd be great on the show!
Mom, stop following me.
I have no desire to be on camera.
I think you're just scared because of what happened last time you tried to be a star.
Katie, dance like no one's watching even though everyone is and the stakes couldn't be higher.

Mom, I'm not scared.
I just don't want to be a field reporter, and honestly, I don't want you to go back to being an insane stage mom.
Oh, please.
I wasn't insane enough.
If I had pushed you harder, you would've won Little Miss New Jersey and Little Miss America and that other pageant that turned out to be for dwarves.
I didn't want to do any of those.
Only because you were afraid of your own greatness.
You're not gonna make that mistake again.
Yes, I am.
Oh, so you admit that it's a mistake.
Well, case closed, Judge Joe Black.
Or is it Brown?
You know, the... black one.
Okay, Mom, Mom, I'm not doing it.
Okay.
What do you say to this?
"Believe in your dreams"?
Why do you have this?
Oh, Katie, I just don't want you to be on your deathbed and look over at me and say, "I should've gone for it, Mom."
"New theme song, eh?
You know, I play guitar."
Stupid.
Stupid.
Stupid.
Listen to the rock.
I'm definitely not gonna regret it, and I'm not making my life decisions based on advice from a rock!
I'm coming.
Is someone playing a prank on me?
Because it's very funny, and I definitely get it!
"Believe in your dreams"?
Thank you!
I'm writing the new theme song, and that's final.
If Frasier can do it, so can I.
For lunch, I wanted tossed salad and scrambled eggs.
It's not because of the song.
Hey, what's Greg doing?
Screen testing new field reporters.
Do you speak any English at all?
- Ja.
- We'll be in touch.
I can't believe you don't want to do it, Katie.
Yeah, I don't know.
I just never really wanted to be on camera.
Plus, I have this NRA piece that I think...
It's 2017.
The only people that don't want fame and attention are molesters and not even.
Josh Duggar and Jared Fogle have that new reality show
"Property Pervs." You're the only one.
- Okay, whenever you're ready.
- Hi, I'm Gordy Smurch, and today, I'm reporting on boogers, ew!
Thank you!
So you haven't found anyone yet, huh?
No.
The talent pool is thin, Katie.
There's just too many news shows.
CNN had to give 10:00 to the "Damn Daniel" guy.
- Oh, this guy looks normal.
- Okay, go ahead.
Could you do it without the dummy?
You heard him, dummy.
Get lost.
Could you please fill in, Katie?
- Buy me some time.
- I don't know.
Every time I do something like this, my mom just gets way too into it.
This one time, I was in the background of a "Girls Gone Wild" video, not naked, just using a metal detector, and she bought, like, a thousand copies.
Please, Katie, for the show.
Fine.
Fine, but just temporarily.
We're back in business, baby!
What?
Why do you have that?
I've never taken it off.
Fans from around the globe will gather at this midtown hotel to celebrate the 20th anniversary of "Dunston Checks In,"
which this reporter urges all of you to check out.
In Manhattan, I'm Katie Wendelson.
Back to you, Chuck.
Back to you, Chuck!
All right, everyone, go get some dessert, and then we'll rewind and watch it for the sixth time.
Dave, open that wine you've been saving for your retirement!
You got it, dear!
Congratulations.
- Thanks, Angie.
- You know, now that you have such a cool job, I may set you up with my nephew, the one that killed all those possums under my deck.
- Ralphie asked about me?
- Uh, no.
Mom, why is that woman glaring at you?
Oh, her?
That's my nemesis, Judy.
She is so jealous because you're on TV.
Her daughter's just a stupid senator.
I am so proud of you, Katie.
You made me so happy tonight!
Aw, thanks, Mom.
You know what, it wasn't even that bad.
I got my makeup done, a mean girl from middle school approved my friend request.
See, I told you this was gonna be a good thing.
Yeah, and I've never had so many people say "Good job."
You never hear that as a producer.
Sometimes, I sit on my own hand and then pat myself on the back so it feels like a stranger's doing it.
Oh.
Wait.
What?
...with Portia Scott Griffin.
Stan, you've been at the NRA for 30 years?
What?
They did my NRA interview without me?
But I was out in the field.
I didn't write any questions.
So let's get right to it.
What is, like, the coolest gun in the world?
Oh, no.
She produced it herself.
You know, I once shot a bazooka in a Taylor Swift video.
- Is there a question?
- No.
Do you have any questions for me?
Um, what's Taylor Swift like?
- Well...
- Oh, my God.
She's screwed it all up.
I lost a huge story 'cause I was doing some stupid thing to make you happy.
- Aw.
- No, Mom, not "Aw."
I'm never going on camera again.
- What?
- Hey.
Can I have a picture with the TV star?
Yes.
And tomorrow, I am marching into Greg's office, and I am telling him that this is over.
Oh, Ralphie texted back.
He said, "She wishes" and four toilet emojis.
Hey, who are you, the janitor?
Clean up these papers that someone else threw on the ground.
No, I'm the editor, Justin.
Haven't I seen you going through the garbage?
No.
Oh, wait.
The garbage?
Yeah.
Cool guitar.
That's her way of saying thank you.
Okay, well, see ya.
I'm actually writing a new theme song for the show.
It's going really well.
- Cool.
Let's hear it.
- All right, you got me!
It's going horribly!
It's not fair.
People only see me as one thing, a serious newsman, but I'm so much more!
I'm a musician!
I'm a painter.
I'm a dirty standup.
I'm a dirty magician.
- I'm an X-rated hypnotist.
- Okay, well, see ya.
Portia gets all these opportunities to be creative.
She was the news anchor in two different "Batmans" but not me.
Finally, I get my opportunity to write a song to show a different side of myself to the world, and I'm blowing it!
Wow, Chuck, I didn't know you were that into music.
Well, you know how the old saying goes,
"All news anchors want to be rock stars and all rock stars want to be news anchors."
You know, I'm actually in a band myself.
Okay, well, see ya.
No, what I meant was I can help you write the song,
- if you want.
- You would do that?
You know what, you're all right, janitor.
Greg, that was my NRA interview.
Good morning.
How could you let Portia do it alone?
That's like letting a baby shoot a gun, which happened at the end of the interview.
- You were out in the field.
- Well, not anymore.
I officially quit being a field reporter.
No, you don't.
The network called.
- They loved you.
- What?
They wanted you to take over the position permanently.
Why?
I wasn't even that good.
Yeah, I have no idea why.
I'm sure it's only because...
- Because what?
- Well, you know, you did look not ugly on camera.
Greg, come on.
You know me, I don't care how hot I look on camera.
Never said "hot."
I'm sorry, but unless you start a fire and join the Redhead Army, which Kevin is somehow mobilizing from prison, you are the new field reporter.
- Stupid slamming bod.
- Never said "slamming bod!"
Sorry I'm late.
Last night was the release party for my new young adult novel.
- Cool.
What's it about?
- I don't know.
Like, a elf or something.
Sounds like you're pretty busy, Portia.
But so have I!
Chuck's been up for 36 hours.
I managed to put a little something together for the new theme song, so why don't you take a listen?
I don't think we're gonna get many complaints on this one.
You may fire when ready.

Greg said he didn't know why the network wanted me.

What's his name, Mom?
John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt...
Schmidt.
Liar, liar, capris on fire!
Okay, fine!
I called the network.
Me and everyone in the viewing party.
Angie and Barb and Pat and that two-faced B-word, Judy.
She wants to be my friend now!
But why would the network listen to you?
Well, you know what Greg said.
Old complainers are "The Breakdown's key demographic".
Hey, we are live in 90 seconds.
Oh, my God, Mom, you are unbelievable.

- No, you know what?
I'm not doing my report.
I quit.
What?
No.
Come here.
You are not gonna quit!
I will not let you!
There'll be a hundred calls, a thousand calls.
You don't know how many women I know with endless free time on their hands.
How do you think Curly Sue won "The Voice"?
It was us!
Anyway, break a leg, pumpkin!
I knew this would happen if I went on camera.
You are like a drug addict, Mom.
Only, your drug is imagining me playing charades with Jane Lynch on "Hollywood Game Night."
Oh, so what?
I'm addicted to fame, and I ain't going to rehab unless I get to share a room with Kim Richards.
This is just like when I did pageants,
- and you wouldn't let me quit.
- What?
That's why I had to pretend to forget "The Hotstepper."
Yeah, that's right.

No, no.

Master.

And the senator was forced to suspend his campaign when officials discovered it was a,
"Weekend at Bernie's" situation.
Chuck?
Dozens hospitalized as a serial arsonist strikes again in New York City.
We go now to our field reporter,
Kevin Herkins, who's been on top of this story from the beginning.
Kevin?
That's right, Chuck.
This Quiznos may be toasted, but tonight, nobody's saying "Mmm."
Witnesses saw a white male fleeing the scene.
He's described as 30s, red hair, wearing a grey suit, and a pink tie.
However, police are warning that the description is wrong and the guy probably looks the opposite to that.
There he is!
We now go live to over there!
No!
Well, I'm sure that's some sort of strange coincidence.
Kevin is a beloved member of the MMN family.
- He obviously didn't...
- I did it!
I set all the fires!
Redheads unite and kill all the other hair colors!
Back to you, Chuck.
[upbeat news broadcast music] [gasps] There's my little star!
All my friends saw you on TV!
Oh, I'm exhausted.
I was up all night recording vocals for DJ Snake's brother, DJ Worm, and my voice is already shot from doing that TED Talk on the power of chillaxing.
Tonight, I'm serving as a celebrity referee at Susan Sarandon's ping pong nightclub.
Huh.
That last one sounds made up.
Are you working on any dope side projects, Chuck?
Well, actually, in June,
I am giving the commencement address at the Braithwaite School for Troubled Boys.
Wonderful news, everyone.
Kevin has been indicted for serial arson.
- Oh, my God.
- Obviously, we need a new field reporter ASAP, so if anyone has any ideas...
We don't need someone with a ton of experience.
Basically, if they can string four words together, the job is theirs.
Me could go camera.
[deep voice] Katie could do it.
[normal voice] Ha!
That's an interesting idea.
Who said that?
[deep voice] I did.
I'm a talent scout.
[normal voice] Well, what are you doing at our morning meeting?
Do you want to do it, Katie?
Just for today?
No, thanks.
- Good.
- What?
Why?
You've got nothing going on.
I read your texts.
They're all from the Domino's Pizza Tracker.
Because I would like to produce a story.
I've been working a source at the NRA, and I think he's finally willing to do an interview.
Okay.
That does sound better than your last piece about the cat who dialed 912 and everyone died.
There is one more thing.
The network has received quite a few angry phone calls from older viewers about our theme song.
Really?
I think our theme song's zazzy.
Unfortunately, elderly people who complain about things are our key demographic.
We're gonna need a new theme song.
New theme song, eh?
You know, I play... guitar.
But I think you'd be great on the show!
Mom, stop following me.
I have no desire to be on camera.
I think you're just scared because of what happened last time you tried to be a star.

- Ja.
- We'll be in touch.
I can't believe you don't want to do it, Katie.
Yeah, I don't know.
I just never really wanted to be on camera.
Plus, I have this NRA piece that I think...
It's 2017.

Josh Duggar and Jared Fogle have that new reality show

No.

There's just too many news shows.
CNN had to give 10:00 to the "Damn Daniel" guy.
- Oh, this guy looks normal.
- Okay, go ahead.
Could you do it without the dummy?
You heard him, dummy.

That's why all those people called in about you.
- Wait, what people?
- All the people that called the network just to say how great you were.
Who told you that?
Greg said he didn't know why the network wanted me.
- Oh, Greg's boss told me.
- Oh, yeah?
What's his name, Mom?
John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt...
Schmidt.
Liar, liar, capris on fire!
Okay, fine!
I called the network.
Me and everyone in the viewing party.
Angie and Barb and Pat and that two-faced B-word, Judy.
She wants to be my friend now!
But why would the network listen to you?
Well, you know what Greg said.
Old complainers are "The Breakdown's key demographic".
Hey, we are live in 90 seconds.
Oh, my God, Mom, you are unbelievable.
- I know.
- No, you know what?
I'm not doing my report.
I quit.
What?
No.
Come here.
You are not gonna quit!
I will not let you!
There'll be a hundred calls, a thousand calls.
You don't know how many women I know with endless free time on their hands.
How do you think Curly Sue won "The Voice"?
- [gasps]
- It was us!
Anyway, break a leg, pumpkin!
[ominous music]
I knew this would happen if I went on camera.
You are like a drug addict, Mom.
Only, your drug is imagining me playing charades with Jane Lynch on "Hollywood Game Night."
Oh, so what?
I'm addicted to fame, and I ain't going to rehab unless I get to share a room with Kim Richards.
This is just like when I did pageants,
- and you wouldn't let me quit.
- What?
That's why I had to pretend to forget "The Hotstepper."
- [gasps]
- Yeah, that's right.
I could've done "The Hotstepper" that day.
I could do it right now.
- That is not true!
- One minute to air!
We'll talk about this after your report.
Good luck!

I never should've forced you to do those pageants.
I really thought it's what you wanted to do.
I know.
I know, Mom.
The truth is I just wanted you to be able to pursue my dreams.
My dreams.
I keep getting it wrong.
My dreams.
Hey, Mom, do you think it's possible that being on camera is your dream?
Me?
On camera?
Oh, give me a break.
I really think I'm too old for that.
Mom, you got a job in cable news with no experience at age 60.
Who says this dream is out of reach?
I don't know, Katie.
It seems... impossible.
Oh, yeah?
Well, what do you say to this?
"Believe in your dreams."
Oh, Katie.

Can we please go?
- Well, Katie, you're fired.
- What?
No, no.
As a field reporter.
You can still be a producer.

- No, no.
It's very funny.
Thank you.
Well, I hope my dancing didn't ruin the show.
Oh, it did.
But actually, I was quite impressed 'cause I thought I was the only person on earth who didn't want to be famous.
No, no.
There are two of us.
Oh, I did manage to find a new field reporter finally.

There's no way they're gonna take those back.
One has button eyes from when Emery turned it into a puppet.
Mom's the queen of returns.
Watch the master at work.
He's saying, "You need a receipt."
And Mommy's going, "Are you saying I didn't buy them here?
Are you calling me a liar?"
And he goes, "No.

[School bell rings]
Private-school kids.
What are they doing here?
They're gonna get jumped.
They go to school here.
That's our debate team.
Debate team?
It's kind of like a sports team, but instead of balls... they throw formal arguments at each other.
Oh.
Is there any physical contact?
Nope.
It's mostly reading and research.
Oh!
I mean, it's really just a ton of extra homework.
Ooh!
Well, if you're into it, they're having tryouts later this week.
How did I not see that poster before?
We see what we want to see.
Huh.
Oh, Peggy... _
_
Don't worry, son.
You'll score a basket on me someday.
Did you have to yell "Not in my house"
every time you blocked a shot?
Well, if you keep bringing me weak sauce,
I'm gonna keep rejecting it.
[Scoffs]
What's this noise?
I'm entering a contest.
You create your own comic, and if the publisher likes it, they'll print it, and they'll give it away for free a comic-book stores nationwide.
I heard "give it away," "free,"
and then I stopped listening.
Well, I think it's awesome.
I'm gonna go get my colored pencils.
Enjoy working for free.

[Imitates notes]
[Chuckles]
Here you go.
Oh, good!
I get a chance to use my new mail-sorting system.
Mommy, I'd like to try out for the school debate team.
Absolutely not.
It'll take time away from your schoolwork, they'll charge us for additional supplies, and I'm not driving all over town to take you to debate tournaments.
Or... it'll look good on your transcript, it's bonus studying, and it'll be a chance to practice public-speaking skills for when you become doctor-president.
- Mommy... did you...
- Yes.
I debated myself.
Who do you think won?
- Uh...
- You did.
Because you're joining the debate team.
[Gasps] You tricked me, and I love it.
Hey, can you hand me that pencil?
Man, we work together really well.
Building on that,
I was thinking about your comic-book contest.
Why don't we team up, do it together?
You know I'd love a sibling team-up.
It'd be like my favorite TV show,
"Sister, Sister,"
except brothers.
♪ Brother, brother ♪
But wait.
I thought you said comic books were a waste of time.
That was hours ago.
I've changed so much since then.
Come on.
You draw it, I'll write it.
Together, we could create something amazing and possibly make millions.
Hmm.
In conclusion, nobody says "a candy bar a day keeps the doctor away."
Therefore, we need apples in the school vending machines.
Thank you.
Much better.
Nice opening joke, good posture, and I like how you took away the possibility of any poison-apple arguments.
Right.
Because Snow White lived...
And I quote... "happily ever after."
You're ready for tryouts.
[Gasps] One more tip...
When debating a real person, use their own words against them.
It traps them in a prison of their own design.
"Own design."
Thanks, Mommy.
Mm-hmm.
Evan, what did you do to my Lowenwasser?
I needed a crest.
Oh.
Well, after a few of these, I'll forget you ever did it.
Mom, you said me and Emery couldn't read our comic books at the table, but Evan gets to read his debate book?
Evan is reading an actual book.
You were reading a finished coloring book.
Ah, so he gets a pass 'cause he's a nerd.
Got it.
In formal debate, slander is not permitted and must be stricken from the record.
Luckily, this is not a formal debate, and you are a butt face.
What do you all want for dessert?
Hector just made a pineapple right-side-up cake.
He's afraid to flip it.
We'll just take the usual...
One slice of key-lime pie and five spoons.
Although, pineapple cake does sound good.
[Chuckles softly]
[Inhales sharply] No.
Pie is superior because it is filled with nutritious fruit.
It is the healthiest dessert.
In fact, pie is so good, dessert couldn't contain it.
It burst out into chicken-pot, mincemeat.
It is the food of shepherds, mathematicians...
Pi...
Infinite possibilities.
[Light applause]
[Chuckles]
But cake is good...
We'll have that piece of...
And here are the reasons why.
Cake represents joy...
Birthdays, graduations, retirements.
No one's ever heard of a wedding pie.
Every important milestone in your life, cake was there.
Cake watched you grow up.
And sure, some may say pie burst out, but I say pie is confused.
It doesn't know what it wants to be.
Is it savory?
Is it sweet?
Shepherd's pie has lamb in it.
Do they seem like good shepherds to you?
So, really, when you think about it, pie is murder.
If you choose life, choose cake.
Let us eat cake!
So, then I said,
"When you think about it, pie is murder.
If you choose life, choose cake."
[Chuckles] I did get political.
Thank you, Zack.
Anyway, the place went crazy.
I learned from the best.
Now I'm the best.
[Telephone base clicks]
Let's take a drive.
What do you think?
This is Nice Man.
He uses the power of overwhelming positivity to diffuse negative situations.
I don't know if he's gonna go with the words I've written.
"Yo mama" jokes?
How is that a super power?
My guy's an orphan, so he can tell "yo mama" jokes, but no one can say them back to him.
Okay.
How about another character?
The Empathizer.
Her power is the superhuman ability to see things from other people's point of view.
Oh, dope.
So she can see people's thoughts and use those thoughts to destroy them.
No.
She's not the violent type, but she could understand why someone else might be.
[Sighs]
I think you and I need to get on the same page.
Why don't we each, separately, come up with 10 ideas for the comic book?
There's bound to be one we both like.
I hear where you're coming from!
That's The Empathizer's catchphrase.
Not into it?
Okay.
10 ideas.
Got it.
Mommy, are you really returning our phone?
You bought the five years ago at a Radio Shack in D.C.
Watch the queen conquer.
Oh, no.
I need to return this phone.
I don't believe we sell this phone.
Oh, good, 'cause I'm not asking you to sell it to me.
I'm asking you to take it back.
I'm sorry.
I can't.
There are limits.
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you owned this store.
- I don't.
- Oh.
So, then, who are you to change the rules?
Is Mr. Save-More here?
Does he know that customers are no longer your first priority?
Ma'am... you know I love our weekly sparring sessions.
This is my job as much as it is my gym some days.
But do you know how it would make me look to take back a phone that you didn't even buy here?
I'm sorry, but my final answer is "no."
Do what you will.
[Gasps] Evan:
Beep.
Beep.
Beep-beep.
Beep.
Beep.
Beep-beep.
Bee-beep.
Beep.
Beep-beep.
Morse code.
That's how we used to communicate.
But now... we use the telephone.
It's what connects us.
That's why it's vital to have one that you're happy with.
I'm sorry, sir, but you're gonna have to wait.
I'm with someone.
I'll be honest with you, Roger.
You're right.
We didn't buy the phone at this store.
But that shouldn't matter.
Let me ask you something.
Do you have a mother?
I do.
Well, then, imagine your mother taking time out of her busy day to come down here, looking for help, only to have someone embarrass her in front of you, her son.
Oh, no.
Do the right thing, Roger, not for the store, but for mothers everywhere.
They're not perfect... but they're ours.
Okay.
I'm gonna take the phone back... and use it to call my mother.
Chapter 8... "Emotional Manipulation."
Binder it, Mommy.
[Mechanical whirring]
What's going on?
I thought we were supposed to be working on our 10 ideas.
I am.
Watching Trent play "Turok" is part of my process.
Right, Trent?
Yeah, he's been, uh...
[Buttons clicking]
[Sighs]
[Scribbling aggressively]
Here, what do you think of this?
Lazy Boy uses the power of flimsy excuses to deflect responsibility and hard work.
Looks kind of rushed.
Lazy Boy is you!
You wanted to team up, but you don't want to do any of the work.
I thought we were doing this as brothers.
You've spent more time with Trent than you have with me.
Whoa!
Don't bring me into...
[Grunting]
You wanted me to do all the work, which, come to think of it, is just like an episode of "Sister, Sister" I saw.
But it was my least... favorite.
I'm going back to doing my own comic.
Have fun with your game.
Fine!
I can trace my own comic book!
It's not that hard.
The words are the best good anyway!
Man, your brother is really...
[Grunting]
Louis:
Jessica?
Why are all the lights off?
Because Evan wanted them off, and who am I to argue?
Are you okay?
Look at this.
This is Evan's binder of returns.
He made it.
He wants me to hold it for him.
He's better than me at arguing.
It's his kingdom now.
The queen is dead.
[Strained] Long live the prince.
Okay.
Even if that's true, is it really so bad?
We want our kids to be better than us, don't we?
Of course, eventually.
But not today!
How would you feel if Eddie beat you at basketball?
Well, I'd be sad.
Ooh!
That's game, Pops!
10-0, me.
How's that goose egg taste?
I'd be sad because I'd be dead.
[Chuckles] That's not happening.
I have nothing left to teach Evan.
He doesn't need me anymore.
[Sighs]
Uh... why are the lights on?
Hi.
I'm Louis Huang.
What are you doing?
I just wanted to introduce myself, since I have no idea who you are right now.
Is this some weird bedroom game?
Because I am not in the mood.
And if I was... you would be dressed quite differently.
The Jessica I know fights for what she wants.
Show Evan he still needs you, that he has a lot left to learn.
Remind him he still needs you.
- Stop it.
- Fine.
Well, what do you want me to do?
Well, what do you want you to do?
[Sighs]
I...want... to... challenge him to another argument and destroy him.
Oh, th-that's not exactly what I was thinking.
Ah, who cares if he's my baby?
I need to be ruthless, like you!
Like, what is it you always say to Eddie when you're playing basketball?
"No sauce in our home!"
[Claps]
Grandma!
_
Come here for a sec!
_
What do you think about this?
Garfield?
_
It's not Garfield.
It's Spaghetti Dog.
Instead of a cat that likes lasagna, it's a dog that likes spaghetti!
_
_
This is way harder than I thought.
_
_
[Sighs]
Hello, Evan.
As you can see, there are two root vegetables in front of me.
Which one is better?
Let's argue.
You go first.
The debate teacher won't let me on the team.
History is littered with great debates...
Lincoln versus Douglas,
Nixon versus JFK...
How 'bout mother versus fool?
[Chuckles] I'm sorry?
Why won't you let my son on your debate team?
I've seen him beat the best.
You can't tell me he's not good enough.
Actually, Evan is good enough.
Uh, he's just too young.
Debate team's only for 5th graders.
- Why?
- Those are just the rules.
You're the debate teacher.
Defend your rule.
[Chuckling] Well, it's not my rule.
It's the school's rule.
Oh, so you don't care about these kids at all?
You just do what your boss tells you to?
Is that why you got into debate, to lie down?
You should work in a mattress store.
[Laughter]
[Laughs] Okay, okay.
She is...
She is using humor to expose a flaw in my argument.
Textbook marginalization.
Write that down.
I would encourage you to think for yourself, the way you encourage your class to think for themselves.
Being young isn't a negative.
It's a positive.
Okay, class, this is her thesis statement.
Let's see how she supports it.
[Regal music plays] Think of other brilliant young prodigies througut history...
Mozart, Joan of Arc, Doogie Howser.
What if someone had told them that they were too young to practice their extraordinary gift?
Little girl... what if someone had prevented you from following your dream?
Am I supposed to answer?
I think you just did.
The passion of children inspires us all to be better.
It's what breathes life into society.
Instead of standing in the way of that, we should embrace it, nurture it, follow it.
As Ms. Whitney Houston said, and I quote,
"I believe the children are our future.
Teach them well and let them lead the way."
[Mr. O'Connor laughs]
You're amazing, Evan's mom!
What's this?
An apology, from Lazy Boy to Nice Man.
I'm sorry I didn't do any work.
Give me another chance.
Let me make it up to you.
"Brother, Brother" for real this time.
Well, Nice Man's motto is,
"Everyone deserves a second chance."
That's why villains always take advantage of him.
All right.
There's still a day before the deadline.
I think we can still come up with a superhero that no one's ever seen before.
Let's do this.
[Door opens]
I'm on the debate team!
Mommy did it!
[Door closes]
You should have seen it.
The teacher was like, "He's too young."
But Mommy was like,
"Young talent is good for society."
And the teacher was all, "Ah!
You convinced me!"
Guess he does still need you.
Mommy was using debate tricks there's not even names for.
Then the class asked if she could be our teacher, and she said, "I hate teachers."
Everyone loved her.
She was like a superhero.
Oh, my God, Eddie.
The perfect superheroes are right in front of us.
Oh, damn.
Here is your debate team exemption form, signed by your teacher.
I'll put it in your binder.
No.
It belongs in yours.
Here you go.
Waste of time.
This is junk.
Let's see this now.
Oh!
By the golden hammer of Thor!
Look at this!
Wow.

One slice of key-lime pie and five spoons.
Although, pineapple cake does sound good.
No.
Pie is superior because it is filled with nutritious fruit.
It is the healthiest dessert.
In fact, pie is so good, dessert couldn't contain it.
It burst out into chicken-pot, mincemeat.
It is the food of shepherds, mathematicians...
Pi...
Infinite possibilities.
But cake is good...
We'll have that piece of...
And here are the reasons why.
Cake represents joy...
Birthdays, graduations, retirements.
No one's ever heard of a wedding pie.
Every important milestone in your life, cake was there.
Cake watched you grow up.
And sure, some may say pie burst out, but I say pie is confused.
It doesn't know what it wants to be.
Is it savory?
Is it sweet?
Shepherd's pie has lamb in it.
Do they seem like good shepherds to you?
So, really, when you think about it, pie is murder.
If you choose life, choose cake.
Let us eat cake!
So, then I said,
"When you think about it, pie is murder.
If you choose life, choose cake."
I did get political.
Thank you, Zack.
Anyway, the place went crazy.
I learned from the best.
Now I'm the best.
Let's take a drive.
What do you think?
This is Nice Man.
He uses the power of overwhelming positivity to diffuse negative situations.
I don't know if he's gonna go with the words I've written.
"Yo mama" jokes?
How is that a super power?
My guy's an orphan, so he can tell "yo mama" jokes, but no one can say them back to him.
Okay.
How about another character?
The Empathizer.
Her power is the superhuman ability to see things from other people's point of view.
Oh, dope.
So she can see people's thoughts and use those thoughts to destroy them.
No.
She's not the violent type, but she could understand why someone else might be.
I think you and I need to get on the same page.
Why don't we each, separately, come up with 10 ideas for the comic book?
There's bound to be one we both like.
I hear where you're coming from!
That's The Empathizer's catchphrase.
Not into it?
Okay.
10 ideas.
Got it.
Mommy, are you really returning our phone?
You bought the five years ago at a Radio Shack in D.C.
Watch the queen conquer.
Oh, no.
I need to return this phone.
I don't believe we sell this phone.
Oh, good, 'cause I'm not asking you to sell it to me.
I'm asking you to take it back.
I'm sorry.
I can't.
There are limits.
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you owned this store.
- I don't.
- Oh.
So, then, who are you to change the rules?
Is Mr. Save-More here?
Does he know that customers are no longer your first priority?
Ma'am... you know I love our weekly sparring sessions.
This is my job as much as it is my gym some days.
But do you know how it would make me look to take back a phone that you didn't even buy here?
I'm sorry, but my final answer is "no."
Do what you will.
Beep.
Beep.
Beep-beep.
Beep.
Beep.
Beep-beep.
Bee-beep.
Beep.
Beep-beep.
Morse code.
That's how we used to communicate.
But now... we use the telephone.
It's what connects us.
That's why it's vital to have one that you're happy with.
I'm sorry, sir, but you're gonna have to wait.
I'm with someone.
I'll be honest with you, Roger.
You're right.
We didn't buy the phone at this store.
But that shouldn't matter.
Let me ask you something.
Do you have a mother?
I do.
Well, then, imagine your mother taking time out of her busy day to come down here, looking for help, only to have someone embarrass her in front of you, her son.
Oh, no.
Do the right thing, Roger, not for the store, but for mothers everywhere.
They're not perfect... but they're ours.
Okay.
I'm gonna take the phone back... and use it to call my mother.
Chapter 8... "Emotional Manipulation."
Binder it, Mommy.
What's going on?
I thought we were supposed to be working on our 10 ideas.
I am.
Watching Trent play "Turok" is part of my process.
Right, Trent?
Yeah, he's been, uh...
Here, what do you think of this?
Lazy Boy uses the power of flimsy excuses to deflect responsibility and hard work.
Looks kind of rushed.
Lazy Boy is you!
You wanted to team up, but you don't want to do any of the work.
I thought we were doing this as brothers.
You've spent more time with Trent than you have with me.
Whoa!
Don't bring me into...
You wanted me to do all the work, which, come to think of it, is just like an episode of "Sister, Sister" I saw.
But it was my least... favorite.
I'm going back to doing my own comic.
Have fun with your game.
Fine!
I can trace my own comic book!
It's not that hard.
The words are the best good anyway!
Man, your brother is really...
Jessica?
Why are all the lights off?
Because Evan wanted them off, and who am I to argue?
Are you okay?
Look at this.
This is Evan's binder of returns.
He made it.
He wants me to hold it for him.
He's better than me at arguing.
It's his kingdom now.
The queen is dead.
Long live the prince.
Okay.
Even if that's true, is it really so bad?
We want our kids to be better than us, don't we?
Of course, eventually.
But not today!
How would you feel if Eddie beat you at basketball?
Well, I'd be sad.
Ooh!
That's game, Pops!
10-0, me.
How's that goose egg taste?
I'd be sad because I'd be dead.
That's not happening.
I have nothing left to teach Evan.
He doesn't need me anymore.
Uh... why are the lights on?
Hi.
I'm Louis Huang.
What are you doing?
I just wanted to introduce myself, since I have no idea who you are right now.
Is this some weird bedroom game?
Because I am not in the mood.
And if I was... you would be dressed quite differently.
The Jessica I know fights for what she wants.
Show Evan he still needs you, that he has a lot left to learn.
Remind him he still needs you.
- Stop it.
- Fine.
Well, what do you want me to do?
Well, what do you want you to do?
I...want... to... challenge him to another argument and destroy him.
Oh, th-that's not exactly what I was thinking.
Ah, who cares if he's my baby?
I need to be ruthless, like you!
Like, what is it you always say to Eddie when you're playing basketball?
"No sauce in our home!"
Grandma!
_
Come here for a sec!
_
What do you think about this?
Garfield?
_
It's not Garfield.
It's Spaghetti Dog.
Instead of a cat that likes lasagna, it's a dog that likes spaghetti!
_

This is way harder than I thought.

Hello, Evan.
As you can see, there are two root vegetables in front of me.
Which one is better?
Let's argue.
You go first.
The debate teacher won't let me on the team.
History is littered with great debates...
Lincoln versus Douglas,
Nixon versus JFK...
How 'bout mother versus fool?
I'm sorry?
Why won't you let my son on your debate team?
I've seen him beat the best.
You can't tell me he's not good enough.
Actually, Evan is good enough.
Uh, he's just too young.
Debate team's only for 5th graders.
- Why?
- Those are just the rules.
You're the debate teacher.
Defend your rule.
Well, it's not my rule.
It's the school's rule.
Oh, so you don't care about these kids at all?
You just do what your boss tells you to?
Is that why you got into debate, to lie down?
You should work in a mattress store.
Okay, okay.
She is...
She is using humor to expose a flaw in my argument.
Textbook marginalization.
Write that down.
I would encourage you to think for yourself, the way you encourage your class to think for themselves.
Being young isn't a negative.
It's a positive.
Okay, class, this is her thesis statement.
Let's see how she supports it.
Think of other brilliant young prodigies througut history...
Mozart, Joan of Arc, Doogie Howser.
What if someone had told them that they were too young to practice their extraordinary gift?
Little girl... what if someone had prevented you from following your dream?
Am I supposed to answer?
I think you just did.
The passion of children inspires us all to be better.
It's what breathes life into society.
Instead of standing in the way of that, we should embrace it, nurture it, follow it.
As Ms. Whitney Houston said, and I quote,
"I believe the children are our future.
Teach them well and let them lead the way."
You're amazing, Evan's mom!
What's this?
An apology, from Lazy Boy to Nice Man.
I'm sorry I didn't do any work.
Give me another chance.
Let me make it up to you.
"Brother, Brother" for real this time.
Well, Nice Man's motto is,
"Everyone deserves a second chance."
That's why villains always take advantage of him.
All right.
There's still a day before the deadline.
I think we can still come up with a superhero that no one's ever seen before.
Let's do this.
I'm on the debate team!
Mommy did it!
You should have seen it.
The teacher was like, "He's too young."
But Mommy was like,
"Young talent is good for society."
And the teacher was all, "Ah!
You convinced me!"
Guess he does still need you.
Mommy was using debate tricks there's not even names for.
Then the class asked if she could be our teacher, and she said, "I hate teachers."
Everyone loved her.
She was like a superhero.
Oh, my God, Eddie.
The perfect superheroes are right in front of us.
Oh, damn.
Here is your debate team exemption form, signed by your teacher.
I'll put it in your binder.
No.
It belongs in yours.
Here you go.
Waste of time.
This is junk.
Let's see this now.
Oh!
By the golden hammer of Thor!
Look at this!
Wow.

Oh, boy!
This is what I've been looking for!
Previously on "blacklist:
Redemption"...
Remember, whitehall... she has to tell you about whitehall.
Your accomplice...
I need to know his name.
He's your son.
I don't know anything about whitehall.
If you tell me, nothing will happen to you.
Who are you?
I am Richard whitehall.
Whitehall has cracked quantum computing.
A computer with this kind of speed would mean the end of privacy as we know it.
If scottie moves from a prototype to a working model, the woman would be unstoppable.
As of today, I will do everything in my power to take back control of the company that I created.
I know you're watching, honey, and I'm coming for you.
Yeah, I got it.
I got it.
Did you see that?
Yeah.
All right.
Just keep walking.
I got it.
Hi.
Hey!
Hey, hey!
You... you can't go in there!
Quantum computing is like a skeleton key.
The original mainframe computers were the size of this room.
You know a computer that's 10,000 times more powerful?
This.
That's the difference between what's being used today and what anyone who gets their hands on whitehall's device will be using tomorrow.
Today, cellphones, laptops are vulnerable.
Tomorrow, it'll be banking, classified systems, troop movements, nuclear codes.
Scottie's holding whitehall inside halcyon.
We can't just walk him out.
No.
We have to break him out.
Of halcyon?
Any chance you got a plan "b"?
My plan "b" is already under way.
The reason I went public is to force the board to call a meeting to decide who to believe, scottie or me.
The board already sided with her.
I'm not going in to lobby for votes.
I'm going in through the front to enable you to launch a tactical assault through the back.
How are we gonna do that?
You leave that to me.
All you have to worry about is assembling a team that'll stay off of halcyon's radar.
High risk, low probability of success.
Got any takers?
Yeah, I think I do.
We talked about this.
It was a mistake.
I'm sorry.
We didn't talk about it.
I told you I knew about you and Kat, that you were sleeping with my assistant.
You apologized.
That acknowledgment, not talk.
Do you want to talk about it?
No, 'cause there's nothing to talk about.
'Cause if we did talk about it,
I'd probably end up taking that ice pick and stabbing you with it.
The board meeting.
Are you worried?
Of course.
Howard plays dirty.
But I have a few tricks to play.
What's this?
Insurance.
I need your vote in the board meeting.
Where did you get this?
Doesn't matter.
Your soon-to-be ex is asking for full custody of Isaac and Hannah.
She's not getting it, once a judge sees her snorting her child-support payments.
Of course I'm with you.
Can't afford to have Howard upend everything we've been working on.
Looking for a refill?
Nah, I'm trying to kick it.
I'm here to sell you on something.
We got a business proposal for you.
Hands up.
Now.
What's in there?
We need your help.
We're willing to pay.
This is the first installment.
We don't need your money.
Well, that's good, because I didn't bring any.
Taaffeite.
A million times scarcer than diamonds.
Retail price, $4,000 a carat.
You're looking at 1,000 carats.
You do the math.
You trust her?
She cool.
Kind of help you looking for?
The kind that could get you killed.
So?
So, enhanced interrogation works.
And since you don't want me using it on señor whitehall, the results are mixed.
Maybe he's working with Howard, maybe not.
I'll talk to him.
Howard's almost here.
Escort him in.
Watch him.
He's here for whitehall, which means he's got a plan to get him out.
Curing certain cancers, making more effective drugs, discovering distant planets, driverless cars.
That is the promise of my inventions.
Healthier, smarter, safer.
There are so many rewards.
But all you see is the evil this can do.
Why is that?
Because someone has to live in the shadows so others can live in the light.
I'll take him from here.
Scottie asked me to escort you to the board.
Phyllis.
- It's wonderful to see you.
- You, too, sir.
Jesse.
How are the twins?
Doing great.
Bob.
It's good to be back to see you.
- Denise, hi.
- Do any of you really think
I'm capable of trying to murder my husband?
I do.
Scottie.
Howard.
What's the matter?
You all look like you've seen a ghost.
So, who do you want to hear from first?
I say brains before beauty.
So, scottie, you're up.
Morning.
Nothing about any hvac units today.
Well, I have four in the back, three other trips to make by lunch.
Can I leave them with you?
Let...
let's check them out.
My man.
If this feels like déjà vu all over again, that's because it is.
Six months ago, I came before the board because I had concluded that the husband I loved and adored was gone, that he had become delusional, and that it was your fiduciary responsibility to remove him as head of this company.
My company.
Which I created, in all my delusional grandeur.
You agreed with my assessment then, and everything that's happened since only reinforces the conclusion that Howard is not of sound mind.
By his own admission, he faked his death.
Howard's not well.
But he is dangerous.
Since his tragic death, Howard's been pursuing the holy grail of the digital age...
Quantum computing.
Quantum computing's a pipe dream.
No, it's not.
It's real.
The man responsible for the breakthrough is here.
As a prisoner.
He's here so my husband can't force him to give him his technology.
Howard knew about it, pursued it...
In secret, away from us, from this company.
Why would he do that?
There's only one explanation.
Howard is no longer working for this company.
He is working against it.
It's simple.
Snatch, grab, and go.
It'd be a lot simpler if we had real bullets.
- They do.
- No.
Whitehall's being held by people we know.
They believe they're doing the right thing.
They're not.
So tranqs only.
That's what you signed up for.
Everything else gets left in the Van.
Everything.
I am not normal.
And I have no interest in being normal.
I think normal is boring.
I believe in conspiracies.
I think delusions are the same as dog whistles.
Just because you can't hear them or see them doesn't mean they're not real.
We breach on Howard's signal.
Now, not being normal isn't the same as being nuts.
Nuts would be faking your own death,
You pretended to be dead.
Isn't that the same thing?
I didn't fake my death.
I simply avoided being murdered.
Come on, that's ridiculous.
Is it?
This is a preliminary report of the ntsb, indicating that the landing gear on my plane had been tampered with.
See this?
The qr code.
So?
The conference-room table is covered with smart glass and is smart enough to read that.
What'll the code tell it to do?
Calculate chess positions for 100,000 games played simultaneously.
You're gonna overheat the servers.
Triggering a cooling protocol, which includes opening the air vents from the server room to the parking lot.
We're in.
Let's go.
This warning light means the servers are overheating, and they never overheat.
I got to run a diagnostics.
Get a tac team up to level a.
The ntsb report is inconclusive.
Someone tampered with your landing gear,
And scottie could be holding Dr. whitehall against his will to protect him from me and not to force him to build a prototype of his invention, but I think we all know that she's not.
Of course, we could ask him.
What do you think, honey?
Should we call him in?
Shh.
You guys shouldn't be here.
Who the hell are these guys?
You don't want to know.
We need the access codes.
Yeah, well, you did try to decapitate Solomon.
No, we threw a bomb on his head.
It's a little different.
But just give us the codes.
He's fine, by the way.
I'm sure he'd love to see you.
Why don't I go tell him you're here?
I love you, buddy.
If you don't tell me whitehall's location and the code in the next five seconds...
I will shoot you with a tranq dart in the face.
You would do that?
Try me.
Lebron.
Really?
Lebron?
Cleveland against the world.
The allegations you both made could not be more serious.
They are, and should be, the subject of a criminal investigation.
The final decision of the board will rest in part on the outcome of that investigation, but that could take months, if not years.
The company needs a direction now.
Aah!
Aah!
By a show of hands, all those in favor of restoring Howard hargrave as ceo.
Don't shoot!
I'm unarmed!
Aah!
All those in favor of keeping scottie hargrave in charge.
Tranqs were a bad idea.
Grab a gun.
Check on vito.
- Zip-tie these guys.
- Got it.
Vito!
You all right, man?
Man.
Solomon.
Nez.
Nez, come on.
Come on.
You guys hang here and wait for Howard's orders.
Howard, I'm sorry.
The vote was five to two against you.
A count I assume scottie bought and paid for.
I didn't come here to win your vote, Jack.
That's him.
Let's go.
Then, why did you come?
To rescue whitehall.
And h-how do you plan on doing that?
By taking over this facility.
Hear that?
Anyone?
That is the sound of a dog whistle.
What is this, Howard?
You want to tell us what the hell's going on?
- Patience.
- Howard, unlock the door.
Dr. whitehall will be released from Dr. hargrave's confinement shortly, and he will explain.
- If you don't release us...
- Unlock the door.
when you hear what this woman has been willing to do...
Stay put.
Everybody, stay put.
Your chariot has arrived.
Howard.
Don't make him do something you might regret.
Let's go.
We need to get to whitehall.
Tom and Nez might already be there.
We know where he is.
They may not.
And after we get him?
Unh-unh.
I don't know yet.
I'm taking it one crisis at a time.
Great idea.
Hold on, everyone.
Just hold on.
These two fine gentlemen, misters...
Devon.
Jimmy.
Mr. Devon and Mr. Jimmy are here to protect you.
You really have lost your mind.
No one leaves.
Time to go.
You're not safe here.
Go!
Go!
Scottie!
With me... now.
I want you to bring up the subbasement.
The surveillance feeds, schematics?
Everything.
Scottie, stop!
Go!
The code doesn't work.
And these windows are bulletproof.
He's having way too much fun.
What's going on?
I demand you let me go.
I changed the key code.
Buys us a little time but not much.
Howard has control of the system.
He can unlock it.
Not anymore.
They knocked us off the grid.
We're on reserve juice.
Scottie's got whitehall barricaded in the subbasement.
Wouldn't cutting the power cause the doors to automatically unlock?
In the even of a power loss, the lock will automatically engage.
What about the cargo elevator?
That's not on the reserve system.
They can't get out that way.
Meaning we can't get in.
There are other ways to get in.
Damn it.
Solomon, put her on the phone.
Scottie, think about this.
You can't get out, and in four minutes, we're coming in.
I'm not giving him to Howard.
You don't have a choice.
Howard, remember the world summit on innovation?
We stayed up all night working on your speech, how quantum computing would outstrip human capabilities, that if its development wasn't managed carefully, humanity would risk engineering its own extinction?
You convinced me then we could never let that kind of power fall into the hands of some deranged, maniacal madman.
I just never thought that madman would be you.
You're not in the boardroom anymore, honey.
You can drop the act.
Scottie, you don't have any leverage.
Of course I do.
Please don't make me use it.
Come through that door, and I will put a bullet through whitehall's head.
The hell you will!
Scottie, don't... don't do this.
Are you... are you there?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
If I'm going to die,
I'd like to die in my bed, in my sleep, having told my wife I love her, perhaps rereading the final chapter of "Moby-dick."
Unfortunately for you, sir, there is only one way out.
We can commandeer the elevator.
Not possible.
We've been cut off from the power grid.
And reserve power does not go to the cargo elevator.
Even if you can get the elevator to work,
Howard will know the second you do.
Well...
That's your problem to solve.
I'm worried about getting out alive.
We're almost in.
I'm not convinced that's gonna work.
Mr. Solomon, is it?
Are you familiar with schrodinger's cat?
Yes.
It's a paradox.
Cat's sealed in the box with poison, simultaneously alive and dead until you open up the box and observe it.
Exactly.
This is nothing like that.
When they open this box, we're just dead.
They're almost in.
You got two minutes or less.
It works.
Get in.
This should give us about 30 seconds' worth of lift.
That'll get us to the next floor.
They're on the move.
Lock down bay six.
They're getting away.
Go.
Go now.
Well, here goes our ride now.
You don't have any bullets.
He doesn't know that.
Hey!
Scottie!
We got company.
Come on.
Please don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
Come on.
There's nothing we can do, scottie.
Get in the car.
Dr. whitehall, you are safe now.
That seems to be the only thing you and your wife agree on.
Speaking of scottie...
No.
Or Solomon.
If you'll come with me, sir, there are some people I'd like you to meet.
I want everyone released.
They were trying to kill us.
They were only doing their jobs.
Take everyone into the command center.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Just hold still.
Hold still.
Okay, there.
Keep the pressure on.
You're closer to scottie than anyone else.
Do you believe what he's saying about her?
Apologies.
Where's scottie?
I would like to introduce Richard whitehall.
Where is she?
Is she all right?
I don't know, and, yeah, scottie is unhurt.
I wish everyone was.
I genuinely regret having to resort to such extreme measures.
You can't take the company back by force.
You need our consent.
Agreed.
And if I don't get it, I'm prepared to walk away...
After you hear what Dr. whitehall has to say.
I did what I thought I had to do in order for you to hear him out.
And I'm very sorry, but it seems like a small price to pay for the truth.
Doctor.
I'll do my best.
To begin with,
I am not in business with Howard hargrave.
I'm here because I was abducted by scottie hargrave.
You all must be very confused.
I know I would be.
To those who stood against me, you did what you were trained to do, defend the company.
To those who stood with me,
I ask you to accept that we must now all work together.
To those loyal to scottie,
I'll tell you what I told the board.
I'm only interested in the truth.
She will have her day in court.
But, first, we have to find her.
Anyone who is not comfortable with that mission may leave now.
With my blessings.
Thank you.
That's all.
Dumont.
Sir.
You knew that they had access to the elevator, and yet, you said nothing.
And that allowed scottie to escape.
Now you're gonna help us find her.
How did my team access the facility?
You...
Programmed the servers to overheat, opening the vents.
Which shut down the network.
I want you to get it back up.
Yes, sir.
That's what it looks like, not what it is.
Look, Dr. whitehall sees it differently.
- I held him for his own good.
- You made your case.
- I kept him from Howard.
- Howard made his.
And now you're siding with him?
Whitehall sided with him.
Yeah, well, that's only because let it go, scottie.
You've got other things to worry about.
I just got the results of an internal investigation launched after Howard's press conference.
There is a string of financial irregularities on your watch, including several off-the-book facilities.
Who's seen this?
Everyone.
Scottie, I don't know what you've done, and I don't want to know.
Do yourself a favor.
Whatever it is, get ahead of it.
Here's what we owe you.
Let me know how to contact Zeke and vito's families, and I'll make sure they get their share.
Thanks, man.
Hey, one more thing.
You're done selling drugs to Nez.
Tom.
All due respect, playboy, man's got to make a living.
All due respect, Nez is like a daughter to Howard, which means she's like a sister to me.
I think you can see we're pretty generous with those who help.
I'm a lot less generous with those who don't.
You got me?
Where are you?
You all right?
I'm nowhere close to all right.
and I need your help to carry it out.
Yeah, whatever you need.
Is the artax network back online?
Dumont's working on it.
I need him to stop.
Okay.
Yeah, of course.
I'll tell him.
Howard's looking everywhere for me.
I need to get across town without him finding me.
Okay, but then where are you gonna go?
Just tell dumont.
Is the system online yet?
Working as fast as I can, okay?
Just got to reboot this server.
Wait.
Talked to scottie.
She's fine, but she's on the run, doesn't really want us looking for her.
Hargrave wants the network up.
She wants it down.
Just 20 more minutes.
Did you know about whitehall?
About her holding him?
She's been good to me.
She's been good to me, too.
And I'm not sure what's right or wrong here...
Online, offline, but I have to decide whether to flip the switch or not.
And before I do, I want to know if she told you about whitehall.
Is the network up yet?
I got one last problem to solve.
Kat's helping me with it.
With what?
Simple binary choice.
Did she or didn't she?
Yes or no?
No.
She didn't.
Okay.
Good.
That's the answer I needed.
We're good to go.
System's up.
Satellite, cctv, mta, dmv, snapchat... everything.
I want to know the second you get a hit.
If we find her, what's gonna happen to her?
Justice.
I loved her once.
In some ways, I still do.
I know how difficult this is, but it's the right thing to do.
I want to thank you for helping me do it.
So, how are we playing this?
The intel marienthal showed me, for all we know, Howard's seen it.
You think Howard's guys will be here?
So we have to assume the answer is yes.
Well, then, there's only one way to play this.
Let's do it.
Guys, I think I got them.
Where?
A former pharmaceutical plant in williamsburg.
Corner of flushing and spring.
Bring up any images you have of the area.
We'll meet the FBI there.
Everybody on the ground.
Come on.
Hands up in the air.
Now.
I-I don't understand.
What are you doing?
You know how many, scottie.
Nine per shift.
How do you know her name?
I should know her name.
She hired me.
She hired all of us.
- Hey!
- Hey.
Careful.
I am just...
I-i want to show you something.
Work orders for the week, all signed by you.
I've got three months' worth in back.
Purifiers, flame extractors.
This is made up, all of it.
I think you know that it's not made up.
Whitehall prototype.
You want to tell me what's going on here, scottie?
A frame-up.
That's what's going on.
And I fell right into it.
Keen, Rowan.
We're with halcyon.
Agents lamb and noxon, FBI.
What are we looking at?
Friends of ours.
Very armed, very dangerous.
What's here?
What's inside?
- We don't know.
- Curious to find out.
You've never been here before.
No.
And you do not know these guys.
Look at me, scottie.
If Howard set you up, then the cops will be on their way.
We got to move.
Federal agents!
Don't move!
All right.
Go back to the lab.
Find a different way out.
I'll lay down cover fire.
There are too many.
If I can get to one of the techs,
I'll take one of them as a hostage.
Gun down.
Somebody's gonna put their gun down, but it's not gonna be me.
You backed the wrong horse, Nez.
Matty, I didn't think you believed in right and wrong.
Scottie is the good guy here.
Scottie lied about everything.
She's not who we thought she was.
This place is proof of that.
I hope that the truth comes out in the justice system.
But since I don't intend on letting the justice system deliberate the truth about me, this is where I step off.
The only surviving member of the pequod.
It's the whaling ship in "Moby-dick."
It went down.
Took everyone with it except ishmael.
And how did he survive?
"Buoyed up by that coffin,"
I floated on a soft and dirgelike main.
The unharming sharks, they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths.
On the second day, a sail drew near.
It was the devious-cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search after her missing children,
"only found another orphan."
I'll find you.
God, I hope so.
Stop it.
Stop!
Stop!
It's over.
It's over.
Howard's setting me up.
If that's true, then come in.
If you're really innocent, then you have nothing to hide.
I can't.
I can't do that.
Well, that sounds like guilty.
Look, I understand why it's hard for you to believe me, but we both know Howard did something incredibly cruel and didn't allow you to tell me that you're my son, that after all these years, you're still alive.
That cruelty was also a blessing because you got to see how I truly feel about my son, that I never stopped loving him.
I never stopped loving you.
If you know how I feel, then you know who I am.
And if you know that, can you honestly tell me that you believe what Howard says about me?
Today, I can.
Susan hargrave, you're under arrest for kidnapping and false imprisonment.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
My answer's no.
Usually, we like to get the question out first.
You showed me the ntsb report.
It says the landing gear on Howard's plane was tampered with.
You want to know if I think she did it.
Do you?
Of course she did.
This an accurate prototype?
Completely.
I can't believe how close she came.
And it could've only been built by someone who had access to my research.
And no one had that other than scottie hargrave?
Scottie hargrave and me.
You were the only ones authorized to make payments
- from this account.
- That's right.
This is a payment schedule from the account.
Everything related to the construction of the prototype,
Mrs. hargrave denies knowing anything about.
7:29 A.M. on 3/1.
11:45 P.M. on 3/9.
6:15 A.M. on 3:17.
If you're asking me whether I made these payments, the answer is no.
I wasn't even working at these times.
So, if Ms. Carlson didn't make the payments, then it must've been you.
Gotcha.
I'm sorry it ended this way.
Yeah, me too.
What you said before about me
- being like a sister to you...
- I meant it.
Good.
Whatever help you need.
I like what you've done with the place.
How does it feel?
It feels...
Right, this, being here with you.
You know, my daughter turns...
She turns 1 next week.
This isn't the end, you know?
This is just the beginning.
Yeah.
For our family, which I hope...
I want you to be a part of.
And I want you to be a part of this.
I know.
Maybe, someday.
Who knows?
For now, I am going home to my daughter's birthday.
Well, of course you are.
You should.
You're coming to the party by the way.
It's a Princess theme, so I hope you've got a tiara.
I wouldn't miss it.
You did it, dad.
We did, son.
Together.
Tiara?
Yeah, you got it.
Hey.
Saved you a piece of cheesecake.
Cheesecake?
Yeah, cheesecake.
The truth is, I knew you'd come back sooner or later, that it was only a matter of time before you realized what a huge mistake
- it was to dump me.
- Can you explain this?
Explain what?
What... what is it?
Payment authorizations.
For the construction of a sophisticated
- computer prototype.
- What is there to...
- Look at the dates and times.
- I don't...
Look at the dates and times!
Okay, okay.
I'm looking.
- What am I looking at?
- Transactions.
Made from my computer and dates and times when we were together.
All except one that was made on my phone...
After you switched it with yours, after you made it look like it was an innocent mistake.
It was you, wasn't it?
You were working with Howard the whole time.
He used you to get close to her, to get access to her files.
It was you that made it all work.
The frame-up.
Making it look like scottie was this guilty...
Couldn't get to her files.
She was too smart.
But you...
You actually thought I cared.
I'm sorry.
Last thing anyone's ever gonna say to you is,
"this is all your fault."
is he here?
Yes, sir.
Arrived an hour ago.
Now, my flight leaves in two hours.
I should be home for dinner.
Like you said when I left, what could possibly go wrong?
Kat.
Jesus!
What happened?
What is this?
What's on this?
The truth.
It's him.
Where are we?
We are operational.
Previously on "Blacklist:
Redemption"...
Remember, Whitehall... she has to tell you about Whitehall.
Your accomplice...
I need to know his name.
He's your son.
I don't know anything about Whitehall.
If you tell me, nothing will happen to you.
Who are you?
I am Richard Whitehall.
Whitehall has cracked quantum computing.
A computer with this kind of speed would mean the end of privacy as we know it.
If Scottie moves from a prototype to a working model, the woman would be unstoppable.
As of today, I will do everything in my power to take back control of the company that I created.
I know you're watching, honey, and I'm coming for you.
Yeah, I got it.
I got it.
Oh, my God.
Did you see that?
Yeah.
- All right.
Just keep walking.
- I got it.
Hey!
Hey, hey!
You-you can't go in there!
_
Quantum computing is like a skeleton key.
The original mainframe computers were the size of this room.
You know a computer that's 10,000 times more powerful?
This.
That's the difference between what's being used today and what anyone who gets their hands on Whitehall's device will be using tomorrow.
Today, cellphones, laptops are vulnerable.
Tomorrow, it'll be banking, classified systems, troop movements, nuclear codes.
Scottie's holding Whitehall inside Halcyon.
We can't just walk him out.
No.
We have to break him out.
Of Halcyon?
Any chance you got a plan "B"?
My plan "B" is already under way.
The reason I went public is to force the board to call a meeting to decide who to believe,
Scottie or me.
The board already sided with her.
I'm not going in to lobby for votes.
I'm going in through the front to enable you to launch a tactical assault through the back.
- How are we gonna do that?
- You leave that to me.
All you have to worry about is assembling a team that'll stay off of Halcyon's radar.
High risk, low probability of success.
Got any takers?
Yeah, I think I do.
We talked about this.
It was a mistake.
I'm sorry.
We didn't talk about it.
I told you I knew about you and Kat, that you were sleeping with my assistant.
You apologized.
That's acknowledgment, not talk.
Do you want to talk about it?
No, 'cause there's nothing to talk about.
'Cause if we did talk about it,
I'd probably end up taking that ice pick and stabbing you with it.
The board meeting... are you worried?
Of course.
Howard plays dirty.
But I have a few tricks to play.
- What's this?
- Insurance.
I need your vote in the board meeting.
- Where did you get this?
- Doesn't matter.
Your soon-to-be ex is asking for full custody of Isaac and Hannah.
She's not getting it, once a judge sees her snorting her child-support payments.
Of course I'm with you.
Good.
Can't afford to have Howard upend everything we've been working on.
Looking for a refill?
Nah, I'm trying to kick it.
I'm here to sell you on something.
We got a business proposal for you.
Hands up.
Now.
What's in there?
We need your help.
We're willing to pay.
This is the first installment.
We don't need your money.
Well, that's good, because I didn't bring any.
Mm.
Taaffeite.
A million times scarcer than diamonds.
Retail price, $4,000 a carat.
You're looking at 1,000 carats.
You do the math.
You trust her?
She cool.
Kind of help you looking for?
The kind that could get you killed.
So?
So, enhanced interrogation works.
And since you don't want me using it on señor Whitehall, the results are mixed.
Maybe he's working with Howard, maybe not.
I'll talk to him.
Howard's almost here.
Escort him in.
Watch him.
He's here for Whitehall, which means he's got a plan to get him out.
Curing certain cancers, making more effective drugs, discovering distant planets, driver-less cars.
That is the promise of my inventions.
Healthier, smarter, safer.
There are so many rewards.
But all you see is the evil this can do.
Why is that?
Because someone has to live in the shadows so others can live in the light.
I'll take him from here.
Scottie asked me to escort you to the board.
Phyllis.
- It's wonderful to see you.
- You, too, sir.
Jesse.
- How are the twins?
- Doing great.
Bob.
It's good to be back to see you.
- Do any of you really think...
- Denise, hi.
... I'm capable of trying to murder my husband?
I do.
Scottie.
Howard.
What's the matter?
You all look like you've seen a ghost.
So, who do you want to hear from first?
I say brains before beauty.
So, Scottie, you're up.
Morning.
Nothing about any HVAC units today.
Well, I have four in the back, three other trips to make by lunch.
Can I leave them with you?
- Let...
let's check them out.
- My man.
If this feels like déjà vu all over again, that's because it is.
Six months ago, I came before the board because I had concluded... that the husband I loved and adored was gone, that he had become delusional, and that it was your fiduciary responsibility to remove him as head of this company.
My company... which I created, in all my delusional grandeur.
You agreed with my assessment then, and everything that's happened since only reinforces the conclusion that Howard is not of sound mind.
By his own admission, he faked his death.
Howard's not well.
But he is dangerous.
Since his tragic death,
Howard's been pursuing the Holy Grail of the digital age... quantum computing.
Quantum computing's a pipe dream.
No, it's not.
It's real.
The man responsible for the breakthrough is here.
As a prisoner.
He's here so my husband can't force him to give him his technology.
Howard knew about it, pursued it... in secret, away from us, from this company.
Why would he do that?
There's only one explanation.
Howard is no longer working for this company.
He is working against it.
It's simple.
Snatch, grab, and go.
It'd be a lot simpler if we had real bullets.
- They do.
- No.
Whitehall's being held by people we know.
They believe they're doing the right thing.
They're not.
So tranqs only.
That's what you signed up for.
Everything else gets left in the van.
Everything.
I am not normal.
And I have no interest in being normal.
I think normal is boring.
I believe in conspiracies.
I think delusions are the same as dog whistles.
Just because you can't hear them or see them doesn't mean they're not real.
We breach on Howard's signal.
Now, not being normal isn't the same as being nuts.
Nuts would be faking your own death, and I didn't do that.
You pretended to be dead.
Isn't that the same thing?
I didn't fake my death.
I simply avoided being murdered.
- Oh, come on, that's ridiculous.
- Is it?
This is... a preliminary report of the NTSB, indicating that the landing gear on my plane had been tampered with.
- See this?
- The QR code.
So?
The conference-room table is covered with smart glass and is smart enough to read that.
What'll the code tell it to do?
Calculate chess positions for 100,000 games played simultaneously.
You're gonna overheat the servers.
Triggering a cooling protocol, which includes opening the air vents from the server room to the parking lot.
We're in.
Let's go.
This warning light means the servers are overheating, and they never overheat.
I got to run a diagnostics.
Get a tac team up to Level A.
The NTSB report is inconclusive.
Someone tampered with your landing gear, but it could've been you.
And Scottie could be holding Dr. Whitehall against his will to protect him from me and not to force him to build a prototype of his invention, but I think we all know that she's not.
Of course, we could ask him.
What do you think, honey?
Should we call him in?
Shh.
You guys shouldn't be here.
Who the hell are these guys?
You don't want to know.
We need the access codes.
They locked us out of the system.
Yeah, well, you did try to decapitate Solomon.
No, we threw a bomb on his head.
It's a little different.
But just give us the codes.
He's fine, by the way.
I'm sure he'd love to see you.
- Why don't I go tell him you're here?
- I love you, buddy.
If you don't tell me Whitehall's location and the code in the next five seconds...
I will shoot you with a tranq dart in the face.
You would do that?
Try me.
LeBron.
Really?
LeBron?
Cleveland against the world.
The allegations you both made... could not be more serious.
They are, and should be, the subject of a criminal investigation.
The final decision of the board will rest in part... on the outcome of that investigation, but that could take months, if not years.
The company needs a direction now.
Aah!
Aah!
By a show of hands, all those in favor of restoring Howard Hargrave as CEO.
Don't shoot!
I'm unarmed!
Aah!
All those in favor of keeping Scottie Hargrave in charge.
Tranqs were a bad idea.
Grab a gun.
Check on Vito.
- Zip-tie these guys.
- Got it.
Vito!
You all right, man?
Oh, man.
Solomon.
Nez.
Nez, come on.
Come on.
You guys hang here and wait for Howard's orders.
Howard, I'm sorry.
The vote was five to two against you.
A count I assume Scottie bought and paid for.
I didn't come here to win your vote, Jack.
That's him.
Let's go.
Then, why did you come?
To rescue Whitehall.
Oh, and h-how do you plan on doing that?
By taking over this facility.
Hear that?
Anyone?
That is the sound of a dog whistle.
What is this, Howard?
You want to tell us what the hell's going on?
- Patience.
- Howard, unlock the door.
Dr. Whitehall will be released from Mrs. Hargrave's confinement shortly, and he will explain.
- If you don't release us...
- Unlock the door.
When you hear the truth, when you hear what this woman has been willing to do...
Stay put.
Everybody, stay put.
Your chariot has arrived.
Ah, ah, ah.
Howard.
Don't make him do something you might regret.
Let's go.
We need to get to Whitehall.
Tom and Nez might already be there.
We know where he is.
They may not.
And after we get him?
Unh-unh.
I don't know yet.
I'm taking it one crisis at a time.
Great idea.
Hold on, everyone.
Just hold on.
These two fine gentlemen, misters...
Devon.
Jimmy.
Mr. Devon and Mr. Jimmy are here to protect you.
You really have lost your mind.
No one leaves.
- Time to go.
- You're not safe here.
Go!
Go!
Scottie!
With me... now.
I want you to bring up the sub-basement.
- The surveillance feeds, schematics?
- Everything.
Scottie, stop!
Go!
The code doesn't work.
And these windows are bulletproof.
He's having way too much fun.
What's going on?
I demand you let me go.
I changed the key code.
Buys us a little time but not much.
Howard has control of the system.
He can unlock it.
Not anymore.
They knocked us off the grid.
We're on reserve juice.
Scottie's got Whitehall barricaded in the sub-basement.
Wouldn't cutting the power cause the doors to automatically unlock?
In the even of a power loss, the lock will automatically engage.
What about the cargo elevator?
That's not on the reserve system.
They can't get out that way.
Meaning we can't get in.
Oh, there are other ways to get in.
Damn it.
Solomon, put her on the phone.
Scottie, think about this.
You can't get out, and in four minutes, we're coming in.
I'm not giving him to Howard.
You don't have a choice.
Howard... remember the World Summit on Innovation?
Geneva?
We stayed up all night working on your speech, how quantum computing would outstrip human capabilities, that if its development wasn't managed carefully, humanity would risk engineering its own extinction?
You convinced me then we could never let that kind of power fall into the hands of some deranged, maniacal madman.
I just never thought that madman would be you.
You're not in the boardroom anymore, honey.
You can drop the act.
Scottie, you don't have any leverage.
Of course I do.
Please don't make me use it.
Come through that door, and I will put a bullet through Whitehall's head.
The hell you will!
Scottie, don't... don't do this.
Are you... are you there?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
If I'm going to die,
I'd like to die in my bed, in my sleep, having told my wife I love her, perhaps re-reading the final chapter of "Moby-Dick."
Unfortunately for you, sir, there is only one way out.
We can commandeer the elevator.
Not possible.
We've been cut off from the power grid, and reserve power does not go to the cargo elevator.
Even if you can get the elevator to work,
Howard will know the second you do.
Well... that's your problem to solve.
I'm worried about getting out alive.
We're almost in.
I'm not convinced that's gonna work.
Mr. Solomon, is it?
Are you familiar with Schrodinger's cat?
Oh, yes.
It's a paradox.
Cat's sealed in the box with poison, simultaneously alive and dead until you open up the box and observe it.
Exactly.
This is nothing like that.
When they open this box, we're just dead.
They're almost in.
You got two minutes or less.
_
It works.
Get in.
This should give us about 30 seconds' worth of lift.
That'll get us to the next floor.
They're on the move.
Lock down Bay Six.
They're getting away.
Go.
Go now.
Well, here goes our ride now.
You don't have any bullets.
He doesn't know that.
Hey!
Scottie!
We got company.
Come on.
Please don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
Come on.
There's nothing we can do, Scottie.
Get in the car.
Dr. Whitehall, you are safe now.
That seems to be the only thing you and your wife agree on.
- Speaking of Scottie...
- No.
Or Solomon.
If you'll come with me, sir, there are some people I'd like you to meet.
I want everyone released.
They were trying to kill us.
They were only doing their jobs.
Take everyone into the command center.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Just hold still.
Hold still.
Okay, there.
Keep the pressure on.
You're closer to Scottie than anyone else.
Do you believe what he's saying about her?
Apologies.
Where's Scottie?
I would like to introduce Richard Whitehall.
Where is she?
Is she all right?
I don't know, and, yeah, Scottie is unhurt.
I wish everyone was.
I genuinely regret having to resort to such extreme measures.
You can't take the company back by force.
You need our consent.
Agreed.
And if I don't get it, I'm prepared to walk away... after you hear what Dr. Whitehall has to say.
I did what I thought I had to do in order for you to hear him out.
And I'm very sorry, but it seems like a small price to pay for the truth.
Doctor.
I'll do my best.
To begin with, I am not in business... with Howard Hargrave.
I'm here because I was abducted by Scottie Hargrave.
You all must be very confused.
I know I would be.
To those who stood against me, you did what you were trained to do, defend the company.
To those who stood with me,
I ask you to accept that... we must now all work together.
To those loyal to Scottie,
I'll tell you what I told the board.
I'm only interested in the truth.
She will have her day in court.
But, first, we have to find her.
Anyone who is not comfortable with that mission... may leave now... with my blessings.
Thank you.
That's all.
Dumont.
Sir.
You knew that they had access to the elevator, and yet, you said nothing.
And that allowed Scottie to escape.
Now you're gonna help us find her.
How did my team access the facility?
You... programmed the servers to overheat, opening the vents.
Which shut down the network.
I want you to get it back up.
Yes, sir.
That's what it looks like, not what it is.
Look, Dr. Whitehall sees it differently.
- I held him for his own good.
- You made your case.
- I kept him from Howard.
- Howard made his.
- Oh, and now you're siding with him?
- Whitehall sided with him.
- Yeah, well, that's only because...
- Let it go, Scottie.
You've got other things to worry about.
I just got the results of an internal investigation launched after Howard's press conference.
There is a string of financial irregularities on your watch, including several off-the-book facilities.
- Who's seen this?
- Everyone.
Scottie, I don't know what you've done, and I don't want to know.
Do yourself a favor.
Whatever it is, get ahead of it.
Here's what we owe you.
Let me know how to contact Zeke and Vito's families, and I'll make sure they get their share.
Thanks, man.
Hey, one more thing.
- You're done selling drugs to Nez.
- Tom.
All due respect, playboy, man's got to make a living.
All due respect, Nez is like a daughter to Howard, which means she's like a sister to me.
I think you can see we're pretty generous with those who help.
I'm a lot less generous with those who don't.
You got me?
Where are you?
You all right?
I'm nowhere close to all right.
But I do have a plan, and I need your help to carry it out.
Yeah, whatever you need.
Is the Artax Network back online?
Dumont's working on it.
I need him to stop.
Okay.
Uh, yeah, of course.
I'll tell him.
Howard's looking everywhere for me.
I need to get across town without him finding me.
Okay, but then where are you gonna go?
Just tell Dumont.
Is the system online yet?
Working as fast as I can, okay?
Just got to reboot this server.
Wait.
I, uh, talked to Scottie.
She's fine, but she's on the run, doesn't really want us looking for her.
Hargrave wants the network up.
She wants it down.
Just 20 more minutes.
Did you know about Whitehall?
About her holding him?
She's been good to me.
She's been good to me, too.
And I'm not sure what's right or wrong here... online, offline, but I have to decide whether to flip the switch or not.
And before I do, I want to know if she told you about Whitehall.
Is the network up yet?
I got one last problem to solve.
Kat's helping me with it.
With what?
Simple binary choice.
Did she or didn't she?
Yes or no?
No.
She didn't.
Okay.
Good.
That's the answer I needed.
We're good to go.
System's up.

The intel Marienthal showed me, for all we know, Howard's seen it.
You think Howard's guys will be here?
I don't know.
So we have to assume the answer is yes.
Well, then, there's only one way to play this.
Let's do it.

Scottie lied about everything.
She's not who we thought she was.
This place is proof of that.
I hope that the truth comes out in the justice system.
But since I don't intend on letting the justice system deliberate the truth about me, this is where I step off.

I'll find you.
God, I hope so.
Stop it.

Howard's setting me up.
If that's true, then come in.
If you're really innocent, then you have nothing to hide.
I can't.
I can't do that.
Well, that sounds like guilty.
Look, I understand why it's hard for you to believe me, but we both know Howard did something incredibly cruel when he sent you to me and didn't allow you to tell me that you're my son,
that after all these years, you're still alive.
That cruelty was also a blessing, because you got to see how I truly feel about my son, that I never stopped loving him.
I never stopped loving you.
If you know how I feel, then you know who I am.
And if you know that, can you honestly tell me... that you believe what Howard says about me?
Today, I can.
Susan Hargrave, you're under arrest for kidnapping and false imprisonment.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
My answer's no.
Usually, we like to get the question out first.
You showed me the NTSB report.
It says the landing gear on Howard's plane was tampered with.
You want to know if I think she did it.
Do you?
Of course she did it.
This an accurate prototype?
Completely.
I can't believe how close she came.
And it could've only been built by someone who had access to my research.
And no one had that other than Scottie Hargrave?
Scottie Hargrave and me.
You were the only ones authorized to make payments from this account.
That's right.
This is a payment schedule from the account.
Everything related to the construction of the prototype,
Mrs. Hargrave denies knowing anything about.
7:29 a.m. on 3/1.
11:45 p.m. on 3/9.
6:15 a.m. on 3:17.
If you're asking me whether I made these payments, the answer is no.
I wasn't even working at these times.
So, if Ms. Carlson didn't make the payments, then it must've been you.
Gotcha.
I'm sorry it ended this way.
Yeah, me too.
What you said before about me being like a sister to you...
I meant it.
Good.
Whatever help you need.
I like what you've done with the place.
How does it feel?
It feels... right... this, being here with you.
You know, my daughter turns... she turns 1 next week.

This is just the beginning.
Yeah.
For our family, which I hope...
I want you to be a part of.
And I want you to be a part of this.

Maybe, someday.
Who knows?
For now, I am going home to my daughter's birthday.
Well, of course you are.
You should.
You're coming to the party by the way.

He used you to get close to her, to get access to her files.
It was you that made it all work.

Couldn't get to her files.

Six months ago, I came before the board because I had concluded... that the husband I loved and adored was gone, that he had become delusional, and that it was your fiduciary responsibility to remove him as head of this company.
My company... which I created, in all my delusional grandeur.
You agreed with my assessment then, and everything that's happened since only reinforces the conclusion that Howard is not of sound mind.
By his own admission, he faked his death.
Howard's not well.
But he is dangerous.

Howard's been pursuing the Holy Grail of the digital age... quantum computing.
Quantum computing's a pipe dream.

He's here so my husband can't force him to give him his technology.

Remember, Whitehall... she has to tell you about Whitehall.
Your accomplice...
I need to know his name.
He's your son.
I don't know anything about Whitehall.
If you tell me, nothing will happen to you.
Who are you?
I am Richard Whitehall.
Whitehall has cracked quantum computing.
A computer with this kind of speed would mean the end of privacy as we know it.
If Scottie moves from a prototype to a working model, the woman would be unstoppable.
As of today, I will do everything in my power to take back control of the company that I created.
I know you're watching, honey, and I'm coming for you.
Yeah, I got it.
I got it.
Oh, my God.
Did you see that?
Yeah.
- All right.
Just keep walking.
- I got it.
Hey!
Hey, hey!
You-you can't go in there!
_
Quantum computing is like a skeleton key.
The original mainframe computers were the size of this room.
You know a computer that's 10,000 times more powerful?
This.
That's the difference between what's being used today and what anyone who gets their hands on Whitehall's device will be using tomorrow.
Today, cellphones, laptops are vulnerable.
Tomorrow, it'll be banking, classified systems, troop movements, nuclear codes.
Scottie's holding Whitehall inside Halcyon.
We can't just walk him out.
No.
We have to break him out.
Of Halcyon?
Any chance you got a plan "B"?
My plan "B" is already under way.
The reason I went public is to force the board to call a meeting to decide who to believe,
Scottie or me.
The board already sided with her.
I'm not going in to lobby for votes.
I'm going in through the front to enable you to launch a tactical assault through the back.
- How are we gonna do that?
- You leave that to me.
All you have to worry about is assembling a team that'll stay off of Halcyon's radar.
High risk, low probability of success.
Got any takers?
Yeah, I think I do.
We talked about this.
It was a mistake.
I'm sorry.
We didn't talk about it.
I told you I knew about you and Kat, that you were sleeping with my assistant.
You apologized.
That's acknowledgment, not talk.
Do you want to talk about it?
No, 'cause there's nothing to talk about.
'Cause if we did talk about it,
I'd probably end up taking that ice pick and stabbing you with it.
The board meeting... are you worried?
Of course.
Howard plays dirty.
But I have a few tricks to play.
- What's this?
- Insurance.
I need your vote in the board meeting.
- Where did you get this?
- Doesn't matter.
Your soon-to-be ex is asking for full custody of Isaac and Hannah.
She's not getting it, once a judge sees her snorting her child-support payments.
Of course I'm with you.
Good.
Can't afford to have Howard upend everything we've been working on.
Looking for a refill?
Nah, I'm trying to kick it.
I'm here to sell you on something.
We got a business proposal for you.
Hands up.
Now.
What's in there?
We need your help.
We're willing to pay.
This is the first installment.
We don't need your money.
Well, that's good, because I didn't bring any.
Mm.
Taaffeite.
A million times scarcer than diamonds.

You do the math.
You trust her?
She cool.
Kind of help you looking for?
The kind that could get you killed.
So?
So, enhanced interrogation works.
And since you don't want me using it on señor Whitehall, the results are mixed.
Maybe he's working with Howard, maybe not.
I'll talk to him.
Howard's almost here.
Escort him in.
Watch him.
He's here for Whitehall, which means he's got a plan to get him out.
Curing certain cancers, making more effective drugs, discovering distant planets, driver-less cars.
That is the promise of my inventions.
Healthier, smarter, safer.
There are so many rewards.
But all you see is the evil this can do.
Why is that?
Because someone has to live in the shadows so others can live in the light.
I'll take him from here.
Scottie asked me to escort you to the board.
Phyllis.
- It's wonderful to see you.
- You, too, sir.
Jesse.
- How are the twins?
- Doing great.
Bob.
It's good to be back to see you.

- Denise, hi.
... I'm capable of trying to murder my husband?
I do.
Scottie.
Howard.
What's the matter?
You all look like you've seen a ghost.
So, who do you want to hear from first?
I say brains before beauty.
So, Scottie, you're up.
Morning.
Nothing about any HVAC units today.
Well, I have four in the back, three other trips to make by lunch.
Can I leave them with you?
- Let...
let's check them out.
- My man.
If this feels like déjà vu all over again, that's because it is.
Six months ago, I came before the board because I had concluded... that the husband I loved and adored was gone, that he had become delusional, and that it was your fiduciary responsibility to remove him as head of this company.
My company... which I created, in all my delusional grandeur.
You agreed with my assessment then, and everything that's happened since only reinforces the conclusion that Howard is not of sound mind.
By his own admission, he faked his death.
Howard's not well.
But he is dangerous.
Since his tragic death,
Howard's been pursuing the Holy Grail of the digital age... quantum computing.
Quantum computing's a pipe dream.
No, it's not.
It's real.
The man responsible for the breakthrough is here.
As a prisoner.
He's here so my husband can't force him to give him his technology.
Howard knew about it, pursued it... in secret, away from us, from this company.
Why would he do that?
There's only one explanation.
Howard is no longer working for this company.
He is working against it.
It's simple.
Snatch, grab, and go.
It'd be a lot simpler if we had real bullets.
- They do.
- No.
Whitehall's being held by people we know.
They believe they're doing the right thing.
They're not.
So tranqs only.
That's what you signed up for.
Everything else gets left in the van.
Everything.
I am not normal.
And I have no interest in being normal.
I think normal is boring.
I believe in conspiracies.
I think delusions are the same as dog whistles.
Just because you can't hear them or see them doesn't mean they're not real.
We breach on Howard's signal.
Now, not being normal isn't the same as being nuts.
Nuts would be faking your own death, and I didn't do that.
You pretended to be dead.
Isn't that the same thing?
I didn't fake my death.
I simply avoided being murdered.
- Oh, come on, that's ridiculous.
- Is it?
This is... a preliminary report of the NTSB, indicating that the landing gear on my plane had been tampered with.
- See this?
- The QR code.
So?
The conference-room table is covered with smart glass and is smart enough to read that.
What'll the code tell it to do?
Calculate chess positions for 100,000 games played simultaneously.
You're gonna overheat the servers.
Triggering a cooling protocol, which includes opening the air vents from the server room to the parking lot.
We're in.
Let's go.
This warning light means the servers are overheating, and they never overheat.
I got to run a diagnostics.
Get a tac team up to Level A.
The NTSB report is inconclusive.
Someone tampered with your landing gear, but it could've been you.
And Scottie could be holding Dr. Whitehall against his will to protect him from me and not to force him to build a prototype of his invention, but I think we all know that she's not.
Of course, we could ask him.
What do you think, honey?
Should we call him in?
Shh.
You guys shouldn't be here.
Who the hell are these guys?
You don't want to know.
We need the access codes.
They locked us out of the system.
Yeah, well, you did try to decapitate Solomon.
No, we threw a bomb on his head.
It's a little different.
But just give us the codes.
He's fine, by the way.
I'm sure he'd love to see you.
- Why don't I go tell him you're here?
- I love you, buddy.
If you don't tell me Whitehall's location and the code in the next five seconds...
I will shoot you with a tranq dart in the face.
You would do that?
Try me.
LeBron.
Really?
LeBron?
Cleveland against the world.
The allegations you both made... could not be more serious.
They are, and should be, the subject of a criminal investigation.
The final decision of the board will rest in part... on the outcome of that investigation, but that could take months, if not years.
The company needs a direction now.
Aah!
Aah!
By a show of hands, all those in favor of restoring Howard Hargrave as CEO.
Don't shoot!
I'm unarmed!

Oh, man.

Nez, come on.

You guys hang here and wait for Howard's orders.
Howard, I'm sorry.
The vote was five to two against you.
A count I assume Scottie bought and paid for.
I didn't come here to win your vote, Jack.
That's him.
Let's go.
Then, why did you come?
To rescue Whitehall.
Oh, and h-how do you plan on doing that?
By taking over this facility.
Hear that?
Anyone?
That is the sound of a dog whistle.
What is this, Howard?
You want to tell us what the hell's going on?
- Patience.
- Howard, unlock the door.
Dr. Whitehall will be released from Mrs. Hargrave's confinement shortly, and he will explain.
- If you don't release us...
- Unlock the door.
When you hear the truth, when you hear what this woman has been willing to do...
Stay put.
Everybody, stay put.
Your chariot has arrived.
Ah, ah, ah.
Howard.
Don't make him do something you might regret.
Let's go.
We need to get to Whitehall.
Tom and Nez might already be there.
We know where he is.
They may not.
And after we get him?
Unh-unh.
I don't know yet.
I'm taking it one crisis at a time.

Hold on, everyone.
Just hold on.

I want you to bring up the sub-basement.

- Everything.
Scottie, stop!
Go!
The code doesn't work.
And these windows are bulletproof.
He's having way too much fun.
What's going on?
I demand you let me go.
I changed the key code.
Buys us a little time but not much.
Howard has control of the system.
He can unlock it.
Not anymore.
They knocked us off the grid.
We're on reserve juice.
Scottie's got Whitehall barricaded in the sub-basement.
Wouldn't cutting the power cause the doors to automatically unlock?
In the even of a power loss, the lock will automatically engage.
What about the cargo elevator?
That's not on the reserve system.
They can't get out that way.
Meaning we can't get in.
Oh, there are other ways to get in.
Damn it.
Solomon, put her on the phone.
Scottie, think about this.
You can't get out, and in four minutes, we're coming in.
I'm not giving him to Howard.
You don't have a choice.
Howard... remember the World Summit on Innovation?
Geneva?
We stayed up all night working on your speech, how quantum computing would outstrip human capabilities, that if its development wasn't managed carefully, humanity would risk engineering its own extinction?
You convinced me then we could never let that kind of power fall into the hands of some deranged, maniacal madman.
I just never thought that madman would be you.
You're not in the boardroom anymore, honey.
You can drop the act.
Scottie, you don't have any leverage.
Of course I do.
Please don't make me use it.
Come through that door, and I will put a bullet through Whitehall's head.
The hell you will!
Scottie, don't... don't do this.
Are you... are you there?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
If I'm going to die,
I'd like to die in my bed, in my sleep, having told my wife I love her, perhaps re-reading the final chapter of "Moby-Dick."
Unfortunately for you, sir, there is only one way out.
We can commandeer the elevator.
Not possible.
We've been cut off from the power grid, and reserve power does not go to the cargo elevator.
Even if you can get the elevator to work,
Howard will know the second you do.
Well... that's your problem to solve.
I'm worried about getting out alive.
We're almost in.
I'm not convinced that's gonna work.
Mr. Solomon, is it?
Are you familiar with Schrodinger's cat?
Oh, yes.
It's a paradox.
Cat's sealed in the box with poison, simultaneously alive and dead until you open up the box and observe it.
Exactly.
This is nothing like that.
When they open this box, we're just dead.
They're almost in.
You got two minutes or less.
_
It works.
Get in.
This should give us about 30 seconds' worth of lift.
That'll get us to the next floor.
They're on the move.
Lock down Bay Six.
They're getting away.
Go.
Go now.
Well, here goes our ride now.
You don't have any bullets.
He doesn't know that.
Hey!
Scottie!
We got company.
Come on.
Please don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
Come on.
There's nothing we can do, Scottie.
Get in the car.
Dr. Whitehall, you are safe now.
That seems to be the only thing you and your wife agree on.
- Speaking of Scottie...
- No.
Or Solomon.
If you'll come with me, sir, there are some people I'd like you to meet.
I want everyone released.
They were trying to kill us.
They were only doing their jobs.
Take everyone into the command center.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Just hold still.
Hold still.
Okay, there.
Keep the pressure on.
You're closer to Scottie than anyone else.
Do you believe what he's saying about her?
Apologies.
Where's Scottie?
I would like to introduce Richard Whitehall.
Where is she?
Is she all right?
I don't know, and, yeah, Scottie is unhurt.
I wish everyone was.
I genuinely regret having to resort to such extreme measures.
You can't take the company back by force.
You need our consent.
Agreed.
And if I don't get it, I'm prepared to walk away... after you hear what Dr. Whitehall has to say.
I did what I thought I had to do in order for you to hear him out.
And I'm very sorry, but it seems like a small price to pay for the truth.
Doctor.
I'll do my best.
To begin with, I am not in business... with Howard Hargrave.
I'm here because I was abducted by Scottie Hargrave.
You all must be very confused.
I know I would be.
To those who stood against me, you did what you were trained to do, defend the company.
To those who stood with me,
I ask you to accept that... we must now all work together.
To those loyal to Scottie,
I'll tell you what I told the board.
I'm only interested in the truth.
She will have her day in court.
But, first, we have to find her.
Anyone who is not comfortable with that mission... may leave now... with my blessings.
Thank you.
That's all.
Dumont.
Sir.
You knew that they had access to the elevator, and yet, you said nothing.
And that allowed Scottie to escape.
Now you're gonna help us find her.
How did my team access the facility?
You... programmed the servers to overheat, opening the vents.
Which shut down the network.
I want you to get it back up.
Yes, sir.
That's what it looks like, not what it is.
Look, Dr. Whitehall sees it differently.
- I held him for his own good.
- You made your case.
- I kept him from Howard.
- Howard made his.
- Oh, and now you're siding with him?
- Whitehall sided with him.
- Yeah, well, that's only because...
- Let it go, Scottie.
You've got other things to worry about.
I just got the results of an internal investigation launched after Howard's press conference.
There is a string of financial irregularities on your watch, including several off-the-book facilities.
- Who's seen this?
- Everyone.
Scottie, I don't know what you've done, and I don't want to know.
Do yourself a favor.
Whatever it is, get ahead of it.
Here's what we owe you.
Let me know how to contact Zeke and Vito's families, and I'll make sure they get their share.
Thanks, man.
Hey, one more thing.

I'm a lot less generous with those who don't.
You got me?
Where are you?
You all right?
I'm nowhere close to all right.
But I do have a plan, and I need your help to carry it out.
Yeah, whatever you need.
Is the Artax Network back online?
Dumont's working on it.
I need him to stop.
Okay.
Uh, yeah, of course.
I'll tell him.
Howard's looking everywhere for me.
I need to get across town without him finding me.
Okay, but then where are you gonna go?
Just tell Dumont.
Is the system online yet?
Working as fast as I can, okay?
Just got to reboot this server.
Wait.
I, uh, talked to Scottie.
She's fine, but she's on the run, doesn't really want us looking for her.
Hargrave wants the network up.
She wants it down.
Just 20 more minutes.
Did you know about Whitehall?
About her holding him?
She's been good to me.
She's been good to me, too.
And I'm not sure what's right or wrong here... online, offline, but I have to decide whether to flip the switch or not.
And before I do, I want to know if she told you about Whitehall.
Is the network up yet?
I got one last problem to solve.
Kat's helping me with it.
With what?
Simple binary choice.
Did she or didn't she?
Yes or no?
No.
She didn't.
Okay.
Good.
That's the answer I needed.
We're good to go.
System's up.
Process every image... satellite,
CCTV, MTA, DMV, Snapchat... everything.
I want to know the second you get a hit.
If we find her, what's gonna happen to her?
Justice.
I loved her once.
In some ways, I still do.
I know how difficult this is, but it's the right thing to do.
I want to thank you for helping me do it.
So, how are we playing this?
The intel Marienthal showed me, for all we know, Howard's seen it.
You think Howard's guys will be here?
I don't know.
So we have to assume the answer is yes.
Well, then, there's only one way to play this.
Let's do it.
Guys, I think I got them.
Where?
A former pharmaceutical plant in Williamsburg.
Corner of Flushing and Spring.
Dumont, call in the FBI.
Bring up any images you have of the area.
We'll meet the FBI there.
- Everybody on the ground.
- Oh!
Come on.
Hands up in the air.
Now.
I-I don't understand.
What are you doing?
Who else is here?
How many?
You know how many, Scottie.
Nine per shift.
How do you know her name?
I should know her name.
She hired me.
She hired all of us.
- Hey!
- Hey.

Don't move!

Oh, Matty, I didn't think you believed in right and wrong.
Scottie is the good guy here.
Scottie lied about everything.
She's not who we thought she was.
This place is proof of that.
I hope that the truth comes out in the justice system.
But since I don't intend on letting the justice system deliberate the truth about me, this is where I step off.

"On the second day, a sail drew near.
"It was the devious-cruising Rachel,

"only found...
"another orphan."
I'll find you.
God, I hope so.
Stop it.
Stop!
Stop!
It's over.
It's over.
Howard's setting me up.
If that's true, then come in.
If you're really innocent, then you have nothing to hide.
I can't.
I can't do that.
Well, that sounds like guilty.
Look, I understand why it's hard for you to believe me, but we both know Howard did something incredibly cruel when he sent you to me and didn't allow you to tell me that you're my son,
that after all these years, you're still alive.
That cruelty was also a blessing, because you got to see how I truly feel about my son, that I never stopped loving him.
I never stopped loving you.
If you know how I feel, then you know who I am.
And if you know that, can you honestly tell me... that you believe what Howard says about me?
Today, I can.
Susan Hargrave, you're under arrest for kidnapping and false imprisonment.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
My answer's no.
Usually, we like to get the question out first.
You showed me the NTSB report.
It says the landing gear on Howard's plane was tampered with.
You want to know if I think she did it.
Do you?
Of course she did it.
This an accurate prototype?
Completely.
I can't believe how close she came.
And it could've only been built by someone who had access to my research.
And no one had that other than Scottie Hargrave?
Scottie Hargrave and me.
You were the only ones authorized to make payments from this account.
That's right.
This is a payment schedule from the account.
Everything related to the construction of the prototype,
Mrs. Hargrave denies knowing anything about.
7:29 a.m. on 3/1.
11:45 p.m. on 3/9.
6:15 a.m. on 3:17.
If you're asking me whether I made these payments, the answer is no.
I wasn't even working at these times.
So, if Ms. Carlson didn't make the payments, then it must've been you.
Gotcha.
I'm sorry it ended this way.
Yeah, me too.
What you said before about me being like a sister to you...
I meant it.
Good.
Whatever help you need.
I like what you've done with the place.
How does it feel?
It feels... right... this, being here with you.
You know, my daughter turns... she turns 1 next week.
This isn't the end, you know?
This is just the beginning.
Yeah.
For our family, which I hope...
I want you to be a part of.
And I want you to be a part of this.
I know.
Maybe, someday.
Who knows?
For now, I am going home to my daughter's birthday.
Well, of course you are.
You should.
You're coming to the party by the way.
It's a princess theme, so I hope you've got a tiara.

The truth is, I knew you'd come back sooner or later, that it was only a matter of time before you realized what a huge mistake

- Transactions.

All except one that was made on my phone... after you switched it with yours, after you made it look like it was an innocent mistake.
It was you, wasn't it?
You were working with Howard the whole time.
He used you to get close to her, to get access to her files.
It was you that made it all work.
The frame-up.
Making it look like
Scottie was this guilty...
Couldn't get to her files.
She was too smart.

Six months ago, I came before the board because I had concluded... that the husband I loved and adored was gone, that he had become delusional, and that it was your fiduciary responsibility to remove him as head of this company.
My company... which I created, in all my delusional grandeur.
You agreed with my assessment then, and everything that's happened since only reinforces the conclusion that Howard is not of sound mind.
By his own admission, he faked his death.
Howard's not well.
But he is dangerous.

Remember, Whitehall... she has to tell you about Whitehall.
Your accomplice...
I need to know his name.
He's your son.
I don't know anything about Whitehall.
If you tell me, nothing will happen to you.
Who are you?
I am Richard Whitehall.
Whitehall has cracked quantum computing.
A computer with this kind of speed would mean the end of privacy as we know it.
If Scottie moves from a prototype to a working model, the woman would be unstoppable.
As of today, I will do everything in my power to take back control of the company that I created.
I know you're watching, honey, and I'm coming for you.
Yeah, I got it.
I got it.
Oh, my God.
Did you see that?
Yeah.
- All right.
Just keep walking.
- I got it.
Hey!
Hey, hey!
You-you can't go in there!
_
Quantum computing is like a skeleton key.
The original mainframe computers were the size of this room.
You know a computer that's 10,000 times more powerful?
This.
That's the difference between what's being used today and what anyone who gets their hands on Whitehall's device will be using tomorrow.
Today, cellphones, laptops are vulnerable.
Tomorrow, it'll be banking, classified systems, troop movements, nuclear codes.
Scottie's holding Whitehall inside Halcyon.
We can't just walk him out.
No.
We have to break him out.
Of Halcyon?
Any chance you got a plan "B"?
My plan "B" is already under way.
The reason I went public is to force the board to call a meeting to decide who to believe,
Scottie or me.
The board already sided with her.
I'm not going in to lobby for votes.
I'm going in through the front to enable you to launch a tactical assault through the back.
- How are we gonna do that?
- You leave that to me.
All you have to worry about is assembling a team that'll stay off of Halcyon's radar.
High risk, low probability of success.
Got any takers?
Yeah, I think I do.
We talked about this.
It was a mistake.
I'm sorry.
We didn't talk about it.
I told you I knew about you and Kat, that you were sleeping with my assistant.
You apologized.
That's acknowledgment, not talk.
Do you want to talk about it?
No, 'cause there's nothing to talk about.
'Cause if we did talk about it,
I'd probably end up taking that ice pick and stabbing you with it.
The board meeting... are you worried?
Of course.
Howard plays dirty.
But I have a few tricks to play.
- What's this?
- Insurance.
I need your vote in the board meeting.
- Where did you get this?
- Doesn't matter.
Your soon-to-be ex is asking for full custody of Isaac and Hannah.
She's not getting it, once a judge sees her snorting her child-support payments.
Of course I'm with you.
Good.
Can't afford to have Howard upend everything we've been working on.
Looking for a refill?
Nah, I'm trying to kick it.
I'm here to sell you on something.
We got a business proposal for you.
Hands up.
Now.
What's in there?
We need your help.
We're willing to pay.
This is the first installment.
We don't need your money.
Well, that's good, because I didn't bring any.
Mm.

The kind that could get you killed.
So?
So, enhanced interrogation works.
And since you don't want me using it on señor Whitehall, the results are mixed.
Maybe he's working with Howard, maybe not.
I'll talk to him.
Howard's almost here.
Escort him in.
Watch him.
He's here for Whitehall, which means he's got a plan to get him out.
Curing certain cancers, making more effective drugs, discovering distant planets, driver-less cars.
That is the promise of my inventions.

There are so many rewards.
But all you see is the evil this can do.
Why is that?
Because someone has to live in the shadows so others can live in the light.
I'll take him from here.
Scottie asked me to escort you to the board.

- It's wonderful to see you.
- You, too, sir.

I do.
Scottie.
Howard.
What's the matter?
You all look like you've seen a ghost.
So, who do you want to hear from first?
I say brains before beauty.
So, Scottie, you're up.
Morning.
Nothing about any HVAC units today.
Well, I have four in the back, three other trips to make by lunch.
Can I leave them with you?
- Let...
let's check them out.
- My man.
If this feels like déjà vu all over again, that's because it is.
Six months ago, I came before the board because I had concluded... that the husband I loved and adored was gone, that he had become delusional, and that it was your fiduciary responsibility to remove him as head of this company.
My company... which I created, in all my delusional grandeur.
You agreed with my assessment then, and everything that's happened since only reinforces the conclusion that Howard is not of sound mind.
By his own admission, he faked his death.
Howard's not well.
But he is dangerous.
Since his tragic death,
Howard's been pursuing the Holy Grail of the digital age... quantum computing.
Quantum computing's a pipe dream.
No, it's not.
It's real.
The man responsible for the breakthrough is here.
As a prisoner.
He's here so my husband can't force him to give him his technology.
Howard knew about it, pursued it... in secret, away from us, from this company.
Why would he do that?
There's only one explanation.
Howard is no longer working for this company.
He is working against it.
It's simple.
Snatch, grab, and go.
It'd be a lot simpler if we had real bullets.
- They do.
- No.
Whitehall's being held by people we know.
They believe they're doing the right thing.
They're not.
So tranqs only.
That's what you signed up for.
Everything else gets left in the van.
Everything.
I am not normal.
And I have no interest in being normal.
I think normal is boring.
I believe in conspiracies.
I think delusions are the same as dog whistles.
Just because you can't hear them or see them doesn't mean they're not real.
We breach on Howard's signal.
Now, not being normal isn't the same as being nuts.
Nuts would be faking your own death, and I didn't do that.
You pretended to be dead.
Isn't that the same thing?
I didn't fake my death.
I simply avoided being murdered.
- Oh, come on, that's ridiculous.
- Is it?
This is... a preliminary report of the NTSB, indicating that the landing gear on my plane had been tampered with.
- See this?
- The QR code.
So?
The conference-room table is covered with smart glass and is smart enough to read that.
What'll the code tell it to do?
Calculate chess positions for 100,000 games played simultaneously.
You're gonna overheat the servers.
Triggering a cooling protocol, which includes opening the air vents from the server room to the parking lot.
We're in.
Let's go.
This warning light means the servers are overheating, and they never overheat.
I got to run a diagnostics.
Get a tac team up to Level A.
The NTSB report is inconclusive.
Someone tampered with your landing gear, but it could've been you.
And Scottie could be holding Dr. Whitehall against his will to protect him from me and not to force him to build a prototype of his invention, but I think we all know that she's not.
Of course, we could ask him.
What do you think, honey?
Should we call him in?
Shh.
You guys shouldn't be here.
Who the hell are these guys?
You don't want to know.
We need the access codes.
They locked us out of the system.
Yeah, well, you did try to decapitate Solomon.
No, we threw a bomb on his head.
It's a little different.
But just give us the codes.
He's fine, by the way.
I'm sure he'd love to see you.
- Why don't I go tell him you're here?
- I love you, buddy.
If you don't tell me Whitehall's location and the code in the next five seconds...
I will shoot you with a tranq dart in the face.
You would do that?
Try me.
LeBron.
Really?
LeBron?
Cleveland against the world.
The allegations you both made... could not be more serious.
They are, and should be, the subject of a criminal investigation.
The final decision of the board will rest in part... on the outcome of that investigation, but that could take months, if not years.
The company needs a direction now.

I didn't come here to win your vote, Jack.
That's him.
Let's go.
Then, why did you come?
To rescue Whitehall.
Oh, and h-how do you plan on doing that?
By taking over this facility.
Hear that?
Anyone?
That is the sound of a dog whistle.
What is this, Howard?
You want to tell us what the hell's going on?
- Patience.
- Howard, unlock the door.
Dr. Whitehall will be released from Mrs. Hargrave's confinement shortly, and he will explain.
- If you don't release us...
- Unlock the door.
When you hear the truth, when you hear what this woman has been willing to do...
Stay put.
Everybody, stay put.
Your chariot has arrived.
Ah, ah, ah.
Howard.
Don't make him do something you might regret.
Let's go.
We need to get to Whitehall.

We know where he is.
They may not.
And after we get him?
Unh-unh.

And these windows are bulletproof.
He's having way too much fun.
What's going on?
I demand you let me go.
I changed the key code.
Buys us a little time but not much.
Howard has control of the system.
He can unlock it.
Not anymore.
They knocked us off the grid.
We're on reserve juice.
Scottie's got Whitehall barricaded in the sub-basement.
Wouldn't cutting the power cause the doors to automatically unlock?
In the even of a power loss, the lock will automatically engage.
What about the cargo elevator?
That's not on the reserve system.
They can't get out that way.
Meaning we can't get in.
Oh, there are other ways to get in.
Damn it.
Solomon, put her on the phone.
Scottie, think about this.
You can't get out, and in four minutes, we're coming in.
I'm not giving him to Howard.
You don't have a choice.
Howard... remember the World Summit on Innovation?
Geneva?
We stayed up all night working on your speech, how quantum computing would outstrip human capabilities, that if its development wasn't managed carefully, humanity would risk engineering its own extinction?
You convinced me then we could never let that kind of power fall into the hands of some deranged, maniacal madman.
I just never thought that madman would be you.
You're not in the boardroom anymore, honey.
You can drop the act.
Scottie, you don't have any leverage.
Of course I do.
Please don't make me use it.
Come through that door, and I will put a bullet through Whitehall's head.
The hell you will!
Scottie, don't... don't do this.
Are you... are you there?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
If I'm going to die,
I'd like to die in my bed, in my sleep, having told my wife I love her, perhaps re-reading the final chapter of "Moby-Dick."
Unfortunately for you, sir, there is only one way out.
We can commandeer the elevator.
Not possible.
We've been cut off from the power grid, and reserve power does not go to the cargo elevator.
Even if you can get the elevator to work,
Howard will know the second you do.
Well... that's your problem to solve.
I'm worried about getting out alive.
We're almost in.
I'm not convinced that's gonna work.
Mr. Solomon, is it?
Are you familiar with Schrodinger's cat?
Oh, yes.
It's a paradox.
Cat's sealed in the box with poison, simultaneously alive and dead until you open up the box and observe it.
Exactly.
This is nothing like that.
When they open this box, we're just dead.
They're almost in.

Come on.
Please don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
Come on.
There's nothing we can do, Scottie.
Get in the car.
Dr. Whitehall, you are safe now.
That seems to be the only thing you and your wife agree on.
- Speaking of Scottie...
- No.
Or Solomon.
If you'll come with me, sir, there are some people I'd like you to meet.
I want everyone released.
They were trying to kill us.
They were only doing their jobs.
Take everyone into the command center.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Just hold still.

Okay, there.
Keep the pressure on.
You're closer to Scottie than anyone else.

Apologies.
Where's Scottie?
I would like to introduce Richard Whitehall.
Where is she?
Is she all right?
I don't know, and, yeah, Scottie is unhurt.
I wish everyone was.
I genuinely regret having to resort to such extreme measures.
You can't take the company back by force.
You need our consent.
Agreed.
And if I don't get it, I'm prepared to walk away... after you hear what Dr. Whitehall has to say.
I did what I thought I had to do in order for you to hear him out.
And I'm very sorry, but it seems like a small price to pay for the truth.
Doctor.
I'll do my best.
To begin with, I am not in business... with Howard Hargrave.
I'm here because I was abducted by Scottie Hargrave.
You all must be very confused.
I know I would be.
To those who stood against me, you did what you were trained to do, defend the company.
To those who stood with me,
I ask you to accept that... we must now all work together.
To those loyal to Scottie,
I'll tell you what I told the board.
I'm only interested in the truth.
She will have her day in court.
But, first, we have to find her.
Anyone who is not comfortable with that mission... may leave now... with my blessings.
Thank you.
That's all.
Dumont.
Sir.
You knew that they had access to the elevator, and yet, you said nothing.
And that allowed Scottie to escape.
Now you're gonna help us find her.
How did my team access the facility?
You... programmed the servers to overheat, opening the vents.
Which shut down the network.
I want you to get it back up.
Yes, sir.
That's what it looks like, not what it is.
Look, Dr. Whitehall sees it differently.
- I held him for his own good.
- You made your case.
- I kept him from Howard.
- Howard made his.
- Oh, and now you're siding with him?
- Whitehall sided with him.
- Yeah, well, that's only because...
- Let it go, Scottie.
You've got other things to worry about.
I just got the results of an internal investigation launched after Howard's press conference.
There is a string of financial irregularities on your watch, including several off-the-book facilities.
- Who's seen this?
- Everyone.
Scottie, I don't know what you've done, and I don't want to know.
Do yourself a favor.
Whatever it is, get ahead of it.
Here's what we owe you.
Let me know how to contact Zeke and Vito's families, and I'll make sure they get their share.
Thanks, man.
Hey, one more thing.
- You're done selling drugs to Nez.
- Tom.
All due respect, playboy, man's got to make a living.
All due respect, Nez is like a daughter to Howard, which means she's like a sister to me.
I think you can see we're pretty generous with those who help.
I'm a lot less generous with those who don't.
You got me?
Where are you?
You all right?
I'm nowhere close to all right.
But I do have a plan, and I need your help to carry it out.
Yeah, whatever you need.
Is the Artax Network back online?
Dumont's working on it.
I need him to stop.
Okay.
Uh, yeah, of course.
I'll tell him.
Howard's looking everywhere for me.
I need to get across town without him finding me.
Okay, but then where are you gonna go?
Just tell Dumont.
Is the system online yet?
Working as fast as I can, okay?
Just got to reboot this server.
Wait.
I, uh, talked to Scottie.
She's fine, but she's on the run, doesn't really want us looking for her.
Hargrave wants the network up.
She wants it down.
Just 20 more minutes.
Did you know about Whitehall?
About her holding him?
She's been good to me.
She's been good to me, too.
And I'm not sure what's right or wrong here... online, offline, but I have to decide whether to flip the switch or not.
And before I do, I want to know if she told you about Whitehall.
Is the network up yet?
I got one last problem to solve.
Kat's helping me with it.
With what?
Simple binary choice.
Did she or didn't she?
Yes or no?
No.
She didn't.
Okay.
Good.
That's the answer I needed.
We're good to go.
System's up.
Process every image... satellite,
CCTV, MTA, DMV, Snapchat... everything.
I want to know the second you get a hit.
If we find her, what's gonna happen to her?
Justice.
I loved her once.
In some ways, I still do.
I know how difficult this is, but it's the right thing to do.
I want to thank you for helping me do it.
So, how are we playing this?
The intel Marienthal showed me, for all we know, Howard's seen it.
You think Howard's guys will be here?
I don't know.
So we have to assume the answer is yes.
Well, then, there's only one way to play this.
Let's do it.
Guys, I think I got them.
Where?
A former pharmaceutical plant in Williamsburg.
Corner of Flushing and Spring.
Dumont, call in the FBI.
Bring up any images you have of the area.
We'll meet the FBI there.
- Everybody on the ground.
- Oh!
Come on.
Hands up in the air.
Now.
I-I don't understand.
What are you doing?
Who else is here?
How many?
You know how many, Scottie.
Nine per shift.
How do you know her name?
I should know her name.
She hired me.
She hired all of us.
- Hey!
- Hey.
Careful.
I am just...
I-I want to show you something.
Work orders for the week, all signed by you.
I've got three months' worth in back.
Purifiers, flame extractors.
This is made up, all of it.
I think you know that it's not made up.
Whitehall prototype.
You want to tell me what's going on here, Scottie?
A frame-up.
That's what's going on.
And I fell right into it.
Keen, Rowan.
We're with Halcyon.
Agents Lamb and Noxon, FBI.
What are we looking at?
Friends of ours.
Very armed, very dangerous.
What's here?
What's inside?
- We don't know.
- Curious to find out.
- You've never been here before.
- No.
And you do not know these guys.
Look at me, Scottie.
If Howard set you up, then the cops will be on their way.
We got to move.
Federal agents!
Don't move!
All right.
Go back to the lab.
Find a different way out.
I'll lay down cover fire.
There are too many.
If I can get to one of the techs,
I'll take one of them as a hostage.
Gun down.
_
Somebody's gonna put their gun down, but it's not gonna be me.
You backed the wrong horse, Nez.
Oh, Matty, I didn't think you believed in right and wrong.
Scottie is the good guy here.
Scottie lied about everything.
She's not who we thought she was.
This place is proof of that.
I hope that the truth comes out in the justice system.
But since I don't intend on letting the justice system deliberate the truth about me, this is where I step off.
The only surviving member of the Pequod.
It's the whaling ship in "Moby-Dick."
Oh, it went down.
Took everyone with it except Ishmael.
And how did he survive?
"Buoyed up by that coffin,
"I floated on a soft and dirge-like main.
"The unharming sharks,
"they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths.
"On the second day, a sail drew near.
"It was the devious-cruising Rachel,
"that in her retracing search after her missing children,
"only found...
"another orphan."
I'll find you.
God, I hope so.
Stop it.
Stop!
Stop!
It's over.
It's over.
Howard's setting me up.
If that's true, then come in.
If you're really innocent, then you have nothing to hide.
I can't.
I can't do that.
Well, that sounds like guilty.
Look, I understand why it's hard for you to believe me, but we both know Howard did something incredibly cruel when he sent you to me and didn't allow you to tell me that you're my son,
that after all these years, you're still alive.
That cruelty was also a blessing, because you got to see how I truly feel about my son, that I never stopped loving him.
I never stopped loving you.
If you know how I feel, then you know who I am.
And if you know that, can you honestly tell me... that you believe what Howard says about me?
Today, I can.
Susan Hargrave, you're under arrest for kidnapping and false imprisonment.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
My answer's no.
Usually, we like to get the question out first.
You showed me the NTSB report.
It says the landing gear on Howard's plane was tampered with.
You want to know if I think she did it.
Do you?
Of course she did it.
This an accurate prototype?
Completely.
I can't believe how close she came.
And it could've only been built by someone who had access to my research.
And no one had that other than Scottie Hargrave?
Scottie Hargrave and me.
You were the only ones authorized to make payments from this account.
That's right.
This is a payment schedule from the account.
Everything related to the construction of the prototype,
Mrs. Hargrave denies knowing anything about.
7:29 a.m. on 3/1.
11:45 p.m. on 3/9.
6:15 a.m. on 3:17.
If you're asking me whether I made these payments, the answer is no.
I wasn't even working at these times.
So, if Ms. Carlson didn't make the payments, then it must've been you.
Gotcha.
I'm sorry it ended this way.
Yeah, me too.
What you said before about me being like a sister to you...
I meant it.
Good.
Whatever help you need.
I like what you've done with the place.
How does it feel?
It feels... right... this, being here with you.
You know, my daughter turns... she turns 1 next week.
This isn't the end, you know?
This is just the beginning.
Yeah.
For our family, which I hope...
I want you to be a part of.
And I want you to be a part of this.
I know.
Maybe, someday.
Who knows?
For now, I am going home to my daughter's birthday.
Well, of course you are.
You should.
You're coming to the party by the way.
It's a princess theme, so I hope you've got a tiara.
I wouldn't miss it.
You did it, Dad.
We did, son.
Together.
- Tiara?
- Yeah, you got it.
Hey.
Saved you a piece of cheesecake.
- Cheesecake?
- Yeah, cheesecake.
The truth is, I knew you'd come back sooner or later, that it was only a matter of time before you realized what a huge mistake
- it was to dump me.
- Can you explain this?
Explain what?
What... what is it?
Payment authorizations.
For the construction of a sophisticated computer prototype.
- What is there to...
- Look at the dates and times.
- I don't...
- Look at the dates and times!
Okay, okay.
I'm looking.
- What am I looking at?
- Transactions.
Made from my computer and dates and times when we were together.
All except one that was made on my phone... after you switched it with yours, after you made it look like it was an innocent mistake.
It was you, wasn't it?
You were working with Howard the whole time.
He used you to get close to her, to get access to her files.
It was you that made it all work.
The frame-up.
Making it look like
Scottie was this guilty...
Couldn't get to her files.
She was too smart.
But you... you actually thought I cared.
I'm sorry.
Last thing anyone's ever gonna say to you is,
"This is all your fault."
- Is he here?
- Yes, sir.
Arrived an hour ago.
Now, my flight leaves in two hours.
I should be home for dinner.
Like you said when I left, what could possibly go wrong?
Kat.
Jesus!
What happened?
What is this?
What's on this?
The truth.
It's him.
Where are we?
We are operational.

I've got more flowers.
Got you, Elena.
Someone has the carnaval spirit.
Thank you.
And Esteban's in a good mood, too.
Let me help you with those.
Carnaval was Mommy's favorite holiday.
Remember?
How could I forget?
Riding with you and your mother on the royal float was one of my last happy memories, before the dark times.
That's why I brought back the carnaval, so we can all make some more good memories, cousin.
Higgins, stop fooling around.
Great, you have the beak.
Yes, yes.
Now, where does it go?
Really?
Just kidding.
But you're never just kidding.
I think I know who should be king of the carnaval, Isabel.
Yeah!
Thank you, Elena.
But I am not worthy of such an honor.
But you'd finally be king of something.
Higgins.
Just think about it, okay?
Where's Armando?
He wanted these flowers.
Armando!
- Right here, Your Highness.
- The beak!
Armando!
Sorry.
El Segundo.
Victor?
So you haven't forgotten me, El Segundo.
They call me Chancellor Esteban now.
Well, Chancellor Esteban, that chicken mask suits you.
It is a phoenix, and this is not a mask.
Really?
After what you did to me, old friend,
I would think you'd be too ashamed to show your face.
Princess Elena, you are as beautiful as ever.
- Have we met?
- Pardon me.
It was 41 years ago, after all, before Shuriki invaded, before you were trapped in that amulet.
My father was the royal treasurer when your father was king.
Victor Delgado?
!
Victor Delgado?
It's been far too long!
Seor Flores.
Better check your pockets, abuelo.
What?
Just like old times?
You and Esteban loved practicing your sleight-of-hand tricks.
Tricks?
That was their excuse for taking things that didn't belong to them.
Seora Flores.
Please, let me introduce my daughter.
- Carla.
- It's an honor.
I've heard so much about all of you.
Where have you been all these years?
When Shuriki took over, we had to flee the kingdom.
We lost everything.
But now that Avalor is free,
I wanted to show Carla where I grew up.
That is why you came back?
And to celebrate carnaval, of course.
Yes, it is so wonderful of you to bring back the old traditions.
Well, how would you like to be our personal guests at the carnaval parade today?
I am sure they have other...
We would love to.
Ooh, can we take a tour of the palace first?
I've never seen anything so beautiful.
It's like a fairy tale.
Of course.
I'll show you around myself.
I can't believe you grew up here, Papa.
El Segundo grew up here.
I was merely a visitor.
How did Esteban get that nickname?
I can't remember.
Well, when we were young, we used to race all over the palace, and Esteban always came in second.
Thus, El Segundo.
Yes, well, now that you have toured the palace, you should probably be moving on.
I'm in no hurry.
And we haven't seen where Grandfather worked yet.
I am afraid the royal treasury is not part of the tour.
It'll only take a few minutes, Esteban.
Summon the captain of the guard.
This is all yours?
Well, it belongs to the kingdom of Avalor.
We're just the caretakers.
That's what my father used to say, until Shuriki threw us out of the kingdom.
Well, most of us.
That tiara is my favorite.
It was my mother's.
But she only wore it at carnaval.
I remember how it used to sparkle in the sun.
We used to ride together on the float.
One time, when I was eight, she even let me wear the tiara.
That day, I was the happiest girl in all of Avalor.
It's magnificent.
It's even prettier up close.
Come on.
Elena, we cannot go any closer, remember?
Right.
The whole room is rigged with booby traps, you know, in case of thieves.
Yes, it is the best system in the world.
No one could possibly get past it.
Now we should really go back downstairs.
I am sure Isabel could use some assistance with the float.
I'm so sorry.
I thought we were going that way.
Entirely my fault, seorita.
Good job.
Remember the plan.
You keep them distracted while I steal the jewels.
If you need any help with the float,
I'm happy to lend a hand.
Sure.
Grab a brush.
There's one for Seor Delgado, too.
I would love to, but I am very tired from the trip.
Well, you are in luck.
Avalor City has many fine inns.
Esteban.
There's only a million rooms in the palace.
Armando!
- Yes, princess.
- Hey!
- Armando!
- Sorry.
Can you show Victor to the parlor?
Thank you, but I spent my childhood in these halls.
I know the way.
Cousin Esteban, could you put the beak back on?
It keeps coming loose.
Of course, Isabel.
Follow him, Higgins.
I do not trust him.
But you've known him for ages.
Yes, that is how I know he's up to no good.
Were you following me?
Me?
No.
I was just going to the... to the...
- To the kitchen?
- Yes!
The kitchen.
Wonderful.
Perhaps you can fetch me a torta.
Ham and cheese.
In fact, why don't you get yourself one while you're there?
Thanks, Victor.
I could use a snack.
I'll meet you in the parlor.
I'll be waiting.
Hmph.
You call this a security system?
Ha!
Child's play.
Aah!
Quarter turn to the left.
Perfect.
Higgins, where is Victor?
I wish I knew.
I have his torta.
His what?
!
I told you to follow him, not fix him a snack.
Give me that.
There's my torta.
Thank you, Esteban.
I have had enough of your games, Victor.
What are you really doing here?
Just visiting old friends.
Is that so?
Looks like someone set off a booby trap.
You tried to steal the royal jewels.
That is nothing compared to what you did to me.
Forty-one years ago, you and I made a deal with Shuriki.
We were going to help her invade Avalor, and rule the kingdom with her.
We were partners.
But when Shuriki kicked me and my family out of Avalor, you did nothing to stop her.
What could I do?
You saw what she did to Elena's parents.
I had no choice.
You always have a choice.
For example, I could tell your family that you betrayed them all.
Keep your voice down.
Clumsy me.
- Elena, can you help me?
- Sure.
You cannot tell them the truth.
I won't... if you bring me the crown jewels.
I...
I cannot do this.
Bring me the jewels, or I tell them your secret.
Looks like we're partners once more, El Segundo.
Chancellor.

There you are.
I've been looking all over for you.
It's time to go to the parade.
What are you doing with my mother's tiara?
I...
I am bringing it to you.
Because of that story you told me about her,
I think you should wear your mother's tiara today in her honor.
And I brought something for the rest of the family, so they do not feel left out.
You look just like your mother.
I do?
We should go.
They're waiting.
Thank you, Esteban.
Elena, hurry.
We'll be late.
Coming.
What's she doing with the tiara?
Carla, Victor, time to go.
Go.
I'll find Esteban.
Ooh, this is so exciting.
I've never been on a royal float before.
I told you to steal the jewels.
I did, but she caught me.
She's handing them out like candy.
Get those jewels back, Esteban, or I'll tell them what you did.
How, Victor?
They are wearing them.
The way we used to do it.
Our sleight-of-hand tricks.
I'll create a distraction, and you get the jewels off them... partner.
Isabel, Mommy wore this on your tenth birthday.
It's beautiful.
Mijito.
It was so sweet of you to bring out the jewels for the parade.
Ay, abuela, please.
It's going to be a long parade, so I brought plenty of guava juice.
Andale!
Hang on, abuela, I've got you.
Steady, abuelo.
Victor, slow down.
It's not a race.
We don't want to be late.
Isabel!
Isa, the beak is coming loose.
Don't worry, I'll fix it.
Okay, that is it.
I have them all.
No, you don't.
The tiara.
But it is on her head.
There is no way to take it without everyone seeing.
Get rid of the others.
What?
!
Hey, she unhooked the float.
Why would she do that?
Adios!
Carla!
Now, get that tiara.
Now, who would like some refreshing guava juice?
Elena and Esteban are in trouble.
We have to help them, Francisco.
You already have enough jewels.
Just take them and go.
The tiara is the only piece that matters.
We're not leaving without it.
Then you are not leaving at all.
What are you doing?
What I should've done in the first place...
Making the right choice.
Whoa!
I'm warning you.
I'll tell her everything.
Do what you must.
Ha!
Princess.
It's about time you knew the truth about your dear cousin Esteban.
He made a secret deal with Shuriki to help her invade Avalor.
He betrayed your family.
That is how he stayed in power while the rest of us suffered.
I'll take that.
- Papa!
- No!
- Gracias, Carla.
- No!
Esteban!
You lose again, old friend.
They locked it.
Andale!
Rapido.
Elena, about what Victor said.
There's nothing to say, Esteban.
I know Victor was just lying to distract us.
Like you'd ever do anything to hurt your own family.
Yes, this is true.
But I do feel bad for serving Shuriki all those years.
You had no choice.
That is what I told myself, but I have always felt guilty.
You shouldn't.
You did what you had to do to survive, and when the time came, you stood up to Shuriki, and helped us defeat her.
You tried to stop Victor today.
It's time to put the past behind you.
You can't change what you did before, but you can change what you do next.
You... you're right, Elena.
I can.
We must get out of here.
We cannot let them get away with this.
Ay!
Why did Isabel have to make this thing so strong?
Except for the beak.
I see them!
But I can't fit.
Wait, wait.
All this rocking is making the float move.
That's it!
Elena, I know how we can catch them.
Help me get the float moving.
Just a few... more... tries.
We did it!
It's moving.
Quick, climb back up the neck.
One of us needs to see where we are going.
Move, move!
Traffic.
- Lean to the left.
- Leaning left.
- Now hard to the right.
- Hard right.
Carla, they're coming.
This way.
They're headed into the park.
Lean left.
Now!
They're thieves, stop them!
Turn this float around.
The Crown Princess needs us!
Follow me.
Okay, veer right.
Brace yourself, Esteban.
Stop right there.
Not so fast.
I'll take those... old friend.
Captain.
Remove these thieves from our kingdom, and see that they never return.
Yes, Your Majesty.
What do we do now, Papa?
We needed that tiara.
We will find another way, Carla.
I assure you.
Avalor has not heard the last of us.
This is where your mother's tiara belongs.
Thank you, Esteban.
I wish we had something for you.
We do.
You said you weren't worthy of this honor, but I think you've earned the right to wear the crown.
Chancellor Esteban,
I hereby proclaim you... king of the carnaval.
Would you like to do the honors?
Nothing would please me more.
Let the carnaval parade begin!
Previously on "Queen Sugar"...
I'm worried about him.
He's not talking.
Did you know Micah wet himself the night the police took him?
I need to be in St. Jo's with you.
You matter most.
- Let's get it and get out of here.
- Let's go!
Hurry up!
He sent me to join the collective so he could see what y'all was doing.
If you come after one of us again, you come after all of us.
- Is that a threat?
- Yeah, it is.
I'm no lawyer, but it should stand up in court as a will.
- My sisters won't sue me.
- You sure?
Micah!
Let's go!
Breakfast is ready.
Breakfast mean eggs and bacon?
Don't act like you don't like these.
- Right?
- It's good.
Good morning.
- That what I think it is?
- Yep.
I mended some of your clothes for you.
Thanks, but I meant the other thing.
Blue, come see your surprise!
- Do you need help?
Are you good?
- No, I'm good, thanks.
- Where's Blue?
- He was still in bed when I got in the shower but gone when I got out.
Maybe he's hiding somewhere with my calculus binder.
- You can't find it?
- No.
I think I may have left it at Dad's.
Or maybe it's at Aunt Vi's.
I know things have been tough lately, but I put a deposit down on that rental that we liked.
It'll be ours in two weeks, promise.
Me and Kenya decorated it for you.
I told you to stay out of my stuff.
We're late.
Let's go.
Come on.
- What's this?
- See if you can guess what fun thing we're doing today.
Fishy toy.
Swimming!
- Bye, Pop.
Let's go.
- Bye.
- Bye, Pop.
- Bye.
We don't have enough time to waste!
Okay, okay, okay.
What you doing down there?
Hopefully fixing this disposal.
Can you turn on the water?
Hit the switch.
Hopefully, like there was a doubt.
Never know.
Could be losing my touch.
So, what's next?
Mwah.
No, no, no.
What's next on the "honey do" list?
Nothing.
You're done.
What you mean done?
I mean you've been here three weeks now, and the house is perfect.
No, no.
I never finish that list.
You must be forgetting something.
Normally, you go back to the rigs, and then the list grows while you're gone.
So what do I do now?
Just sit around waiting for stuff to break?
Some people call that "relaxing."
You should try it.
What, baby?
You don't know how?
Here's how.
You take your behind and you sit it on that seat out there.
You put your feet up on the table, and you watch that TV.
And... hold on.
You drink this.
For how long?
Until I come home from work, and then we...
I know what we do then.
That's right.
Rest up.
- Hi.
- Ma'am, sign.
Thank you.
The control panel is that way.
- You'll need hats.
- Yes, ma'am.
They're setting up our eye in the sky... one room where we'll monitor all the parts of the process, which means we'll be able to locate and fix problems quickly.
Add that upgrade to our shortretention clarifiers, which process in 45 minutes instead of three hours, and our new spectrometers which analyze cane sucrose levels in less than a minute.
And I hope I've been clear...
our focus is on efficiency.
Well, your daddy used to say farming is waiting and waiting is farming.
That's true, Mr. Webb.
But my motto for the mill is another old saw... time is money.
I keep my costs down, those savings go to you.
These fancy machines are only as good as the people that run them.
You don't have any experience with that.
True, but Remy here has helped me recruit.
Joe Rodriguez as operations manager.
Joe has over 20 years of milling under his belt, and he's even consulted in the development of some of those fancy machines.
So you've seen for yourselves how well the renovations are going.
Come harvest, this mill will be more than ready for business.
I hope I have convinced you to give me yours.
That's very impressive, young lady.
Thank you.
- Hope to get your business.
- Thank you...
Thank you so much.
Thanks again.
Nova Bordelon, we meet at last.
Mr. McDonald.
Welcome to the "Daily News."
Steve, please.
Sorry.
Just getting settled in.
Been reading a lot more than decorating.
Read your bail piece.
It's tough, solid.
Great work.
Thank you.
That said, I'd like to put a pin in it.
The story's important.
No one writes about social and criminal justice as in depth as this paper does.
As I do.
I agree, and I fully support your series on mass incarceration.
I just want you to cast your net a little wider.
You know, help us balance the coverage of the issues.
I can tell you, Steve, it's hard to find balance in NoLa.
A lot is broken around here.
Yeah, but not everything.
And our readers wanna see what's working.
So we're also gonna profile areas of success, like diversion, reentry programs.
Due respect, you just got here.
You know what our readers want?
I know 100 newspapers have gone out of business the last 10 years.
And we could be next if our readers go looking elsewhere for good news because we only write about problems, not solutions.
Just give my plan a shot, Nova.
We can do great things together.
Free for lunch?
Absolutely.
We can celebrate the contracts that Byron Webb and Cardale Stewart signed.
That's 1,500 acres of cane between them.
I know.
And you brought them in, which is why I'm buying.
Thank you.
What do you see here?
Cobwebs?
Possibility.
Queen Sugar will be a major brand someday.
This could be a flagship retail space.
Hold on.
Hi, Nadine.
Am I getting the keys early?
Yeah, yeah, I can do that.
Okay, thanks.
Unbelievable.
I found the perfect rental, and the current tenant just decided not to move out.
My rental agent wants to show me another listing right now.
All right.
Raincheck, then?
Unless you want to take a look at it and we can grab a bite after?
I mean, you seem to be pretty good with second opinions.
Already?
I'll see y'all soon.
Soybean seed set aside for us.
You know what?
I'm trying to plant them in the ground today.
That don't look right.
What's wrong?
That whitefly?
Upstairs has four bedrooms, each with its own bath.
Wait until you see the master.
And this is the reading salon.
Has plenty of natural light, but it feels like a private oasis in the home.
It's lovely.
And there's a home theater.
Sorry, excuse me.
Hey, what's up?
We got a big problem.
You see that?
Ew, wait, what... what is that?
Whitefly.
Might not kill the cane, but could make it worthless.
How much of the crop is affected?
About 30 acres.
- I'm ready to start scrubbing now.
- Scrubbing?
Yeah, cleaning and removing the contaminated leaves.
Well, how... how long will that take?
Enough people, a day.
Be faster to do an aerial application.
It's fast, but it ain't cheap.
How not cheap?
At least five grand.
My FSA check came in today.
No, no, that money is for you, for the soybeans.
I'm paying for the spray.
Thanks.
Make it happen, Prosper.
- All right.
- Yeah.
May you never be thirsty.
May no enemy slow your growth.
May your life not be ordinary but fulfilled with flavor, happiness, and substance.
Like salt, you will preserve all that is good.
May you live a long, sweet, and happy life.
May these blankets... warm... and protect you... as you were warm and protected in your mother's belly.
Look at you.
You know you're a natural.
Even with your daddy passing, you don't wanna have a family of your own?
I got Rah, Charley, Aunt Vi, my nephews, and a great big community of brothers and sisters
I fight alongside every day.
That's all the family I want and all the family I ever need.
Meanwhile, there's plenty of work to keep me busy.
And how is saving the world going?
When am I gonna read your next bomb piece, Miss Ida B. Wells?
What?
I don't think my new editor and I agree about what stories to cover.
He killed my piece on bail bonds after he told me how great he thinks I am.
Well, then tell him you quit unless he runs it.
And what if he calls my bluff?
I lose my paycheck and my platform.
So, what are you gonna do?
Only thing I can do.
Go along to get along till I finally win him over.
Look at that!
Pop!
What is that?
Sugar's so sweet, it's already attracting flies.
We gotta get rid of them.
- I want Kenya to see it.
- All right, go get her.
- How was it?
- It was good.
Crowded.
Did you know that Blue can't swim?
I can barely swim myself.
I mean, just enough to jump off my daddy's boat.
Why?
You swim?
I was named allstate junior and senior year.
- Damn.
- You should be impressed.
I didn't know you did all that.
I saw a flyer for swimming classes at the pool.
I think it'd be good for Blue.
How much that cost?
I could pay for the lessons out of my paycheck.
I told you, I don't want you doing it.
But it'd help.
I appreciate it.
If this doesn't work, I'm about to lose
$1 1/2 million worth of cane.
How's that factor into your decision about the house on Chesley?
I could I'll swing it.
That place is almost perfect.
I don't love the fixtures in the guest bath, but...
It's just you and Micah.
You'll probably never even be in that guest bathroom.
Listen, your rent money is better spent around here.
But there is closer to Micah's school and classmates.
And, yes, it's a lot of house, but after everything he's been through, he needs some normalcy.
Your normal sure is different from mine.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Charley, you're asking farmers to take a risk by grinding at your mill.
What do you think they're gonna think when they see you living large right down the street from the Landrys?
That I have worked hard to get here, that I'm doing right by my son.
That you believe that you can't do right by your son right here.
- No, that is not fair.
- Now, you say that your mill is a way to uplift the community?
You want to lead the people, baby, you gotta show that you love the people.
Fair or not, that's what's always been required in black role models.
Being a role model means living by example and showing that if you work hard, you can enjoy the fruits of your success.
What is so wrong with black success looking like white success?
Why does white have to be the model for our aspirations?
Okay, so waving my black card when I'm choosing my home means being okay with having less?
Really?
There are plenty of white people out there trying to tell me where and how to live.
I don't accept that from them, and I won't take it from black people either.
- I'm not asking you to...
- Hey, you two, what's shakin'?
Hey, Wood!
What you been up to since you got back?
Well, you know, a little bit of this, a little bit of that.
- Hey, baby.
- We can't make breakfast when the eggs don't get here till noon.
- All right.
- I had engine trouble.
That's your problem and your distributor's, not mine.
So we gonna have to talk about discounts to make up for this next quarter.
Betty Ann!
Eggs are finally here.
Come on back.
Welcome, baby.
Go on, take a seat.
Somebody will be right with you.
Um, ladies' bathrooms?
Nasty.
Supply closet.
You want me to do it?
Make me proud.
Hey, baby, what you doing here?
You run out of beer?
No, just bored, and I missed you.
Can't a man come see his lady?
You can see her all you want, but I can't entertain you while I'm working.
No problem.
Hello, Grandma.
I hear that Tonya had a little baby boy.
Isaiah, after my favorite verse.
"Those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength."
They will soar...
on wings like eagles.
They will run and not grow weary.
"They will walk and not be faint."
Name like that, he blessed for life.
Hope so, but we still gonna christen him day after tomorrow just in case.
No, that's right.
And actually, I was hoping you could make some pies for the reception.
Baby, I only do that for Juneteenth.
- Why not?
I'll pay?
- No disrespect to Isaiah or the Lord, but this place here?
It do make me grow weary.
You know I can help.
Now look, I done seen you bake pie a thousand times.
Just write down a list of everything we need and trust I can handle the rest.
Come on, Vi, how you gonna turn down both these faces?
Well, it looks like I'm not gonna get any peace unless I say yes.
Yes.
If we stop the whiteflies from spreading, but lose the infested 30 acres, that's still 10% of our yield gone.
We plant some of them soybeans, we can make some of that back.
Your current commodities report shows that soybeans are behind sugar.
- I'm also worried about the mill.
- Yah!
What the hell is wrong with you?
!
Get off him!
- You okay, Blue?
- Get off of him.
Don't ever lay your hands on my son again.
You take your hands off of my son now!
I won't.
It was an accident.
Stop!
It's okay.
Come on.
Shh, shh, shh.
It's okay, buddy.
It's okay.
Let's go to sleep.
Let's go to sleep.
- Can I sleep with you tonight?
- Absolutely.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
I just wanna do my homework.
Micah...
I'm sorry.
It was an accident.
Don't make it right.
Neither was what you did.
Micah's going through a hard time.
I thought you of all people would understand that.
What you mean me of all people?
Come on, Rah.
He's been a wreck since he got arrested.
I know you ain't saying we had it the same.
His four hours in custody, and my four years in prison?
No, of course not.
I...
I'm just asking you to...
I'm asking you to understand that it messed him up.
You and Davis messed him up.
Micah even know any people who ain't famous or kin?
Micah's soft.
And it's your fault raising him like that.
Your money don't make you safe here, Charley.
It just make you forget who you really are.
It's not all bad news.
I don't see any live whitefly.
Thank God.
But fungus could set in if we don't wash these leaves.
Well, what do we use for that?
Elbow grease.
So, all those acres we sprayed, we gotta clean them all by hand now?
Yep.
That's the only way.
I'm gonna go buy supplies.
All right, good.
I'm gonna call the collective, see who can give us a hand.
All right.
Hey, John...
Don't worry about it.
Us field negroes can deal without you.
Hey, my baby!
How was work?
It was...
What is going on here?
I got a triple batch of dough chilling in the refrigerator,
- and these strawberries are...
- No, baby!
You're gonna burn your mouth.
Here.
Here, here, here, here.
Go, go, go, go.
That's pretty good.
Honey, would you separate the eggs for custard?
Ralph Angel want me to come over.
Said there was a problem with the sugarcane.
Well, if he's calling, you should go.
No.
Are you sure?
'Cause I wanna stay here and help for when Sheena comes.
Baby, go.
They need you more.
I'll come by after I finish up here.
And recidivism is down by 5%.
Every way you look at the numbers, we're keeping nonviolent offenders out of jail.
The statistics are definitely impressive.
But I wanna get past the numbers, talk about the people, the participants and counselors that make the program work.
You can drop the act.
What act?
When's the last time you didn't take our office, the police, the courts, all of us out to the whipping chair?
I'm tough, but I'm fair.
Give me a success story and I'll write it straight.
- You know me, Tara.
- I do know you.
So I know what happens when I tell you that the DOJ cut Diversion funding by more than 30%.
Or are you so intent on scoring points with your new boss that you're giving the administration a pass on that?
That's what I thought.
This is why no one else from the office will talk to you on the record.
Thank you for your time.
Good luck with whatever you're trying to do here.
Hey, what's going on?
Dealing with these damn whiteflies.
What about the spraying?
Still got a lot of work to do.
Any chance you can come by?
Um...
It's that bad?
Yeah.
I need you.
I'll figure it out.
Hi.
Didn't know I was paying you to make personal phone calls.
I'm really sorry.
Um, there's kind of a emergency.
Would it be okay if I leave?
- I can find someone to cover.
- Emergency?
Your kid?
No, he's... he's fine.
It's, um... it's my boyfriend.
No.
You deal with your love life after your shift ends.
First step is washing.
This is dish soap, vinegar, and water.
Nothing to be afraid of.
You spray it and you scrub it.
Now, once the leaf is clean, then you wanna check its health, okay?
If it's withered, we wanna cut it.
We wanna put it in a bag.
Bag get full, we wanna seal it up... and run it to the truck for disposal.
- Mama!
- Baby!
And last but not least, we set traps.
Thanks for coming.
Thank you for asking.
Blue, the traps.
All right, yellow attracts the flies.
And the Vaseline gets them stuck.
All right, grab your equipment and fan out.
I can't thank you gentlemen enough for coming out.
Yeah, well, Ernest was always there for me.
We do for each other or not at all.
Of course, we had a bet whether you'd be out here ruining your manicure.
You owe me 30 bucks.
Whoo.
Is this is okay for you?
Or you got even fancier stuff in the fridge?
Give me that water.
Let me ask you something.
You still think I'm a bougie bitch?
Charley, I don't think that.
- We was just disagreeing.
- I know.
But it came from somewhere.
And where is this coming from now?
A bunch of stuff.
That bet between the farmers.
Stuff Remy said.
Stuff Rah said.
You letting Rah get to you?
You don't know the half of it.
You know he had Micah up against the wall last night?
- What?
- You believe that?
Y'all too close for comfort around here.
You and Micah are more than welcome to come and stay with me.
I appreciate that, but this house is ours as much as is his.
I'm not gonna let him run me off.
Now I know you not a bougie bitch.
That's a straightup hood attitude right there.
I'll bring it up right here.
Looks like you could use a break.
I made some extra apple pie.
Come on in and get yourself a piece.
I'll eat when we done.
Ralph Angel, I am trying to be uplifting here.
- Thank you, Aunt Vi.
- Hey, baby.
How much more y'all got to do?
We just finished the first...
Be out here at least another three hours.
Excuse me.
I thought y'all been getting along.
Yeah, well... she always say something to let you know she a whole lot better than you.
And I'm doing her a favor.
She staying in my house on my farm.
She has a right, Ralph Angel.
It's her farm, too.
Your daddy made that clear.
Yeah, he made it clear, all right.
What is going on with you?
I found a letter a couple of months back, a letter Pops left to me.
A letter?
All this?
He said he left it to me and Blue.
And Charley don't even know.
I wasn't ready to tell anybody before.
But now I want Charley to know so she'll get up out my face.
Ralph Angel.
You don't want this.
Trust me, this can hurt y'all up something bad, something you can't come back from.
You want me to hold on to it?
For how long?
I expect you're gonna do what you wanna do.
But I'm telling you right now, you can let your mouth and your pride write that check if you wanna, but you best be ready to cash it, you hear me?
Yes, ma'am.
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey.
How was Econ Club?
Not as exciting as what went on here all day.
You heard about that?
Yeah, Aunt Vi posted a bunch of pictures on Facebook.
What you looking at?
How would you feel about staying closer to the mill and the farm?
I mean, we won't exactly find what we're used to, but...
That's fine.
I mean, I know we won't.
Nothing here is like back home.
I know.
And I'm gonna find someone to help us talk about all that, okay?
I'll get it.
Mom?
Yes?
Can I help you?
We're looking for Ralph Angel Bordelon.
That you?
I'm Ralph Angel.
What's this about?
Parole violation.
What you mean I violated my parole?
We received a complaint about gunshots
- coming from this property.
- What?
Do you have any weapons on this premises?
I do.
Well, my father did, and he left it to me.
I've been staying with my brother.
- Here?
- Yeah.
You fired it?
Yep.
Unfortunately, it's still a violation to be in the house with a weapon.
I didn't even know it was here.
And I didn't know it was a problem.
I'm moving out tomorrow to my own place, so it'll be gone anyway.
It's not that simple, Mrs. West.
I understand.
You know, this whole move from LA has been a little challenging.
I mean, I'm just not used to snakes and rats and everything else out there that rustles around when I'm trying to sleep.
You know, I honestly don't even know how you all do it.
Well, you just be sure you take it with you.
You folks have a good night.
Guess I better start packing.
You going back to Aunt Vi's?
I'll figure something out.
Charley...
Thanks.
No matter what you think of me, Rah,
I will always have your back.
I remember when you was born.
You about as much younger as me as I am from Nova, so I thought you were kind of like a little brother.
Except for Charley never really brought you around and I never made my way to Cali, so...
I don't know how you grew up.
But I know it's way different from Louisiana.
Hey.
All I'm saying is...
I been through some shit.
For real.
So, you ever need someone to talk to now that you're here,
I'm about it.
I got you.
All right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry I hit Blue.
Tell him.
Thing is, man, being inside... it's normal for folks to act like animals.
Hell, they practically force us to.
But out here?
We human.
Can't never forget that.
I'm sorry I put my hands on you.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
Get some rest.
I'm sorry I made such a mess in your kitchen that you sent me out... to do backbreaking work just to get rid of me.
You fool.
Maybe I ain't all that.
Sorry.
It felt good to do an honest day's worth of labor.
You know, I think I might go out and try to find a job.
You're just restless, baby, that's all.
Shoot, you busted your rump for 20 years.
You got money in the bank, more on the way, so... take some time.
Don't rush into something else.
Baby, I like working.
I know.
I do, too.
But they got us thinking that we're supposed to work until we die.
And if we don't, we the problem.
Well, that ain't my American dream.
Is that yours?
Nah.
Do you know what my dream is?
This.
Waking up beside you every morning, going to bed beside you every night.
How we fill in the rest of the time, it really don't matter.
Of course it does.
What, and you think you ain't wasting your time at the High Yellow?
I see the look on your face when you running around.
That ain't the look of love.
It's the look of determination.
I worked my butt off for that promotion.
I know you did.
But I always see you at your most happiest when you in your kitchen.
So tell me, what does your dream look like?
What does it look like?
I guess it... it looks like... me making people happy with my food... my pies.
I... guess it's me having my own business.
You saying that like it can't happen.
Look... let me figure out what to do next.
But I want you to figure out the same thing.
We ain't too old to get ours, baby.
We ain't.
I didn't touch anything.
That's okay.
Um, I wanted to thank you for sharing your room with me.
Look, I'm sorry I hit you.
It was an accident, but that doesn't make it okay.
I just want you to know that I will never hurt you again.
I'm sorry, too.
I didn't ask you if you wanted to play.
You never have to ask with me, ever.
Ooh, I got you something.
For you and Kenya.
Now you can make a masterpiece.
Charley, did you leave anything in the store?
Well, we basically came here with the clothes on our backs.
Takes more than that to make a home.
Well, whatever you have back in storage in Los Angeles,
I don't think any of it's gonna work in here.
She's right.
I don't see a home theater.
You sure about living at the mill?
Well, you can't get much closer to the community than this, right?
What's this?
Grandma got that on a trip to Egypt.
Gave it to me when I left for college.
It's sort of a good luck charm.
Think it works?
Baby, if you're uncomfortable with this, just say the word.
I can always undo a crazy lastminute decision.
No, I'm tired of moving around.
Besides, it'll be fun to watch you rough it.
Anybody wanna bet how long it'll be before Mom decides to move out?
- Four days.
- Two months.
- A couple hours.
- Y'all give Charley a break.
And the answer is she won't last through the first week of harvest.
It's okay, baby, because you're always welcome home.
I'll just tell Hollywood he has to remember to put on his drawers.
Okay.
I'm glad you and Charley made up.
- She told you about what happened?
- Enough.
She thinks it was the Boudreauxs called the cops on you.
She probably right.
They're dangerous, Ralph Angel.
You gotta be more careful.
It was nice seeing Darla yesterday.
She good for you, little brother.
Tell me something I don't know.
Heard.
Your final paycheck.
What?
I specifically told you not to leave, and you did anyway.
You're fired, effective immediately.
This job is part of my recovery.
Please give me another chance.
I will stay late.
I will pick up more shifts.
Please.
Part of recovery is also being accountable for your actions.
You made a decision.
These are the consequences.
Now leave the premises or I'll call security and have them escort you out.
Probationary WPC 515G Tennison, attached to B Relief Hackney, sir.
- You worried they'll eat her alive?
- No, I wasn't, sir.
No.
And what brings you to the police?
I thought the force could do with more posh sorts, sir.
I'm very sorry to tell you that a girl we believe to be your daughter has been found dead.
We are treating it as a murder enquiry.
- When did you last see her?
- Over a year ago.
Who would want Julie-Ann dead, Eddie?
Think!
- Did you see her get into a car?
- Yeah, a red one.
- What sort of red car, Eddie?
- A Jaguar.
Eddie Phillips has absconded.
I want all units out there looking for him now.
♪ Call out the instigator
♪ Because there's something in the air
♪ We've got to get together sooner or later
♪ Because the revolution's here

They said you'd be here.
Sir, I don't think Eddie Phillips was just Julie-Ann's boyfriend.
What?
I went to speak to Suzy and she...
Tennison, you shouldn't have done that.
- There are protocols.
- I know, but...
Whatever she said could be inadmissible.
When was this?
- Just...
- Best if you don't tell me.
- Same again.
- Sure.
- What are you having?
- Erm...
I'll just have the same as you.
There you go.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Eight years ago, we had this young PC --
Charlie Hopkins.
He was not much older than you.
He died while doing a routine check on a vehicle with false plates.
The driver deliberately mowed him down.
What Hopkins didn't know was that... .. the driver was on his way to an armed raid on a bookies.
I got information about a garage that had taken the vehicle in for repairs, so I broke in.
I found it.
Smashed headlight... .. dented bumper... blood smear.
I knew I had him.
- The driver.
- You arrested him?
No.
No, he saw me go in the garage.
And by the time I came back with the warrant, he'd torched the car.
No fingerprints, no nothing to connect it to PC Hopkins.
Bastard got away with it.
Sorry.
I...
I didn't mean to be... .. going on about that.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Same as you, I trained at Hendon.
And when was that?
Late '50s?
Early '60s?
Really?
Well, I suppose that explains why you're walking me home, then.
Clearly, I'm old and doddery enough to warrant a chaperone.
Actually, it's because you nearly fell over coming out of the pub and then you tried to get your car keys out.
I didn't want to see what happened next.
Well, in that case, erm... .. thank you for saving my life.
No, seriously, erm...
I'm very...
Drunk?
Grateful.
I admire you.
No.
Sorry, I can't be doing that.
I'm your superior officer and er... we're both very drunk.
Evening.
Er...
I should be going.
Erm... will you be OK getting home?
Yes, I'll be fine.
Er... well, erm...
All right, early bird?
Morning.
Late one, was it?
Where'd you go?
Er... nowhere.
Stayed in.
Up late studying, that's all.
Tell me we've found Eddie Phillips.
Still looking but we'll find him.
Sir, nothing found in Eddie's flat.
- Not one print that matches Julie-Ann's.
- Bollocks.
Any luck tracing the red Jag that Eddie claimed picked Julie-Ann up?
- That was the last time she was seen alive.
- Nothing yet.
Can you get started on those red Jag phone calls, Jane?
- Jane?
- Hm?
- Phone calls?
- Yes.
- Where did you get up to?
- Er...
let's see.
Go from there.
Morgan.
I need a plonk to accompany me to Julie-Ann's parents.
Er...
Sergeant Harris has posted me on foot patrol covering Five Beat.
Sorry.
Tennison?
There was a matching necklace.
It was part of a set.
I'm sorry.
We haven't found that yet.
At least we'll have something of hers for the service.
We'll release the body as soon as we can.
There is another reason that we stopped by.
What is it?
We've already told you everything we know.
This may be difficult for you to hear.
Julie-Ann may have been trying to kick her drug habit because she was pregnant.
Oh, dear God.
I take it neither of you knew?
The newspaper describes Julie-Ann as a drug user and a prostitute.
If you speak to the press, will you remind them that she was more than that?
Of course.
The post-mortem also revealed that your daughter had injuries consistent with a beating we think from about two weeks before her death.
W-W-Was this the boyfriend?
This... er...
Eddie?
How do you know about Eddie?
The newspaper describes him as Julie-Ann's boyfriend.
"Helping with your enquiries."
♪ Wish everybody would leave me alone, yeah
'The news is on the hour every hour.

Come on, John.
Time to get up.
They've been talking about that poor murdered girl again on the radio.
Ta.
Makes you scared to leave your own home.
Is David back?
He was.
Went straight out again.
He spoken to you?
About?
Just wondered what he's up to.
John?
Is this about some girl he was seeing?
He's fine, Ma.
Here, do us some bacon, will you?
♪ All those lies can be so unkind
♪ They can make you feel like you're losing your mind
You got anything stronger?
Do I look like a dealer?
Please, man.
Tell me where I can find Eddie, then.
You're not gonna find him.
If you really need something,
I can give you an address not far from here.
We're speaking to all Jaguar dealers in the area, looking for the owner of a red XJ series.
20,000 red Jags sold since 1968.
- Can we get a better description?
- When we find Eddie, we'll ask him.
- Tennison?
- Hm?
I just found Julie-Ann's PM report lying on my desk.
Yes.
You told me to leave it there, sir.
Yes, but it needs to be in an envelope with my name on it.
It's sensitive material.
This vehicle was parked at Homerton Hospital.
- 'Are you still there?
'
- Sorry about that.
Sorry, you said he worked there?
And that's definitely a red Jaguar?
Erm... this garage serviced a red XJ6 for a doctor at Homerton Hospital.
So that's Dr Hussein Pryor.
Thank you.
Great.
- Morgan, you beauty.
- Yes!
Come on!
Silas, darling, is that van gonna be parked there all day?
Once they've unloaded it, I'll get them to move it round the corner, OK?
And the noise level?
I do hope there won't be any noise?
Let's hope not.
I will sort it.
You're a treasure, darling.
Hey.
You have to keep quiet.
The busybody next door will complain and the council will shut me down.
Please, move this stuff downstairs.
What do you care if the council shut you down?
Yeah, this time next week, you'll be on a beach.
Sitting on a big pile of cash!
- Ready to roll?
- Yeah.
What are you gonna do with your share?
Get as far away from here as possible.
Me too.
- Mum will be all right, won't she?
- Yeah.
She'll have Dad to look after her.
Yeah.
Oi.
I don't know what's going on in that head of yours,
- but don't fuck this one up for us, David.
- I'm not gonna.
She looks familiar.
Julie-Ann Collins.
She came here as an outpatient on May 1st to sign up to your methadone programme.
She was last seen climbing into a red Jaguar outside here.
Do you own a red Jaguar XJ6?
My wife has the Jag.
Ex-wife.
She lives in Kent.
We're gonna have to contact your wife to confirm this.
Fine.
Have you talked to Teresa?
- Who's Teresa?
- Teresa O'Duncie.
One of the receptionists.
I'm sure she knew this girl.
- Is Teresa here now?
- Ask one of the girls.
They'll have her details.
Thank you for coming in, Miss O'Duncie.
After I had my appendix out last month, the stitches got infected.
Just take a seat.
I had this shooting pain right across my stomach.
So they put me on a course of antibiotics...
O'Duncie?
Is that with a C-Y?
C-I-E.
Well, when I came back to work today and heard about Julie-Ann, the pain came back, in the same place, right here, so maybe it's an emotional pain, not an infection.
- Every cloud...
- Hm.
Dr Pryor said you let Julie-Ann use an office phone.
Her and Eddie.
We know Eddie at the unit.
He was always around.
I was never sure about him.
- Any idea who she called?
- No.
I overheard her asking someone for money.
Well, demanding.
But it was an 01 number.
- Would anyone have written it down?
- Yeah, me.
External calls have to go through the switchboard.
You still have it?
When Julie-Ann left, did Eddie go with her?
He asked her where she was going.
But she told him to mind his own business.
He got really angry with her.
I reckon he's done this.
You should speak to him.
Hi, Sheila.
The public phone's always out of order, so I didn't think there would be a problem.
I like to help the poor angels any way I can, point them in the right direction.
That's where I wrote it down.
On the pad there.
Before I got this job, I was an outpatient here.
It's a disease -- addiction.
Stop!
- What you doing?
- Checking for indented writing.
Not by that ham-fisted method.
The forensic document examiner does that.
He's got a bigger pencil.
Come on.
What you doing here again?
I've been thinking...
I want the same share as John and Danny.
They're doing the manual labour.
It's worked out on merit.
You hardly even know Danny.
- He's your cousin.
He's family too.
- And I'm your son.
David!
We're only keeping 40%.
The rest goes to Whiteley.
The slices are already cut very thin.
Thinner for some than others.
Why has the money become an issue all of a sudden?
You can have 5% of mine.
Ten.
Don't push your luck!
Cliffy, mate.
Looked like you was having some family trouble.
A son like that needs to be brought in line.
Don't fill me with confidence seeing you being talked to by a cripple like that.
♪ I don't mind
Shit!
♪ Just what you say
♪ I never heard you, baby
We're looking for your mate Eddie.
I've not seen him since you last picked us up.
Well, he's your mate.
Has he not dropped by?
- No.
- Shall we take you in, Billy?
- I swear!
- Last chance.
What did you put in your pocket as I came in?
Help us out or we take a look.
Try Dwayne Clarke.
Eddie always runs to him when he's in trouble.
This car was parked outside Homerton Hospital...
Hello?
Thank you.
I was wondering if you'd had a chance to look at the hospital notepad we brought in.
We need to speak to this prick Billy told us about, Dwayne Clarke.
- He's hiding Eddie.
- Still looking.
We'll find him.
Nothing so far.
No record, his name doesn't crop up anywhere.
Well, run his name by Drugs and Vice.
Shake some branches.
He's getting fidgety.
He's rumbled.
Go, go, go!
- Hello, lads.
- Jesus!
You scared the shit out of me!
I didn't realise you Drug Squad boys got scared.
- My guv needs your help.
- Oh, yeah?
We need you to ID someone.
Dwayne Clarke, real name Darren Ackroyd.
Believe it or not, but the lad is well connected.
Fingers in lots of pies.
Dwayne's got form, likes to stomp on heads.
- Junkies, mostly.
- Where can we find him?
You don't.
He's the subject of a long-running undercover operation.
- Oh, come on, don't be a job's worth.
- My hands are tied.
This is a murder investigation.
She was 17, for God's sake.
We think he's harbouring our prime suspect.
If you don't touch him, we'll agree to a fair exchange of information.
We'll show you ours if... well, you know.
We don't know for certain if there's active surveillance on him.
So make sure no-one outside this room knows.
Find Dwayne and we get Eddie.
And where do we find him?
Duke let slip that Dwayne has an alias:
Darren Ackroyd.
We've got an address and a car registered to him.
Come in!
Sorry to interrupt.
Sir, the Forensic Document Examiner... erm... retrieved a partial number from the pad we found at the hospital.
0-1, 9-4-6, 0-3.
I'll need your signature so that the GPO can send us a list of possibilities.
I put it in an envelope... with your name on it, sir.
Leave it with me.
Argh!
Arhh!
Argh!
- Who's the cripple now, then?
- Argh!
You should watch your fucking mouth.
Arrgh!
Don't suppose Dwayne drives a brown mini?
Look, if he is as smart as Duke suggests, then he's not gonna come back to his flat with Eddie, is he?
Better not be late for my gig tonight.
Do you do any Beatles?
Bolan, Quo, Slade, Kinks.
No bloody Beatles, no.
You should do some Beatles.
- Dwayne's not home.
- Darren's not home.
'Golf Hotel to DI Bradfield.
- 'Over.'
- Go ahead.
Uniform has spotted a blue Mercedes, listed owner Darren Ackroyd.
Registration:
Delta, Hotel, November.
Five, Seven, Seven, Hotel, heading north on Talbot Road.
Over.
Tell Uniforms to take him now.
We don't want to lose him.
That's him!
- 'Suspect apprehended.'
- Tell them to keep him there.
We're on our way.
Over.
- Where is he?
Did you lose him?
- He's over here.
He's a real handful.
- Took four of us to pin him down.
- Is everyone all right?
- Yes, sir.
- We've had to chuck him in here.
Get me out of here!
You arseholes, you've got nothing on me!
Dwayne?
Yoo-hoo, Mr Clarke?
- Can you hear me?
- You're gonna pay for this!
Knock once, if you can.
- You've got no right to do this.
- Is he cuffed?
Yeah.
Ready?
Oi, what's this all about?
Get me out of here now!
You arseholes have got nothing on me!
Good work.
Eddie Phillips -- his girlfriend has turned up dead, he's done a runner.
And we think you know where he is.
So let's see what Mr Clarke's been up to.
A scuzzy dickhead like Dwayne Clarke can afford a motor like this, and I'm on a poxy scooter!
I don't know no Eddie.
We saw you with him, idiot.
So why are you covering for him?
I'm not covering for that arsehole.
We found these in the air filter.
It's enough to throw possession with intent to supply at him.
What do we find in your car that starts with W?
I didn't put that there.
Who did, then?
Fucking tooth fairy?
Here we go.
Got it.
He kept a tally book.
So... in this little book we have a handy list of your customers.
Now, this Tod had quite the party on the 13th.
You supplied him with various drugs on the day that Julie-Ann died.
I've never seen that book before.
One of your coppers must have planted it.
You're on thin ice.
Same goes for that bag of weed and the money.
None of that is mine.
I'd like to speak to my solicitor.
Tell us where to find Eddie Phillips.
Fucking Eddie.
I ain't seen him.
How did you afford a place there, then?
I didn't.
I live with my parents.
Yeah?
So do I.
Can't you type any quicker?
He didn't give us Eddie, did he?
We'll stick him with the possession charge.
What do you tell Duke?
Speak of the devil.
You arrogant pricks.
All right.
Steady, mate.
Six months of surveillance down the drain.
We're building a case against some major players and you blew it out of the water!
I've got a murdered girl.
I don't give a toss about what long game you're playing.
What's that?
Part of our fair exchange of information.
Duke, hold on.
Shit!
- Who's that with Eddie and Julie-Ann?
- A new player.
We're still establishing his identity, but he's a regular supplier of Eddie's.
They were taken two days before she died.
All we know is, on the street, he's known as Oz.
Thank you.
According to the plans, the first wall is...
.. somewhere.
It's there.
Right...
let's go.
- Jesus.
- 'Eagle One to Eagle's Nest.
'Eagle One to Eagle's Nest.'
We're done for the night.
'You still awake up there?
'
Eagle One, I'm awake.
Over.
Might I suggest we continue without her?
- Dad, where is she?
- I told her to be here.
Oh, finally!
Sorry I'm late.
I hope you're not gonna wear that on the day.
It'll look like Pam's out on day release.
Please, Mum, I'm missing work for this.
Glad you could make it (!
)
- We're at the vows.
You take the bouquet.
- What?
Take it, then!
And then when we leave the vestry, you hand it back to me.
Got that?
I think we need to go over it again for my sister's benefit.
- In a rush, Tennison?
- Oh.
Morning, sarge.
First-aid training today.
I thought for a minute the rumours were right
- and you'd found yourself a new boyfriend.
- What rumours?
The general consensus around the station is the only reason you've signed up is to procure yourself a husband.
Great.
You could do a lot worse.
Now, I've got you down to accompany DI Bradfield to the Collins Service.
So dump your boyfriend and smarten up!
- Sarge thinks I'm only here to find a husband.
- Oh, yeah?
Like I'm a cat stuck up a tree, waiting for a man to save me.
There is not a man in this station I would open my legs for.
What?
None of them?
You're kidding?
They're all good for nothing.
Yeah.
I know.
- You got a boyfriend?
- No.
You?
Beating 'em off with a stick.
Look, I...
I don't usually drink that much.
What do I do if someone asks about the investigation?
Oh, erm...
Just tell them it's sub judice to discuss it.
George...
Oh, er... thank you for coming, Detective Inspector.
Have there been any developments?
We are chasing several leads, sir.
Oh, well, that's something.
So sad, George.
So very sad.
Erm...
let me get you a taxi, Reg.
Yeah.
I think you're right, George.
Tennison, could you call a taxi for this gentleman?
Of course.
Thank you, dear.
Would you like to come and say hello to Mary?
Of course.
Hello?
48 Church Mount Road, please.
Oh... 0-1, 9-4-6, 0-3-6-5.
Thank you.
[0-1, 9-4-6, 0-3-6-5.]
Cheers, then.
Is er... everything all right?
I didn't see any ashtrays, so I assume Mrs Collins would prefer I did this out here.
Ah, yes, well, er... you assumed right!
- Sorry, sir.
- You had the phone number.
I didn't think it was enough.
Well, it's enough to question him and get a warrant.
I trust we won't find your fingerprints all over those door handles?
I didn't touch it.
Where is Gibbs?
It was a good spot.
I don't usually drink that much.
That suspect driver I told you about...
About six weeks later, we arrested him for a different robbery.
And the bastard gets out this week.
What the hell's this?
Lords knows, I have no desire to delay your release, so I've convinced Mikey here to tell the warden he fell down the stairs.
So what?
Ought to tell your dog to be more careful who he bites.
Trust... that is so important to me, Clifford.
Now, I've invested too much in this job to allow anything to derail it.
Now, you promised me you could do it.
In return for 40%, I don't expect to have to deal with shite like this.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
Do you know who I am?
You're a nobody, old man.
You'll return the plans, and I'll find someone more obedient.
I was pulling schemes like this when you were still shitting in your nappies.
Now, my boys have already started.
So back off and let us get on with it.
All right.
Untwist your knickers, Clifford.
I've got people on the outside relying on you, so stop messing about and get it done.
Or next time, I'll take more than just your wife's purse.
Right, you four with me.
Where'd you go for that warrant?
Timbuktu?
Wait here.
With me.
All right?
Hi.
Make sure nobody goes into the bedrooms before I do.
One of the lads saw you and Bradfield outside the section house the other night.
I didn't think you were a cat stuck up a tree.
Be careful, Jane.
Nothing happened.
Weren't studying, were you?
Come on.
Excuse me.
- I'm so sorry.
- Of course.
DCI Bradfield?
What's this?
- A change of shift?
- I'm very sorry, Mr Collins, but your guests need to leave.
Wh-Wh-Whatever's happened?
My officers need to search your house.
This is the warrant.
Now?
I already told you that Julie-Ann didn't live here.
You also told us you hadn't spoken to her since last year, but that's not the case.
She telephoned this house on May 1st.
The day she was seen leaving the clinic.
Er... well, what do I tell them?
That you need to be alone.
They'll understand.
George?
Excuse me, could I... have everyone's attention, please?
Thanks for coming.
All yours, Paul.
I'm looking for anything that can place Julie-Ann Collins here in the last two weeks.
- Morgan, can you sit with Mrs Collins, please?
- Yeah.
Tennison, check the garage, see what you can find.
Sorry about this.
Wait there for me, please.
It will only take a couple of minutes.
Well, why are they speaking to George?
It's just a formality.
Oh, my God.
Did you speak to Julie-Ann on May 1st?
She telephoned and we spoke, but not for long.
What did you talk about?
Er... she wanted to borrow some money.
I refused.
- That was it.
- You didn't see her?
No.
So on that same day, outside Homerton Hospital, we have an eyewitness who saw your daughter getting into a red Jaguar.
You have a red Jaguar parked in your garage, George.
On May 1st, at 11am, did you pick your daughter up from Homerton Hospital?
I don't even know where that is.
And about two weeks later, Sunday May 13th, in the evening, can you tell me where you were?
I've already told you.
Tell me again, George.
My wife and I went to a dinner hosted by one of the managers at my factory.
We found red fibres on Julie-Ann's socks.
Are they gonna match the carpeting in your car, George?
Why do you keep using my first name?
You think I'm guilty?
My own daughter.
You think I'm capable of this?
After you picked her up from Homerton Hospital, where did you drive her?
Well?
We can place her near the car.
She left a nice clean thumb print on the passenger door handle.
Unless the father talks, it'd be hard for us to prove that was put there in the past two weeks.
Guv?
You need to see this.
We found nothing in the master bedroom or the study.
- The spare room's used for storage.
- Where's this going, Spence?
It's this room, sir.
There's blood here and here.
The mattress had been turned over.
These fibres seem a good match.
I'll have to check with the lab to be certain.
Sir?
Christ.
They locked her in here.
This is a cell.
George?
George!
- What's going on?
- Ma'am, please.
Probationary WPC 515G Tennison, attached to B Relief Hackney, sir.
- You worried they'll eat her alive?
- No, I wasn't, sir.
No.
And what brings you to the police?
I thought the force could do with more posh sorts, sir.
I'm very sorry to tell you that a girl we believe to be your daughter has been found dead.
We are treating it as a murder enquiry.
- When did you last see her?
- Over a year ago.
Who would want Julie-Ann dead, Eddie?
Think!
- Did you see her get into a car?
- Yeah, a red one.
- What sort of red car, Eddie?
- A Jaguar.
Eddie Phillips has absconded.
I want all units out there looking for him now.

Sir, I don't think Eddie Phillips was just Julie-Ann's boyfriend.
What?
I went to speak to Suzy and she...
Tennison, you shouldn't have done that.
- There are protocols.
- I know, but...
Whatever she said could be inadmissible.
When was this?
- Just...
- Best if you don't tell me.
- Same again.
- Sure.
- What are you having?
- Erm...
I'll just have the same as you.
There you go.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Eight years ago, we had this young PC --
Charlie Hopkins.
He was not much older than you.
He died while doing a routine check on a vehicle with false plates.
The driver deliberately mowed him down.
What Hopkins didn't know was that... .. the driver was on his way to an armed raid on a bookies.
I got information about a garage that had taken the vehicle in for repairs, so I broke in.
I found it.
Smashed headlight... .. dented bumper... blood smear.
I knew I had him.
- The driver.
- You arrested him?
No.
No, he saw me go in the garage.
And by the time I came back with the warrant, he'd torched the car.
No fingerprints, no nothing to connect it to PC Hopkins.
Bastard got away with it.
Sorry.
I...
I didn't mean to be... .. going on about that.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Same as you, I trained at Hendon.
And when was that?
Late '50s?
Early '60s?
Really?
Well, I suppose that explains why you're walking me home, then.
Clearly, I'm old and doddery enough to warrant a chaperone.
Actually, it's because you nearly fell over coming out of the pub and then you tried to get your car keys out.
I didn't want to see what happened next.
Well, in that case, erm... .. thank you for saving my life.
No, seriously, erm...
I'm very...
Drunk?
Grateful.
I admire you.
No.
Sorry, I can't be doing that.
I'm your superior officer and er... we're both very drunk.
Evening.
Er...
I should be going.
Erm... will you be OK getting home?
Yes, I'll be fine.
Er... well, erm...
All right, early bird?
Morning.
Late one, was it?
Where'd you go?
Er... nowhere.
Stayed in.
Up late studying, that's all.
Tell me we've found Eddie Phillips.
Still looking but we'll find him.
Sir, nothing found in Eddie's flat.
- Not one print that matches Julie-Ann's.
- Bollocks.
Any luck tracing the red Jag that Eddie claimed picked Julie-Ann up?
- That was the last time she was seen alive.
- Nothing yet.
Can you get started on those red Jag phone calls, Jane?
- Jane?
- Hm?
- Phone calls?
- Yes.
- Where did you get up to?
- Er...
let's see.
Go from there.
Morgan.
I need a plonk to accompany me to Julie-Ann's parents.
Er...
Sergeant Harris has posted me on foot patrol covering Five Beat.
Sorry.
Tennison?
There was a matching necklace.
It was part of a set.
I'm sorry.
We haven't found that yet.
At least we'll have something of hers for the service.
We'll release the body as soon as we can.
There is another reason that we stopped by.
What is it?
We've already told you everything we know.
This may be difficult for you to hear.
Julie-Ann may have been trying to kick her drug habit because she was pregnant.
Oh, dear God.
I take it neither of you knew?
The newspaper describes Julie-Ann as a drug user and a prostitute.
If you speak to the press, will you remind them that she was more than that?
Of course.
The post-mortem also revealed that your daughter had injuries consistent with a beating we think from about two weeks before her death.
W-W-Was this the boyfriend?
This... er...
Eddie?
How do you know about Eddie?
The newspaper describes him as Julie-Ann's boyfriend.

If you really need something,
I can give you an address not far from here.
We're speaking to all Jaguar dealers in the area, looking for the owner of a red XJ series.
20,000 red Jags sold since 1968.
- Can we get a better description?
- When we find Eddie, we'll ask him.
- Tennison?
- Hm?

Yes.
You told me to leave it there, sir.

So that's Dr Hussein Pryor.
Thank you.
Great.

She came here as an outpatient on May 1st to sign up to your methadone programme.
She was last seen climbing into a red Jaguar outside here.
Do you own a red Jaguar XJ6?
My wife has the Jag.
Ex-wife.
She lives in Kent.
We're gonna have to contact your wife to confirm this.
Fine.
Have you talked to Teresa?
- Who's Teresa?
- Teresa O'Duncie.
One of the receptionists.
I'm sure she knew this girl.
- Is Teresa here now?
- Ask one of the girls.
They'll have her details.
Thank you for coming in, Miss O'Duncie.
After I had my appendix out last month, the stitches got infected.
Just take a seat.
I had this shooting pain right across my stomach.
So they put me on a course of antibiotics...
O'Duncie?
Is that with a C-Y?
C-I-E.
Well, when I came back to work today and heard about Julie-Ann, the pain came back, in the same place, right here, so maybe it's an emotional pain, not an infection.
- Every cloud...
- Hm.
Dr Pryor said you let Julie-Ann use an office phone.
Her and Eddie.
We know Eddie at the unit.
He was always around.
I was never sure about him.
- Any idea who she called?
- No.
I overheard her asking someone for money.
Well, demanding.
But it was an 01 number.
- Would anyone have written it down?
- Yeah, me.
External calls have to go through the switchboard.
You still have it?
When Julie-Ann left, did Eddie go with her?
He asked her where she was going.
But she told him to mind his own business.
He got really angry with her.
I reckon he's done this.
You should speak to him.
Hi, Sheila.
The public phone's always out of order, so I didn't think there would be a problem.
I like to help the poor angels any way I can, point them in the right direction.
That's where I wrote it down.
On the pad there.
Before I got this job, I was an outpatient here.
It's a disease -- addiction.
Stop!
- What you doing?
- Checking for indented writing.
Not by that ham-fisted method.
The forensic document examiner does that.
He's got a bigger pencil.
Come on.
What you doing here again?
I've been thinking...
I want the same share as John and Danny.
They're doing the manual labour.
It's worked out on merit.
You hardly even know Danny.
- He's your cousin.
He's family too.
- And I'm your son.
David!
We're only keeping 40%.
The rest goes to Whiteley.
The slices are already cut very thin.
Thinner for some than others.
Why has the money become an issue all of a sudden?
You can have 5% of mine.
Ten.
Don't push your luck!
Cliffy, mate.
Looked like you was having some family trouble.
A son like that needs to be brought in line.
Don't fill me with confidence seeing you being talked to by a cripple like that.
♪ I don't mind
Shit!
♪ Just what you say
♪ I never heard you, baby
We're looking for your mate Eddie.
I've not seen him since you last picked us up.
Well, he's your mate.
Has he not dropped by?
- No.
- Shall we take you in, Billy?
- I swear!
- Last chance.
What did you put in your pocket as I came in?
Help us out or we take a look.
Try Dwayne Clarke.
Eddie always runs to him when he's in trouble.
This car was parked outside Homerton Hospital...
Hello?
Thank you.
I was wondering if you'd had a chance to look at the hospital notepad we brought in.
We need to speak to this prick Billy told us about, Dwayne Clarke.
- He's hiding Eddie.
- Still looking.
We'll find him.
Nothing so far.
No record, his name doesn't crop up anywhere.
Well, run his name by Drugs and Vice.
Shake some branches.
He's getting fidgety.
He's rumbled.
Go, go, go!
- Hello, lads.
- Jesus!
You scared the shit out of me!
I didn't realise you Drug Squad boys got scared.
- My guv needs your help.
- Oh, yeah?
We need you to ID someone.
Dwayne Clarke, real name Darren Ackroyd.
Believe it or not, but the lad is well connected.
Fingers in lots of pies.
Dwayne's got form, likes to stomp on heads.
- Junkies, mostly.
- Where can we find him?
You don't.
He's the subject of a long-running undercover operation.
- Oh, come on, don't be a job's worth.
- My hands are tied.
This is a murder investigation.
She was 17, for God's sake.
We think he's harbouring our prime suspect.
If you don't touch him, we'll agree to a fair exchange of information.
We'll show you ours if... well, you know.
We don't know for certain if there's active surveillance on him.
So make sure no-one outside this room knows.
Find Dwayne and we get Eddie.
And where do we find him?
Duke let slip that Dwayne has an alias:
Darren Ackroyd.
We've got an address and a car registered to him.
Come in!
Sorry to interrupt.
Sir, the Forensic Document Examiner... erm... retrieved a partial number from the pad we found at the hospital.
0-1, 9-4-6, 0-3.
I'll need your signature so that the GPO can send us a list of possibilities.
I put it in an envelope... with your name on it, sir.
Leave it with me.
Argh!
Arhh!
Argh!
- Who's the cripple now, then?
- Argh!
You should watch your fucking mouth.
Arrgh!
Don't suppose Dwayne drives a brown mini?
Look, if he is as smart as Duke suggests, then he's not gonna come back to his flat with Eddie, is he?
Better not be late for my gig tonight.
Do you do any Beatles?
Bolan, Quo, Slade, Kinks.
No bloody Beatles, no.
You should do some Beatles.
- Dwayne's not home.
- Darren's not home.
'Golf Hotel to DI Bradfield.
- 'Over.'
- Go ahead.
Uniform has spotted a blue Mercedes, listed owner Darren Ackroyd.
Registration:
Delta, Hotel, November.
Five, Seven, Seven, Hotel, heading north on Talbot Road.
Over.
Tell Uniforms to take him now.
We don't want to lose him.
That's him!
- 'Suspect apprehended.'
- Tell them to keep him there.
We're on our way.
Over.
- Where is he?
Did you lose him?
- He's over here.
He's a real handful.
- Took four of us to pin him down.
- Is everyone all right?
- Yes, sir.
- We've had to chuck him in here.
Get me out of here!
You arseholes, you've got nothing on me!
Dwayne?
Yoo-hoo, Mr Clarke?
- Can you hear me?
- You're gonna pay for this!
Knock once, if you can.
- You've got no right to do this.
- Is he cuffed?
Yeah.
Ready?
Oi, what's this all about?
Get me out of here now!
You arseholes have got nothing on me!
Good work.
Eddie Phillips -- his girlfriend has turned up dead, he's done a runner.
And we think you know where he is.
So let's see what Mr Clarke's been up to.
A scuzzy dickhead like Dwayne Clarke can afford a motor like this, and I'm on a poxy scooter!
I don't know no Eddie.
We saw you with him, idiot.
So why are you covering for him?
I'm not covering for that arsehole.
We found these in the air filter.
It's enough to throw possession with intent to supply at him.
What do we find in your car that starts with W?
I didn't put that there.
Who did, then?
Fucking tooth fairy?
Here we go.
Got it.
He kept a tally book.
So... in this little book we have a handy list of your customers.
Now, this Tod had quite the party on the 13th.
You supplied him with various drugs on the day that Julie-Ann died.
I've never seen that book before.
One of your coppers must have planted it.
You're on thin ice.
Same goes for that bag of weed and the money.
None of that is mine.
I'd like to speak to my solicitor.
Tell us where to find Eddie Phillips.
Fucking Eddie.
I ain't seen him.
How did you afford a place there, then?
I didn't.
I live with my parents.
Yeah?
So do I.
Can't you type any quicker?
He didn't give us Eddie, did he?
We'll stick him with the possession charge.
What do you tell Duke?
Speak of the devil.
You arrogant pricks.
All right.
Steady, mate.
Six months of surveillance down the drain.
We're building a case against some major players and you blew it out of the water!
I've got a murdered girl.
I don't give a toss about what long game you're playing.
What's that?
Part of our fair exchange of information.
Duke, hold on.
Shit!
- Who's that with Eddie and Julie-Ann?
- A new player.
We're still establishing his identity, but he's a regular supplier of Eddie's.
They were taken two days before she died.
All we know is, on the street, he's known as Oz.
Thank you.
According to the plans, the first wall is...
.. somewhere.
It's there.
Right...
let's go.
- Jesus.
- 'Eagle One to Eagle's Nest.
'Eagle One to Eagle's Nest.'
We're done for the night.
'You still awake up there?
'
Eagle One, I'm awake.
Over.
Might I suggest we continue without her?
- Dad, where is she?
- I told her to be here.
Oh, finally!
Sorry I'm late.
I hope you're not gonna wear that on the day.
It'll look like Pam's out on day release.
Please, Mum, I'm missing work for this.
Glad you could make it (!
)
- We're at the vows.
You take the bouquet.
- What?
Take it, then!
And then when we leave the vestry, you hand it back to me.
Got that?
I think we need to go over it again for my sister's benefit.
- In a rush, Tennison?
- Oh.
Morning, sarge.
First-aid training today.
I thought for a minute the rumours were right
- and you'd found yourself a new boyfriend.
- What rumours?
The general consensus around the station is the only reason you've signed up is to procure yourself a husband.
Great.
You could do a lot worse.
Now, I've got you down to accompany DI Bradfield to the Collins Service.
So dump your boyfriend and smarten up!
- Sarge thinks I'm only here to find a husband.
- Oh, yeah?
Like I'm a cat stuck up a tree, waiting for a man to save me.
There is not a man in this station I would open my legs for.
What?
None of them?
You're kidding?
They're all good for nothing.
Yeah.
I know.
- You got a boyfriend?
- No.
You?
Beating 'em off with a stick.
Look, I...
I don't usually drink that much.
What do I do if someone asks about the investigation?
Oh, erm...
Just tell them it's sub judice to discuss it.
George...
Oh, er... thank you for coming, Detective Inspector.
Have there been any developments?
We are chasing several leads, sir.
Oh, well, that's something.
So sad, George.
So very sad.
Erm...
let me get you a taxi, Reg.
Yeah.
I think you're right, George.
Tennison, could you call a taxi for this gentleman?
Of course.
Thank you, dear.
Would you like to come and say hello to Mary?
Of course.
Hello?
48 Church Mount Road, please.
Oh... 0-1, 9-4-6, 0-3-6-5.
Thank you.
[0-1, 9-4-6, 0-3-6-5.]
Cheers, then.
Is er... everything all right?
I didn't see any ashtrays, so I assume Mrs Collins would prefer I did this out here.
Ah, yes, well, er... you assumed right!
- Sorry, sir.
- You had the phone number.
I didn't think it was enough.
Well, it's enough to question him and get a warrant.
I trust we won't find your fingerprints all over those door handles?
I didn't touch it.
Where is Gibbs?
It was a good spot.
I don't usually drink that much.
That suspect driver I told you about...
About six weeks later, we arrested him for a different robbery.
And the bastard gets out this week.
What the hell's this?
Lords knows, I have no desire to delay your release, so I've convinced Mikey here to tell the warden he fell down the stairs.
So what?
Ought to tell your dog to be more careful who he bites.
Trust... that is so important to me, Clifford.
Now, I've invested too much in this job to allow anything to derail it.
Now, you promised me you could do it.
In return for 40%, I don't expect to have to deal with shite like this.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
Do you know who I am?
You're a nobody, old man.
You'll return the plans, and I'll find someone more obedient.
I was pulling schemes like this when you were still shitting in your nappies.
Now, my boys have already started.
So back off and let us get on with it.
All right.
Untwist your knickers, Clifford.
I've got people on the outside relying on you, so stop messing about and get it done.
Or next time, I'll take more than just your wife's purse.
Right, you four with me.
Where'd you go for that warrant?
Timbuktu?
Wait here.
With me.
All right?
Hi.
Make sure nobody goes into the bedrooms before I do.
One of the lads saw you and Bradfield outside the section house the other night.
I didn't think you were a cat stuck up a tree.
Be careful, Jane.
Nothing happened.
Weren't studying, were you?
Come on.
Excuse me.
- I'm so sorry.
- Of course.
DCI Bradfield?
What's this?
- A change of shift?
- I'm very sorry, Mr Collins, but your guests need to leave.
Wh-Wh-Whatever's happened?
My officers need to search your house.
This is the warrant.
Now?
I already told you that Julie-Ann didn't live here.
You also told us you hadn't spoken to her since last year, but that's not the case.
She telephoned this house on May 1st.
The day she was seen leaving the clinic.
Er... well, what do I tell them?
That you need to be alone.
They'll understand.
George?
Excuse me, could I... have everyone's attention, please?
Thanks for coming.
All yours, Paul.
I'm looking for anything that can place Julie-Ann Collins here in the last two weeks.
- Morgan, can you sit with Mrs Collins, please?
- Yeah.
Tennison, check the garage, see what you can find.
Sorry about this.
Wait there for me, please.
It will only take a couple of minutes.
Well, why are they speaking to George?
It's just a formality.
Oh, my God.
Did you speak to Julie-Ann on May 1st?
She telephoned and we spoke, but not for long.
What did you talk about?
Er... she wanted to borrow some money.
I refused.
- That was it.
- You didn't see her?
No.
So on that same day, outside Homerton Hospital, we have an eyewitness who saw your daughter getting into a red Jaguar.
You have a red Jaguar parked in your garage, George.
On May 1st, at 11am, did you pick your daughter up from Homerton Hospital?
I don't even know where that is.
And about two weeks later, Sunday May 13th, in the evening, can you tell me where you were?
I've already told you.
Tell me again, George.
My wife and I went to a dinner hosted by one of the managers at my factory.
We found red fibres on Julie-Ann's socks.
Are they gonna match the carpeting in your car, George?
Why do you keep using my first name?
You think I'm guilty?
My own daughter.
You think I'm capable of this?
After you picked her up from Homerton Hospital, where did you drive her?
Well?
We can place her near the car.
She left a nice clean thumb print on the passenger door handle.
Unless the father talks, it'd be hard for us to prove that was put there in the past two weeks.
Guv?
You need to see this.
We found nothing in the master bedroom or the study.
- The spare room's used for storage.
- Where's this going, Spence?
It's this room, sir.
There's blood here and here.
The mattress had been turned over.
These fibres seem a good match.
I'll have to check with the lab to be certain.
Sir?
Christ.
They locked her in here.
This is a cell.
George?
George!
- What's going on?
- Ma'am, please.
Probationary WPC 515G Tennison, attached to B Relief Hackney, sir.
- You worried they'll eat her alive?
- No, I wasn't, sir.
No.
And what brings you to the police?
I thought the force could do with more posh sorts, sir.
I'm very sorry to tell you that a girl we believe to be your daughter has been found dead.
We are treating it as a murder enquiry.
- When did you last see her?
- Over a year ago.
Who would want Julie-Ann dead, Eddie?
Think!
- Did you see her get into a car?
- Yeah, a red one.
- What sort of red car, Eddie?
- A Jaguar.
Eddie Phillips has absconded.
I want all units out there looking for him now.
They said you'd be here.
Sir, I don't think Eddie Phillips was just Julie-Ann's boyfriend.
What?
I went to speak to Suzy and she...
Tennison, you shouldn't have done that.
- There are protocols.
- I know, but...
Whatever she said could be inadmissible.
When was this?
- Just...
- Best if you don't tell me.
- Same again.
- Sure.
- What are you having?
- Erm...
I'll just have the same as you.
There you go.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Eight years ago, we had this young PC...
Charlie Hopkins.
He was not much older than you.
He died while doing a routine check on a vehicle with false plates.
The driver deliberately mowed him down.
What Hopkins didn't know was that... the driver was on his way to an armed raid on a bookies.
I got information about a garage that had taken the vehicle in for repairs, so I broke in.
I found it.
Smashed headlight... dented bumper... blood smear.
I knew I had him.
- The driver.
- You arrested him?
No.
No, he saw me go in the garage.
And by the time I came back with the warrant, he'd torched the car.
No fingerprints, no nothing to connect it to PC Hopkins.
Bastard got away with it.
Sorry.
I...
I didn't mean to be... going on about that.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Same as you, I trained at Hendon.
And when was that?
Late '50s?
Early '60s?
Really?
Well, I suppose that explains why you're walking me home, then.
Clearly, I'm old and doddery enough to warrant a chaperone.
Actually, it's because you nearly fell over coming out of the pub and then you tried to get your car keys out.
I didn't want to see what happened next.
Well, in that case, erm... thank you for saving my life.
No, seriously, erm...
I'm very...
Drunk?
Grateful.
I admire you.
No.
Sorry, I can't be doing that.
I'm your superior officer and er... we're both very drunk.
Evening.
Er...
I should be going.
Erm... will you be OK getting home?
Yes, I'll be fine.
Er... well, erm...
All right, early bird?
Morning.
Late one, was it?
Where'd you go?
Er... nowhere.
Stayed in.
Up late studying, that's all.
Tell me we've found Eddie Phillips.
Still looking but we'll find him.
Sir, nothing found in Eddie's flat.
Not one print that matches Julie-Ann's.
Bollocks.
Any luck tracing the red Jag that Eddie claimed picked Julie-Ann up?
That was the last time she was seen alive.
Nothing yet.
Can you get started on those red Jag phone calls, Jane?
Jane?
- Phone calls?
- Yes.
- Where did you get up to?
- Er...
let's see.
Go from there.
Morgan.
I need a plonk to accompany me to Julie-Ann's parents.
Er...
Sergeant Harris has posted me on foot patrol covering Five Beat.
Sorry.
Tennison?
There was a matching necklace.
It was part of a set.
I'm sorry.
We haven't found that yet.
At least we'll have something of hers for the service.
We'll release the body as soon as we can.
There is another reason that we stopped by.
What is it?
We've already told you everything we know.
This may be difficult for you to hear.
Julie-Ann may have been trying to kick her drug habit because she was pregnant.
Dear God.
I take it neither of you knew?
The newspaper describes Julie-Ann as a drug user and a prostitute.
If you speak to the press, will you remind them that she was more than that?
Of course.
The post-mortem also revealed that your daughter had injuries consistent with a beating we think from about two weeks before her death.
W-W-Was this the boyfriend?
This... er...
Eddie?
How do you know about Eddie?
The newspaper describes him as Julie-Ann's boyfriend.
"Helping with your enquiries."
'The news is on the hour every hour.
'And there's no better way to listen to your favourites than on the nation's favourite.'
Come on, John.
Time to get up.
They've been talking about that poor murdered girl again on the radio.
Ta.
Makes you scared to leave your own home.
Is David back?
He was.
Went straight out again.
He spoken to you?
About?
Just wondered what he's up to.
John?
Is this about some girl he was seeing?
He's fine, Ma.
Here, do us some bacon, will you?
You got anything stronger?
Do I look like a dealer?
Please, man.
Tell me where I can find Eddie, then.
You're not gonna find him.
If you really need something,
I can give you an address not far from here.
We're speaking to all Jaguar dealers in the area, looking for the owner of a red XJ series.
20,000 red Jags sold since 1968.
- Can we get a better description?
- When we find Eddie, we'll ask him.
Tennison?
I just found Julie-Ann's PM report lying on my desk.
Yes.
You told me to leave it there, sir.
Yes, but it needs to be in an envelope with my name on it.
It's sensitive material.
This vehicle was parked at Homerton Hospital.
- 'Are you still there?
'
- Sorry about that.
Sorry, you said he worked there?
And that's definitely a red Jaguar?
Erm... this garage serviced a red XJ6 for a doctor at Homerton Hospital.
So that's Dr Hussein Pryor.
Thank you.
Great.
- Morgan, you beauty.
- Yes!
Come on!
Silas, darling, is that van gonna be parked there all day?
Once they've unloaded it, I'll get them to move it round the corner, OK?
And the noise level?
I do hope there won't be any noise?
Let's hope not.
I will sort it.
You're a treasure, darling.
Hey.
You have to keep quiet.
The busybody next door will complain and the council will shut me down.
Please, move this stuff downstairs.
What do you care if the council shut you down?
Yeah, this time next week, you'll be on a beach.
Sitting on a big pile of cash!
- Ready to roll?
- Yeah.
What are you gonna do with your share?
Get as far away from here as possible.
Me too.
Mum will be all right, won't she?
Yeah.
She'll have Dad to look after her.
Yeah.
Oi.
I don't know what's going on in that head of yours, but don't fuck this one up for us, David.
I'm not gonna.
She looks familiar.
Julie-Ann Collins.
She came here as an outpatient on May 1st to sign up to your methadone programme.
She was last seen climbing into a red Jaguar outside here.
Do you own a red Jaguar XJ6?
My wife has the Jag.
Ex-wife.
She lives in Kent.
We're gonna have to contact your wife to confirm this.
Fine.
Have you talked to Teresa?
- Who's Teresa?
- Teresa O'Duncie.
One of the receptionists.
I'm sure she knew this girl.
- Is Teresa here now?
- Ask one of the girls.
They'll have her details.
Thank you for coming in, Miss O'Duncie.
After I had my appendix out last month, the stitches got infected.
Just take a seat.
I had this shooting pain right across my stomach.
So they put me on a course of antibiotics...
O'Duncie?
Is that with a C-Y?
Well, when I came back to work today and heard about Julie-Ann, the pain came back, in the same place, right here, so maybe it's an emotional pain, not an infection.
Every cloud...
Dr Pryor said you let Julie-Ann use an office phone.
Her and Eddie.
We know Eddie at the unit.
He was always around.
I was never sure about him.
- Any idea who she called?
- No.
I overheard her asking someone for money.
Well, demanding.
But it was an 01 number.
- Would anyone have written it down?
- Yeah, me.
External calls have to go through the switchboard.
You still have it?
When Julie-Ann left, did Eddie go with her?
He asked her where she was going.
But she told him to mind his own business.
He got really angry with her.
I reckon he's done this.
You should speak to him.
Hi, Sheila.
The public phone's always out of order, so I didn't think there would be a problem.
I like to help the poor angels any way I can, point them in the right direction.
That's where I wrote it down.
On the pad there.
Before I got this job, I was an outpatient here.
It's a disease... addiction.
Stop!
- What you doing?
- Checking for indented writing.
Not by that ham-fisted method.
The forensic document examiner does that.
He's got a bigger pencil.
Come on.
What you doing here again?
I've been thinking...
I want the same share as John and Danny.
They're doing the manual labour.
It's worked out on merit.
You hardly even know Danny.
- He's your cousin.
He's family too.
- And I'm your son.
David!
We're only keeping 40%.
The rest goes to Whiteley.
The slices are already cut very thin.
Thinner for some than others.
Why has the money become an issue all of a sudden?
You can have 5% of mine.
Ten.
Don't push your luck!
Cliffy, mate.
Looked like you was having some family trouble.
A son like that needs to be brought in line.
Don't fill me with confidence seeing you being talked to by a cripple like that.
Shit!
We're looking for your mate Eddie.
I've not seen him since you last picked us up.
Well, he's your mate.
Has he not dropped by?
- No.
- Shall we take you in, Billy?
- I swear!
- Last chance.
What did you put in your pocket as I came in?
Help us out or we take a look.
Try Dwayne Clarke.
Eddie always runs to him when he's in trouble.
This car was parked outside Homerton Hospital...
Hello?
Thank you.
I was wondering if you'd had a chance to look at the hospital notepad we brought in.
We need to speak to this prick Billy told us about, Dwayne Clarke.
- He's hiding Eddie.
- Still looking.
We'll find him.
Nothing so far.
No record, his name doesn't crop up anywhere.
Well, run his name by Drugs and Vice.
Shake some branches.
He's getting fidgety.
He's rumbled.
Go, go, go!
- Hello, lads.
- Jesus!
You scared the shit out of me!
I didn't realise you Drug Squad boys got scared.
- My guv needs your help.
- Yeah?
We need you to ID someone.
Dwayne Clarke, real name Darren Ackroyd.
Believe it or not, but the lad is well connected.
Fingers in lots of pies.
Dwayne's got form, likes to stomp on heads.
- Junkies, mostly.
- Where can we find him?
You don't.
He's the subject of a long-running undercover operation.
- Come on, don't be a job's worth.
- My hands are tied.
This is a murder investigation.
She was 17, for God's sake.
We think he's harbouring our prime suspect.
If you don't touch him, we'll agree to a fair exchange of information.
We'll show you ours if... well, you know.
We don't know for certain if there's active surveillance on him.
So make sure no-one outside this room knows.
Find Dwayne and we get Eddie.
And where do we find him?
Duke let slip that Dwayne has an alias:
Darren Ackroyd.
We've got an address and a car registered to him.
Come in!
Sorry to interrupt.
Sir, the Forensic Document Examiner... erm... retrieved a partial number from the pad we found at the hospital.
0-1, 9-4-6, 0-3.
I'll need your signature so that the GPO can send us a list of possibilities.
I put it in an envelope... with your name on it, sir.
Leave it with me.
Argh!
Arhh!
Argh!
- Who's the cripple now, then?
- Argh!
You should watch your fucking mouth.
Arrgh!
Don't suppose Dwayne drives a brown mini?
Look, if he is as smart as Duke suggests, then he's not gonna come back to his flat with Eddie, is he?
Better not be late for my gig tonight.
Do you do any Beatles?
Bolan, Quo, Slade, Kinks.
No bloody Beatles, no.
You should do some Beatles.
- Dwayne's not home.
- Darren's not home.
'Golf Hotel to DI Bradfield.
- 'Over.'
- Go ahead.
Uniform has spotted a blue Mercedes, listed owner Darren Ackroyd.
Delta, Hotel, November.
Five, Seven, Seven, Hotel, heading north on Talbot Road.
Over.
Tell Uniforms to take him now.
We don't want to lose him.
That's him!
- 'Suspect apprehended.'
- Tell them to keep him there.
We're on our way.
Over.
- Where is he?
Did you lose him?
- He's over here.
He's a real handful.
- Took four of us to pin him down.
- Is everyone all right?
- Yes, sir.
- We've had to chuck him in here.
Get me out of here!
You arseholes, you've got nothing on me!
Dwayne?
Yoo-hoo, Mr Clarke?
- Can you hear me?
- You're gonna pay for this!
Knock once, if you can.
- You've got no right to do this.
- Is he cuffed?
Yeah.
Ready?
Oi, what's this all about?
Get me out of here now!
You arseholes have got nothing on me!
Good work.
Eddie Phillips... his girlfriend has turned up dead, he's done a runner.
And we think you know where he is.
So let's see what Mr Clarke's been up to.
A scuzzy dickhead like Dwayne Clarke can afford a motor like this, and I'm on a poxy scooter!
I don't know no Eddie.
We saw you with him, idiot.
So why are you covering for him?
I'm not covering for that arsehole.
We found these in the air filter.
It's enough to throw possession with intent to supply at him.
What do we find in your car that starts with W?
I didn't put that there.
Who did, then?
Fucking tooth fairy?
Here we go.
Got it.
He kept a tally book.
So... in this little book we have a handy list of your customers.
Now, this Tod had quite the party on the 13th.
You supplied him with various drugs on the day that Julie-Ann died.
I've never seen that book before.
One of your coppers must have planted it.
You're on thin ice.
Same goes for that bag of weed and the money.
None of that is mine.
I'd like to speak to my solicitor.
Tell us where to find Eddie Phillips.
Fucking Eddie.
I ain't seen him.
How did you afford a place there, then?
I didn't.
I live with my parents.
Yeah?
So do I.
Can't you type any quicker?
He didn't give us Eddie, did he?
We'll stick him with the possession charge.
What do you tell Duke?
Speak of the devil.
You arrogant pricks.
All right.
Steady, mate.
Six months of surveillance down the drain.
We're building a case against some major players and you blew it out of the water!
I've got a murdered girl.
I don't give a toss about what long game you're playing.
What's that?
Part of our fair exchange of information.
Duke, hold on.
Shit!
- Who's that with Eddie and Julie-Ann?
- A new player.
We're still establishing his identity, but he's a regular supplier of Eddie's.
They were taken two days before she died.
All we know is, on the street, he's known as Oz.
Thank you.
According to the plans, the first wall is... somewhere.
It's there.
Right...
let's go.
- Jesus.
- 'Eagle One to Eagle's Nest.
'Eagle One to Eagle's Nest.'
We're done for the night.
'You still awake up there?
'
Eagle One, I'm awake.
Over.
Might I suggest we continue without her?
- Dad, where is she?
- I told her to be here.
Finally!
Sorry I'm late.
I hope you're not gonna wear that on the day.
It'll look like Pam's out on day release.
Please, Mum, I'm missing work for this.
Glad you could make it.
We're at the vows.
You take the bouquet.
What?
Take it, then!
And then when we leave the vestry, you hand it back to me.
Got that?
I think we need to go over it again for my sister's benefit.
- In a rush, Tennison?
- Morning, sarge.
First-aid training today.
I thought for a minute the rumours were right and you'd found yourself a new boyfriend.
What rumours?
The general consensus around the station is the only reason you've signed up is to procure yourself a husband.
Great.
You could do a lot worse.
Now, I've got you down to accompany DI Bradfield to the Collins Service.
So dump your boyfriend and smarten up!
Sarge thinks I'm only here to find a husband.
- Yeah?
Like I'm a cat stuck up a tree, waiting for a man to save me.
There is not a man in this station I would open my legs for.
What?
None of them?
You're kidding?
They're all good for nothing.
Yeah.
I know.
- You got a boyfriend?
- No.
You?
Beating 'em off with a stick.
Look, I...
I don't usually drink that much.
What do I do if someone asks about the investigation?
Erm...
Just tell them it's sub judice to discuss it.
George...
Er... thank you for coming, Detective Inspector.
Have there been any developments?
We are chasing several leads, sir.
Well, that's something.
So sad, George.
So very sad.
Erm...
let me get you a taxi, Reg.
Yeah.
I think you're right, George.
Tennison, could you call a taxi for this gentleman?
Of course.
Thank you, dear.
Would you like to come and say hello to Mary?
Of course.
Hello?
48 Church Mount Road, please.
0-1, 9-4-6, 0-3-6-5.
Thank you.
Cheers, then.
Is er... everything all right?
I didn't see any ashtrays, so I assume Mrs Collins would prefer I did this out here.
Yes, well, er... you assumed right!
- Sorry, sir.
- You had the phone number.
I didn't think it was enough.
Well, it's enough to question him and get a warrant.
I trust we won't find your fingerprints all over those door handles?
I didn't touch it.
Where is Gibbs?
It was a good spot.
I don't usually drink that much.
That suspect driver I told you about...
About six weeks later, we arrested him for a different robbery.
And the bastard gets out this week.
What the hell's this?
Lords knows, I have no desire to delay your release, so I've convinced Mikey here to tell the warden he fell down the stairs.
So what?
Ought to tell your dog to be more careful who he bites.
Trust... that is so important to me, Clifford.
Now, I've invested too much in this job to allow anything to derail it.
Now, you promised me you could do it.
In return for 40%, I don't expect to have to deal with shite like this.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
Do you know who I am?
You're a nobody, old man.
You'll return the plans, and I'll find someone more obedient.
I was pulling schemes like this when you were still shitting in your nappies.
Now, my boys have already started.
So back off and let us get on with it.
All right.
Untwist your knickers, Clifford.
I've got people on the outside relying on you, so stop messing about and get it done.
Or next time, I'll take more than just your wife's purse.
Right, you four with me.
Where'd you go for that warrant?
Timbuktu?
Wait here.
With me.
All right?
Hi.
Make sure nobody goes into the bedrooms before I do.
One of the lads saw you and Bradfield outside the section house the other night.
I didn't think you were a cat stuck up a tree.
Be careful, Jane.
Nothing happened.
Weren't studying, were you?
Come on.
Excuse me.
- I'm so sorry.
- Of course.
DCI Bradfield?
What's this?
- A change of shift?
- I'm very sorry, Mr Collins, but your guests need to leave.
Wh-Wh-Whatever's happened?
My officers need to search your house.
This is the warrant.
Now?
I already told you that Julie-Ann didn't live here.
You also told us you hadn't spoken to her since last year, but that's not the case.
She telephoned this house on May 1st.
The day she was seen leaving the clinic.
Er... well, what do I tell them?
That you need to be alone.
They'll understand.
George?
Excuse me, could I... have everyone's attention, please?
Thanks for coming.
All yours, Paul.
I'm looking for anything that can place Julie-Ann Collins here in the last two weeks.
Morgan, can you sit with Mrs Collins, please?
- Yeah.
Tennison, check the garage, see what you can find.
Sorry about this.
Wait there for me, please.
It will only take a couple of minutes.
Well, why are they speaking to George?
It's just a formality.
My God.
Did you speak to Julie-Ann on May 1st?
She telephoned and we spoke, but not for long.
What did you talk about?
Er... she wanted to borrow some money.
I refused.
- That was it.
- You didn't see her?
No.
So on that same day, outside Homerton Hospital, we have an eyewitness who saw your daughter getting into a red Jaguar.
You have a red Jaguar parked in your garage, George.
On May 1st, at 11am, did you pick your daughter up from Homerton Hospital?
I don't even know where that is.
And about two weeks later, Sunday May 13th, in the evening, can you tell me where you were?
I've already told you.
Tell me again, George.
My wife and I went to a dinner hosted by one of the managers at my factory.
We found red fibres on Julie-Ann's socks.
Are they gonna match the carpeting in your car, George?
Why do you keep using my first name?
You think I'm guilty?
My own daughter.
You think I'm capable of this?
After you picked her up from Homerton Hospital, where did you drive her?
Well?
We can place her near the car.
She left a nice clean thumb print on the passenger door handle.
Unless the father talks, it'd be hard for us to prove that was put there in the past two weeks.
Guv?
You need to see this.
We found nothing in the master bedroom or the study.
- The spare room's used for storage.
- Where's this going, Spence?
It's this room, sir.
There's blood here and here.
The mattress had been turned over.
These fibres seem a good match.
I'll have to check with the lab to be certain.
Sir?
Christ.
They locked her in here.
This is a cell.
George?
George!
- What's going on?
- Ma'am, please.

- What is it?
- Look out!
Can't catch me, huh?
Ow!
- Hey!
- Oops.
Sorry, Supergirl.
Pow!
Blaster success.
Intergalactic Games, here we come!
They might as well give us the gold medal now, 'cause the Batgirl and Bumblebee battle bots are the bomb.
Nice work.
Help us!
There's trouble in Metropolis.
Sound the "Save the day" alarm.
Come on, girls.
I...
I'm sorry for yelling at you about breaking our window.
I...
I should have known the customer's always right.
Initiate protocol.
Crush human.
Over here, you hunk of hardware.
Stay here, Steve.
You'll be safe.
Thanks, Supergirl.
Oh.
Major wreckage.
We heard the "Save the day" alarm.
What's going on?
Robots.
You shall not do that on the watch that is mine.
I will crush Wonder Woman.
Bring it.
Just a sec.
Gotta take this.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, princess.
How are you?
Just ducky.
Yeah!
Not yeah.
Have you been studying the treaties of Themyscira that I sent you?
Um, well, it's been hectic preparing for the Intergalactic Games.
Precisely why you should study the treaties, to impress the ambassador during the games.
This is your chance to get the last spot at the inaugural
Intergalactic ambassador's student summit.
Uh-huh.
I know.
I can really learn how to be a better queen at the summit.
Feel the burn!
Heat vision, approximately 2,000 degrees.
Melting point of Platinum, 3,250 degrees.
Platinum fist velocity, 200 miles per hour.
Supergirl fist velocity,
- 168 miles per hour.
- Ow!
All part of Superhero's faulty programing.
I am a person.
I don't have programing.
Shame.
Platinum is programed to protect herself and preserve her power.
But Supergirl will predictably save humans above all else.
Help!
- Oh.
- Crush human.
Oh, no!
Thank you!
Okay, Mom.
See you.
Off with the heads.
I can...
To see games...
My phone.
Now I'm really mad.
We have to stop them.
Crush.
Crush.
Crush.
What shall we do?
Their metal is of the indestructability.
Starfire's right.
Every time I get a hit in, they just reform.
- That's it!
- A soaked phone?
They're robots.
Their bodies might be tough to crack, but their technology isn't.
They must be powered by computers.
And magnets scramble computers.
What if we magnetize our vehicles?
Oracle, remote pilot Supergirl's spaceship to these coordinates.
As you wish, Batgirl.
I outfitted Supergirl's spaceship and my Bat-jet with electro-magnetic pulse blasters.
It'll totally shut them down.
Wonder Woman, you're up.
Error!
Return lead to ground.
I'm locked on the target.
Now, zap him!
Return now...
We bring another of the robotic beings for your scramblification.
This is what I call pumping iron.
Return Lead and Iron to me, or the human shall be destroyed.
- Help!
- Steve!
Supergirl, stick with the plan.
Magnetizer on three.
One, two...
Time's up.
Huh?
An experiment?
Uh, that...
That was a malfunction.
But I've made real strides with the technology.
Doc Magnus, you made strides right into trouble central.
I can't have teachers building evil robots.
Especially not now, with all the scrutiny around the games.
But, Principal Waller...
Our student tech committee will decide what to do with these experiments.
I don't know, Doc.
It's like it's got a high powered wicked chip in there.
But this technology could change the world.
Look, I call it the Responsometer.
Once I work out the kinks, it'll be the greatest advancement in robotics in the galaxy.
Hmm...
What does it do?
It makes robots more human.
Gives them free will.
We know the robots are powerful.
Today proved that they can stand up to some of the toughest heroes.
I got that loud and clear when they tried to take down my friends.
But what if they were fighting villains instead?
If the robots could make good choices, then they could be superheroes.
Overnight we could double, triple the number of certified superheroes and stop evil worldwide.
What do you think?
These robots are corrupt.
We should destroy them.
- Batgirl knows best.
- She's right.
Yeah.
Destroy them.
Principal Waller, I wanted to let you know that
I've increased the Wi-Fi capacity and we can handle all the guest for the games.
Thank you, Lena.
Sounds like you're really on top of all the IT girl duties.
I try.
Anything else I can do for you?
Actually.
Yes.
These robots need to be put in the secure disposal.
Yeah.
Sure.
You got it.
The Responsometer.
What's that got to do with us?
That fool at Super Hero High created it to make more heroes.
But, combine it with our Apokolipstion robots and we'll have the greatest army ever seen.
- Oh.
Wicked.
- Stompa like army!
The Responsometers will allow them to act on their own.
Spreading our Apokolipstion evil throughout the galaxy.
We're wanted criminals.
If you think the Female Furies can just march into Super Hero High and grab that thing, you're getting dizzy.
Lashina...
Don't forget your place.
Yes, Granny Goodness.
Our ally who sent the photos has arranged safe passage for us.
Super Hero High will be forced to welcome us.
Sweetums...
This is your chance to get revenge on that traitor Big Barda.
And give her the punishment she deserves.
Yes.
Furies forever!
Furies forever!
Furies forever!
♪ I'll sing you a song ♪
♪ To swear my allegiance ♪
♪ I'll tell you a tale ♪
♪ Of loyalty strong ♪

Oh.
Hey, Wonder Woman.
What are you doing, Big Barda?
Just practicing my villain launch.
Uh, my event for the games, you know.
Not that part.
The singing part.
Uh, it's just some song from when I was a kid.
It...
It helps me focus.
It's...
It's one of them ear snakes.
You mean, ear worm?
On Apokolips we call them ear snakes.
'Cause if Granny Goodness heard you singing, you'd have rather been bit by a snake.
Well, that's, um...
Nostalgic.
Good luck at the games.
Yes!
Hola, Wonder Woman.
Should you need any help in your duties as head of the games committee like, enforcing rules or making sure Korugar Academy isn't cheating,
I'm here for you.
Thanks, Hawkgirl.
Yeah!
You got it.
Is it the time?
Have they made their arrival?
Not yet, Starfire.
I made this gift to the good luck and welcoming.
Do you think it will be appreciated by my knifster?
Your knifster?
Oh, you mean your sister, Blackfire?
Yes.
On Tamaran we say knifster.
It is like your Earth word for sister.
But it means more than the sharing of the DNA.
The most accurate translation is,
"Girls who have the bond of the eternity."
That's beautiful.
I'm sure Blackfire will love it.
I cannot the wait!
Lena.
How are the improvements on the Hero Balls Stadium coming along?
Good.
Great.
Excellent.
There's several new features that will really up the excitement during the big game on Friday.
Wow.
You've really gone all out with the randomized floor traps.
And that's not all.
But I can't let our Hero Ball team captain in on all the surprises.
It wouldn't be fair.
I guess you're right.
- Thanks, Lena.
- Of course.
For sure.
Anytime.
You can come out now.
Soon...
Soon my little Kryptomite.
Soon.
This stadium will make a fine venue for the finale of the games.
Oh!
And here is one of our top students.
Wonder Woman.
Ambassador Beck.
I hope the council is pleased with the preparations.
Very pleased.
We are proud that two superb schools have made it through the semi-finals and will be vying for the championship.
Our thanks to the council for sponsoring the games.
May they work to bring peace through friendly competition throughout the galaxy.
And may my fortune be even greater in that I find the final participant to attend next week's exclusive student summit.
Yes!
I hope you...
Korugar!
They're early.
He best not be parking on my lawn.
No.
Hurry everyone!
Get ready for the opening ceremony.
Yeah!
Blackfire will be the overjoyed to see the garments of Tamaran.
Drones swarm.
Welcome, Harley fans.
Your Harley Quinn to send your play by play by play of the opening ceremony for the Intergalactic Games.
Here comes the home team and my personal favs,
Super Hero High.
Don't they look smashing!
Yeah, totally fly.
And now presenting,
Korugar Academy.
Ooh...
That rosy ray of light there is Headmaster Sinestro.
That guy gives me the heebie-jeebies.
Okay, everyone.
I know we all want to win.
But the ambassador is watching.
So make sure we have good sportsmanship.
- Yeah.
- You got it.
Blackfire.
Blackfire.
It is I, your knifster.
Perhaps she did not hear me.
Yeah, uh...
Probably not.
Welcome.
We look forward to competing with...
Of course, you do.
Now if your mundanities are complete,
I believe it's time for my speech.
Thank you for hosting us on your...
Humble planet.
Having coached Korugar Academy to victory in the past eight games...
Oh, knifster!
Oh, I have missed the you.
Starfire.
You haven't changed.
How unfortunate.
I made for you the gift of the luck that is good.
Luck?
We're Korugar Academy.
We don't need luck.
Only students with the greatest superpowers are accepted.
Not like your school which lets in mere mortals.
Like that one.
- Me?
- Am I mistaken?
Do you have super speed?
Super strength?
Can you fly?
Well...
No.
See?
The only thing she's super at is being super boring.
But, Batgirl is the friend of mine.
Then maybe you should give this to her.
Super Hero High will need all the luck it can get.
Oops.
Let the games begin!
Uh, oh!
The Female Furies.
And they're on my lawn.
Granny Goodness.
Please, supers.
We come seeking only peace.
The same peace that the ambassador wished to achieve with these games.
Ambassador Garren Beck, I presume.
I am Granny Goodness, dean of the Apokolips Magnet school.
We received an invitation from your council.
Ambassador Beck, don't listen to her nonsense.
Granny Goodness and the Furies tried to brainwash us.
Amanda, I understand you are used to running things around here.
But do remember that the games of the jurisdiction of the council.
Hmm.
This does appear official.
It's not the decision that I would make.
But I trust the council has its reasons.
As ambassadors, it is our mission to promote peace.
Today we uphold that mission by allowing Apokolips Magnet to join the championships.
This isn't gonna be good.
Ante up security.
I'll install finger print readers on every door.
The school will be accessible only by our students.
Good.
Those Furies are up to something.
Now, we feast!
Come along, competitors.
Come on, team.
As long as they uphold their promise of peace, we should give them peace in return.
Well put, future ambassador.
But we still wanna win, right?
More than ever.
Super Hero High!
Super Hero High!
Super Hero High!
Super Hero High!
Super Hero High!
Super Hero High!
Don't you just love the smell of impending doom?
Oh...
Feels so good to let my hair down.
Wrench.
Not yet.
You need to keep that mischief bottled up inside until Friday.
Um-kay?
Rebooting.
Thank you, master.
Master?
Indeed.
But we're in undercover mode, so call me...
Lena.
Lena Thurul.
Employed by Super Hero High school as IT specialist.
No criminal record.
You're a riot, Platinum!
That's what I hacked the school computer to say.
But between you and me...
Thurul isn't really my last name.
I am programed to keep secrets.
Yes!
Great.
Do as you're programed and everything will be super.
Or rather...
Unsuper.
- See what I did there?
- Good one.
- Wow.
- Hi.
- It's amazing.
- Amazing.
Hi!
Now, as you say on Earth...
Dig in!
Oh, it looks so good, you guys.
Big Barda, we saved you a seat.
Once a Fury, forever a Fury.
Right?
Ignore them.
They're using non-tactics to anger you.
Right.
Thanks, Lady Shiva.
Lashina, don't be so upset about Big Barda.
She has new friends now.
And she'll probably leave them in the lurch, like she left us.
Stompa no like lurch.
It wasn't a lurch.
It was juvenile detention.
We were doing our time, 'cause we did the crime.
But you didn't do your time.
You betrayed us to get out of there.
I gotta give you credit.
This gone good thing is one of your bestest tricks.
And I said, "Guano?"
"Well, I'm guano take you to Belle Reve."
Where are you going?
I must see if this gala's to Blackfire's enjoyment.
Really?
But she's...
Well, "mean" is putting it mildly.
Why do you keep trying with her?
Blackfire has been mean.
But she has also been sweeter than the pie of the Gorka berries.
I must give her another chance.
Hello, knifster.
Is this seat taken?
Sadly, no.
I do not know why you're so upward set with me.
Have I done something to offend you?
Yeah.
Actually, your whole super hero lifestyle offends me.
We're princesses of Tamaran.
I shouldn't have to endure the thought of my sister lowering herself to help humans.
Squik.
I am sorry for your distress.
If you are really sorry, you'd drop Super Hero High and come to Korugar, where you can learn how to use your superpowers to bring glory to yourself and our family.
Don't you wanna be the best you can be for our family?
Our planet?
Yes.
You're right.
If Korugar wins the games and proves they're truly the best,
I shall do as you ask.
- Deal.
- But...
If Super Hero High is the victorious, then you shall do what I wish.
What's that?
You will answer my calls, and make responses to my e-messages.
And like my updates of status on the social media.
Plus, you shall spend with me a day of funship.
Day of funship?
Twenty-four hours of the togetherness of the knifters.
There's no way we'll lose.
So, you got yourself a deal.
Wonderful.
Ew.
Who did that?
Uber hilarious story, Hawkgirl.
Katana.
Whoops.
Food fight!
Food fight!
Korugar?
More like Snorugar.
Booyah!
Put that pie from the sky in my tum-tum.
Bombs away.
Ew.
Ew.
Ew!
Oh, sheesh.
Stop it this instance.
For our sake.
You're breaking the peace.
Get behind me.
Ew.
Guess my bracelets are just bullet proof.
Not borsht proof.
Want some mashed potatoes?
It's okay, Ambassador.
I got this.
Hey!
Everyone!
Stop.
Please!
Oh.
Supergirl.
Supergirl?
- Kryptomite.
- Uh-oh.
Wonder Woman, I found a Kryptomite.
I need some of Frost and Ivy's anti-K mix.
I'm on it.
Excuse me.
It's hero time.
If you please, ladies.
Huh?
I lost it.
I can help.
What are you doing here?
If you get too close to it, it can hurt you.
I don't have to get close.
I just have to find it.
In there.
Help!
The anti-K.
Nighty night, Kryptomite.
- Yes!
- Cool.
Good.
Gooey but good.
Royal rule of peace keeping number six.
Create a distraction.
A microphone.
Bumblebee,
I need feedback.
Right now?
Uh...
I think you're doing a great job?
Not like that.
Over the speakers.
- Get the mic.
- Oh, I can do that.
Ow!
Ow!
My ears!
Oh, my precious ears.
Students...
You should be ashamed of yourselves.
If that kind of nonsense happens again,
I will cancel the games.
Now, go to your rooms and prepare for tomorrow's competition.
Are you all right?
Absolutely not!
I have garlic in my eye.
I expected more from you.
You did great.
Don't let old grumpy garlic guy get to you.
- Thanks.
- You still hungry?
I got plenty of left-overs.
Another Kryptomite?
I thought we cleared those things out of Metropolis.
Looks like we missed one.
Luckily, the anti-K works like a charm to deactivate it.
Frost, Ivy, make sure we have plenty of your solution ready.
There may be a few more of these monsters hiding out there.
Precious.
All my baby Kryptomites in a row!
I am so glad I figured out how to build you cute little butterballs of destruction.
Oh no!
Platinum, have you analyzed the footage and their fighting techniques?
Yes.
But, I do not understand the reason for the many strange deviations in the behavior of Super Hero High students in comparison to the normal human.
They act strangely for no reason.
The reason for that is what they call heroism.
Yuck!
Gross!
This is Lois Lane reporting live from the Intergalactic Games.
Beat it, girly!
It's the Harley Quinn show now!
Howdy, Harleirino's!
Harley here.
And we have more games coming up than a centipede's got legs.
Whoa!
That's a lot of games, Yo!
Flash clobbers the competition in the Super Speed Sprint.
Lashina gets a sweet 8.2 in the long distance whip.
Ha!
Measly.
Beat that.
Pansy.
Actually the name's Ivy.
That's what's up!
A perfect 10 for Ivy.
Yeah!
That's my green thumb girl!
Getting the gold!
Yeah!
Katana is a cut above Mad Harriet in the weapons round.
Who's that?
Maxima goes for maximum winage in the skeet shoot.
My ankle!
Stompa's win in the hand to hand combat round is a real smack down!
And I'm not kiddin'!
Somebody called for a kitten?
Better say goodbye to your pals now.
Korugar has this in the bag.
The gulp.
Wondy kicks the competition right in the kisser in the aerial obstacle race.
♪ I will sing you a song to swear my allegiance ♪
♪ I'll tell you tale of loyalty strong ♪
♪ Forever in battle, expanding our homeland ♪
♪ It's with you by my side I know I belong ♪
Lashina!
What are you doing here?
I heard you singing.
Thought you must have been reminiscing.
That song gets stuck in my head.
It was always my favorite.
Remember how you used to have those nightmares?
It was bad news if your crying woke granny.
I'd sing to you until you went to sleep.
I almost forgot about that.
Probably better that way.
Now that we're enemies.
Well, we don't have to be enemies.
You'll come back to The Furies?
No.
I'll never do that.
But you guys could go good.
Break off from dark side.
I'm sure Super Hero High would take you in.
You.
You were always a wishful thinker.
I made an oath to the Furies.
Forever.
But as long as we are here for the games, let's get along.
For old time's sake?
Yeah!
That's for stopping by, Lashina.
The fingerprints weren't a problem.
Fed her a sob story about that stupid song she always sings.
Big Barda has always been a sentimental fool.
What a perfect punishment it will be for her to know that she is to blame for the Furies acquiring the Universe Destruction Technology.
None of these will do.
We'll have to get you a whole new wardrobe in Korugar.
But the winner's not decided.
We still have the game of the Hero Ball, the Battle Bots, and the partner biathlon.
You really think you and Supergirl can beat me and Bleez in the biathlon?
Please.
Supergirl and I have trained and refined the strategy of the partnership.
And...
Go on, tell me all about your strategy.
I am only the saying, should Super Hero High prevail,
I am very much looking forward to our day of funship.
We could watch the lake chicken at the park.
And eat of the ice cream until our brain is freezing!
Ugh!
Squik!
Pow!
Battle Bot on!
How about you, partner?
Ready to kick some robot butt!
Suspicious activity in Sector H.
You won't need to bring any of this to Korugar.
It's all junk.
This is not the junk.
Don't you remember the great laughs of the hilarity we had this day at the Tamaran Zoo?
I remember being embarrassed by your wailing when you fell into the Polka Hoozy pen.
Girls?
We got trouble.
Black Fire.
Join me in the mission of saving the day!
Yeah, right.
Have fun being a Super Zero.
See you tomorrow, knifster.
Find that Responsometer!
Stompa find pretty.
Yes.
Put that down!
Furies!
Finish these supers!
Hey, buggy.
I should have finished you off last time.
Look at what Stompa caught.
Can I keep her?
Na-uh, bats.
Oh, no!
Batgirl!
Wake up!
Not so fast!
Slice and dice.
Good gorka, I am oozing my life goop.
Come on, Furies.
Hey, Gran.
Out of my way, Big Barda.
I don't take orders from you anymore.
I make my own choices now.
Can't beat me, Barda.
Bumblebee, sting Speed Queen's skates.
Yeah!
Give it back.
Or Batty gets it.
Supergirl,
Harley's buggy.
Hey!
Who turned out the lights?
Stompa no like lasso!
Come home with us.
You were born a Fury, and you will always be a Fury.
You're right.
I was born a Fury, but I changed.
I fight for good now.
You did it.
That's one way to use a Mega Rod.
Good riddance.
The Metropolis Special Crimes unit will take care of the Furies now.
I do not envy them the paper work.
I'm just glad the school is safe again.
Thanks to no small part to your efforts.
Which is why I'd formally like to invite you to join us next week for the summit.
Really?
Oh, my, Hera!
My mom is going to flip her bananas.
Thank you, Ambassador.
I can't believe all that was over my gadget.
Super Hero High does attract more than its share of Super Villains.
I couldn't forgive myself if this got in the wrong hands.
We should destroy it.
You're right, Doc.
I'll use the secure disposal.
It will be gone for good after that.
Coast is clear.
Letting the Furies do all the hard work for us was a nice stroke.
A tip off to Batgirl's security system and bang, bang, bing, bang!
The Furies are out and the Responsometer is ours.
The army is 92 percent complete.
So cool.
How great am I gonna look commanding these things?
Very great, Master.
Platinum.
I have a treat for you.
You'll be my first Ultrabot.
Whoa!
- How does it feel?
- I feel like...
I feel.
Whoo-hoo!
Excellent!
Soon Metropolis will be cured of its "Super" problem.
Yeah.
Good one.
Did you pack enough socks?
Mom.
It's one week.
You're right.
You'll need more!
I can't believe I am leaving for the summit right after the games.
I have never been 62 light years from home before.
My little princess is on her way to becoming a great ambassador, and an even greater queen.
I am so proud.
Thanks, mom.
The teams are tied as we get ready for some heavy metal action!
Not that kinda heavy metal.
It's Team Bot Battle time.
Batgirl and Bumblebee are facing off against Mangal and Lobo.
Goodness of morning, knifster.
What happened to you?
Oh.
It is only the wound of the flesh from the fight with the Furies last night.
You fought the Furies?
I was not alone.
Wonder Woman, Supergirl, Batgirl...
Batgirl?
That non-Super?
Batgirl may not have the super powers like you, but she is a true Super Hero.
Blackfire!
The Korugar section is over here.
Of course, Headmaster Sinestro.
You are bothered by your sister's injury?
No way.
Of course not.
I was just thinking how much greater my powers are than hers since I have been at Korugar.
Furies wouldn't hurt me.
Indeed.
But as long as you live the Korugarian way, you will never need to take risks.
Your sister was injured because she fancies herself a Super Hero.
It's abhorrent.
Agreed, Headmaster.
Let us go!
The whoo and the whoo!
Hey!
Wow!
Yeah, honey!
What?
How could she?
Torn limb from metal limb!
Oh, the humanity!
Did someone call for a manatee?
Oh, no.
Bug target confirmed.
Guess who's got auto targeting, twerps.
Nothing can escape my blasters.
Don't worry.
I've got this.
Go small or go home.
- Huh?
- Where'd it go?
Let's see you auto target this.
And Super Hero High scores!
- Way to go, Super Hero High.
- Awesome.
Give to me the highness of the five.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks, Starfire.
Assembling time.
Destroying the supers will be fun.
Hey!
I know what fun is.
Neato.
Yes, it will be loads of fun.
What?
How'd you do that?
I was so excited about our upcoming triumph,
I could hardly remain a secret whispering in your ear.
Whoa!
Who's voice is that?
Just another one of my minions.
Now, back to what's important.
Hello, my babies.
Time to play.
Hey, Harleians!
Yowza, yowza, yowza!
What a rolly-coaster ride of games it's been.
It's Super Hero High at 26 wins.
And Korugar at 25.
As we's gettin' ready for the second to last event.
If we kick some booty in the partner biathlon, the championship is ours.
No way Korugar can overtake us.
You both have Super Powers by nature.
We won't allow a school that lets mere mortals masquerade as supers take our glory.
Yes, Headmaster.
On your marks, get set...
Go!
Oh, the yes!
Yeah?
I got solar power, too, sister.
- Huh?
- Help us!
Help us!
- Come on!
- Go, Supergirl!
What is she waiting for?
I have to go.
There's a fire in Metropolis.
Partners in the Biathlon.
Partners in the day saving.
See that, Starfire?
Starfire?
There was smoke everywhere.
I couldn't see anything.
Where did they go?
This is highly unorthodox.
- Is that everyone?
- That is all of the citizens.
Then we gotta get back.
Korugar Academy wins the partner Biathlon.
The game is a tie.
26 wins to 26 wins.
It's down to the Hero Ball game to determine the champion.
Congratulations.
- Where did you go?
- To save the people.
There was a fire.
You sacrificed winning the championship for some humans?
It is just a game.
Principal Waller teaches, there is no greatness without sacrifice.
There she is.
That's the girl.
Yay!
Thank you for saving my daddy.
You're my hero.
Mmm.
Thank you.
Here.
Put your nose holes to it.
But that's yours.
Gifts are best when we share them.
Please welcome, the reigning Champions of the Intergalactic Games,
Korugar Academy.
And on this side, the challengers,
Super Hero High School.
And now to set the game...
Um, well...
There seems to be some sort of technical difficulty.
Hey, hello, hi.
What the...
What?
What?
- Lena Thurol?
- She has the suit of the powers!
That suit.
It's like Lex Luthor's.
Luthor?
Thurol?
Dude!
Same letters, wickeder order.
Does somebody need the IT girl's help?
Oh, I can fix your little game.
But I rather fix this whole city.
Oh, my, cog!
Platinum?
It's, okay.
I'll protect you.
You're first mission as student ambassador is to make peace with this villain so the games can continue.
Lena, I'm sure we can resolve this.
What do you want?
What I want?
What I want is to rid Metropolis of supers.
Oh, goodness Croc.
Think about it, Metropolis.
That robot attack was because of the supers,
Eclipso, Dark Opal, the Female Furies.
Super villains target our cities because these supers are here.
Hey, that's not true.
You're wrong!
Join my side.
And we'll free Metropolis of supers.
Never!
This Super Hero saved me.
Me too!
I'm with Super Hero High.
Super Hero High!
Super Hero High!
All right!
Fine!
Whatever!
Kryptomites, attack!
Attack!
Flyers?
Get the citizens to safety.
The rest of you get those Kryptomites!
Supergirl.
Bring in Lena.
Yes, Principal Waller.
Freezer burn.
Be kind to the behind, bro.
Good things I got a thick hide.
All right!
10 points to Big Barda and the villain launch.
Pathetic.
Super Hero High couldn't even secure itself long enough for the game.
Come on, Lena, we don't have to fight.
Just turn yourself in.
That would be so easy, wouldn't it?
Just another time when Supergirl doesn't even have to try.
What?
All you had to do was land on Earth to get super powers.
I tried everything to get them.
Chemical accidents, close encounters with meteors.
Genetic mutations!
Ah!
Day and night I have been working on these Kryptomites.
Even when it was so toxic that my hair fell out.
I didn't stop.
It appears that Lena Luthor alias Lena Thurol, sibling of known villain Lex Luthor, has launched a full scale attack on the supers.
Attacking Super Hero High will cost you an arm and a leg.
Say, hola to my mace!
Ha!
Ni hao, Kryptobot.
Come on, let's go.
Please, Sinestro.
We need your help.
You're team has such great super powers.
You can save so many.
Out of the way!
This is not our battle.
Hiya!
Blackfire!
Come immediately.
Or you will face the consequences.
Blackfire!
Come on, knifster.
Huh?
I thought you were leaving to go to the planet of Korugar?
I was.
But you need my help.
Heroism, irrational but good.
Fire on three.
One, two, three.
- What was that?
- We are the knifsters.
We are the strongest when we do the blast of togetherness.
Diana!
You're safe here.
I'm going back to fight.
No!
You should stay here.
Protect me.
Uh, I mean, protect us.
Should any of those things escape the stadium.
But they need me.
I need you.
You already failed me once today.
If you want to go to the summit, I command you stay.
Respectfully, Ambassador, no way!
Diana!
Sorry, Mom.
But the only future I want is one where I do the most good wherever I am.
And right now that means saving Metropolis and being there for my friends.
Hey!
Where did Blackfire go?
She's made her choice.
If she lives, she will face the consequences of her defiance.
Here!
Take your best shot!
Or you could...
Help.
Help me, Supergirl!
I got you!
What?
No.
Stop!
Mommy!
It hurts.
You are just as irrational as Platinum said you were.
- Right, Platinum?
- Uh...
Right, Master.
Oh, no!
How do we stop them?
Batgirl.
Can we magnetize the bots like before?
No.
They are not powered by computers.
They're powered by...
Kryptomites!
We need the Anti-K juice!
Frost, Ivy, come on!
You guys get the Anti-K sauce from the science lab.
I'll get rid of this guy.
Meet you back here.
Over here, 8-bit.
A-ha!
Let's go for a ride.
You should have never come to Metropolis.
My head.
Hmm?
- Get away from my friend!
- Huh?
Aah!
Lena, please, you don't have to do this.
But I want to!
Lena!
You saved me.
How dare you!
Cyborg, use your sonic blaster to break the Kryptobots' canopies.
Now!
- So cool!
- Science for the win.
You okay, Supes?
I am now.
Got you.
Nice catch.
We'll be back to take you to Belle Reve after we finish off the robots.
You will be finished, supers!
Ooh-ooh!
Ooh-ooh!
Ooh-ooh.
Nice work, Blackfire.
That was some pretty great super-heroing, Batgirl.
Hello?
Can you hear me?
Oh, you're still alive.
Pity it's come to this.
Now I must reveal myself.
No, you don't.
Just get me out of here, and I'll finish the job.
The supers are right about one thing.
There is no greatness without sacrifice.
And for my greatness,
I'm sacrificing you.
No!
Let me out of here!
Hello, supers.
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Brainiac.
Lena Luthor failed.
But I will still destroy you.
I have gathered all the best technology from across the galaxies so that I can rid the universe of superheroes.
Oh!
Not my metal!
Bow to my power.
How do we defeat it?
Everything has a weakness.
We just have to figure out what his is.
If Lena's been hanging out with this Brainiac guy, she should know what gets his goat.
What do you want?
Brainiac is going to destroy the city.
We need your help.
Nope.
No way.
Not gonna happen.
Lena, I know what it's like.
When all you've known was being bad, it's hard to be good.
But if you help us, you can still be a hero.
Thanks!
But no thanks, Big Barda.
Now scram.
Vamoose.
Shoo.
He's on the move.
Oracle, bring my Batjet.
Full speed!
Certainly, Batgirl.
Okay, Oracle, enough stunts for one day.
Let's blast this bog back to the pit it was mined from.
Huh?
Fire defense blasters.
Huh?
I don't see any obvious targets.
But my X-ray vision isn't working on that skull thing.
Must be lead-lined.
Bumblebee discovered I can't see through...
Kryptonite?
Of course I have Kryptonite.
Who do you think taught Lena how to use it?
She's a bright girl, but needed a little guidance.
Hey, Robo, looks like you could use some more ram!
Or not.
Bumblebee, Supergirl needs that secret project you've been working on.
But it's not ready!
You have to try.
Drones, over here!
Suit her up!
Hmmm?
What is this?
Super suits are my specialty.
It'll keep you safe from Kryptonite.
It's laced with lead.
Give me back my Mega-Rod!
Whoa!
I will destroy you, Princess of Themyscira.
Anyone figure out anything new about Brainiac yet?
Only that he really, really wants to destroy us.
Ha!
You want me?
Come get me.
I found the ship's weak spot!
Aim for the dots!
Yeah.
I am stronger than your superpowers.
Whoa!
They need to combine their power.
They need a conduit!
Hey, supers, I've got an idea!
Platinum, I command you to get back here.
I am not just a machine anymore.
Everyone, power me up!
Worth a try.
Now, charge!
Just a little more!
- Yeah, success!
- We did it!
Platinum did it!
Platinum.
She saved us.
Diana!
Mom!
Thank Hera, you are safe!
I'm sorry I disappointed you about the summit.
Disappointed?
Diana, I have never been prouder.
But...
I thought you wanted me to go to the summit to learn to be queen.
There is nothing more regal than standing up for what you believe.
You will be an excellent queen.
I am proud to share the bond of eternity with you.
Me, too.
Too bad our bond is about as long as I'm going to be in detention.
You think your principal will let me catch a Boom Tube back to Korugar?
Of course!
I shall get Principal Waller.
Hey.
I didn't say I had to go right now.
Weren't you planning a day of funship?
Mmm, yes!
First, we shall see how many of the muffins made of bran we can eat.
And then to gaze upon the fishes made of jelly at the aquarium!
Ooh, and then to have the fight of the fluffy pillows!
And after that, the masks of magic mud!
Since Korugar Academy ran away before the last competition, they have forfeited.
And therefore, it is my pleasure to award the Intergalactic Game Championship to
Super Hero High!
Oh, hi everybody!
Platinum, you're okay!
Rebuilt and better than ever.
Yes!
Platinum, you're not finished yet!
But they're having a celebration!
And I've never been the type of girl to miss a celebration.
Uh...
That's because you've never been any type of girl before.
First time for everything.
Super Hero High will hold the Championship title...
Can I squeeze in with you?
Sure thing.
We always have room for another hero.
I invite you all to join us there.
I will destroy those supers.
Jill, you're a seven, right?
If I'm a seven, you're a four.
Meow!
I meant your shoe size.
Oh.
In that case, yes.
And sorry for snapping' at ya.
When you have your hair down and gloss those lips, you're a solid six.
Thanks.
I was just hoping to borrow some cowboy boots.
She's got a date with a hillbilly.
- He's not a hillbilly.
- He's taking you country line dancing, so he's a hillbilly from the early '90s.
Hey, it's still cool to line dance.
I take a line dance aerobics class.
And who's cooler than Marjorie?
I've got a date with a coordinated man who has a penis.
I'd do the polka, if that's what it took.
Do you even have a clue how to line dance?
Yeah.
You wear cute boots and dance in a line.
Ugh.
Oh, I did not just hear that.
You are gonna lose that fella to a gal who knows how to tush push you right out of a two wall formation change.
A two wall what?
All right.
Line up, ladies.
Let's show Christy a little country heat.
Shouldn't we stretch first?
I got to tinkle.
No, no time.
The Gamblers Anonymous people will be here any minute, and I owe one of them a couple hundred dollars.
Okay, now, this is your basic step.
Follow my lead.
Five, six.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Step, back, side, touch.
Step, back, side, touch.
Pivot, pivot.
Kick ball change, twist, twist...
Oh, dear Lord, how were you ever a stripper?
You put glitter on your boobs and Def Leppard's playing.
Nobody's looking at your feet.
Hello?
Yeah, this is she.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Okay, well, thanks for calling.
- Who was that?
- Uh, some lawyer.
My mother's dead.
Pivot, pivot.
Kick ball change...
What?
- You doin' all right?
- Yeah.
Why?
Bonnie, we're your friends.
Knock, knock, let us in.
What?
You mean my mother?
I barely knew the woman.
I'm fine.
I wish this was a true medium rare, but I'm fine.
You're not sad that she died?
No, but you seem to be snottin' it up pretty good.
Okay, I got a little more information.
She was in the hospital, she didn't suffer, she went quick.
Not quick enough.
- Oh, Bonnie...
- Oh, Wendy!
And her landlord wants everything out of the apartment.
So I guess we're going to San Francisco.
- Pass.
- Pass?
They can dump her stuff in the bay, for all I care.
- Oh, Bonnie...
- That's two!
You don't want to find out what happens at three!
You don't.
This is all very fresh.
But when you have a little distance, you might regret not going and getting some closure.
Might help you get rid of some of that anger.
- What anger?
- But it's your...
Do not say "mother"!
A mother is someone who sticks around, day in, day out, and pays the price, like I did with her.
- Well, you didn't exactly...
- Not the time.
Her mother just died, her burger's not pink in the middle, and she's about to punch Wendy.
- Couldn't sleep?
- No.
And I was so hoping you'd come downstairs so we could have a deep, life-affirming talk about it.
Kiss my ass.
You know, you might not care that you lost your mother, but I lost my grandmother.
If I kiss your ass, will you leave me alone?
You do understand we're never gonna see this woman again.
And you understand we never saw her before.
Christy, if you and I had never reconnected and I died, would you have mourned me?
Yes, I would have.
Oh, come on.
Those years we weren't speaking, did you even think about me at all?
Every day.
- Really?
- Yes.
You never called.
For 18 months, you didn't have phone privileges.
Give me one good reason why I should go to San Francisco and rummage around that old woman's apartment.
And don't give me any of that emotional closure crap.
Maybe you could find some stuff to sell.
You should've led with that.
I'm in.
Hello, Wendy's next birthday present.
Good news... we inherited a closet full of soap operas and a VHS player that was...
Get this... built in America.
Aw.
She liked soap operas.
I bet she watched them to fill her lonely life.
Oh, grow up, Bambi.
The only reason we're here is to find crap we can sell.
That's your reason.
I came here to learn about my grandmother.
Let me give you a thumbnail: she smoked Camels, wore clogs, and gave away her daughter.
Hey, Cranky, I think you need to eat.
Maybe there's something in the fridge.
Yeah, probably a six-pack of Ensure and some radishes.
Ooh, even better, a shriveled lemon and some batteries.
Aw, she liked lemons.
Probably to put in the tea that she drank while she watched her stories.
Stop it!
Why can't this be like in the movies, where I wear a black suit and a veil and pretend to cry into a hanky while a lawyer hands me a check, and...
Oh, my God, you're not gonna believe what I found.
If it's a dead cat, lie to me.
It's a big bag of cash.
Look!
If it's a dead cat, I am gonna kill you.
No, it really is a big bag of cash!
Oh, Mommy, I knew you were looking out for me!
I've got $2,438.
You?
I got $673.
- Really?
- Sorry.
Old habit. $3,084.
Oh, my God.
Altogether, that's, um...
Carry the six...
Let's just say we have between five and six grand.
- "We"?
- Yeah, "we."
I don't mean to pull rank here, but she was my mother.
You wouldn't even know about the money if I hadn't dragged you down here.
You just came so you could fence her toaster.
We're still doing that.
Come on, grab the boxes, I'll take the cash.
Nice try.
Let's just go.
It's kind of sad.
The woman lived her whole life, and all she had to show for it were a few tchotchkes and a wad of cash.
- And me.
- I was including you as a tchotchke.
- Who are you?
- Who are you?
This is my mother's place.
Oh, my God.
Have we been cleaning out the wrong apartment?
Who exactly is your mother?
Shirley Stabler.
Wow.
Grandma just got a lot more interesting.
Not so fast.
I know this hustle.
- What hustle?
- You scan the obits, find out about an old lady that's dead, show up to her apartment claiming to be a relative.
- Who does that?
- I've done it.
Yeah.
It works every time.
Except when you get sloppy.
My mother was white.
So was mine.
Look, here.
This is my mother with my father.
Wow.
There's Grandma with a... black man.
I'm sorry.
That was weird.
I don't know why I whispered.
We have black friends.
I'm sorry, I'm gonna need some proof, Miss... ?
You first.
Ray Stabler.
- Bonnie Plunkett.
- Christy Plunkett.
Unfortunately, the only proof I can show you is a picture of the fire station she dumped me at when I was four.
Here's the e-mail we got from a lawyer.
This is crazy.
Are you saying you're my... sister?
I'm not sayin' nothin' to nobody.
Unbelievable.
I saw her in the hospital right before she passed, and she never mentioned a daughter.
Just said, "Look in the freezer."
Well, that makes no sense.
- Dementia, huh?
- Cancer.
Same thing.
So, uh, let me get this straight.
She kept you?
I guess it's not what you want to hear, but, yes, she did.
Wow.
Even from the grave, she's finding new ways to stick it to me.
Frozen peas?
Why would she want me to find these?
Eh, you know, mothers and vegetables.
Excuse me, I got to take this.
Yeah, Lorraine.
- Put him on.
- Can you believe this?
She didn't want the girl but kept the boy?
Where are we, China?
Don't we have to tell him about the money?
No!
Are you crazy?
But his mom told him about the freezer.
Yeah, and he got a bag of peas.
Everybody wins.
But now that we're sober, aren't we supposed to be rigorously honest?
Not when it comes to money.
I'm sorry about that.
Got a trial coming up.
Oh, really?
What'd they get you for?
I'm the lawyer.
Oh.
Well, la-Dee-da.
A lawyer.
That's so cool.
You know, I'm actually
- studying to be...
- Not now.
Listen, I'm not really sure what we're supposed to do here.
This is my card.
Give me a call if you ever want to sit down and...
I don't know... talk.
Well, I don't have a card, seeing as it's not 1947.
Is she always like this?
No, sometimes she's in a bad mood.
I can come back another time.
Take whatever you need, but if you find any pictures of an adorable black boy, don't throw 'em out.
Hang on.
This makes a lot more sense now.
You threw out my Little League picture?
That's cold.
Sorry.
We thought you came with the frame.
Okay, I'm just gonna go.
Wait!
We found a bunch of
- cash in the freezer.
- No!
It's only right if you take half.
How much is there?
- About six grand.
- $350.
Six grand.
It's okay.
You keep it.
What's that supposed to mean?
- Means I don't need it.
- And we do?
We do, Mom.
We really do.
Here.
I got news for you, little bro.
You can keep your charity.
I have lived my whole life without any help from that woman.
I do not need a handout now!
I am so sorry about that.
For someone who wasn't raised by my mother, she sure is a lot like her.
Never, ever say that to her.
Can you move your foot, Uncle Ray?
You're on a 50.
- Here.
Let me help you with that.
- Thanks.
This'll really help with tuition.
Where'd you go to school?
Cal.
How about you?
- Sonoma State.
- Good school?
Ample parking.
You sure you're okay with us taking all of this?
Yeah, I'm sure.
- And another thing!
- Buckle up.
I never even finished high school, and she put you through law school?
!
I put me through law school.
I put me through college, I put me through everything.
She gave me nothing.
That's how I feel about you.
Everything I accomplished was in spite of her.
Now I know you had it hard, but believe me, it was no picnic being raised by Shirley.
- Abandoned.
- Black.
- Woman.
- Gay.
I think he wins.
My dad left, and every time she looked at me,
I was just a reminder.
- Oh, that's so sad.
- What about my story?
It's sad, too.
I've just heard it a lot.
You wish you had her.
I couldn't wait to get away from her.
And now I want to get away from you.
Christy, I wish you nothing but success.
And she'll have it, 'cause she had a mother who loved her and took care of her!
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.
He doesn't know.
I am so sorry I dragged you there.
I thought you'd get closure with your mom, and now it's just opener.
More open?
Oh, come on.
Just give me a dirty look so I know you still love me.
- It's not your fault.
- I know.
I was just making noise 'cause the radio doesn't work.
This is my life.
I get knocked around, kicked in the teeth, and then,
When I finally get good news, like my mother's dead, boom, I get kicked in the teeth again.
That's a funny line.
I'm gonna steal it when you die.
Enjoy it, 'cause I got nothing else to leave you.
Oh, stop feeling sorry for yourself.
Everybody's life is hard.
Oh, not my long-lost brother.
He apparently made something of himself.
Hey, don't discount what you've achieved.
I'm 52 years old, and I manage an apartment building.
You're sticking with 52, huh?
There's the dirty look.
Mom, we're all doing the best we can.
There's no point in comparing yourself to other people.
Thank you.
Especially a super successful attorney who overcame poverty and racial prejudice.
Oh, you do still love me!
I still can't believe Bonnie has a brother.
I know.
It's like finding out there was a Jerry Hitler.
How's she handling it?
You know her.
- Oh, you poor thing.
- Sorry.
Thanks.
Is she coming to the meeting?
No.
She's too busy having a meeting with all the angry voices in her head.
Last count, there were seven, and maybe a dog.
Yeah, well, she needs to come.
- You tell her.
- Maybe I will.
Just be sure to let her smell your hand before you pet her.
As the Sun Sets.
This portion brought to you today by Brim Decaffeinated Coffee.
Fill your cup to the rim with the richness of Brim.
And Lady Whisper Body Spray.
Because... well... you know.
What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
- Why aren't you at the meeting?
I'm not at the meeting 'cause you're not at the meeting.
You want to play 20 Questions, or are you gonna invite me in?
Fine.
I just don't want to talk about my mother.
You got it.
You know, I had a dead mom I was mad at, too.
For God's sake.
What?
I'm talking about my mother.
I see.
So this is where we make my problem about you.
Oh, we'll get there.
But since you brought it up, what exactly is your problem?
Seriously?
My mother threw me into the foster system, but chose to raise a son.
Okay.
How is that a problem?
Are you trying to piss me off?
I'm just saying, that's something that happened a long time ago.
It's only a problem now if you make it one.
I didn't think I could hate that woman any more than I already did.
Can I tell you something Marjorie told me?
Ugh.
Let me guess.
Pray?
Go to a meeting?
Pray at a meeting?
Do the hokey pokey, turn yourself around?
She told me to write my mother a letter and tell her everything
I didn't get a chance to tell her when she was alive.
And where would I mail this letter?
Do you happen to know the zip code for hell?
You go to her grave, and you just read it.
Wow.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Yeah, well, I thought so, too, but... it really helped.
And I had a nice weekend in South Carolina.
Bought an antique samovar.
I don't know what that is.
Is that a person?
A sandwich?
Make all the jokes you want, but instead of hating my mom day in and day out, now the anger just flares up occasionally.
Like herpes?
I wouldn't know.
But yes.
Okay, let's do this.
"Dear Mom,
"I have hated you my whole life.
"What kind of person abandons a four-year-old child?
"I wasn't a baby, you knew me.
"We sang songs together.
"And then I spent... the rest of my life thinking
"I must've done something wrong, or you would have wanted me.
"Do you know what that does to a person?
"I drank... because of you.
"I almost lost my child because of you.
"I went to jail because of you.
Because of you, because of you, because of you."
I can't keep doing this.
You have been the great excuse of my life.
I blamed you for everything.
It's all on you.
God.
I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I'm sorry.
I don't like you...
I don't have to like you...
But you're not responsible for my life.
I am responsible for my life.
There.
You're off the hook.
Rest in peace.
"Dear Mom, for as long
"as I can remember, you were never there for me.
You let me down so..""
What's going on?
Shh.
Lay down.
Just go with it.
What are you doing?
I was inspired by what you did, and I realized I still have so much anger towards you,
I thought I should get some of it out.
Wait.
You're doing your dead mom letter now?
Yeah.
I was in the mood, nothing on TV.
Eh, knock yourself out.
It might help if you crossed your arms.
Like this?
Perfect.
And breathe shallow.
Nice.
"You let me down so many times, and I learned not to trust.."
- Roar!
- That's going in the letter!
Jill, you're a seven, right?
If I'm a seven, you're a four.
Meow!
I meant your shoe size.
Oh.
In that case, yes.
And sorry for snapping' at ya.
When you have your hair down and gloss those lips, you're a solid six.
Thanks.
I was just hoping to borrow some cowboy boots.
She's got a date with a hillbilly.
- He's not a hillbilly.
- He's taking you country line dancing, so he's a hillbilly from the early '90s.
Hey, it's still cool to line dance.
I take a line dance aerobics class.
And who's cooler than Marjorie?
I've got a date with a coordinated man who has a penis.
I'd do the polka, if that's what it took.
Do you even have a clue how to line dance?
Yeah.
You wear cute boots and dance in a line.
Ugh.
Oh, I did not just hear that.
You are gonna lose that fella to a gal who knows how to tush push you right out of a two wall formation change.
A two wall what?
All right.
Line up, ladies.
Let's show Christy a little country heat.
Shouldn't we stretch first?
I got to tinkle.
No, no time.
The Gamblers Anonymous people will be here any minute, and I owe one of them a couple hundred dollars.
(upbeat country song playing)
Okay, now, this is your basic step.
Follow my lead.
Five, six.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Step, back, side, touch.
Step, back, side, touch.
Pivot, pivot.
Kick ball change, twist, twist...
Oh, dear Lord, how were you ever a stripper?
You put glitter on your boobs and Def Leppard's playing.
Nobody's looking at your feet.
(phone ringing)
Hello?
Yeah, this is she.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Okay, well, thanks for calling.
- Who was that?
- Uh, some lawyer.
My mother's dead.
Pivot, pivot.
Kick ball change...
What?
♪ (Theme) ♪
- You doin' all right?
- Yeah.
Why?
MARJORIE:
Bonnie, we're your friends.
Knock, knock, let us in.
What?
You mean my mother?
I barely knew the woman.
I'm fine.
I wish this was a true medium rare, but I'm fine.
You're not sad that she died?
No, but you seem to be snottin' it up pretty good.
Okay, I got a little more information.
She was in the hospital, she didn't suffer, she went quick.
Not quick enough.
- Oh, Bonnie...
- Oh, Wendy!
And her landlord wants everything out of the apartment.
So I guess we're going to San Francisco.
- Pass.
- Pass?
They can dump her stuff in the bay, for all I care.
- Oh, Bonnie...
- That's two!
You don't want to find out what happens at three!
You don't.
This is all very fresh.
But when you have a little distance, you might regret not going and getting some closure.
Might help you get rid of some of that anger.
- What anger?
- But it's your...
Do not say "mother"!
A mother is someone who sticks around, day in, day out, and pays the price, like I did with her.
- Well, you didn't exactly...
- Not the time.
Her mother just died, her burger's not pink in the middle, and she's about to punch Wendy.
(sighs)
- Couldn't sleep?
- No.
And I was so hoping you'd come downstairs so we could have a deep, life-affirming talk about it.
Kiss my ass.
You know, you might not care that you lost your mother, but I lost my grandmother.
If I kiss your ass, will you leave me alone?
You do understand we're never gonna see this woman again.
And you understand we never saw her before.
Christy, if you and I had never reconnected and I died, would you have mourned me?
Yes, I would have.
Oh, come on.
Those years we weren't speaking, did you even think about me at all?
Every day.
- Really?
- Yes.
You never called.
For 18 months, you didn't have phone privileges.
Give me one good reason why I should go to San Francisco and rummage around that old woman's apartment.
And don't give me any of that emotional closure crap.
Maybe you could find some stuff to sell.
You should've led with that.
I'm in.
Hello, Wendy's next birthday present.
Good news... we inherited a closet full of soap operas and a VHS player that was...
Get this... built in America.
Aw.
She liked soap operas.
I bet she watched them to fill her lonely life.
Oh, grow up, Bambi.
The only reason we're here is to find crap we can sell.
That's your reason.
I came here to learn about my grandmother.
Let me give you a thumbnail: she smoked Camels, wore clogs, and gave away her daughter.
Hey, Cranky, I think you need to eat.
Maybe there's something in the fridge.
Yeah, probably a six-pack of Ensure and some radishes.
Ooh, even better, a shriveled lemon and some batteries.
Aw, she liked lemons.
Probably to put in the tea that she drank while she watched her stories.
Stop it!
Why can't this be like in the movies, where I wear a black suit and a veil and pretend to cry into a hanky while a lawyer hands me a check, and...
Oh, my God, you're not gonna believe what I found.
If it's a dead cat, lie to me.
It's a big bag of cash.
Look!
If it's a dead cat, I am gonna kill you.
No, it really is a big bag of cash!
Oh, Mommy, I knew you were looking out for me!
I've got $2,438.
You?
I got $673.
- Really?
- Sorry.
Old habit. $3,084.
Oh, my God.
Altogether, that's, um...
Carry the six...
Let's just say we have between five and six grand.
- "We"?
- Yeah, "we."
I don't mean to pull rank here, but she was my mother.
You wouldn't even know about the money if I hadn't dragged you down here.
You just came so you could fence her toaster.
We're still doing that.
Come on, grab the boxes, I'll take the cash.
Nice try.
Let's just go.
It's kind of sad.
The woman lived her whole life, and all she had to show for it were a few tchotchkes and a wad of cash.
- And me.
- I was including you as a tchotchke.
- Who are you?
- Who are you?
This is my mother's place.
Oh, my God.
Have we been cleaning out the wrong apartment?
Who exactly is your mother?
Shirley Stabler.
Wow.
Grandma just got a lot more interesting.
Not so fast.
I know this hustle.
- What hustle?
- You scan the obits, find out about an old lady that's dead, show up to her apartment claiming to be a relative.
- Who does that?
- I've done it.
Yeah.
It works every time.
Except when you get sloppy.
My mother was white.
So was mine.
Look, here.
This is my mother with my father.
Wow.
There's Grandma with a (whispers): black man.
I'm sorry.
That was weird.
I don't know why I whispered.
We have black friends.
I'm sorry, I'm gonna need some proof, Miss... ?
You first.
Ray Stabler.
- Bonnie Plunkett.
- Christy Plunkett.
Unfortunately, the only proof I can show you is a picture of the fire station she dumped me at when I was four.
Here's the e-mail we got from a lawyer.
This is crazy.
Are you saying you're my... sister?
I'm not sayin' nothin' to nobody.
Unbelievable.
I saw her in the hospital right before she passed, and she never mentioned a daughter.
Just said, "Look in the freezer."
Well, that makes no sense.
- Dementia, huh?
- Cancer.
Same thing.
So, uh, let me get this straight.
She kept you?
I guess it's not what you want to hear, but, yes, she did.
Wow.
Even from the grave, she's finding new ways to stick it to me.
Frozen peas?
Why would she want me to find these?
Eh, you know, mothers and vegetables.
(ringtone playing)
Excuse me, I got to take this.
Yeah, Lorraine.
- Put him on.
- Can you believe this?
She didn't want the girl but kept the boy?
Where are we, China?
Don't we have to tell him about the money?
No!
Are you crazy?
But his mom told him about the freezer.
Yeah, and he got a bag of peas.
Everybody wins.
But now that we're sober, aren't we supposed to be rigorously honest?
Not when it comes to money.
I'm sorry about that.
Got a trial coming up.
Oh, really?
What'd they get you for?
I'm the lawyer.
Oh.
Well, la-Dee-da.
CHRISTY:
A lawyer.
That's so cool.

I am responsible for my life.
There.
You're off the hook.
Rest in peace.
(quietly): "Dear Mom, for as long
"as I can remember, you were never there for me.
You let me down so..""
What's going on?
Shh.
Lay down.
Just go with it.
What are you doing?
I was inspired by what you did, and I realized I still have so much anger towards you,
I thought I should get some of it out.
Wait.
You're doing your dead mom letter now?
Yeah.

And breathe shallow.
(exhales heavily)
Nice.
"You let me down so many times, and I learned not to trust.."
- Roar!
- (screams) That's going in the letter!
What do you know about Jessica Ford?
She was my mother.
You were in command at the Shiloh siege.
You got Tactical too close.
I don't pose any threat to Mr. Beaumont.
Emotions are a threat.
And let's be honest, Maxine, you bring a lot of emotion.
Mr. Beaumont.
Why would you hire me if you knew who my mother was?
The question isn't why I hired you.
It's why you'd want to work for the man who got her killed.
You know Damien Delaine's up for parole?
Has he tried to contact you?
I...
I haven't spoken to him.
Good.
Keep it that way.
Okay.
You can do this.
Can I see your ID, please?
Sure.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Open the gate!
Eric.
Hey, just checking you got everything you need.
Well, apart from a good night's sleep.
I stayed up going over the protocols again.
I wouldn't send you on a risk assessment alone unless I knew you were ready for it, and you are.
Thanks, boss.
I never should have let you talk me into that.
As if I could.
Uh-huh.
Yeah?
Mm.
Mm.
Come in.
Sir, Miss Carlson is here for you.
Thank you, Agent Stokes.
Crisis resolution must be pretty good, Miss Carlson, for the FBI to kick this over to a private contractor.
Well, my boss, Eric Beaumont, wrote the FBI's risk assessment protocols.
Have you done many of these?
Not many.
Have you had any further contact since the voice message?
Radio silence.
And the voice said,
"Give up your access codes, or I pay with your life."
Yeah, I think those were the exact words.
The voice was computerized, and I didn't get a chance to record it.
What kind of access codes is he demanding?
To a top-secret data center...
The kind we used to protect western democracies from every kind of terrorist attack you can imagine.
And what makes you think a threat came from this hack-tivist, Krank?
Same M.O.
Krank tried to hack into our systems to steal these access codes 10 years ago.
Isn't it strange that he would suddenly reappear now?
You tell me.
You're the expert.
Didn't you promise Evie you wouldn't track her anymore?
It's for her own safety.
I'm sure.
The point is, you told her you wouldn't.
I don't want her worrying.
Your work demands you manipulate people.
Your family needs the truth.
Better hurry up getting dressed.
She's in the hallway.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, mom, I'm back.
Hello, sweetie.
Are you gate crashing our shopping trip?
Your mom's got me working again.
Uh-huh.
What were you saying about the truth?
Excuse me.
Hello?
Hel...?
So, what's the verdict, Miss Carlson?
The threat is nonspecific and hasn't recurred.
According to our protocols, it's low risk.
Well, I'm not gonna pretend that's not a relief.
Hello?
Ubi mors ibi spes.
Ubi mors ibi spes.
Ubi mors ibi spes.
Ubi mors ibi spes.
It's the same voice.
Ubi mors ibi spes.
Ubi mors ibi spes.
Ubi mors ibi spes.
Ubi mors ibi spes.
It's Latin.
"Where there is death, there is hope."
- Ubi mors ibi spes.
- Sir?
Put the phone down.
Put the phone down, please.
Put the phone down, now!
Someone help!
Oh, my God!
Marcus?
Agent Nash, I have you.
I have you.
Help!
Somebody help!
Maxine?
Agent Nash died an hour ago.
Massive brain hemorrhaging.
Look at me.
Look at me.
This isn't your fault.
You understand me?
The phone exploded seconds after I told him he was safe.
That phrase in Latin.
"Where there is death, there is hope."
It was used by the Fascists in the Spanish Civil War.
You recognized it as a threat?
Just not soon enough.
Mr. Beaumont?
Assistant Executive Director Woods has arrived.
He requests to meet with you immediately.
All right.
Come on.
Ma'am, you can relax.
This wasn't your fault.
Either the protocols are wrong, which we know they aren't, or I screwed up.
Or neither.
I trust Marcus Nash's cellphone got your attention.
That was just a taste of my power.
I can infect any computer that controls an electromechanical process.
Cars, life-support machines, nuclear centrifuges... all your critical infrastructure.
Release the access codes to NSA's cloud servers by midnight tonight, or I will inflict mass civilian casualties and chaos.
Can he make good on that threat?
Well, our guys are analyzing the pulse that he sent through the network to Nash's phone.
Theoretically, it's possible.
Yes, theoretically, yes.
Well, then we have to assume this is real.
Mm-hmm.
And the U.S. government does not negotiate with terrorists.
No, we don't, but... 14 hours and change.
I'm gonna need something to offer.
You'll have it.
And your word, Freddie.
If you want me to negotiate, then you have to let me negotiate.
Right, right... no force, no tactical.
Scout's honor.
- One other thing.
- Hmm?
I don't want the girl on this one.
Maxine is my second.
You and I used to be friends.
I still consider us friends, Freddie.
All right, all right, then listen to me on this one.
Look, I know you feel responsible for Jessica Ford's death at Shiloh.
But hiring her daughter, you don't see that as a mistake.
This was a targeted assassination, timed to occur at precisely the moment
Maxine was with Nash.
Why would they do that?
I don't know.
Yet.
My team.
My way.
- Did you reach Maxine?
- Yeah.
Yeah, she is shaken, blaming herself.
Should she?
I mean, she followed protocol.
So what happened?
Well, that's them now.
Hey, Max.
- Hey.
- Hang in there.
I'll be fine once we stop this guy.
Well, Krank left no e-mail address, no phone number.
We've got 14 hours and no way to contact him.
There's someone else we can talk to.
The electromagnetic pulse that Krank used to make that phone explode was written in a complex programming language called "Coma."
So complex, only a handful of people know how to write it.
It was developed by a professor at Chicago Tech in the early '90s.
Damien Delaine.
Damien Delaine?
Isn't he serving 17 years for the massacre at Shiloh?
Was.
Paroled for good behavior last week.
Oh.
Last week?
So, he was still in prison when Agent Nash originally received the threat.
Okay, only a handful of people in the world know how to read this computer language.
If Damien Delaine's not behind this attack, he might know who is.
All right, talk to him.
All right.
Okay.
You okay?
Talking about Delaine must bring back strong emotions for you, considering his involvement in your mother's death.
It does for me.
I can handle it.
_
Do you think what I'm thinking?
Six months ago,
Maxine Carlson appears in our lives.
And suddenly, we get a case involving Damien Delaine, the man who's responsible for her mother's death who Eric hasn't seen or spoken to in 17 years.
Damien Delaine convinced some 50-some odd people at Shiloh that suicide was a better option than living.
Get your game face on.
And remember, we need his help.
I'm Zara Hallam.
This is my colleague, Oliver Yates.
Thank you for agreeing to come in.
I was so grateful to receive this call.
17 years in prison, that's a long time.
How does it feel to be on the outside?
17 years gives you a lot of sleepless hours to think about the people that lost their lives, the families that I tore apart.
Now you're rehabilitated?
I was wrong.
I thought I had a cause.
I thought... many things, misguided things.
So, please, if there's any small way I can help you with your case, you have no idea how much that would mean to me.
And you bear no ill will against Eric Beaumont?
Eric Beaumont is a manipulator and a hypocrite who bears as much responsibility as I do, if not more so, for the deaths at Shiloh.
We both consider Eric a mentor and a friend.
I've paid for my crimes, Miss Hallam.
Eric Beaumont has not, but that does not diminish my genuine desire to help you if I can.
A person calling themselves "Krank"
used these codes to blow up a cellphone and the man holding it.
Well, no wonder you can't read this.
This is Coma.
Can you help us identify the person who wrote it?
It has to be Victoria Locke.
She's a former student of mine.
British.
She'd be in her late 30s now.
How certain are you that it's her?
Well, Coma was Victoria's thesis.
Others could write simple programs, but to pull off what you described.
It can't be anyone else.
Nice theory.
Slight problem.
Victoria Locke died in 2007.
People are asleep, walking around in daydreams while the rich get richer, and the government destructs us with consumerism as they watch our every move.
We let them control us.
Surveillance audio of Victoria Locke from her college days.
Anti-government rant, fits the profile.
But if she drowned in Malta in 2007, how can she be Krank?
And the timing of Victoria's death tallies with when Krank dropped off the bureau's radar.
So, what?
She came back from the dead?
Maybe.
Maybe?
Damien Delaine's the ultimate manipulator.
Each move seems random and disconnected.
Until it doesn't.
He was in prison until a week ago.
Could he really be behind this?
But I spoke to his prison officers.
His behavior was exemplary.
Not even caught with a cellphone, let alone a computer.
Still, one week out of prison, and this happens?
The timing is suspicious.
Maybe he gave us the name of a dead woman to throw us off the scent?
All right, get our techs to compare Krank's threats with our hack-tivists operating the last 10 years.
Let's see if we can find a match.
Right away.
Excuse me.
Yeah.
Maxine?
Sorry, am I interrupting?
No, it's okay.
Listen, um a man died in your arms yesterday.
No one would think any less of you if... if you wanted to sit this one out.
I'm fine.
Really.
But thank you for asking.
Okay, our techs found something.
They're sending it through right now.
Okay.
What are we looking at?
Online posts from someone calling themselves "Tech Girl."
Tech Girl?
Victoria Locke went to Chicago Institute of Technology.
Her posts bear a remarkable similarity to Krank's.
What kind of similarities?
Vocabulary, syntax, subject matter.
Plus, Tech Girl appears to have come into existence shortly after Victoria Locke drowned in 2007.
Or is said to have drowned.
Faked her own death and went underground.
So, she's alive, and Damien Delaine's intel was helpful.
So it appears, yeah.
Can you pull a cellphone number for Tech Girl?
Yeah, I'm working on it.
Oh, and I need something to negotiate with.
The NSA has authorized the release of certain packets of classified intel for leverage purposes.
Packets containing...?
Above my pay grade.
Bingo.
Got a contact number.
All right, well, let's roll the dice.
This better work.
We've got 10 hours left.
Hello?
Am I speaking with Tech Girl?
My name is Eric Beaumont.
I'm a negotiator.
Am I right in presuming you are Victoria Locke, a.k.a., Krank?
Darling, I'll be whoever you want me to be.
Waveform is a match.
I'll try to track her location.
Victoria, I want you to know that I'm authorized by the U.S. government to negotiate a deal with you.
Negotiate what?
I have all the power.
And you want access to classified government data.
What do you plan to do with it?
Release it to the world.
People need to know the truth... how they're using terrorism as an excuse to spy on all of us.
Well, wouldn't it hurt the people if terrorists were able to read the U.S. government's classified files?
Tell me, Eric, do you know how many of the machines that power our lives are run by computer?
Most of them.
So you'll know to give me what I want, or I will start by taking down a few hospitals, an airport, and maybe I'll wipe out part of the Eastern seaboard.
Here's the thing I don't get.
You're brilliant enough to create this virus, but you need my help to access the government's secrets?
The government use quantum encryption to protect their secrets... completely unhackable, even to me.
So why target ordinary people?
Why not attack the government?
This precisely is an attack on the government.
For these people, these sheep, for them to realize they're being oppressed, the only thing is to spill their blood.
The revolution will not begin until we hit the reset button, and that's where we're going... a revolution, a total collapse of authority.
Please trust me, I'm gonna do everything I can to get you what you need.
Access codes by midnight, or the bodies start piling up.
I wasn't able to track her location.
Shouldn't the FBI get Damien Delaine to start working on a way to block her attack?
Well, Woods is working on it.
He doesn't need Delaine on this.
But they don't know this programming language, and they don't know her.
He does.
Look at Victoria's profile.
She's A-1 critical, total conviction to the cause, comfortable with substantial loss of life, slight hysteria, possibly not sane of mind.
Your point?
She's not gonna budge, Eric.
Not in 10 hours, and you know it.
We need Delaine to give us another way out.
She's right.
Delaine's an asset we can't afford to lose.
Delaine is not what he seems, Freddie.
We both know that.
And without him, we wouldn't have had our lead to Victoria Locke.
This is a game, and we are playing by his rules.
Eric, I despise the son of a bitch as much as you do, but within 10 hours, she's gonna start killing people.
[Computer beeps
They've given Delaine a high-speed computer.
He's working on a way to counteract the virus.
Victoria, it's Eric.
Do you have what I need?
Sir, the techs have been able to use
Beaumont's communication to pinpoint Victoria Locke's location.
South D.C. Tactical Unit's ready to take her out.
I told Eric Beaumont
I'd give him time to negotiate.
Sir, with 10 hours left,
I don't think anyone expects you to hold to that promise.
I don't have those access codes, but I do have a gift.
What's the gift?
And she's on the hook.
A terabyte of classified information.
It's a show of good faith, Victoria, while I work on getting you the rest.
And here I was thinking you wanted me to trust you.
I absolutely do.
You people forget surveillance works both ways.
What the hell just happened?
She's watching us.
Not us.
Let me see.
Son of a...
Freddie?
!
Eric!
Freddie, I'm gonna get you out of there!
What's wrong with the elevator?
Aah.
Somebody get an engineer!
Son of a bitch.
Right this way, right this way.
Can you move aside, please?
We got get through here, okay?
I got him.
I got him right here.
I got it all clear.
Eric?
Government techs have confirmed it.
The same code that blew Nash's phone took over the elevator.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
We grew apart... but he was my mentor.
He was my friend.
This isn't easy for us, uh, to say, but we both feel that you should recuse yourself.
- I can't.
- Why?
Because you think Damien Delaine's behind this?
He's behind everything.
Killing Nash in front of Maxine, programming language leading us right to him, and now Woods's death.
Eric, Victoria Locke killed Woods.
She's not even trying to hide it.
I am telling you this is Delaine.
Eric, we don't trust him, either, but you're too close to this.
Maybe.
But I'm not leaving.
It's Victoria.
_
_
Face to face... that's progress, right?
It's a trap.
Yeah, it sure is.
Look, if you go, we all go.
You saw what she said.
Alone.
I'll check in when I get there.
The feds are gonna want to find me so they can take her out.
Make sure they don't.
Eric!
Eric, I have to tell you something.
No time, Maxine.
I've been in contact with Damien Delaine.
I know I should have told you, and you have every right to fire me.
How long?
He started writing me letters and texts about a year ago.
I ignored them at first, but...
But I wanted him to tell me more about my mom, and not just the sugar-coated version my aunt fed me.
What?
You're not angry with me?
What?
You think I didn't know?
From the moment I hired you.
You knew.
I know Delaine.
He's been using you to get to me from the start.
Because you arrested him?
Eric, that was 17 years ago.
I know you feel responsible for my mother's death, but...
I am responsible.
Freddie Woods launched that assault.
All those people died before you went in to negotiate.
What I'm about to tell you is not in the public record, because I made sure of it.
I did enter to negotiate.
There were dead bodies everywhere.
Delaine saw me but kept right on walking.
And then I saw her.
I saw your mother.
I saw Jessica...
Now we are calm.
Now we are ready.
This is what we talked about.
Jessica?
I want you to turn on the switch.
...Wearing a suicide vest.
A suicide vest?
Delaine was right behind her.
I pleaded with her to surrender for the sake of the men, women, and children still alive inside the compound, but she said he was in her head.
She couldn't get him out.
Please, Jessica, don't do this.
She didn't want to die.
She loved you so much, Maxine.
I had Freddie in my ear, ordering me to take the shot.
Jessica had Delaine in hers, telling her she had to press the button.
Push that button.
I couldn't reach her.
I tried and I failed.
Push the button.
Jessica.
You shot her?
I didn't want you growing up thinking your mother was a bad person.
She wasn't.
But Damien Delaine wanted to become a martyr that day, and he will never forgive me.
Never.
Mr. Delaine, tell me something good.
I'm working on a way to stop Victoria.
In truth, the code she's written is beautifully simple.
A couple of nuts left to crack.
Six hours, maybe.
You have four.
Maxine.
Hi, Damien.
How wonderful to finally see your face.
You two know each other?
Eric told me everything.
Has this all been about using me to get to him?
My dear...
I will wager that Eric did not, in fact, tell you everything.
But right now, I have work to do.
What didn't he tell me?
Given he's a type-A control freak with a narcissistic personality disorder,
I'm sure he didn't mention the strings he's pulled all your life.
What strings?
The insurance payout from Jessica's death, the scholarship to Northwestern.
- You don't have to listen to this.
- Yes, I do.
Why would he do that?
Because he was in love with your mother, of course.
What?
He's lying.
Check my waveform, Mr. Yates.
You will see that I am not.
Eric and Jessica had an affair for years, way before I met her.
Okay, we're hanging up now.
Do it, if the truth offends you.
The real reason Eric shot your mother is because she left him... for me.
- Can we track Eric's location?
- Yeah.
Then let's go.
- What about Delaine?
- I'm not waiting for him.
All right, I just lost Eric's signal about 20 miles outside Bethesda.
Where do you think she's led him?
If she's planning on going through this,
- it could be a data bunker.
- A data bunker?
Where critical infrastructure is controlled?
She'd need direct access.
Yeah, it's not the kind of place you find on a map.
And it would be protected, wouldn't it?
She wouldn't be able to get past the armed guards.
Well, maybe she could.
Don't worry.
I've returned the carbon monoxide levels to normal.
Have you got my codes?
I don't think that's really what you need.
Please, stay back.
Give me what I want, or I will do it.
Traffic signals Life-support systems...
Air traffic control.
The whole country will come crashing down in blood and chaos.
You do not want to do this.
You're wrong.
One more step, and I will prove it.
You swore you would never pick up a gun again after you killed Jessica Ford.
You want me to pick up the gun, is that it?
And what would you do to save all these lives, Eric?
Take mine?
Okay.
What do the FBI say?
- Any update on Delaine?
- Not exactly.
He's disappeared.
What do you mean "disappeared"?
The FBI went to track his progress.
He's vanished.
So now we have no way of stopping Krank.
This was never about stopping Krank or government secrets.
I think Delaine's been controlling Victoria, perhaps ever since he was her professor, probably even arranged the faking of her death to one day activate her for this.
Eric was right.
This was about destroying him and me.
Maxine, you don't believe what Delaine was saying back there?
I believe everything he said.
Think about it.
If Delaine knew all that about me, then he also knew I studied Latin, that I would recognize that phrase yesterday morning, just too late to save that man from dying.
Why would he want that?
To shake her faith in Eric and herself, get her to turn against him.
This is where Eric's cellphone signal cut out.
- I'm going in.
You should call the FBI.
- No.
We're going with you.
Victoria, I do not want to shoot you.
You don't have a choice.
Delaine has gotten into your head, just like he got into Jessica's, but you do not have to die.
An awful lot of people will unless I do.
Damn it.
Please, stop.
I can't do that, Eric, but you can.
Eric, wait.
It's true, isn't it?
You were in love with my mother.
Yes, I was.
But that's not why you shot her.
Victoria, stop.
This is not the time for this conversation, Maxine.
He's right, Maxine.
This is ready to go.
In just a few seconds, tens of thousands of people will die.
She's wrong, Eric.
Oh, is it Delaine's fix?
He's disappeared.
Because she can't do what she thinks she can do.
She blew up that cellphone, sent Freddie Woods plunging to his death.
Designed by Delaine to make you believe, to make all of us believe, the virus could infiltrate any system.
It was all a bluff.
You don't know that.
You said it yourself.
Damien Delaine is a game player.
This has all been part of his game.
To re-create Shiloh, to take revenge by pushing you to do the one thing you swore you would never do.
The only thing he didn't count on was us.
Put the gun down, Eric.
Nothing will happen.
And if you're wrong?
Then we are all wrong together.
Eric, if you're looking for forgiveness for my mother's death, you have it.
I know you didn't have a choice.
But you do now.
Time's up.
Eric, please.
Eric, please.
Say good night.
No.
I'm...
No.
No!
No!
- No.
- It's over, Victoria.
No!
No, no, no, no, no.
this can't be happening!
- Wait!
No, no.
- It's okay.
No, no!
No.
Ugh.
She'll face charges for the deaths of Nash,
Freddie Woods, and everyone she killed here.
How you doing?
You were right.
Emotions are dangerous.
Well, one thing I wasn't right about was, uh... you.
Maxine, you belong on this team.
I'm not so sure about that.
I kept this picture of your mother in my wallet for 17 years.
I think you should have it now.
All the doors that opened in my life... nothing is what I thought.
I didn't open any doors you couldn't walk through on your own.
I just had to make sure you were okay.
Out of guilt?
No.
Out of love.
Your mother couldn't take care of you, so I did.
I always knew one day, the door you'd walk through would be mine.
I don't think I can stay here anymore.
This isn't over, Maxine.
It is over.
You didn't pull the trigger.
Delaine lost.
He's not gonna accept defeat.
He will keep after me, and you, until he's destroyed us both.
- Nathalie?
- Eric.
Nathalie, what's wrong?
Oh, I put Evie on the plane back to Montreal myself, Eric.
The driver's waiting at Arrivals.
She never showed.
I've been calling and calling.
I know something's wrong, Eric.
I know it.
So...
Eric, answer me.
Eric.
What is it?
Answer me.
Eric, what's happening?
Delaine's taken my daughter.
What do you know about Jessica Ford?
[Voice breaking] She was my mother.
You were in command at the Shiloh siege.
You got Tactical too close.
I don't pose any threat to Mr. Beaumont.
Emotions are a threat.
And let's be honest, Maxine, you bring a lot of emotion.
Mr. Beaumont.
Why would you hire me if you knew who my mother was?
Eric:
The question isn't why I hired you.
It's why you'd want to work for the man who got her killed.
You know Damien Delaine's up for parole?
Has he tried to contact you?
I...
I haven't spoken to him.
Good.
Keep it that way.

The electromagnetic pulse that Krank used to make that phone explode was written in a complex programming language called "Coma."
So complex, only a handful of people know how to write it.
It was developed by a professor at Chicago Tech in the early '90s.
Damien Delaine.

All right, all right, then listen to me on this one.
Look, I know you feel responsible for Jessica Ford's death at Shiloh.
But hiring her daughter, you don't see that as a mistake.
This was a targeted assassination, timed to occur at precisely the moment
Maxine was with Nash.
Why would they do that?
I don't know.
Yet.
My team.
My way.
- Did you reach Maxine?
- Yeah.
Yeah, she is shaken, blaming herself.
Should she?
I mean, she followed protocol.
So what happened?
Well, that's them now.
Hey, Max.
- Hey.
- Hang in there.
I'll be fine once we stop this guy.
Well, Krank left no e-mail address, no phone number.
We've got 14 hours and no way to contact him.
There's someone else we can talk to.
The electromagnetic pulse that Krank used to make that phone explode was written in a complex programming language called "Coma."
So complex, only a handful of people know how to write it.
It was developed by a professor at Chicago Tech in the early '90s.
Damien Delaine.
Damien Delaine?
Isn't he serving 17 years for the massacre at Shiloh?
Was.
Paroled for good behavior last week.
Last week?
So, he was still in prison when Agent Nash originally received the threat.
Okay, only a handful of people in the world know how to read this computer language.
If Damien Delaine's not behind this attack, he might know who is.
All right, talk to him.
All right.
Okay.
You okay?
Talking about Delaine must bring back strong emotions for you, considering his involvement in your mother's death.
It does for me.
I can handle it.
Do you think what I'm thinking?
Six months ago,
Maxine Carlson appears in our lives.
And suddenly, we get a case involving Damien Delaine, the man who's responsible for her mother's death who Eric hasn't seen or spoken to in 17 years.
Damien Delaine convinced some 50-some odd people at Shiloh that suicide was a better option than living.
Get your game face on.
And remember, we need his help.
I'm Zara Hallam.
This is my colleague, Oliver Yates.
Thank you for agreeing to come in.
I was so grateful to receive this call.
17 years in prison, that's a long time.
How does it feel to be on the outside?
17 years gives you a lot of sleepless hours to think about the people that lost their lives, the families that I tore apart.
Now you're rehabilitated?
I was wrong.
I thought I had a cause.
I thought... many things, misguided things.
So, please, if there's any small way I can help you with your case, you have no idea how much that would mean to me.
And you bear no ill will against Eric Beaumont?
Eric Beaumont is a manipulator and a hypocrite who bears as much responsibility as I do, if not more so, for the deaths at Shiloh.
We both consider Eric a mentor and a friend.
I've paid for my crimes, Miss Hallam.
Eric Beaumont has not, but that does not diminish my genuine desire to help you if I can.
A person calling themselves "Krank"
used these codes to blow up a cellphone and the man holding it.
Well, no wonder you can't read this.
This is Coma.
Can you help us identify the person who wrote it?
It has to be Victoria Locke.
She's a former student of mine.
British.
She'd be in her late 30s now.
How certain are you that it's her?
Well, Coma was Victoria's thesis.
Others could write simple programs, but to pull off what you described.
It can't be anyone else.
Nice theory.
Slight problem.
Victoria Locke died in 2007.
People are asleep, walking around in daydreams while the rich get richer, and the government destructs us with consumerism as they watch our every move.
We let them control us.
Surveillance audio of Victoria Locke from her college days.
Anti-government rant, fits the profile.
But if she drowned in Malta in 2007, how can she be Krank?
And the timing of Victoria's death tallies with when Krank dropped off the bureau's radar.
So, what?
She came back from the dead?
Maybe.
Maybe?
Damien Delaine's the ultimate manipulator.
Each move seems random and disconnected.
Until it doesn't.
He was in prison until a week ago.
Could he really be behind this?
But I spoke to his prison officers.
His behavior was exemplary.
Not even caught with a cellphone, let alone a computer.
Still, one week out of prison, and this happens?
The timing is suspicious.
Maybe he gave us the name of a dead woman to throw us off the scent?
All right, get our techs to compare Krank's threats with our hack-tivists operating the last 10 years.
Let's see if we can find a match.
Right away.
Excuse me.
Yeah.
Maxine?
Sorry, am I interrupting?
No, it's okay.
Listen, um... a man died in your arms yesterday.
No one would think any less of you if... if you wanted to sit this one out.
I'm fine.
Really.
But thank you for asking.
Okay, our techs found something.
They're sending it through right now.
Okay.
What are we looking at?
Online posts from someone calling themselves "Tech Girl."
Tech Girl?
Victoria Locke went to Chicago Institute of Technology.
Her posts bear a remarkable similarity to Krank's.
What kind of similarities?
Vocabulary, syntax, subject matter.
Plus, Tech Girl appears to have come into existence shortly after Victoria Locke drowned in 2007.
Or is said to have drowned.
Faked her own death and went underground.
So, she's alive, and Damien Delaine's intel was helpful.
So it appears, yeah.
Can you pull a cellphone number for Tech Girl?
Yeah, I'm working on it.
And I need something to negotiate with.
The NSA has authorized the release of certain packets of classified intel for leverage purposes.
Packets containing...?
Above my pay grade.
Bingo.
Got a contact number.
All right, well, let's roll the dice.
This better work.
We've got 10 hours left.
Hello?
Am I speaking with Tech Girl?
My name is Eric Beaumont.
I'm a negotiator.
Am I right in presuming you are Victoria Locke, a.k.a., Krank?
Darling, I'll be whoever you want me to be.
Waveform is a match.
I'll try to track her location.
Victoria, I want you to know that I'm authorized by the U.S. government to negotiate a deal with you.
Negotiate what?
I have all the power.
And you want access to classified government data.
What do you plan to do with it?
Release it to the world.
People need to know the truth... how they're using terrorism as an excuse to spy on all of us.
Well, wouldn't it hurt the people if terrorists were able to read the U.S. government's classified files?
Tell me, Eric, do you know how many of the machines that power our lives are run by computer?
Most of them.
So you'll know to give me what I want, or I will start by taking down a few hospitals, an airport, and maybe I'll wipe out part of the Eastern seaboard.
Here's the thing I don't get.
You're brilliant enough to create this virus, but you need my help to access the government's secrets?
The government use quantum encryption to protect their secrets... completely unhackable, even to me.
So why target ordinary people?
Why not attack the government?
This precisely is an attack on the government.
For these people, these sheep, for them to realize they're being oppressed, the only thing is to spill their blood.
The revolution will not begin until we hit the reset button, and that's where we're going... a revolution, a total collapse of authority.
Please trust me, I'm gonna do everything I can to get you what you need.
Access codes by midnight, or the bodies start piling up.
I wasn't able to track her location.
Shouldn't the FBI get Damien Delaine to start working on a way to block her attack?
Well, Woods is working on it.
He doesn't need Delaine on this.
But they don't know this programming language, and they don't know her.
He does.
Look at Victoria's profile.
She's A-1 critical, total conviction to the cause, comfortable with substantial loss of life, slight hysteria, possibly not sane of mind.
Your point?
She's not gonna budge, Eric.
Not in 10 hours, and you know it.
We need Delaine to give us another way out.
She's right.
Delaine's an asset we can't afford to lose.
Delaine is not what he seems, Freddie.
We both know that.
And without him, we wouldn't have had our lead to Victoria Locke.
This is a game, and we are playing by his rules.
Eric, I despise the son of a bitch as much as you do, but within 10 hours, she's gonna start killing people.
[Computer beeps.
They've given Delaine a high-speed computer.
He's working on a way to counteract the virus.
Victoria, it's Eric.
Do you have what I need?
Sir, the techs have been able to use.
Beaumont's communication to pinpoint Victoria Locke's location.
South D.C. Tactical Unit's ready to take her out.
I told Eric Beaumont
I'd give him time to negotiate.
Sir, with 10 hours left,
I don't think anyone expects you to hold to that promise.
I don't have those access codes, but I do have a gift.
What's the gift?
And she's on the hook.
A terabyte of classified information.
It's a show of good faith, Victoria, while I work on getting you the rest.
And here I was thinking you wanted me to trust you.
I absolutely do.
You people forget surveillance works both ways.
What the hell just happened?
She's watching us.
Not us.
Let me see.
Son of a...
Freddie?
!
Eric!
Freddie, I'm gonna get you out of there!
What's wrong with the elevator?
Aah.
Somebody get an engineer!
Son of a bitch.
Right this way, right this way.
Can you move aside, please?
We got get through here, okay?
I got him.
I got him right here.
I got it all clear.
Eric?
Government techs have confirmed it.
The same code that blew Nash's phone took over the elevator.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
We grew apart... but he was my mentor.
He was my friend.
This isn't easy for us, to say, but we both feel that you should recuse yourself.
- I can't.
- Why?
Because you think Damien Delaine's behind this?
He's behind everything.
Killing Nash in front of Maxine, programming language leading us right to him, and now Woods's death.
Eric, Victoria Locke killed Woods.
She's not even trying to hide it.
I am telling you this is Delaine.
Eric, we don't trust him, either, but you're too close to this.
Maybe.
But I'm not leaving.
It's Victoria.
Face to face... that's progress, right?
It's a trap.
Yeah, it sure is.
Look, if you go, we all go.
You saw what she said.
Alone.
I'll check in when I get there.
The feds are gonna want to find me so they can take her out.
Make sure they don't.
Eric!
Eric, I have to tell you something.
No time, Maxine.
I've been in contact with Damien Delaine.
I know I should have told you, and you have every right to fire me.
How long?
He started writing me letters and texts about a year ago.
I ignored them at first, but...
But I wanted him to tell me more about my mom, and not just the sugar-coated version my aunt fed me.
What?
You're not angry with me?
What?
You think I didn't know?
From the moment I hired you.
You knew.
I know Delaine.
He's been using you to get to me from the start.
Because you arrested him?
Eric, that was 17 years ago.
I know you feel responsible for my mother's death, but...
I am responsible.
Freddie Woods launched that assault.
All those people died before you went in to negotiate.
What I'm about to tell you is not in the public record, because I made sure of it.
I did enter to negotiate.
There were dead bodies everywhere.
Delaine saw me but kept right on walking.
And then I saw her.
I saw your mother.
I saw Jessica...
Now we are calm.
Now we are ready.
This is what we talked about.
Jessica?
I want you to turn on the switch.
Wearing a suicide vest.
A suicide vest?
Delaine was right behind her.
I pleaded with her to surrender for the sake of the men, women, and children still alive inside the compound, but she said he was in her head.
She couldn't get him out.
Please, Jessica, don't do this.
She didn't want to die.
She loved you so much, Maxine.
I had Freddie in my ear, ordering me to take the shot.
Jessica had Delaine in hers, telling her she had to press the button.
Push that button.
I couldn't reach her.
I tried... and I failed.
Push the button.
Jessica.
You shot her?
I didn't want you growing up thinking your mother was a bad person.
She wasn't.
But Damien Delaine wanted to become a martyr that day, and he will never forgive me.
Never.
Mr. Delaine, tell me something good.
I'm working on a way to stop Victoria.
In truth, the code she's written is beautifully simple.
A couple of nuts left to crack.
Six hours, maybe.
You have four.
Maxine.
Hi, Damien.
How wonderful to finally see your face.
You two know each other?
Eric told me everything.
Has this all been about using me to get to him?
My dear...
I will wager that Eric did not, in fact, tell you everything.
But right now, I have work to do.
What didn't he tell me?
Given he's a type-A control freak with a narcissistic personality disorder,
I'm sure he didn't mention the strings he's pulled all your life.
What strings?
The insurance payout from Jessica's death, the scholarship to Northwestern.
- You don't have to listen to this.
- Yes, I do.
Why would he do that?
Because he was in love with your mother, of course.
What?
He's lying.
Check my waveform, Mr. Yates.
You will see that I am not.
Eric and Jessica had an affair for years, way before I met her.
Okay, we're hanging up now.
Do it, if the truth offends you.
The real reason Eric shot your mother is because she left him... for me.
- Can we track Eric's location?
- Yeah.
Then let's go.
- What about Delaine?
- I'm not waiting for him.
All right, I just lost Eric's signal about 20 miles outside Bethesda.
Where do you think she's led him?
If she's planning on going through this,
- it could be a data bunker.
- A data bunker?
Where critical infrastructure is controlled?
She'd need direct access.
Yeah, it's not the kind of place you find on a map.
And it would be protected, wouldn't it?
She wouldn't be able to get past the armed guards.
Well, maybe she could.
Don't worry.
I've returned the carbon monoxide levels to normal.
Have you got my codes?
I don't think that's really what you need.
Please, stay back.
Give me what I want, or I will do it.
Traffic signals...
Life-support systems...
Air traffic control.
The whole country will come crashing down in blood and chaos.
You do not want to do this.
You're wrong.
One more step, and I will prove it.
You swore you would never pick up a gun again after you killed Jessica Ford.
You want me to pick up the gun, is that it?
And what would you do to save all these lives, Eric?
Take mine?
Okay.
What do the FBI say?
- Any update on Delaine?
- Not exactly.
He's disappeared.
What do you mean "disappeared"?
The FBI went to track his progress.
He's vanished.
So now we have no way of stopping Krank.
This was never about stopping Krank or government secrets.
I think Delaine's been controlling Victoria, perhaps ever since he was her professor, probably even arranged the faking of her death to one day activate her for this.
Eric was right.
This was about destroying him and me.
Maxine, you don't believe what Delaine was saying back there?
I believe everything he said.
Think about it.
If Delaine knew all that about me, then he also knew I studied Latin, that I would recognize that phrase yesterday morning, just too late to save that man from dying.
Why would he want that?
To shake her faith in Eric and herself, get her to turn against him.
This is where Eric's cellphone signal cut out.
- I'm going in.
You should call the FBI.
- No.
We're going with you.
Victoria, I do not want to shoot you.
You don't have a choice.
Delaine has gotten into your head, just like he got into Jessica's, but you do not have to die.
An awful lot of people will unless I do.
Damn it.
Please, stop.
I can't do that, Eric, but you can.
Eric, wait.
It's true, isn't it?
You were in love with my mother.
Yes, I was.
But that's not why you shot her.
Victoria, stop.
This is not the time for this conversation, Maxine.
He's right, Maxine.
This is ready to go.
In just a few seconds, tens of thousands of people will die.
She's wrong, Eric.
Is it Delaine's fix?
He's disappeared.
Because she can't do what she thinks she can do.
She blew up that cellphone, sent Freddie Woods plunging to his death.
Designed by Delaine to make you believe, to make all of us believe, the virus could infiltrate any system.
It was all a bluff.
You don't know that.
You said it yourself.
Damien Delaine is a game player.
This has all been part of his game.
To re-create Shiloh, to take revenge by pushing you to do the one thing you swore you would never do.
The only thing he didn't count on was us.
Put the gun down, Eric.
Nothing will happen.
And if you're wrong?
Then we are all wrong together.
Eric, if you're looking for forgiveness for my mother's death, you have it.
I know you didn't have a choice.
But you do now.
Time's up.
Eric, please.
Eric, please.
Say good night.
No.
I'm...
No.
No!
No!
- No.
- It's over, Victoria.
No!
No, no, no, no, no.
This can't be happening!
- Wait!
No, no.
- It's okay.
No, no!
No.
She'll face charges for the deaths of Nash,
Freddie Woods, and everyone she killed here.
How you doing?
You were right.
Emotions are dangerous.
Well, one thing I wasn't right about was... you.
Maxine, you belong on this team.
I'm not so sure about that.
I kept this picture of your mother in my wallet for 17 years.
I think you should have it now.
All the doors that opened in my life... nothing is what I thought.
I didn't open any doors you couldn't walk through on your own.
I just had to make sure you were okay.
Out of guilt?
No.
Out of love.
Your mother couldn't take care of you, so I did.
I always knew one day, the door you'd walk through would be mine.
I don't think I can stay here anymore.
This isn't over, Maxine.
It is over.
You didn't pull the trigger.
Delaine lost.
He's not gonna accept defeat.
He will keep after me, and you, until he's destroyed us both.
- Nathalie?
- Eric.
Nathalie, what's wrong?
I put Evie on the plane back to Montreal myself, Eric.
The driver's waiting at Arrivals.
She never showed.
I've been calling and calling.
I know something's wrong, Eric.
I know it.
So...
Eric, answer me.
Eric.
What is it?
Answer me.
Eric, what's happening?
Delaine's taken my daughter.
What do you know about Jessica Ford?
She was my mother.
You were in command at the Shiloh siege.
You got Tactical too close.
I don't pose any threat to Mr. Beaumont.
Emotions are a threat.
And let's be honest, Maxine, you bring a lot of emotion.
Mr. Beaumont.
Why would you hire me if you knew who my mother was?
The question isn't why I hired you.
It's why you'd want to work for the man who got her killed.
You know Damien Delaine's up for parole?
Has he tried to contact you?
I...
I haven't spoken to him.
Good.
Keep it that way.
Okay.
You can do this.
Can I see your ID, please?
Sure.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Open the gate!
Eric.
Hey, just checking you got everything you need.
Well, apart from a good night's sleep.
I stayed up going over the protocols again.
I wouldn't send you on a risk assessment alone unless I knew you were ready for it, and you are.
Thanks, boss.
I never should have let you talk me into that.
As if I could.
Uh-huh.
Yeah?
Mm.
Mm.
Come in.
Sir, Miss Carlson is here for you.
Thank you, Agent Stokes.
Crisis resolution must be pretty good, Miss Carlson, for the FBI to kick this over to a private contractor.
Well, my boss, Eric Beaumont, wrote the FBI's risk assessment protocols.
Have you done many of these?
Not many.
Have you had any further contact since the voice message?
Radio silence.
And the voice said,
"Give up your access codes, or I pay with your life."
Yeah, I think those were the exact words.
The voice was computerized, and I didn't get a chance to record it.
What kind of access codes is he demanding?
To a top-secret data center...
The kind we used to protect western democracies from every kind of terrorist attack you can imagine.
And what makes you think a threat came from this hack-tivist, Krank?
Same M.O.
Krank tried to hack into our systems to steal these access codes 10 years ago.
Isn't it strange that he would suddenly reappear now?
You tell me.
You're the expert.
Didn't you promise Evie you wouldn't track her anymore?
It's for her own safety.
I'm sure.
The point is, you told her you wouldn't.
I don't want her worrying.
Your work demands you manipulate people.
Your family needs the truth.
Better hurry up getting dressed.
She's in the hallway.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, mom, I'm back.
Hello, sweetie.
Are you gate crashing our shopping trip?
Your mom's got me working again.
Uh-huh.
What were you saying about the truth?
Excuse me.
Hello?
Hel...?
So, what's the verdict, Miss Carlson?
The threat is nonspecific and hasn't recurred.
According to our protocols, it's low risk.
Well, I'm not gonna pretend that's not a relief.
Hello?
Ubi mors ibi spes.
Ubi mors ibi spes.
Ubi mors ibi spes.
Ubi mors ibi spes.
It's the same voice.
Ubi mors ibi spes.
Ubi mors ibi spes.
Ubi mors ibi spes.
Ubi mors ibi spes.
It's Latin.
"Where there is death, there is hope."
- Ubi mors ibi spes.
- Sir?
Put the phone down.
Put the phone down, please.
Put the phone down, now!
Someone help!
Oh, my God!
Marcus?
Agent Nash, I have you.
I have you.
Help!
Somebody help!
Maxine?
Agent Nash died an hour ago.
Massive brain hemorrhaging.
Look at me.
Look at me.
This isn't your fault.
You understand me?
The phone exploded seconds after I told him he was safe.
That phrase in Latin.
"Where there is death, there is hope."
It was used by the Fascists in the Spanish Civil War.
You recognized it as a threat?
Just not soon enough.
Mr. Beaumont?
Assistant Executive Director Woods has arrived.
He requests to meet with you immediately.
All right.
Come on.
Ma'am, you can relax.
This wasn't your fault.
Either the protocols are wrong, which we know they aren't, or I screwed up.
Or neither.
I trust Marcus Nash's cellphone got your attention.
That was just a taste of my power.
I can infect any computer that controls an electromechanical process.
Cars, life-support machines, nuclear centrifuges... all your critical infrastructure.
Release the access codes to NSA's cloud servers by midnight tonight, or I will inflict mass civilian casualties and chaos.
Can he make good on that threat?
Well, our guys are analyzing the pulse that he sent through the network to Nash's phone.
Theoretically, it's possible.
Yes, theoretically, yes.
Well, then we have to assume this is real.
Mm-hmm.
And the U.S. government does not negotiate with terrorists.
No, we don't, but... 14 hours and change.
I'm gonna need something to offer.
You'll have it.
And your word, Freddie.
If you want me to negotiate, then you have to let me negotiate.
Right, right... no force, no tactical.
Scout's honor.
- One other thing.
- Hmm?
I don't want the girl on this one.
Maxine is my second.
You and I used to be friends.
I still consider us friends, Freddie.
All right, all right, then listen to me on this one.
Look, I know you feel responsible for Jessica Ford's death at Shiloh.
But hiring her daughter, you don't see that as a mistake.
This was a targeted assassination, timed to occur at precisely the moment
Maxine was with Nash.
Why would they do that?
I don't know.
Yet.
My team.
My way.
- Did you reach Maxine?
- Yeah.
Yeah, she is shaken, blaming herself.
Should she?
I mean, she followed protocol.
So what happened?
Well, that's them now.
Hey, Max.
- Hey.
- Hang in there.
I'll be fine once we stop this guy.
Well, Krank left no e-mail address, no phone number.
We've got 14 hours and no way to contact him.
There's someone else we can talk to.
The electromagnetic pulse that Krank used to make that phone explode was written in a complex programming language called "Coma."
So complex, only a handful of people know how to write it.
It was developed by a professor at Chicago Tech in the early '90s.
Damien Delaine.
Damien Delaine?
Isn't he serving 17 years for the massacre at Shiloh?
Was.
Paroled for good behavior last week.
Oh.
Last week?
So, he was still in prison when Agent Nash originally received the threat.
Okay, only a handful of people in the world know how to read this computer language.
If Damien Delaine's not behind this attack, he might know who is.
All right, talk to him.
All right.
Okay.
You okay?
Talking about Delaine must bring back strong emotions for you, considering his involvement in your mother's death.
It does for me.
I can handle it.
_
Do you think what I'm thinking?
Six months ago,
Maxine Carlson appears in our lives.
And suddenly, we get a case involving Damien Delaine, the man who's responsible for her mother's death who Eric hasn't seen or spoken to in 17 years.
Damien Delaine convinced some 50-some odd people at Shiloh that suicide was a better option than living.
Get your game face on.
And remember, we need his help.
I'm Zara Hallam.
This is my colleague, Oliver Yates.
Thank you for agreeing to come in.
I was so grateful to receive this call.
17 years in prison, that's a long time.
How does it feel to be on the outside?
17 years gives you a lot of sleepless hours to think about the people that lost their lives, the families that I tore apart.
Now you're rehabilitated?
I was wrong.
I thought I had a cause.
I thought... many things, misguided things.
So, please, if there's any small way I can help you with your case, you have no idea how much that would mean to me.
And you bear no ill will against Eric Beaumont?
Eric Beaumont is a manipulator and a hypocrite who bears as much responsibility as I do, if not more so, for the deaths at Shiloh.
We both consider Eric a mentor and a friend.
I've paid for my crimes, Miss Hallam.
Eric Beaumont has not, but that does not diminish my genuine desire to help you if I can.
A person calling themselves "Krank"
used these codes to blow up a cellphone and the man holding it.
Well, no wonder you can't read this.
This is Coma.
Can you help us identify the person who wrote it?
It has to be Victoria Locke.
She's a former student of mine.
British.
She'd be in her late 30s now.
How certain are you that it's her?
Well, Coma was Victoria's thesis.
Others could write simple programs, but to pull off what you described.
It can't be anyone else.
Nice theory.

Victoria Locke died in 2007.
People are asleep, walking around in daydreams while the rich get richer, and the government destructs us with consumerism as they watch our every move.
We let them control us.
Surveillance audio of Victoria Locke from her college days.
Anti-government rant, fits the profile.
But if she drowned in Malta in 2007, how can she be Krank?
And the timing of Victoria's death tallies with when Krank dropped off the bureau's radar.
So, what?
She came back from the dead?
Maybe.
Maybe?
Damien Delaine's the ultimate manipulator.
Each move seems random and disconnected.
Until it doesn't.
He was in prison until a week ago.
Could he really be behind this?
But I spoke to his prison officers.
His behavior was exemplary.
Not even caught with a cellphone, let alone a computer.
Still, one week out of prison, and this happens?
The timing is suspicious.
Maybe he gave us the name of a dead woman to throw us off the scent?
All right, get our techs to compare Krank's threats with our hack-tivists operating the last 10 years.
Let's see if we can find a match.
Right away.
Excuse me.
Yeah.
Maxine?
Sorry, am I interrupting?
No, it's okay.
Listen, um a man died in your arms yesterday.
No one would think any less of you if... if you wanted to sit this one out.
I'm fine.
Really.
But thank you for asking.
Okay, our techs found something.
They're sending it through right now.
Okay.
What are we looking at?
Online posts from someone calling themselves "Tech Girl."
Tech Girl?
Victoria Locke went to Chicago Institute of Technology.
Her posts bear a remarkable similarity to Krank's.
What kind of similarities?
Vocabulary, syntax, subject matter.
Plus, Tech Girl appears to have come into existence shortly after Victoria Locke drowned in 2007.
Or is said to have drowned.
Faked her own death and went underground.
So, she's alive, and Damien Delaine's intel was helpful.
So it appears, yeah.
Can you pull a cellphone number for Tech Girl?
Yeah, I'm working on it.
Oh, and I need something to negotiate with.
The NSA has authorized the release of certain packets of classified intel for leverage purposes.
Packets containing...?
Above my pay grade.
Bingo.
Got a contact number.
All right, well, let's roll the dice.
This better work.
We've got 10 hours left.
Hello?
Am I speaking with Tech Girl?
My name is Eric Beaumont.
I'm a negotiator.
Am I right in presuming you are Victoria Locke, a.k.a., Krank?
Darling, I'll be whoever you want me to be.
Waveform is a match.
I'll try to track her location.
Victoria, I want you to know that I'm authorized by the U.S. government to negotiate a deal with you.
Negotiate what?
I have all the power.
And you want access to classified government data.
What do you plan to do with it?
Release it to the world.
People need to know the truth... how they're using terrorism as an excuse to spy on all of us.
Well, wouldn't it hurt the people if terrorists were able to read the U.S. government's classified files?
Tell me, Eric, do you know how many of the machines that power our lives are run by computer?
Most of them.
So you'll know to give me what I want, or I will start by taking down a few hospitals, an airport, and maybe I'll wipe out part of the Eastern seaboard.
Here's the thing I don't get.
You're brilliant enough to create this virus, but you need my help to access the government's secrets?
The government use quantum encryption to protect their secrets... completely unhackable, even to me.
So why target ordinary people?
Why not attack the government?
This precisely is an attack on the government.
For these people, these sheep, for them to realize they're being oppressed, the only thing is to spill their blood.
The revolution will not begin until we hit the reset button, and that's where we're going... a revolution, a total collapse of authority.
Please trust me, I'm gonna do everything I can to get you what you need.
Access codes by midnight, or the bodies start piling up.
I wasn't able to track her location.
Shouldn't the FBI get Damien Delaine to start working on a way to block her attack?
Well, Woods is working on it.
He doesn't need Delaine on this.
But they don't know this programming language, and they don't know her.
He does.
Look at Victoria's profile.
She's A-1 critical, total conviction to the cause, comfortable with substantial loss of life, slight hysteria, possibly not sane of mind.
Your point?
She's not gonna budge, Eric.
Not in 10 hours, and you know it.
We need Delaine to give us another way out.
She's right.
Delaine's an asset we can't afford to lose.
Delaine is not what he seems, Freddie.
We both know that.
And without him, we wouldn't have had our lead to Victoria Locke.
This is a game, and we are playing by his rules.
Eric, I despise the son of a bitch as much as you do, but within 10 hours, she's gonna start killing people.
[Computer beeps
They've given Delaine a high-speed computer.
He's working on a way to counteract the virus.
Victoria, it's Eric.
Do you have what I need?
Sir, the techs have been able to use
Beaumont's communication to pinpoint Victoria Locke's location.
South D.C. Tactical Unit's ready to take her out.
I told Eric Beaumont
I'd give him time to negotiate.
Sir, with 10 hours left,
I don't think anyone expects you to hold to that promise.
I don't have those access codes, but I do have a gift.
What's the gift?
And she's on the hook.
A terabyte of classified information.
It's a show of good faith, Victoria, while I work on getting you the rest.
And here I was thinking you wanted me to trust you.
I absolutely do.
You people forget surveillance works both ways.
What the hell just happened?
She's watching us.
Not us.
Let me see.
Son of a...
Freddie?
!
Eric!
Freddie, I'm gonna get you out of there!
What's wrong with the elevator?
Aah.
Somebody get an engineer!
Son of a bitch.
Right this way, right this way.
Can you move aside, please?
We got get through here, okay?
I got him.
I got him right here.
I got it all clear.
Eric?
Government techs have confirmed it.
The same code that blew Nash's phone took over the elevator.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
We grew apart... but he was my mentor.
He was my friend.
This isn't easy for us, uh, to say, but we both feel that you should recuse yourself.
- I can't.
- Why?
Because you think Damien Delaine's behind this?
He's behind everything.
Killing Nash in front of Maxine, programming language leading us right to him, and now Woods's death.
Eric, Victoria Locke killed Woods.
She's not even trying to hide it.
I am telling you this is Delaine.
Eric, we don't trust him, either, but you're too close to this.
Maybe.
But I'm not leaving.
It's Victoria.
_
_
Face to face... that's progress, right?
It's a trap.
Yeah, it sure is.
Look, if you go, we all go.
You saw what she said.
Alone.
I'll check in when I get there.
The feds are gonna want to find me so they can take her out.
Make sure they don't.
Eric!
Eric, I have to tell you something.
No time, Maxine.
I've been in contact with Damien Delaine.
I know I should have told you, and you have every right to fire me.
How long?
He started writing me letters and texts about a year ago.
I ignored them at first, but...
But I wanted him to tell me more about my mom, and not just the sugar-coated version my aunt fed me.
What?
You're not angry with me?
What?
You think I didn't know?
From the moment I hired you.
You knew.
I know Delaine.
He's been using you to get to me from the start.
Because you arrested him?
Eric, that was 17 years ago.
I know you feel responsible for my mother's death, but...
I am responsible.
Freddie Woods launched that assault.
All those people died before you went in to negotiate.
What I'm about to tell you is not in the public record, because I made sure of it.
I did enter to negotiate.
There were dead bodies everywhere.
Delaine saw me but kept right on walking.
And then I saw her.
I saw your mother.
I saw Jessica...
Now we are calm.
Now we are ready.
This is what we talked about.
Jessica?
I want you to turn on the switch.
...Wearing a suicide vest.
A suicide vest?
Delaine was right behind her.
I pleaded with her to surrender for the sake of the men, women, and children still alive inside the compound, but she said he was in her head.
She couldn't get him out.
Please, Jessica, don't do this.
She didn't want to die.
She loved you so much, Maxine.
I had Freddie in my ear, ordering me to take the shot.
Jessica had Delaine in hers, telling her she had to press the button.
Push that button.
I couldn't reach her.
I tried and I failed.
Push the button.
Jessica.
You shot her?
I didn't want you growing up thinking your mother was a bad person.
She wasn't.
But Damien Delaine wanted to become a martyr that day, and he will never forgive me.
Never.
Mr. Delaine, tell me something good.
I'm working on a way to stop Victoria.
In truth, the code she's written is beautifully simple.
A couple of nuts left to crack.
Six hours, maybe.
You have four.
Maxine.
Hi, Damien.
How wonderful to finally see your face.
You two know each other?
Eric told me everything.
Has this all been about using me to get to him?
My dear...
I will wager that Eric did not, in fact, tell you everything.
But right now, I have work to do.
What didn't he tell me?
Given he's a type-A control freak with a narcissistic personality disorder,
I'm sure he didn't mention the strings he's pulled all your life.
What strings?
The insurance payout from Jessica's death, the scholarship to Northwestern.
- You don't have to listen to this.
- Yes, I do.
Why would he do that?
Because he was in love with your mother, of course.
What?
He's lying.
Check my waveform, Mr. Yates.
You will see that I am not.
Eric and Jessica had an affair for years, way before I met her.
Okay, we're hanging up now.
Do it, if the truth offends you.
The real reason Eric shot your mother is because she left him... for me.
- Can we track Eric's location?
- Yeah.
Then let's go.
- What about Delaine?
- I'm not waiting for him.
All right, I just lost Eric's signal about 20 miles outside Bethesda.
Where do you think she's led him?
If she's planning on going through this,
- it could be a data bunker.
- A data bunker?
Where critical infrastructure is controlled?
She'd need direct access.
Yeah, it's not the kind of place you find on a map.
And it would be protected, wouldn't it?
She wouldn't be able to get past the armed guards.
Well, maybe she could.
Don't worry.
I've returned the carbon monoxide levels to normal.
Have you got my codes?
I don't think that's really what you need.
Please, stay back.
Give me what I want, or I will do it.
Traffic signals Life-support systems...
Air traffic control.
The whole country will come crashing down in blood and chaos.
You do not want to do this.
You're wrong.
One more step, and I will prove it.
You swore you would never pick up a gun again after you killed Jessica Ford.
You want me to pick up the gun, is that it?
And what would you do to save all these lives, Eric?
Take mine?
Okay.
What do the FBI say?
- Any update on Delaine?
- Not exactly.
He's disappeared.
What do you mean "disappeared"?
The FBI went to track his progress.
He's vanished.
So now we have no way of stopping Krank.
This was never about stopping Krank or government secrets.
I think Delaine's been controlling Victoria, perhaps ever since he was her professor, probably even arranged the faking of her death to one day activate her for this.
Eric was right.
This was about destroying him and me.
Maxine, you don't believe what Delaine was saying back there?
I believe everything he said.
Think about it.
If Delaine knew all that about me, then he also knew I studied Latin, that I would recognize that phrase yesterday morning, just too late to save that man from dying.
Why would he want that?
To shake her faith in Eric and herself, get her to turn against him.
This is where Eric's cellphone signal cut out.
- I'm going in.
You should call the FBI.
- No.
We're going with you.
Victoria, I do not want to shoot you.
You don't have a choice.
Delaine has gotten into your head, just like he got into Jessica's, but you do not have to die.
An awful lot of people will unless I do.
Damn it.
Please, stop.
I can't do that, Eric, but you can.
Eric, wait.
It's true, isn't it?
You were in love with my mother.
Yes, I was.
But that's not why you shot her.
Victoria, stop.
This is not the time for this conversation, Maxine.
He's right, Maxine.
This is ready to go.
In just a few seconds, tens of thousands of people will die.
She's wrong, Eric.
Oh, is it Delaine's fix?
He's disappeared.
Because she can't do what she thinks she can do.
She blew up that cellphone, sent Freddie Woods plunging to his death.
Designed by Delaine to make you believe, to make all of us believe, the virus could infiltrate any system.
It was all a bluff.
You don't know that.
You said it yourself.
Damien Delaine is a game player.
This has all been part of his game.
To re-create Shiloh, to take revenge by pushing you to do the one thing you swore you would never do.
The only thing he didn't count on was us.
Put the gun down, Eric.
Nothing will happen.
And if you're wrong?
Then we are all wrong together.
Eric, if you're looking for forgiveness for my mother's death, you have it.
I know you didn't have a choice.
But you do now.
Time's up.
Eric, please.
Eric, please.
Say good night.
No.
I'm...
No.
No!
No!
- No.
- It's over, Victoria.
No!
No, no, no, no, no.
this can't be happening!
- Wait!
No, no.
- It's okay.
No, no!
No.
Ugh.
She'll face charges for the deaths of Nash,
Freddie Woods, and everyone she killed here.
How you doing?
You were right.
Emotions are dangerous.
Well, one thing I wasn't right about was, uh... you.
Maxine, you belong on this team.
I'm not so sure about that.
I kept this picture of your mother in my wallet for 17 years.
I think you should have it now.
All the doors that opened in my life... nothing is what I thought.
I didn't open any doors you couldn't walk through on your own.
I just had to make sure you were okay.
Out of guilt?
No.
Out of love.
Your mother couldn't take care of you, so I did.
I always knew one day, the door you'd walk through would be mine.
I don't think I can stay here anymore.
This isn't over, Maxine.
It is over.
You didn't pull the trigger.
Delaine lost.
He's not gonna accept defeat.
He will keep after me, and you, until he's destroyed us both.
- Nathalie?
- Eric.
Nathalie, what's wrong?
Oh, I put Evie on the plane back to Montreal myself, Eric.
The driver's waiting at Arrivals.
She never showed.
I've been calling and calling.
I know something's wrong, Eric.
I know it.
So...
Eric, answer me.
Eric.
What is it?
Answer me.
Eric, what's happening?
Delaine's taken my daughter.
We'll make a little breakfast
With freshly roasted snipe
Train to Vestli via Tøyen.
Sit down
We'll make a little breakfast
I can't believe you know the lyrics.
Our midday wine
Shall we from our glasses pour
- Anything I can do?
- You can pour some wine.
Did you cut yourself?
No.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Could you take over?
You want me to cook?
Are you sure?
Maybe it's time you learnt.
Vilma!
- He...
Let him treat me.
- I'll take over.
I'm a doctor.
Vilma?
What's happening to you?
- This isn't your fault.
- Vilma.
Shall I help you slide it into place?
- Thanks.
- There.
We have to start from scratch.
How about a break?
I can take over.
You don't know what to do.
No.
Sorry.
That came out wrong.
The infection is getting worse.
I have to keep going.
I can do this.
I can turn it around.
Yes.
Breathe.
Damn it.
Can't you just give her a hint that I'm alive?
- No, I can't.
- Why not?
Marit won't talk.
If she finds out you're alive, she'll have to lie.
You don't want that.
These guys know how to ask questions, and they'll ask plenty for 62 million.
At least give her some money.
You can trust her to keep quiet.
Nothing happens until it's been laundered.
OK, let's do it.
Let's launder it.
- You said you knew how.
- Yes.
- Don't you know how?
- This is more complicated than usual.
- Christ, can you do it or not?
- OK, this is how you launder money:
you set up a massage parlour or tattoo studio.
People pay cash.
The product's untraceable.
You pour away some ink, say you've been really busy tattooing hipsters.
You put the money in a bank account, pay tax.
- Now you've got loads of clean money.
- Then let's do it!
The catch is, this only works if the money is in used notes.
You grabbed shitloads of money straight off the press.
It will always be linked to the heist.
Every note has your name on it.
If you spend a single one on a coke, the police will know you're alive.
And where to start looking for you.
- You mean all this cash is worthless?
- Yes.
Right now, it is.
The guys you worked with probably had detailed plans.
Offshore banks, middlemen.
We don't have that.
- Maybe we should google it?
- Google it?
You want to get nicked?
Goddamn fucking...!
What the hell can I do?
Marit's all alone.
I've fucked up everything.
You have to listen to me.
Listen.
Marit isn't stupid.
As long as the cops and thugs keep asking about you, she knows you're alive.
When they stop asking, she can start worrying.
And then, not before, I'll be there with the info.
Hello?
Ravn?
Ravn, it's Unn.
I know what you've done.
I've been suspended.
The police are involved.
I haven't said anything.
But I won't lie for you unless you give me some explanation.
Call me back.
This is the sixth time I've called.
Again.
You've heard it three times.
It isn't going to change.
This is not good.
- Surname?
- Vikebø.
- She's called you six times.
- What could I say to her?
She'll talk to the cops, Ravn.
They'll find us!
Get it?
Unn won't talk.
I know her.
Vilma did too.
Unn won't talk if she knows the reason.
I need her help with Vilma.
She's not coming to see your wife.
She'll keep quiet.
I'll talk to her.
- She doesn't know you!
- Stay put.
Don't answer if she calls.
Leif!
You're not going to hurt her, are you?
Of course not.
Trust me.
42, 43, 44...
What are you doing?
- Can I borrow it?
- No.
- Why not?
- It's mine.
I'm using it.
- Not right now.
- Yes, I am.
- You've got another one here.
- Yeah.
- I'm busy.
Working.
- You're working in there.
Yes, but I'm working out here as well.
You work in there.
I'll work on this.
In an hour it'll be back.
In perfect order.
Please?
Right, I'm from the police.
- Are you Unn Vikebø?
- Yes.
It's about the equipment stolen from the hospital.
- I've already given you a statement.
- There's new info I need to check.
- Now?
- Yes.
We can do it here or at the station.
You choose.
- Could you wait here a moment?
- Sure.
It's a police officer, he has some questions about the stolen equipment.
Just go ahead, and I'll catch you later.
See you there.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Coffee?
- No thanks.
- It's fresh.
- I'm good, thanks.
Call me when you're done.
- OK, see you.
- I can hardly wait.
- Bye.
- Goodbye.
Who's he?
- His name is Knut.
- Knut...?
Austbø.
Why do you ask?
- And you're married?
- No.
- But he lives here?
- Just visiting.
- So you live alone here?
No children?
- No.
Is that what you want to know?
You were the physician on duty at the neurophysiology lab on August 8th.
You were in charge of security, equipment and personnel.
I was supervising three researchers.
None of them took the equipment.
Might this equipment be of interest... to anyone outside the hospital?
- Not that I know of.
- So you think it's an inside job?
I wouldn't know.
Someone may have borrowed it and forgotten to register it.
Well, so far you're the only suspect in this case.
- "Suspect"?
- You're suspended.
Aren't you?
Yes.
According to the log, you accessed the laboratory with your key card at 6.58pm. Is that correct?
- Probably.
I wouldn't know.
- Were you with someone?
No.
Nobody came to see you and said they wanted access?
And your key card?
Where is it now?
I don't know.
I can't find it.
It's extremely important that you don't lie to me now.
- That you tell me all you know.
- Yes.
I think I've got everything I need.
Thank you for your patience.
What's your name?
May I have your name?
Right.
You know, there's one last thing.
You don't have to...
I need your phone.
- Why?
- Standard procedure.
You're not calling anyone.
Give it to me.
Do as you're told.
- No.
- Give me the phone.
Cut it out.
Take it easy.
Give me the phone.
- Take it easy.
Take it easy!
- Let go of me!
Take it easy.
You want to talk to Ravn?
Do you?
- You want to talk to Ravn?
- Yes.
OK, then calm down and do as I say.
Central to S4.
That vehicle we tracked down for you, how do we log it?
Thanks for helping out.
Turned out to be a dead end,
- so you don't have to log it.
Over.
- Understood.
Let go!
I can walk.
- Come on.
- In there?
Why?
Don't!
I can walk.
Where are we going?
Ouch, damn it.
Take it easy!
Bloody idiot.
- Hey!
Let me out!
- It didn't go too well.
- Let me out, damn it!
Don't touch me!
- Calm down, will you?
Nice and easy.
Right.
In here.
- Hi, Unn.
- Ravn?
- Keep walking.
- What's going on?
What are you doing?
- I can explain.
- Where are we?
And who the hell is he?
- Relax, he's not a cop.
- Yes, I got that.
She's kept quiet.
- But it's a volatile situation.
- Who's volatile, you sick fuck?
- Don't talk to me.
Talk to him.
- Unn?
Unn!
I need to show you something.
- You did it.
- Yes.
But...
It didn't work.
- She's alive, though.
- Yes.
I'm sorry.
I need help.
- How long has she been like this?
- 6 months, 16 days and 4 hours.
She made sure I didn't know too much about what she was doing.
Why?
She wanted to make sure... that it couldn't be traced to me.
That I couldn't be held responsible.
After the committee said no,
Vilma planned to find a way to produce the serum outside the hospital.
I followed her instructions.
Got hold of the equipment.
She was sure she'd succeed in making the cure.
She thought the end would justify the means.
Sounds like her.
I didn't have the background to understand it all anyway.
It was her area of expertise.
So we gathered everything and went out to the cabin.
Vilma thought it was the best place to carry out the plan.
We could work in peace.
She knew she only had this one chance left.
You don't have to do it.
But if this is our last...
I don't want this to be our last night together.
If I don't try this now...
I'll die anyway.
You know that.
Vilma?
Vilma...
Vilma!
Vilma.
No!
I just don't know what went wrong.
But she's alive.
Dear Ravn.
If you're reading this, it didn't go as we hoped.
I can no longer take care of myself.
Remember that this was my own choice.
You know what you have to do.
Don't be afraid.
We'll meet again someday.
I love you.
Vilma.
Yes, hi.
It's Ravn.
Ravn Eikanger.
Your doctor.
Don't worry, you're not ill.
Could you help me with something?
Yes, sort of a favour.
Where can we meet?
When Vilma died, I thought you must have helped her.
She couldn't have done it alone.
I would have done the same.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing much.
Working.
- Is that Ravn's?
- He lent it to me.
- Bullshit.
- It's true.
- Are you online?
- No.
- Emailing Marit, are you?
- Of course not.
I'm not stupid.
- Then what is it?
- Nothing.
- It's mine.
- Show me!
Don't break it.
We have a deal based on trust.
That's not what I'm feeling now.
I've told you not to keep any secrets from me down here.
You've screwed up.
I can't trust you any more.
I'll show you.
You'll understand.
I promise.
This is the basic outline.
The door is blast-proof.
If it's under the house, it can withstand three megatons.
It has double steel plates and a filter valve...
- Where did you learn all this?
- It's easy.
Lots of YouTube videos about it.
So you've got beds for four people.
Separate disinfectant airlock.
Quarantine.
Solar panels.
Air intakes here with carbon and bag filters.
Here...
- So you did all this on your own?
- Yes, check it out.
I filter the water using osmosis and boil it, so everything's reused.
If there's no risk of contamination, I can pipe water from the nearby river.
- So you know where to build it?
- My uncle owns a field he never uses.
It's 20 minutes from the city outside rush hour.
- Is there enough space?
- That's the problem.
There's not enough space for all the rooms.
Yes, never enough space.
You've done the numbers?
About three million all in all, including equipment and materials.
I was going to build it myself with my share of the heist.
- Move over.
- It would cover everything.
Right.
But you're stuck with 62 million you can't use.
I had an idea for a room.
For weapons, ammo, tools, gas masks, protective suits.
I need storage space for food for four people for 8 months.
Depending on what's doable, but it's a reasonable amount.
- Come.
Come here.
- And Marit...
Wow!
What?
Shit, man!
I got the idea from your article on solar flares.
At least that's when I woke up to the facts.
People don't realise how little it takes.
Many do.
Everyone's read your article.
731 people have read it.
That's not "everyone".
What you need is a dry, safe place, preferably underground.
Where nobody will find you.
You need access to water, power, ventilation and equipment.
And it has to be huge.
- Holy shit!
Are you kidding?
- Go ahead.
Seriously?
Yes!
- Ouch!
- Are you OK?
I'm all right.
Shit.
What is it?
No, it's just some...
She's barely alive.
She's on a cocktail of cortisone, interferons, painkillers and antibiotics to keep infections down.
- What about brain activity?
- Oh yes, she's in there somewhere.
It was probably the serum she took that induced the coma.
So the cure worked?
Could it have affected her brainstem?
She was worried about neurological damage.
Constantly fighting it.
Look.
She's losing myelin from her nerve pathways, impeding vital functions.
Proving the hospital got the diagnosis wrong.
Show me your work.
I started with her theories to see if she may have overlooked something.
Eliminating or verifying each step.
- Using these as test animals?
- Plenty of rats down here.
They eat all kinds of crap, so I get the best results when I find newborns.
I've bred some of them.
This one, for example.
My work here gave me some answers, but I get lost working alone.
I need a fresh view on everything.
What'll you do if she wakes up?
- Yes?
- I need a word with you.
Yes, go on.
I need a word with you.
She's one of us now.
You can trust her.
Sure, but it...
It's about...
About that patient.
Are there others here?
What kind of patient?
You're a doctor, right?
A real doctor.
Yes.
You've sworn confidentiality.
This applies to all patients.
Whether they're in hospital, a clinic or anywhere else.
Yes.
Teo!
What happened?
I don't know.
He just started bleeding.
Well, some bleeding isn't unusual after you've broken your nose.
It'll be OK.
The swelling will go down in a week or so.
The black eye will take longer.
You're... that guy, Naustvik.
What's he doing here?
He's staying here until things calm down up there.
- He ran over a police officer!
- It was an accident.
- He's alive, right?
- Absolutely.
- We saved his life.
- Is that a problem?
He's a wanted man.
He stole a load of money and ran over a cop.
Shut up.
- How do I get out of here?
- That's not how it works.
- Let me out.
- I can't.
- What do you suggest?
Lock her up?
- Put on a uniform?
Arrest me again?
- I know where you live.
- Listen.
That's no way to win her trust.
I'll take care of it.
Drive her home.
We have to get Vilma out of there.
Lief brought you because I need help.
Vilma won't survive anywhere else.
I rely on him.
- But the guy's a nutcase!
- You don't know Leif or Teo.
What he's done or why.
I'll go to jail too, if we're caught.
Not if you save her.
But I can't do it alone.
Pull over here.
NO ADMITTANCE
Unn says hello.
She stopped by.
She was happy to see you.
I could tell.
She's brilliant.
Almost as good as you were... are.
She's a better researcher than me.
I think she can help us progress.
If she comes back.
But even without her, I won't give up.
Though sometimes I wish you could tell me what to do.
I can't find space for a room for oxygen, propane and compressed air.
I'm trying to work out whether to adjust it or start from scratch.
The bonus is that I don't have to pay for infrastructure and so on.
- But it'll be more expensive if...
- But you don't have any money.
I don't have to spend it all.
Just what I need down here.
We'll find a way.
I'll help you.
No problem.
- It's still just a prototype.
- Sure, but...
But for Marit, me and the kid, it's going to be a solid...
Damn it, it's Vikebø!
Vik...
Who?
Leif?
- What are you doing here?
- I figured out where it had to be.
- Are you alone?
No cops?
- No.
- You can't show up like this.
- I'm here to help Vilma.
You can't just turn up like this.
It won't do.
It's unacceptable.
- That's not how it works.
- Then how does it work?
I can learn the rules.
There are a couple of things we have to agree on first.
Vilma can stay here.
No problem.
Do as much research as you like.
I don't care what you do, and you don't ask me what I'm doing.
Agreed?
I'll provide security as long as I'm 100% sure that you'll keep quiet.
Most of all you, Vikebø.
- This is extremely important to me.
- OK.
You don't know me.
I only know you from what Ravn's told me.
I trust him.
But if you say anything to anyone... about anything you've seen down here...
Are you threatening me?
Yes.
I am.
And I'm not running a hotel down here.
In return for my hospitality, you'll do some odd jobs for me.
- What kind of jobs?
- Simple things you know how to do.
Patients that I bring.
You'll treat them in the clinic here.
- What kind of patients?
- People who avoid public healthcare.
- Why would they do that?
- Impossible to imagine, is it?
That people lose trust if they get the wrong diagnosis, wrong treatment.
Sick people who face arrogant, invasive questions.
Who want a say over their body.
Don't accept the prognosis.
Or don't want to die alone as unwanted expenditure.
People who distrust Western medicine.
Refuse to be groped by strangers who forget their names.
Refuse to support an out-of-control pharmaceutical industry that exploits the poor and makes money from patents it never produces.
Spreading disease is more profitable.
An industry that corrupts people's lives and health.
Some refuse to take part.
For some, the cure is too costly in the richest country in the world.
All this is completely unimaginable to you?
- No.
- There's another aspect here.
Some of these people will pay serious money.
Really serious.
Well, I never...
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Hey?
Where's my crucifix?
Sorry I didn't come to bed last night.
I wanted to get it done before we left.
Did you?
Till the re-write.
Wow.
Which means that for the next week,
I'm all yours.
Wait a second...
I don't hear any screaming.
Why don't I hear any screaming?
Our son decided he needs some extra beauty sleep, and Jane is training for the next moon landing.
Greta is great.
She is?
Come on, look at them.
Jane's crazy about her.
I mean, who wouldn't like her?
She's so... so blonde.
Is that jealousy I hear in your voice?
It's just an observation,
Mr. "Let's get a nanny because all my successful friends have one."
That reminds me,
Lyle's coming by to look at the furnace.
Oh, Lyle again.
Can we get an authorized repair person for once?
You're the one who's obsessed with saving money.
- Hmm?
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
You are one great astronaut, you know that?
Thanks, Greta!
Aw...
Hey.
Thanks for coming.
It's, uh, furnace problems again?
Yeah, I think it might be a gas supply.
Here's a key.
Take a look, let me know what you think.
Yeah, sure thing.
I'll, uh, send you an estimate.
Great.
We'll be back Sunday.
Sunday.
All right.
This one's gonna be a bestseller, I can feel it.
You're gonna be the next Stephen King.
Just... don't let it out of your sight, okay?
If it gets into the wrong hands, my publisher will...
Well, to use a five-dollar word, she'll be very vexed.
Madam, you are impugning my professional discretion.
Never.
You know how much I appreciate your feedback, Teddy.
The pleasure's all mine.
You're the last decent writer I ever taught.
I swear, half my students should be sent back to remedial English.
Hi, Ted.
Hey, Mark.
How's the startup game?
Can't complain.
Managing a couple of hedge funds.
I got some big investors on the line.
That's what this trip is all about, reelin' 'em in.
Oh, sounds promising.
Tell me, has this protégée of mine made any new friends out there, or is she still the same sad loner you married?
Hey, I resent that remark.
All right.
Enough with the jokes, you guys better get going.
You heard the man.
All right, bye, Teddy.
Thanks again.
You're welcome.
I'll toast your success with a virgin Bloody Mary.
Make sure that wagon doesn't tip.
Said the preacher to the choir.
- Have a nice trip.
- Bye.
Okay, you need to call Brenda.
Uh-huh.
And did you make sure that the kids got all their stuff?
Of course.
Need a hand?
I'm good.
I finally get to be a full-time mom again.
My little guy is going to love that.
Huh?
Yeah.
Is that your wife I see?
Yes.
Hell has officially frozen over.
Thank you so much for looking after the house for us.
No problem.
I hope a week away is good for you two.
Well, I get to decompress, and Mark gets to schmooze with some of the biggest players in venture capital, so should be a win-win.
Mommy, what's venture capital?
Money, Janie.
Money makes the world go around.
I thought love made the world go around.
It does, honey.
It does.
Let's get you in the car, okay?
- Okay.
- Break a leg.
Thank you so much, Brenda.
Bye!
Drive safe.
There must be a mistake.
I was told parking was included.
Did you book using our website?
Actually, it was through your reservation agent.
Let me check with our manager.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
You should be.
Maybe you should take the kids upstairs, and I'll sort this out.
Yeah, good idea.
You need a hand?
No, we're good, I'll see you up there.
Come on, Jane.
Shh, shh, shh...
It's okay, it's okay...
Shh, shh, shh...
Shh, shh, shh...
Hungry little guy, huh?
Yeah.
Hungry and tired.
Aw, long car trip?
Yeah.
Oh, they're the worst.
Here, let me try something.
Please don't cry!
I do not want you to cry anymore!
Yes!
Please do cry!
Your tears make me stronger.
No, they do not, you stop it!
- No, you stop it.
- No, you do!
That's impressive.
You must have kids.
Just a niece and a nephew, yeah.
Well, I bet they like having such a cool uncle.
Thanks.
What's your name?
I'm Oscar.
What's your name?
Jane.
But my friends call me Janie.
Well, I would like to be your friend.
Would you like that?
Can I, Mommy?
Of course, honey.
Okay.
I'm Nomi Gardner.
Nomi?
Wait... that wouldn't be Nomi Gardner the crime writer, would it?
Actually, yeah.
A pleasure.
You've heard of Nomi?
Oh, absolutely.
I'm reading her latest book, Shattered, right now.
Well, that makes my day.
Yeah, great.
Uh, could you please take these, Oscar?
Yes, sir, right away.
Thank you.
Where's 303?
Uh, right down here, and on your right, sir.
I'll take your bags and follow you.
Brilliant.
Excellent work.
I like it.
You should go show Daddy.
Janie...
Daddy's working.
But we colored these for you.
Wow.
That is really good.
You are a talented artist.
You too, Greta.
Thank you.
Greta, where's the formula?
It should be in the change bag.
Well, it's not, and neither are the baby wipes.
Oh, no.
I am so sorry, Nomi,
I can't believe that I forgot both.
No problem.
I think there's a drugstore nearby.
Okay, I'll go.
No, it's okay.
Are you sure?
'Cause I'm the one that screwed up.
Relax.
Nobody's perfect.
Bye, Mommy!
Bye, honey.
Be good,
I'll be back in a minute.
Okay.
[gagging and gasping
Ma'am, can I help you?
Yes, you can call the police.
The police?
Is something wrong?
You could say that.
I'm afraid the Gardners aren't here.
What?
I said, the Gardners are out.
I don't have time for this.
Miss!
Mark!
Jane!
Miss March, you cannot go in there!
That's not my name!
You wanted the police?
Fine.
Let's go back downstairs and call them.
I just want to find out where my family is!
As I've told you twice before, the Gardners are out.
Where?
At the convention, and they made it very clear to me that after the incident last night, your services are no longer required.
What are you talking about?
What incident?
Mark?
Greta?
What are you doing here?
That's not funny, and I could ask you the same question.
I have nothing to say to you.
Damn it, Mark, somebody just tried to kill me.
Where are the kids?
You touch me again, I'll call the police.
Mark... please, just tell me what's going on.
Where are Jane and Aiden?
They're fine.
Their new nanny is looking after them.
You...
Look, I don't know what you think you're doing here, but I thought I made it very clear to you last night that I never want you coming near my family again.
Your family?
So, are you going to leave, or do I have to get Security to throw you out?
Is this some kind of joke?
Some kind of sick prank or something?
What...
If you think I'm going to go along with this, then you're insane.
I could have died.
Boys?
This is the woman who assaulted me last night.
No, no...
No!
I can prove I'm Nomi Gardner!
Really?
And just how are you going to do that?
I'm Nomi Gardner.
My wallet.
My I.D.'s in my wallet.
Are we all on the same page now?
Good.
This is impossible.
No...
Mark?
Mark, say something!
Mark!
Say something!
Mark!
It's... identity theft.
I don't know what else to call it.
There must be family that can vouch for you.
I'm an only child.
My parents died years ago.
And your close friends?
I'm not very social.
I hate crowds.
Since we moved here, I've literally been a hermit.
And you've had no interactions with anyone in your neighborhood?
The nanny... we hired her when we moved to Olympia.
She takes Jane to kindergarten.
She gets the groceries...
She does everything.
I want to press charges, Officer.
Do you know anything about this?
Um...
"They can both rot in hell"?
"I just wish I could be in the room when their kids find out I'm dead?"
That was the last post.
Yesterday at 11:00 p.m.
I'd say whoever wrote that made their intentions pretty clear.
It wasn't me.
I don't use social media.
Greta March does.
I'm not Greta March.
Well, then we have a problem, because everything I've been able to access says otherwise.
They must have hacked my accounts.
Every website?
Every photograph?
Well, it wouldn't be that hard.
I have almost nothing of me online.
I... just find this all very hard to believe.
Mark, my husband, he has been involved in a bunch of tech start-ups.
He knows a lot of people in the computer industry, smart people that he must have hired to do this.
Okay, I'm just being devil's advocate here, okay?
Can I get you something to drink?
Yeah.
Okay.
Oh, God.
I gotta ask... you know how crazy this sounds, right?
Uh-huh.
What's his motive?
What does he stand to gain by going to all this trouble to switch your identities?
I don't know.
Unless there's money involved.
Is there money involved?
My books have barely sold enough to cover the advance.
What about him?
What does he stand to lose?
Nothing.
His last three companies have crashed and burned.
We only moved to Olympia because Boston was getting too expensive, and I kept telling him not to get a nanny, because we can't afford it, and he insisted.
Now I know why.
Look, all I can do right now is file a report, but if it turns out to be false, you could be charged with a felony.
Are you absolutely sure you want to do this?
Yes.
Please.
Okay.
I'll be right back.
Detective Krantz?
My name's Donovan Harris.
I know who you are, Counselor.
What can I do for you?
I've been retained by Mark and Nomi Gardner.
This is a restraining order against a former employee of the family.
Let me guess, Greta March?
My clients have employed Miss March as a nanny for the past six months, however, recently, they've become concerned with a decline in her performance.
The assault on Mrs. Gardner last night was the final straw.
Now, they believe that Greta here is clearly a danger to herself and to others.
Now, they won't press charges if they don't have to, but they do not want an unhinged, and possibly suicidal woman anywhere near their children ever again.
A DNA test.
Excuse me?
That'll prove the kids are mine.
I'm sorry, which part of "ever again"
was unclear to you, Miss March?
I still want to file that report, Detective.
Are you listening to me?
This is the name of a good therapist.
Call her.
She'll be able to help you.
If you won't do your job, then I'll find someone else around here who will.
Unless you want to end up in jail,
I suggest that you go home now and get your head on straight.
And for your own good, stay far, far away from the Gardners.
Come on, come on, pick up.
Hello?
Ted.
Nomi, hey.
I'm still reading, but listen, so far, I've gotta say, you're knocking it out of the park.
This is not about that.
So, to what do I owe the pleasure?
I have a big, big favor to ask you.
I need you to come to Seattle.
What?
Why?
Uh...
It's about Mark and the kids.
Jesus, now you're scaring me.
Yeah, you're not the only one.
All right, I'm sitting down, so tell me what happened.
Okay, um...
I know it sounds really crazy, and it's, uh, short notice, but I need you to vouch for me.
Vouch for you?
What...
I don't get it.
Ted...
I...
It's really important.
Yes or no.
Um...
I'm gonna have to scramble around, get someone to cover my classes, but yes, of course.
If it's that important to you, whatever you need, Nomi.
Okay.
Thank you so much.
Uh, come to the North Precinct police station tomorrow morning, and ask for Detective Krantz.
Krantz, okay.
Uh, sure.
But Nomi... what the hell is going on?
You're the best, Ted.
Really.
I owe you one.
How did it go?
The restraining order has been delivered.
I don't foresee any more issues.
Thanks, Donovan.
We'll touch base tomorrow.
So... how did it go?
Our alibi is in the bag.
That's a relief.
Now you can just focus on us.
Daddy?
I don't like it here.
When can we go home?
Soon, honey.
Very soon.
Trust me, you're going to love this park.
Can I go on the swings?
The swings?
Of course, you can go on the swings.
Jane... how come you don't like your new Mommy?
I just don't.
Why do I have to call her that?
Because your old Mommy is sick, and I know you love her, and you miss her, but if you ever see her, you can't talk to her.
Why?
It's hard to explain.
You just can't.
She's... dangerous.
Want to go on the slide?
Yeah!
All right.
You see, your old mommy can hurt you and your brother because she's sick.
I'm counting on you, Jane.
You understand?
I think so.
Good.
And if you're in trouble, if someone like your old mommy, tries to take you and Aiden, what do you do?
Find a police officer?
That's right.
Find a police officer or call 911.
Remember, I love you.
Let's go, let's get out of here.
Hi, Mrs. G.
Lyle?
If you scream, you're going to have to learn to make do with one kidney.
You're helping them.
What's going on?
Why are they doing this to me?
Get in.
Now what?
Yeah, we'll do lots of great stuff.
One second.
All right, we've got to hurry, baby.
Come on.
Son of a bitch.
What's going on?
I got a text from Lyle.
He said to meet him here.
Me too.
Just one second, sweetie.
Hello?
We got a problem.
What happened?
I saw her at the park, alone.
I thought I could take her.
And instead she got your phone, and now she knows everything.
I'm just cleaning up after your mess.
Besides, I took care of that other thing, didn't I?
I can fix this.
Prove it.
Find her and shut her up.
Everything's fine.
We're going back to the hotel.
Come on.
Come on, everyone.
Janie!
Slow down.
Stay right here, okay?
It's okay, sweetie.
Mark, come look at this.
There's no one here.
There was.
Wonderful.
I spend all this money on hackers, and now they're going to catch us because I left this out.
Hey, no one's getting caught.
Jane...
I know that you're scared, but I also know that you're very brave.
That's what makes you such a great astronaut.
Give Mommy a hug.
See ya.
Oscar!
Oscar...
Hi.
Hi.
Uh, are you okay?
Yeah.
Uh...
Who am I?
Um... you're Nomi Gardner?
We need to talk.
Okay.
Right now?
Yeah.
It's important.
Okay.
Um... my car is over here.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
Okay, so wait, let me get this straight, you have a cousin in the U.K. who's loaded, and who just passed away, and even though you didn't know this person existed, he wills you his entire estate?
Not the whole thing, only five million U.S.
From what I can make out, the rest goes to charity.
Only five million.
Mark must have intercepted the first letter from the lawyer and never told me.
Now Brenda Johnson, my neighbor in Olympia is dead.
I can't believe they're willing to go this far.
So you think I'm next because I know you're the real Nomi Gardner.
No one else west of the Rockies can pick me out of a lineup.
Even my publisher doesn't know what I look like.
We do everything by email and phone.
This is crazy.
No kidding.
No, this is... really crazy.
Wait.
How do I know you weren't planning this when we met at the hotel?
What?
For all I know, you're the one pulling the scam, not them.
You want to know how?
This is how.
There's no author photo, I looked.
I know, I'm too humble for my own good, but that's not what I meant.
Just pick a page.
Uh...
Just start reading, anywhere.
Okay.
Um...
"She crossed the street at a run,
"driven by an impulse she could not contain..."
"The boulevards and alleyways were unusually empty.
"It was as if the city held its breath
"out of respect, or perhaps pity.
"She felt that if she came to a decision, this moment of peace would end."
Are you convinced yet, or should I keep going?
That was amazing.
Will you help me?
When's the last time you ate?
I'm not sure.
It's been a blur.
Okay, I'm going to feed you.
And you can also take a nap, if you like.
There's no time.
We have to go to the police, both of us.
And say what?
The truth.
With...
With you vouching for me, proof of these documents, and Ted coming in tomorrow, the police will have to listen to me.
And then
I can get a court order for a maternity test and I can get my kids back.
What was that?
Don't go out there.
Take it easy.
Not everything's a conspiracy.
Oscar?
Oscar?
It's fine!
Probably just the wind.
Somebody's been looking at things they should not be.
I'm surprised you didn't turn off my phone tracker.
Not too smart for a mystery writer.
Don't do this.
That money is legally mine.
Let me go, and you can name your price.
You're wasting your breath, lady.
I figure... this poor guy, he's just sitting down for dinner when some crazy woman breaks in, and she's got a bogus story about, uh... you know, somebody stole her life.
He asks her to leave, she wouldn't, so he has to defend himself.
What's so funny?
You haven't thought this through, have you?
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but they want both of us dead, yes?
Well... if he hits me with the bat, then how did I kill him?
And then there's the problem of the stun gun.
Unless the M.E. is really incompetent, then they're gonna find burn marks in my back.
How are you going to explain that?
You think you're pretty smart, huh?
I come up with this stuff for a living.
Not anymore.
Okay...
Here's the re-write.
You hit him with the bat, then he shot you with the stun gun, twice.
Your ticker couldn't handle the voltage.
Happened to a guy I knew in the joint.
You've been in prison.
Why am I not surprised?
I guess I can't appeal to your better nature.
You could if I had one.
Is he gone?
I think so.
Are you okay?
Uh... yeah.
You know, it's just another Saturday night.
Tell me it's done.
Not exactly.
"Not exactly"?
What the hell does that mean?
It means the bitch hit me with a bat, all right?
What the hell was she doing with a baseball bat?
No, wait, I don't even want to know that.
This is...
This is unbelievable.
It was two against one.
I mean, what did you expect me to do?
What am I paying you for?
No, scratch that.
Get back here, and make sure no one sees you.
What are you doing?
I'm cutting our losses.
We've just got to get through the next 24 hours, and that money is ours.
The longest 24 hours of my life.
I know, it won't be easy.
We'll be back home in our bed, and she'll be rotting away in a mental hospital.
And then our children will be back where they belong, with me.
Exactly.
It's okay, Aiden.
Our real mommy's going to come for us.
We need to call the police.
I already tried that.
Come on, they tried to kill us.
The cops can't ignore this now.
They did before.
You said you needed someone to back up your story.
Here I am.
Hey...
What did I say?
It's not you.
My husband's been sleeping with another woman for God knows how long, and he just sent someone to kill me.
Twice.
Nomi.
Hey.
I can't put you in danger.
What are you talking about?
They're willing to commit murder.
Do you really want to look over your shoulder for the rest of your life?
Oh, hey, I can take care of myself.
I need to leave.
Nomi, I can't let you do this.
You're going to have to.
Nomi...
No, Nomi, don't go.
Nomi...
This is the second time this month.
Sorry I'm late.
Is he here?
Yes.
Right this way, Miss...
Yeah.
Teddy...
I'm so glad to see you.
I thought I was here for Nomi.
Teddy... tell her it's me.
Are you saying this is not Nomi Gardner?
Look, I...
I'm a busy man, okay?
I...
I dropped everything to get on the redeye from Boston because she said it was an emergency,
I haven't had a wink of sleep, so I'd appreciate it if you'd quit wasting my time.
Oh, my God.
Not you, too.
Mr. Curtis, do you know this woman?
I've never seen her before in my life.
- Dammit!
- Miss March!
- Damn you for this!
- You need to calm down!
How much did they offer you?
A hundred grand?
Two?
It's a drop in the bucket, Teddy.
That's enough!
Let me tell you, they're ripping you off.
$5 million, that's how much is in the trust.
That's a lot of gin and tonics, Teddy.
Don't let them get you cheap, Teddy!
You can let go of me now.
Are you going to stay calm?
Yeah, I'm gonna stay calm.
You've been warned, you need to go home before you get yourself into more trouble, do you understand?
More trouble?
How am I gonna get in any more trouble?
There she is.
Detective, this woman has violated her restraining order.
Now, these are declarations from my clients stating that she broke into their hotel room yesterday and threatened their children.
That's not true.
Janie and Aiden were not there.
You see, this woman is clearly a menace.
Now we suggest that she be detained under Title 71 for her own protection.
You son of a bitch!
You leave me no choice.
Officers...
I am placing you under involuntary psychiatric detention for 72 hours.
Get a warrant, and search the hotel room.
You will find documents that prove my inheritance.
You will be evaluated at a county medical facility by a mental health professional.
You have the right to speak to your attorney during this time.
You can't do this!
No!
No!
No!
What's going on?
Where are they taking her?
That depends on what her shrink says about her mental state.
I'm sorry you had to come all this way for nothing.
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.
Mm-hmm.
There is only one thing I'm curious about, though.
You said that Nomi Gardner asked you to come.
But she didn't show.
Just Miss March did.
What's your point?
I have no point.
I just... found it strange, that's all.
It's a strange world.
I have no argument there.
Excuse me.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
It's done.
I want to speak to a lawyer right now.
Are you listening to me?
I have the right to speak to an attorney!
No...
No, please, no.
This is a mistake.
You can't do this to me!
Please, no... no!
No, no, no, no...
No!
Please...
My name is Nomi Gardner!
Please, please, please...
Hello?
Please, my kids need me.
Let me out!
Please... my kids!
Please...
Please... my kids need me!
Help me, help me!
Let me out!
Would you stop that?
You're making me nervous.
You're nervous?
I just arranged a murder and had my wife committed.
She's a vindictive schizophrenic and Brenda Johnson died in a freak accident.
Patience.
Refresh it again.
It's automatic.
Just humor me, please?
It's here.
Oh ye of little faith.
So... how does it feel to be a very rich man, Mr. Gardner?
You want to know how it feels, Mrs. Gardner?
I always knew my dreams would come true.
Damn, he has some lungs on him.
It's okay,
I'll take care of it.
After all, I am his mother.
You really love him, don't you?
Like he was my own.
Who is it?
The professor.
And what does he want?
Nomi?
Well, I'll be damned.
Love what you've done with your hair.
What do you want?
I just wanted to see your new place.
Nice neighborhood.
I'll bet the crime rate is really low.
And there's the man of the house.
Congratulations on your recent windfall, Mark, but hey, if anyone deserves it, you do.
Your money's on the way.
Well, that's wonderful news.
I am enjoying my stay.
It's a beautiful hotel you put me in.
Well, we're very appreciative.
Excellent, then I'm sure you won't mind adding another little zero to that hundred grand.
You're even more of a lush than I thought.
She's right.
You get what we agreed to, not a cent more.
Nomi...
The real Nomi...
She told me how much you two are making off this little scam, and I am not so old and miserable that I am gonna sell out a friend for table scraps.
Now, come on, Mark,
I don't think you're in any position to bargain here.
You don't want me going back to that police station and changing my story.
250.
500,000, not a cent less.
Fine.
Fine?
Just pay him and get him out of here.
Pleasure doing business with you.
I'll be the one in my hotel room checking my balance, and hey,
I think you should hurry up and act on this, because, uh, my flight to Bermuda leaves at 9:00 tonight.
My ex had a Chihuahua like that.
He bit me after I gave him a chew toy.
How would you like a raise?
It had to be done.
Even if we paid him, there's no guarantees he wouldn't be back.
Is everything okay down there?
Perfectly fine, sweetie.
I'll be up in a minute.
Next time you try to tie up a loose end, try not to do it in our front yard where the children can see.
Hey, a little reminder.
We just became millionaires today.
You're right.
Excuse me, Jane and Aiden need their mother.
Thank you, Ian.
Have a seat, Miss March.
I'd rather stand.
Suit yourself.
Do you understand why you're here?
I'm on a psych hold, what they'd call a 5150 in California, and you're the shrink who's supposed to decide just how crazy I am.
That's right, only we don't use the term "crazy" here.
How very enlightened of you.
In my first book, my protagonist ended up in a place like this.
I did my research, but I have to say, it's really different being on this side of the desk.
Ah, yes.
You believe you are a mystery writer named Nomi Gardner.
And when I prove that I'm right, you and a lot of other people are going to look very stupid.
Well, the last thing a man in my profession wants is to look stupid, so... why don't you prove it to me, right now.
I'd love to, but you and I both know that that's not going to happen.
Would you do me a favor?
Take a look in that mirror and tell me what you see.
That mirror?
Yes.
Please.
I see a woman who's lost everything.
Want to know what I see?
A woman who has everything to gain.
And all I have to do is pretend to be someone I'm not, right?
I don't want you to do anything you're not comfortable with.
Really?
Really.
I'm so glad to hear that.
Thank you.
And I'm sorry.
For what?
For this.
Ian!
No!
No!
No!
No...
No...
Well, the good news is I've finished my evaluation.
The bad news is
I think you're going to be with us for a lot longer than 72 hours.
No...
Hold still, Greta.
Hold still.
Please don't do this.
It's just a muscle relaxant.
We don't want you biting off your tongue, now, do we?
Take her to the ECT.
Let's see if we can get some electro-shock therapy to jog something loose.
Please...
This is a mistake.
I'm not...
Greta March.
I'm Nomi Gardner.
Nomi Gardner...
I'm not...
I'm not who you think I am.
I have...
I have two children.
They're in danger.
Just try and relax, Greta.
My...
My name's not Greta.
It's probably just a drill.
There was nothing scheduled.
I guess we'll have to pick this up later.
You...
They need your help in Ward C right away, some of the psychotics are refusing to leave.
What about her?
I've got her.
I'm not Greta.
My name is Nomi Gardner.
You have to believe me.
I do.
You do?
It's me.
Oh!
Oscar!
Can you walk?
I don't think so, they gave me something.
Well, we are just going to have to risk it.
Come on.
Okay.
I got you, I got you.
Okay, let's get out of here before someone realizes
I'm not qualified to practice medicine.
Okay.
How did you find me?
My sister is a dispatch officer.
She owed me a favor.
I thought I told you to stay out of it.
Can I be honest?
Yeah.
I think letting someone with your talent waste away in a mental hospital would be a crime against literature.
Okay.
This way.
Over here.
Hey!
What do you think you're doing?
Uh-oh.
That woman is my patient!
Where are you taking her?
Thank you!
Hey!
Stop!
Stop!
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Listen, I don't want to rain on your parade, but we're officially fugitives from justice now.
Got any ideas?
Only one.
Get my kids.
I thought you'd say that.
Honey?
Are you okay?
Oh, fine, just dropped something!
I'll be there in a minute.
Hey.
Honey... are you okay?
Daddy, the music is too loud.
I'm sorry.
Your mommy and I are having a little party.
I'll turn it down, okay?
She's not my mom!
Janie, don't say that.
You know that's not true.
Yes, it is!
Janie...
Janie, get back here!
You know, I was thinking of redecorating, but then I remembered we're not going be living here much longer.
No, we won't.
God... this just feels so good, you know?
All this stress just...
just melting away.
We really are living our dream, and pretty soon, you and I are going to be lounging on a beach in Costa Rica.
Little Aiden is going to be playing on my lap, while Janie is braiding my hair and talking about her first day at primary school.
What about me?
Oh, you will be thinking of all the wild and naughty things that I'll be doing to you while they're in bed.
Who is it?
It's Lyle.
Hey...
Here's to sand in my shorts and umbrellas in my drinks!
I will drink to that.
How did it go?
Easy.
He smelled like a distillery, so I rolled his car, lit it up.
Ooh...
The teacher had excellent taste in whiskey.
Does he have to be here?
Greta, we're all friends.
Actually one of us is an employee.
I prefer the term "business partner".
Yeah, well, your business is killing people, and we have two children upstairs asleep!
Greta...
I did what I was paid to do.
Yeah, and I don't want to constantly be reminded of that!
What do you expect me to do?
You want me to disappear into some gutter?
Hey, Lyle...
Lyle, she did not mean that.
Actually, I did!
Oh, so that's how it is, huh?
Yeah?
I'm supposed to clean up all of your messes while you sit here, and you play house with your two little runts?
I'm not playing house!
9-1-1, what is your emergency?
Hello?
I need a police officer.
Okay.
What's your name?
These are my children!
This is my husband!
Don't you dare ever question my commitment to this family again!
Listen... both of you.
We have a really good thing going here, so settle down.
Now look what you've done.
Shh, shh, shh, shh...
Oh, sweetheart, don't cry, Mommy's here.
Hi, sweetie!
Aw... are you hungry?
Oh, yes, you must be so hungry, because Mommy hasn't been feeding you, has she?
Let me find your bottle, okay?
There you go.
Good boy.
Good boy.
Where's your bottle?
Where's the damn bottle?
Mark!
Where's the bottle!
She's taking this new mother thing pretty serious, huh?
Shut it, Lyle.
Mark!
Can you get it for me, please!
"Mark, can you get it for me, please?"
I don't know where it is!
Damn it, keep your voice down!
Jane, don't let all that yelling scare you.
Jane?
Our daughter is missing.
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure.
Jane!
Jane?
Damn.
I knew she would do this.
You take the front yard, I will take the back.
She couldn't have gotten far.
Watch the baby.
Me?
Mother of the year.
What's going on in there?
No idea.
All I know is that psychopath is with my kids.
Hey, wait.
I'm not so sure about this.
Then stay here.
I'm going in.
Nomi...
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Okay.
You are wasting your breath, little guy!
That's better.
Breaking news.
Authorities are warning King County residents to be on the lookout for a patient who escaped from a psychiatric facility near Red Bank.
The patient, Greta March, 39, is described as dangerous to herself and to others, and may be accompanied by an unidentified male in his early-to-mid-30s.
If you see either one of these people, do not try to approach them.
Instead, call 9-1-1 immediately.
Yeah?
She escaped.
What?
Nomi.
I just saw it on the news.
I think she's with the bellhop.
This situation's getting way too out of hand.
What if this plays in Boston, and somebody sees it, hmm?
Or, or... what if she comes for her kids?
You've got to hold it together, Lyle.
Hold it together?
She could bring heat, serious heat down on us.
Oh...
Hi.
Hi...
Are you okay?
Did you miss me?
We're going to get you out of here, okay?
But you have to be really, really quiet.
Okay?
No crying.
Can you do that for me?
Okay.
Let's go find your sister.
Come on.
Jane?
Jane?
Yeah, we're gonna need another exit strategy.
Listen, Lyle, you need to deal with this... now.
Yeah.
Okay.
This mess just keeps getting bigger.
Okay, you just need to focus on finding our daughter, okay?
Jane!
Whoa, whoa, I wouldn't do that.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, he's right.
Before you got your phone back,
I made a copy of the memory card, and I gave it to the cops.
They have all your texts, all your phone records.
They know everything, Lyle.
They can do that?
Where is my daughter?
She took off.
She was getting pretty fed up with those two, and I'm...
I'm starting to see her point.
She took off?
Hi there.
Are you a police officer?
Yes, I am.
What's the matter, honey?
I want my mommy!
Okay, okay, let's see what we can do.
Can you tell me your name?
Jane.
That's a pretty name.
Jane what?
Jane Gardner.
And is this your house?
Jane!
I'm Mark Gardner, that's my daughter.
Oh, Jane, where have you been?
You scared the heck out of us.
We received a 9-1-1 from a child saying she needed help.
I'm so sorry, my daughter has a very vivid imagination.
No, they're lying!
I want my real mommy!
Don't say that, you're hurting your mother's feelings.
Okay, I'm sorry, but I'm going to need to see I.D.s from both of you.
Of course.
Yeah.
I never thought things would go this far.
They kept changing the plan.
Well, it's not too late to run if you want to.
Run?
Go.
All right.
Okay.
Yeah.
Is that true, about his phone?
I wish.
Come on, we have to find Jane before they do.
You go.
I'll take the baby.
Okay.
Just take him.
There you go.
There we go.
Hi.
Hey...
I think he likes you.
Yeah, well, who could blame him, right?
Not me.
Okay, honey, um, you're going to have to go with your parents, okay?
No, please, I don't want to!
Get away from her!
Mommy!
Ma'am, I'm going to have to ask you to stay right there.
That's my daughter.
Jane, are you okay?
Yes!
That woman is Greta March.
She's an escaped mental patient.
Ma'am, hands on the hood of the vehicle, spread your legs.
My name is Nomi Gardner.
That man is my husband, Mark, and that woman is Greta March.
She's lying.
They killed my neighbor, and now they're trying to make everyone think that she's me.
There's a lot of money at stake.
Take me back to the station, do a DNA test, you'll find out that I'm telling the truth.
Last warning, hands on the vehicle.
You're making a mistake.
Come here, Jane!
Please don't believe them!
Please!
I'm going to need back-up here, 1677 Crescent Drive.
- Possible 207A.
- Copy that.
They're going to take her away from me.
No, they're not.
Then they're going to take away Aiden.
Calm down.
I can't live without them!
Ma'am, ma'am,
I need you to stay here!
Would a real mother abandon her child like that?
Lyle!
Where's my baby!
Lyle!
Where's my baby?
Janie, get back here!
I am your father, dammit!
Come here.
Please don't take my mommy away again!
Okay.
I believe you.
Take her to the front seat of the car.
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
No... what?
No, no, no, no, you can't...
You can't do this.
Yeah, well, I just did.
Now, put your hands on the vehicle!
This is wrong!
Janie!
You!
Lyle!
What are you doing in my house?
Waiting for the police.
Oh, yeah, the, uh... the handyman gave you up.
I don't believe you.
Look, just let me have my baby, and nobody else will get hurt, I swear.
Mm-mm.
I am not going to let you take this baby.
I...
Please.
Aiden...
Get out of here.
I...
Ma'am, we're not going in that house without back-up.
My son is in there!
No!
Ma'am!
No...
Hey, hey, hey, hey...
Janie, please open the door!
Janie!
Open the door, you little bitch!
Don't you ever touch my children again.
Let me out!
Is this it?
The results of your DNA.
I suspect, no more surprises?
None.
My sincere apologies, Mrs. Gardner.
Your kids are waiting for you.
So, what now?
My lawyer says I'll have to testify.
We both will.
I meant after the trial.
Once your ex and the nanny from hell are safely behind bars.
Well, I have a great idea for a new book.
But first I need to catch up with these two.
Well, when you come up to breathe, give me a call.
I never did get the chance to microwave you a dinner.
Thanks, I...
I'd love that.
I'll be in touch.
Bye.
Be careful, honey!
Are you going to play with me, Mommy?
Of course, honey!
Let's go.
[♪♪]
Where's my crucifix?
[chuckles]
Sorry I didn't come to bed last night.
I wanted to get it done before we left.
Did you?
Till the re-write.
Wow.
Which means that for the next week,
I'm all yours.
[chuckling]
Wait a second...
I don't hear any screaming.
Why don't I hear any screaming?
Our son decided he needs some extra beauty sleep, and Jane is training for the next moon landing.
[sighs] Greta is great.
She is?
Come on, look at them.
Jane's crazy about her.
I mean, who wouldn't like her?
She's so... so blonde.
Is that jealousy I hear in your voice?
[laughs] It's just an observation,
Mr. "Let's get a nanny because all my successful friends have one."
That reminds me,
Lyle's coming by to look at the furnace.
Oh, Lyle again.
Can we get an authorized repair person for once?
You're the one who's obsessed with saving money.
- Hmm?
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
You are one great astronaut, you know that?
Thanks, Greta!
Aw... [♪♪]
Hey.
Thanks for coming.
It's, uh, furnace problems again?
Yeah, I think it might be a gas supply.
Here's a key.
Take a look, let me know what you think.
Yeah, sure thing.
I'll, uh, send you an estimate.
Great.
We'll be back Sunday.
Sunday.
All right.
[man]:
This one's gonna be a bestseller, I can feel it.
You're gonna be the next Stephen King.
[laughs]
Just... don't let it out of your sight, okay?
If it gets into the wrong hands, my publisher will...
Well, to use a five-dollar word, she'll be very vexed.
Madam, you are impugning my professional discretion.
Never.
You know how much I appreciate your feedback, Teddy.
The pleasure's all mine.
You're the last decent writer I ever taught.
I swear, half my students should be sent back to remedial English.
[laughing]
Hi, Ted.
Hey, Mark.
How's the startup game?
Can't complain.
Managing a couple of hedge funds.
I got some big investors on the line.
That's what this trip is all about, reelin' 'em in.
Oh, sounds promising.
Tell me, has this protégée of mine made any new friends out there, or is she still the same sad loner you married?
Hey, I resent that remark.
All right.
Enough with the jokes, you guys better get going.
You heard the man.
All right, bye, Teddy.
Thanks again.
You're welcome.
I'll toast your success with a virgin Bloody Mary.
Make sure that wagon doesn't tip.
Said the preacher to the choir.
- Have a nice trip.
- Bye.
Okay, you need to call Brenda.
Uh-huh.
And did you make sure that the kids got all their stuff?
Of course.
Need a hand?
I'm good.
I finally get to be a full-time mom again.
My little guy is going to love that.
Huh?
Yeah.
[neighbor calling] Is that your wife I see?
[chuckles]
Yes.
Hell has officially frozen over.
Thank you so much for looking after the house for us.
No problem.
I hope a week away is good for you two.
Well, I get to decompress, and Mark gets to schmooze with some of the biggest players in venture capital, so should be a win-win.
Mommy, what's venture capital?
Money, Janie.
Money makes the world go around.
I thought love made the world go around.
It does, honey.
It does.
Let's get you in the car, okay?
- Okay.
- Break a leg.
Thank you so much, Brenda.
Bye!
Drive safe.
[♪♪]
There must be a mistake.
I was told parking was included.
Did you book using our website?
Actually, it was through your reservation agent.
Let me check with our manager.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
You should be.
Maybe you should take the kids upstairs, and I'll sort this out.
Yeah, good idea.
[baby crying]
You need a hand?
No, we're good, I'll see you up there.
Come on, Jane.
[baby crying]
Shh, shh, shh...
It's okay, it's okay...
Shh, shh, shh...
Shh, shh, shh...
Hungry little guy, huh?
Yeah.
Hungry and tired.
Aw, long car trip?
Yeah.
Oh, they're the worst.
Here, let me try something.
[in silly voice] Please don't cry!
I do not want you to cry anymore!
[in villainous voice] Yes!
Please do cry!
Your tears make me stronger.
[voices arguing] No, they do not, you stop it!
- No, you stop it.
- No, you do!
[chuckles] That's impressive.
You must have kids.
Just a niece and a nephew, yeah.
Well, I bet they like having such a cool uncle.
Thanks.
What's your name?
I'm Oscar.
What's your name?
Jane.
But my friends call me Janie.
Well, I would like to be your friend.
Would you like that?
Can I, Mommy?
Of course, honey.
Okay.
[chuckling]
I'm Nomi Gardner.
Nomi?
Wait... that wouldn't be Nomi Gardner the crime writer, would it?
Actually, yeah.
[chuckles]
A pleasure.
You've heard of Nomi?
Oh, absolutely.
I'm reading her latest book, Shattered, right now.
Well, that makes my day.
Yeah, great.
Uh, could you please take these, Oscar?
Yes, sir, right away.
Thank you.
Where's 303?
Uh, right down here, and on your right, sir.
I'll take your bags and follow you.
Brilliant.
Excellent work.
I like it.
You should go show Daddy.
Janie...
Daddy's working.
But we colored these for you.
Wow.
That is really good.
You are a talented artist.
You too, Greta.
Thank you.
Greta, where's the formula?
It should be in the change bag.
Well, it's not, and neither are the baby wipes.
Oh, no.
I am so sorry, Nomi,
I can't believe that I forgot both.
No problem.
I think there's a drugstore nearby.
Okay, I'll go.
No, it's okay.
Are you sure?
'Cause I'm the one that screwed up.
Relax.
Nobody's perfect.
[chuckles warmly]
Bye, Mommy!
Bye, honey.
Be good,
I'll be back in a minute.
Okay.
[♪♪]
[muffled screams]
[groaning and struggling]
[car horn blaring] [coughing]
[coughing and gagging]
[coughing and retching] [gagging and gasping
[exhaust hissing]
[turns off engine]
[tires squealing]
Ma'am, can I help you?
Yes, you can call the police.
The police?
Is something wrong?
You could say that.
I'm afraid the Gardners aren't here.
What?
I said, the Gardners are out.
I don't have time for this.
Miss!
Mark!
Jane!
Miss March, you cannot go in there!
That's not my name!
You wanted the police?
Fine.
Let's go back downstairs and call them.
I just want to find out where my family is!
As I've told you twice before, the Gardners are out.
Where?
At the convention, and they made it very clear to me that after the incident last night, your services are no longer required.
What are you talking about?
What incident?
Mark?
Greta?
What are you doing here?
That's not funny, and I could ask you the same question.
I have nothing to say to you.
Damn it, Mark, somebody just tried to kill me.
Where are the kids?
You touch me again, I'll call the police.
Mark... please, just tell me what's going on.
Where are Jane and Aiden?
They're fine.
Their new nanny is looking after them.
You...
Look, I don't know what you think you're doing here, but I thought I made it very clear to you last night that I never want you coming near my family again.
Your family?
So, are you going to leave, or do I have to get Security to throw you out?
Is this some kind of joke?
Some kind of sick prank or something?
What...
If you think I'm going to go along with this, then you're insane.
I could have died.
Boys?
This is the woman who assaulted me last night.
No, no...
No!
I can prove I'm Nomi Gardner!
[scoffs] Really?
And just how are you going to do that?
I'm Nomi Gardner.
My wallet.
My I.D.'s in my wallet.
Are we all on the same page now?
Good.
This is impossible.
No...
Mark?
Mark, say something!
Mark!
Say something!
Mark!
It's... identity theft.
I don't know what else to call it.
[Detective]:
There must be family that can vouch for you.
[Nomi]:
I'm an only child.
My parents died years ago.
[Detective]:
And your close friends?
I'm not very social.
I hate crowds.
Since we moved here, I've literally been a hermit.
[Detective]:
And you've had no interactions with anyone in your neighborhood?
[Nomi]:
The nanny... we hired her when we moved to Olympia.
She takes Jane to kindergarten.
She gets the groceries...
She does everything.
I want to press charges, Officer.
Do you know anything about this?
Um...
"They can both rot in hell"?
"I just wish I could be in the room when their kids find out I'm dead?"
That was the last post.
Yesterday at 11:00 p.m.
I'd say whoever wrote that made their intentions pretty clear.
It wasn't me.
I don't use social media.
Greta March does.
I'm not Greta March.
Well, then we have a problem, because everything I've been able to access says otherwise.
They must have hacked my accounts.
Every website?
Every photograph?
Well, it wouldn't be that hard.
I have almost nothing of me online.
I... just find this all very hard to believe.
Mark, my husband, he has been involved in a bunch of tech start-ups.
He knows a lot of people in the computer industry, smart people that he must have hired to do this.
[sighs wearily]
Okay, I'm just being devil's advocate here, okay?
Can I get you something to drink?
Yeah.
Okay.
Oh, God.
I gotta ask... you know how crazy this sounds, right?
Uh-huh.
What's his motive?
What does he stand to gain by going to all this trouble to switch your identities?
I don't know.
Unless there's money involved.
Is there money involved?
My books have barely sold enough to cover the advance.
What about him?
What does he stand to lose?
Nothing.
His last three companies have crashed and burned.
We only moved to Olympia because Boston was getting too expensive, and I kept telling him not to get a nanny, because we can't afford it, and he insisted.
Now I know why.
Look, all I can do right now is file a report, but if it turns out to be false, you could be charged with a felony.
Are you absolutely sure you want to do this?
Yes.
Please.
Okay.
I'll be right back.
Detective Krantz?
My name's Donovan Harris.
I know who you are, Counselor.
What can I do for you?
I've been retained by Mark and Nomi Gardner.
This is a restraining order against a former employee of the family.
Let me guess, Greta March?
My clients have employed Miss March as a nanny for the past six months, however, recently, they've become concerned with a decline in her performance.
The assault on Mrs. Gardner last night was the final straw.
Now, they believe that Greta here is clearly a danger to herself and to others.
Now, they won't press charges if they don't have to, but they do not want an unhinged, and possibly suicidal woman anywhere near their children ever again.
A DNA test.
Excuse me?
That'll prove the kids are mine.
I'm sorry, which part of "ever again"
was unclear to you, Miss March?
I still want to file that report, Detective.
Are you listening to me?
This is the name of a good therapist.
Call her.
She'll be able to help you.
If you won't do your job, then I'll find someone else around here who will.
Unless you want to end up in jail,
I suggest that you go home now and get your head on straight.
And for your own good, stay far, far away from the Gardners.
[scoffs in disbelief] [laughs ruefully]
Come on, come on, pick up.
[cell phone rings]
Hello?
Ted.
Nomi, hey.
I'm still reading, but listen, so far, I've gotta say, you're knocking it out of the park.
This is not about that.
So, to what do I owe the pleasure?
I have a big, big favor to ask you.
I need you to come to Seattle.
What?
Why?
Uh...
It's about Mark and the kids.
Jesus, now you're scaring me.
Yeah, you're not the only one.
All right, I'm sitting down, so tell me what happened.
Okay, um...
I know it sounds really crazy, and it's, uh, short notice, but I need you to vouch for me.
Vouch for you?
What...
I don't get it.
Ted...
I...
It's really important.
Yes or no.
[exhales] Um...
I'm gonna have to scramble around, get someone to cover my classes, but yes, of course.
If it's that important to you, whatever you need, Nomi.
Okay.
Thank you so much.
Uh, come to the North Precinct police station tomorrow morning, and ask for Detective Krantz.
Krantz, okay.
Uh, sure.
But Nomi... what the hell is going on?
You're the best, Ted.
Really.
I owe you one.
[phone ringing]
How did it go?
The restraining order has been delivered.
I don't foresee any more issues.
Thanks, Donovan.
We'll touch base tomorrow.
So... how did it go?
Our alibi is in the bag.
That's a relief.
Now you can just focus on us.
Daddy?
I don't like it here.
When can we go home?
Soon, honey.
Very soon.
[Mark]:
Trust me, you're going to love this park.
Can I go on the swings?
The swings?
Of course, you can go on the swings.
Jane... how come you don't like your new Mommy?
I just don't.
Why do I have to call her that?
Because your old Mommy is sick, and I know you love her, and you miss her, but if you ever see her, you can't talk to her.
Why?
It's hard to explain.
You just can't.
She's... dangerous.
Want to go on the slide?
Yeah!
All right.
You see, your old mommy can hurt you and your brother because she's sick.
I'm counting on you, Jane.
You understand?
I think so.
Good.
And if you're in trouble, if someone like your old mommy, tries to take you and Aiden, what do you do?
Find a police officer?
That's right.
Find a police officer or call 911.
Remember, I love you.
Let's go, let's get out of here.
[yelps]
Hi, Mrs. G.
Lyle?
If you scream, you're going to have to learn to make do with one kidney.
You're helping them.
What's going on?
Why are they doing this to me?
[gasps]
Get in.
[gasping in panic]
[cell phone vibrates]
Now what?
Yeah, we'll do lots of great stuff.
[incoming message chimes]
One second.
All right, we've got to hurry, baby.
Come on.
[♪♪]
Son of a bitch.
What's going on?
I got a text from Lyle.
He said to meet him here.
Me too.
[cell phone rings]
Just one second, sweetie.
Hello?
We got a problem.
What happened?
I saw her at the park, alone.
I thought I could take her.
And instead she got your phone, and now she knows everything.
I'm just cleaning up after your mess.
Besides, I took care of that other thing, didn't I?
I can fix this.
Prove it.
Find her and shut her up.
Everything's fine.
We're going back to the hotel.
Come on.
Come on, everyone.
Janie!
Slow down.
[door latch rattles]
Stay right here, okay?
It's okay, sweetie.
[sighs]
Mark, come look at this.
There's no one here.
There was.
Wonderful.
I spend all this money on hackers, and now they're going to catch us because I left this out.
Hey, no one's getting caught.
Jane...
I know that you're scared, but I also know that you're very brave.
That's what makes you such a great astronaut.
Give Mommy a hug.
[gasps]
[sobbing softly]
See ya.
Oscar!
Oscar...
Hi.
Hi.
Uh, are you okay?
Yeah.
Uh...
Who am I?
[chuckles]
Um... you're Nomi Gardner?
We need to talk.
Okay.
Right now?
Yeah.
It's important.
Okay.
Um... my car is over here.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
Okay, so wait, let me get this straight, you have a cousin in the U.K. who's loaded, and who just passed away, and even though you didn't know this person existed, he wills you his entire estate?
Not the whole thing, only five million U.S.
From what I can make out, the rest goes to charity.
Only five million.
Mark must have intercepted the first letter from the lawyer and never told me.
Now Brenda Johnson, my neighbor in Olympia is dead.
I can't believe they're willing to go this far.
So you think I'm next because I know you're the real Nomi Gardner.
No one else west of the Rockies can pick me out of a lineup.
Even my publisher doesn't know what I look like.
We do everything by email and phone.
This is crazy.
No kidding.
No, this is... [laughing in disbelief] really crazy.
Wait.
How do I know you weren't planning this when we met at the hotel?
What?
For all I know, you're the one pulling the scam, not them.
You want to know how?
This is how.
There's no author photo, I looked.
I know, I'm too humble for my own good, but that's not what I meant.
Just pick a page.
Uh...
Just start reading, anywhere.
Okay.
Um...
"She crossed the street at a run,
"driven by an impulse she could not contain..."
"The boulevards and alleyways were unusually empty.
"It was as if the city held its breath
"out of respect, or perhaps pity.
"She felt that if she came to a decision, this moment of peace would end."
Are you convinced yet, or should I keep going?
That was amazing.
Will you help me?
When's the last time you ate?
I'm not sure.
It's been a blur.
Okay, I'm going to feed you.
And you can also take a nap, if you like.
There's no time.
We have to go to the police, both of us.
And say what?
The truth.
With...
With you vouching for me, proof of these documents, and Ted coming in tomorrow, the police will have to listen to me.
And then
I can get a court order for a maternity test and I can get my kids back.
[crash and clatter outside]
What was that?
Don't go out there.
Take it easy.
Not everything's a conspiracy.
Oscar?
Oscar?
It's fine!
Probably just the wind.
[screams]
[Taser crackling, Oscar gasps in pain]
[Taser crackling]
Somebody's been looking at things they should not be.
I'm surprised you didn't turn off my phone tracker.
Not too smart for a mystery writer.
Don't do this.
That money is legally mine.
Let me go, and you can name your price.
You're wasting your breath, lady.
I figure... this poor guy, he's just sitting down for dinner when some crazy woman breaks in, and she's got a bogus story about, uh... you know, somebody stole her life.
He asks her to leave, she wouldn't, so he has to defend himself.
[laughs, scoffing]
What's so funny?
You haven't thought this through, have you?
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but they want both of us dead, yes?
Well... if he hits me with the bat, then how did I kill him?
And then there's the problem of the stun gun.
Unless the M.E. is really incompetent, then they're gonna find burn marks in my back.
How are you going to explain that?
You think you're pretty smart, huh?
I come up with this stuff for a living.
Not anymore.
Okay... [sniffs]
Here's the re-write.
You hit him with the bat, then he shot you with the stun gun, twice.
Your ticker couldn't handle the voltage.
Happened to a guy I knew in the joint.
You've been in prison.
Why am I not surprised?
I guess I can't appeal to your better nature.
You could if I had one.
[groaning and struggling]
[groans in pain]
[blows thud]
[Lyle groans in pain]
[groaning] Is he gone?
I think so.
Are you okay?
Uh... yeah.
You know, it's just another Saturday night.
[groaning in pain]
[cell phone vibrating]
Tell me it's done.
[breathing hard] Not exactly.
"Not exactly"?
What the hell does that mean?
It means the bitch hit me with a bat, all right?
What the hell was she doing with a baseball bat?
No, wait, I don't even want to know that.
This is...
This is unbelievable.
It was two against one.
I mean, what did you expect me to do?
What am I paying you for?
No, scratch that.
Get back here, and make sure no one sees you.
What are you doing?
I'm cutting our losses.
We've just got to get through the next 24 hours, and that money is ours.
The longest 24 hours of my life.
I know, it won't be easy.
We'll be back home in our bed, and she'll be rotting away in a mental hospital.
And then our children will be back where they belong, with me.
Exactly.
It's okay, Aiden.
Our real mommy's going to come for us.
[wincing]
We need to call the police.
I already tried that.
Come on, they tried to kill us.
The cops can't ignore this now.
They did before.
You said you needed someone to back up your story.
Here I am.
Hey...
What did I say?
It's not you.
My husband's been sleeping with another woman for God knows how long, and he just sent someone to kill me.
Twice.
[sighs in anguish]
Nomi.
Hey.
I can't put you in danger.
What are you talking about?
They're willing to commit murder.
Do you really want to look over your shoulder for the rest of your life?
Oh, hey, I can take care of myself.
[sighs heavily]
I need to leave.
Nomi, I can't let you do this.
You're going to have to.
Nomi...
No, Nomi, don't go.
Nomi... [roar of traffic]
This is the second time this month.
Sorry I'm late.
Is he here?
Yes.
Right this way, Miss...
Yeah.
Teddy...
I'm so glad to see you.
[stammering] I thought I was here for Nomi.
Teddy... tell her it's me.
Are you saying this is not Nomi Gardner?
Look, I...
I'm a busy man, okay?
I...
I dropped everything to get on the redeye from Boston because she said it was an emergency,
I haven't had a wink of sleep, so I'd appreciate it if you'd quit wasting my time.
Oh, my God.
Not you, too.
Mr. Curtis, do you know this woman?
I've never seen her before in my life.
- Dammit!
- Miss March!
- Damn you for this!
- You need to calm down!
How much did they offer you?
A hundred grand?
Two?
It's a drop in the bucket, Teddy.
That's enough!
Let me tell you, they're ripping you off.
$5 million, that's how much is in the trust.
That's a lot of gin and tonics, Teddy.
Don't let them get you cheap, Teddy!
You can let go of me now.
Are you going to stay calm?
Yeah, I'm gonna stay calm.
You've been warned, you need to go home before you get yourself into more trouble, do you understand?
More trouble?
How am I gonna get in any more trouble?
There she is.
Detective, this woman has violated her restraining order.
Now, these are declarations from my clients stating that she broke into their hotel room yesterday and threatened their children.
That's not true.
Janie and Aiden were not there.
You see, this woman is clearly a menace.
Now we suggest that she be detained under Title 71 for her own protection.
You son of a bitch!
You leave me no choice.
Officers...
I am placing you under involuntary psychiatric detention for 72 hours.
Get a warrant, and search the hotel room.
You will find documents that prove my inheritance.
You will be evaluated at a county medical facility by a mental health professional.
You have the right to speak to your attorney during this time.
You can't do this!
No!
No!
No!
What's going on?
Where are they taking her?
That depends on what her shrink says about her mental state.
I'm sorry you had to come all this way for nothing.
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.
Mm-hmm.
There is only one thing I'm curious about, though.
You said that Nomi Gardner asked you to come.
But she didn't show.
Just Miss March did.
What's your point?
I have no point.
I just... found it strange, that's all.
It's a strange world.
I have no argument there.
Excuse me.
Mm-hmm.
[sighs]
Yeah.
It's done.
I want to speak to a lawyer right now.
Are you listening to me?
I have the right to speak to an attorney!
No...
No, please, no.
This is a mistake.
You can't do this to me!
Please, no... no!
No, no, no, no... [sobbing] No!
Please... [sobbing in anguish]
[screaming] My name is Nomi Gardner!
Please, please, please...
Hello?
Please, my kids need me.
Let me out!
Please... my kids!
[sobbing] Please...
Please... my kids need me!
[sobbing in panic]
Help me, help me!
[screaming and banging]
Let me out!
Would you stop that?
You're making me nervous.
You're nervous?
I just arranged a murder and had my wife committed.
She's a vindictive schizophrenic and Brenda Johnson died in a freak accident.
Patience.
Refresh it again.
It's automatic.
Just humor me, please?
[sighs wearily]
It's here.
[laughing in triumph]
Oh ye of little faith.
So... how does it feel to be a very rich man, Mr. Gardner?
You want to know how it feels, Mrs. Gardner?
[giggling]
I always knew my dreams would come true.
[chuckles] [baby starts crying]
Damn, he has some lungs on him.
[sighs heavily] It's okay,
I'll take care of it.
After all, I am his mother.
You really love him, don't you?
Like he was my own.
[giggles] [baby screaming in distress]
Who is it?
The professor.
And what does he want?
[doorbell rings] [knocks]
Nomi?
Well, I'll be damned.
Love what you've done with your hair.
What do you want?
I just wanted to see your new place.
Nice neighborhood.
I'll bet the crime rate is really low.
And there's the man of the house.
Congratulations on your recent windfall, Mark, but hey, if anyone deserves it, you do.
Your money's on the way.
Well, that's wonderful news.
I am enjoying my stay.
It's a beautiful hotel you put me in.
Well, we're very appreciative.
Excellent, then I'm sure you won't mind adding another little zero to that hundred grand.
[laughs]
You're even more of a lush than I thought.
She's right.
You get what we agreed to, not a cent more.
Nomi...
[clearing throat]
The real Nomi...
She told me how much you two are making off this little scam, and I am not so old and miserable that I am gonna sell out a friend for table scraps.
Now, come on, Mark,
I don't think you're in any position to bargain here.
You don't want me going back to that police station and changing my story.
250.
500,000, not a cent less.
Fine.
Fine?
Just pay him and get him out of here.
Pleasure doing business with you.
I'll be the one in my hotel room checking my balance, and hey,
I think you should hurry up and act on this, because, uh, my flight to Bermuda leaves at 9:00 tonight.
[door closes]
My ex had a Chihuahua like that.
He bit me after I gave him a chew toy.
How would you like a raise?
[gasping and struggling]
[bones crunch]
It had to be done.
Even if we paid him, there's no guarantees he wouldn't be back.
[Jane, worried] Is everything okay down there?
Perfectly fine, sweetie.
I'll be up in a minute.
[baby Aiden crying]
Next time you try to tie up a loose end, try not to do it in our front yard where the children can see.
Hey, a little reminder.
We just became millionaires today.
You're right.
[baby screaming upstairs]
Excuse me, Jane and Aiden need their mother.
[baby screaming]
[♪♪]
Thank you, Ian.
Have a seat, Miss March.
I'd rather stand.
Suit yourself.
Do you understand why you're here?
I'm on a psych hold, what they'd call a 5150 in California, and you're the shrink who's supposed to decide just how crazy I am.
[chuckles] That's right, only we don't use the term "crazy" here.
How very enlightened of you.
In my first book, my protagonist ended up in a place like this.
I did my research, but I have to say, it's really different being on this side of the desk.
Ah, yes.
You believe you are a mystery writer named Nomi Gardner.
And when I prove that I'm right, you and a lot of other people are going to look very stupid.
Well, the last thing a man in my profession wants is to look stupid, so... why don't you prove it to me, right now.
I'd love to, but you and I both know that that's not going to happen.
Would you do me a favor?
Take a look in that mirror and tell me what you see.
That mirror?
Yes.
Please.
I see a woman who's lost everything.
Want to know what I see?
A woman who has everything to gain.
And all I have to do is pretend to be someone I'm not, right?
I don't want you to do anything you're not comfortable with.
Really?
Really.
I'm so glad to hear that.
Thank you.
And I'm sorry.
For what?
For this.
[yelping in pain]
Ian!
[gasps in fright] [shouting in protest]
No!
No!
No!
No... [calling silently]
[♪♪] [sobbing in distress] No...
Well, the good news is I've finished my evaluation.
The bad news is
I think you're going to be with us for a lot longer than 72 hours.
No...
Hold still, Greta.
Hold still.
Please don't do this.
It's just a muscle relaxant.
We don't want you biting off your tongue, now, do we?
Take her to the ECT.
Let's see if we can get some electro-shock therapy to jog something loose.
Please...
This is a mistake.
I'm not...
Greta March.
I'm Nomi Gardner.
Nomi Gardner...
I'm not...
I'm not who you think I am.
[gasping] I have...
I have two children.
They're in danger.
Just try and relax, Greta.
My... [sobs]
My name's not Greta.
[sobbing]
[panting in terror] [emergency alarm starts blaring]
It's probably just a drill.
There was nothing scheduled.
I guess we'll have to pick this up later.
[alarm blaring]
[alarm blaring]
You...
They need your help in Ward C right away, some of the psychotics are refusing to leave.
What about her?
I've got her.
I'm not Greta.
My name is Nomi Gardner.
You have to believe me.
I do.
You do?
It's me.
Oh!
Oscar!
[laughs]
Can you walk?
I don't think so, they gave me something.
Well, we are just going to have to risk it.
Come on.
Okay.
[alarm blaring]
I got you, I got you.
Okay, let's get out of here before someone realizes
I'm not qualified to practice medicine.
Okay.
How did you find me?
My sister is a dispatch officer.
She owed me a favor.
I thought I told you to stay out of it.
Can I be honest?
Yeah.
I think letting someone with your talent waste away in a mental hospital would be a crime against literature.
Okay.
This way.
[patients shouting]
Over here.
Hey!
What do you think you're doing?
Uh-oh.
That woman is my patient!
Where are you taking her?
Thank you!
Hey!
Stop!
Stop!
[chuckles in victory]
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Listen, I don't want to rain on your parade, but we're officially fugitives from justice now.
Got any ideas?
Only one.
Get my kids.
I thought you'd say that.
[♪♪]
[glass shattering]
Honey?
Are you okay?
Oh, fine, just dropped something!
I'll be there in a minute.
Hey.
Honey... are you okay?
Daddy, the music is too loud.
I'm sorry.
Your mommy and I are having a little party.
I'll turn it down, okay?
She's not my mom!
Janie, don't say that.
You know that's not true.
Yes, it is!
Janie...
Janie, get back here!
[bedroom door slams]
You know, I was thinking of redecorating, but then I remembered we're not going be living here much longer.
No, we won't.
God... this just feels so good, you know?
All this stress just...
just melting away.
We really are living our dream, and pretty soon, you and I are going to be lounging on a beach in Costa Rica.
Little Aiden is going to be playing on my lap, while Janie is braiding my hair and talking about her first day at primary school.
What about me?
Oh, you will be thinking of all the wild and naughty things that I'll be doing to you while they're in bed.
[knock on door]
Who is it?
It's Lyle.
Hey... [laughs]
Here's to sand in my shorts and umbrellas in my drinks!
I will drink to that.
[Lyle laughing in triumph]
How did it go?
Easy.
He smelled like a distillery, so I rolled his car, lit it up.
Ooh...
The teacher had excellent taste in whiskey.
Does he have to be here?
Greta, we're all friends.
Actually one of us is an employee.
I prefer the term "business partner".
Yeah, well, your business is killing people, and we have two children upstairs asleep!
Greta...
I did what I was paid to do.
Yeah, and I don't want to constantly be reminded of that!
What do you expect me to do?
You want me to disappear into some gutter?
Hey, Lyle...
Lyle, she did not mean that.
Actually, I did!
Oh, so that's how it is, huh?
Yeah?
I'm supposed to clean up all of your messes while you sit here, and you play house with your two little runts?
I'm not playing house!
[smashing bottle]
9-1-1, what is your emergency?
Hello?
I need a police officer.
Okay.
What's your name?
These are my children!
This is my husband!
Don't you dare ever question my commitment to this family again!
Listen... both of you.
We have a really good thing going here, so settle down.
[baby Aiden starts screaming]
Now look what you've done.
Shh, shh, shh, shh...
Oh, sweetheart, don't cry, Mommy's here.
Hi, sweetie!
Aw... are you hungry?
Oh, yes, you must be so hungry, because Mommy hasn't been feeding you, has she?
Let me find your bottle, okay?
There you go.
Good boy.
Good boy.
Where's your bottle?
[baby crying in distress]
Where's the damn bottle?
[baby screaming] [shouting] Mark!
Where's the bottle!
She's taking this new mother thing pretty serious, huh?
Shut it, Lyle.
[Greta shouting]:
Mark!
Can you get it for me, please!
[mocking] "Mark, can you get it for me, please?"
[Mark shouting]:
I don't know where it is!
Damn it, keep your voice down!
Jane, don't let all that yelling scare you.
Jane?
Our daughter is missing.
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure.
Jane!
Jane?
Damn.
I knew she would do this.
You take the front yard, I will take the back.
She couldn't have gotten far.
Watch the baby.
Me?
Mother of the year.
What's going on in there?
No idea.
All I know is that psychopath is with my kids.
Hey, wait.
I'm not so sure about this.
Then stay here.

Breaking news.
Authorities are warning King County residents to be on the lookout for a patient who escaped from a psychiatric facility near Red Bank.
The patient, Greta March, 39, is described as dangerous to herself and to others, and may be accompanied by an unidentified male in his early-to-mid-30s.
If you see either one of these people, do not try to approach them.
Instead, call 9-1-1 immediately.
[baby screaming]
[cell phone rings]
Yeah?
She escaped.
What?
Nomi.
I just saw it on the news.
I think she's with the bellhop.
This situation's getting way too out of hand.
What if this plays in Boston, and somebody sees it, hmm?
Or, or... what if she comes for her kids?
You've got to hold it together, Lyle.
Hold it together?
She could bring heat, serious heat down on us.
[whispering] Oh...
Hi.
Hi...
Are you okay?
Did you miss me?
We're going to get you out of here, okay?
But you have to be really, really quiet.
Okay?
No crying.
Can you do that for me?
Okay.
Let's go find your sister.
Come on.
Jane?
Jane?
Yeah, we're gonna need another exit strategy.
Listen, Lyle, you need to deal with this... now.
Yeah.
Okay.
This mess just keeps getting bigger.
Okay, you just need to focus on finding our daughter, okay?
Jane!
[stool thuds]
Whoa, whoa, I wouldn't do that.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, he's right.
Before you got your phone back,
I made a copy of the memory card, and I gave it to the cops.
They have all your texts, all your phone records.
They know everything, Lyle.
They can do that?
Where is my daughter?
She took off.
She was getting pretty fed up with those two, and I'm...
I'm starting to see her point.
She took off?
[sirens wail]
Hi there.
Are you a police officer?
Yes, I am.
What's the matter, honey?
I want my mommy!
Okay, okay, let's see what we can do.
Can you tell me your name?
Jane.
That's a pretty name.
Jane what?
Jane Gardner.
And is this your house?
Jane!
I'm Mark Gardner, that's my daughter.
Oh, Jane, where have you been?
You scared the heck out of us.
We received a 9-1-1 from a child saying she needed help.
I'm so sorry, my daughter has a very vivid imagination.
No, they're lying!
I want my real mommy!
Don't say that, you're hurting your mother's feelings.
Okay, I'm sorry, but I'm going to need to see I.D.s from both of you.
Of course.
Yeah.
I never thought things would go this far.
They kept changing the plan.
Well, it's not too late to run if you want to.
Run?
Go.
All right.
Okay.
Yeah.
[sighs in relief]
Is that true, about his phone?
I wish.
Come on, we have to find Jane before they do.
You go.
I'll take the baby.
Okay.
Just take him.
There you go.
There we go.
Hi.
Hey...
I think he likes you.
Yeah, well, who could blame him, right?
[chuckles]
Not me.
[laughs nervously] [front door shuts]
Okay, honey, um, you're going to have to go with your parents, okay?
No, please, I don't want to!
Get away from her!
Mommy!
Ma'am, I'm going to have to ask you to stay right there.
That's my daughter.
Jane, are you okay?
Yes!
That woman is Greta March.
She's an escaped mental patient.
Ma'am, hands on the hood of the vehicle, spread your legs.
My name is Nomi Gardner.
That man is my husband, Mark, and that woman is Greta March.
She's lying.
They killed my neighbor, and now they're trying to make everyone think that she's me.
There's a lot of money at stake.
Take me back to the station, do a DNA test, you'll find out that I'm telling the truth.
Last warning, hands on the vehicle.
You're making a mistake.
Come here, Jane!
Please don't believe them!
Please!
I'm going to need back-up here, 1677 Crescent Drive.
- Possible 207A.

They're going to take her away from me.
No, they're not.
Then they're going to take away Aiden.
Calm down.

Ma'am, ma'am,
I need you to stay here!
Would a real mother abandon her child like that?
Lyle!
Where's my baby!
Lyle!
Where's my baby?
Janie, get back here!
I am your father, dammit!
Come here.
Please don't take my mommy away again!
Okay.

Take her to the front seat of the car.
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
No... what?
No, no, no, no, you can't...

Yeah, well, I just did.
Now, put your hands on the vehicle!

Miss Lareau, did the two
CIA case officers killed in Russia earlier this morning report to you?
Yes, they did.
And what were they doing in...
Keykino.
They were supposed to be meeting an Asset who had asked for our help to get him out of Russia.
An Asset?
From the SVR, Russia's Intelligence Service.
Yuri.
He wanted to defect?
Correct.
And what is Yuri's particular value?
He claims to know the identity and allegiance of over 300 Russian agents in the United States.
- And who recruited him to defect?
- I did.
For how long?
The last 14 months.
- Both:
So why...
- I'm sorry.
So why weren't you in Keykino to meet him?
Because I was back in Langley for a Divisional Directors meeting.
You scheduled this extraction while you knew you'd be back in D.C.?
Yuri was familiar with Pulowski and McFaddyen.
They had his full confidence.
Or so you thought.
Is it possible Yuri set them up?
Miss Lareau.
Anything is possible.
But if he did set them up, that means that you recruited a double agent.
Yes.

[Bangs on door] Please!
[Man speaking Russian over loudspeaker]
[Indistinct radio chatter]
Take her hand.
[Indistinct radio chatter]
[Man speaking Russian over loudspeaker]
[Speaking Russian]
[Panting]
[Speaking Russian]
[Indistinct radio chatter]
[Men chattering in Russian]
Why me?
I prayed for a solution, and he...
Gave me you.
I honestly believed you left that life behind a long time ago.
I honestly did.
Problem is, you never believed that I too left it behind.
That is not true.
I'm not the answer to your prayers, George.
You know why?
I don't think you praying right.
I think you praying like some kind of punk-ass hypocrite.
Maybe you should stop praying for solutions and just try harder to be one.
[Indistinct chatter over loudspeaker]
[Baby cooing quietly]
[Sighs]
You ready to roll?
[Sighs]
You really got kids, huh?
Yep.
They're the reason I do this work.
You're crazy.
That's the other reason.
[Both laugh]
_
Tatjana.
_
_
Where are your bags?
- Yura, I'm scared.
- We already talked about this.
No, I'm really scared.
Aren't you scared?
Let's talk about this in the car.
We really must rush.
My husband is going to kill me.
He's going to kill us.
Once we're gone, there's nothing, absolutely nothing that he can do to us.
He's a Colonel in the SVR, a trained assassin.
For god's sake, you think he's going to just let us go?
The CIA will protect us.
Trust me.
We're going to be safe in United States.
Believe me, we're going to be in a lot of danger if we stay here in Russia.
I can't do this, Yura.
Not today.
What?
What do you mean "not today"?
I shouldn't even be here right now.
_
Where is he?
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
You might have a point.
About what?
This not being right.
Get away from the window.
We can't get taken.
Not with what we know about Yuri.
What if it's Yuri who set us up?
You are surrounded!
We know you are CIA!
There's no escape!
You have 30 seconds to surrender!
But what if it wasn't him?
How else did this happen?
What if they've already rolled Yuri up?
- What if, what if?
- Do you really want to die?
If Yuri's still a live Asset.
- You want to die.
- We have to protect him.
Don't do this.
Please?
Joan.
There has to be another way out of this.
Five!
Four!
- God, I hope you're right.
- Three!
Two!
I can't do this.
I'm sorry.
Hey, who got...
Who's on shorty?
Remi, you sleeping again?
- Hey.
- Come on.
What the hell was that?
Ho, ho, ho.
Easy, boys.
Easy, boys.
- It's just a game.
- What's up with you?
You hurt?
We all just having a good time here, right?
Right.
Please say your name and job title.
Uh, Gretchen Lareau, Deputy Chief Moscow Station.
Do you understand, Miss Lareau, that the proceedings of this chamber are classified secret?
I do.
Miss Lareau, did the two
CIA case officers killed in Russia earlier this morning report to you?
Yes, they did.
And what were they doing in...
Keykino.
They were supposed to be meeting an Asset who had asked for our help to get him out of Russia.
An Asset?
From the SVR, Russia's Intelligence Service.
Yuri.
He wanted to defect?
Correct.
And what is Yuri's particular value?
He claims to know the identity and allegiance of over 300 Russian agents in the United States.
- And who recruited him to defect?
- I did.
For how long?
The last 14 months.
- So why...
- I'm sorry.
So why weren't you in Keykino to meet him?
Because I was back in Langley for a Divisional Directors meeting.
You scheduled this extraction while you knew you'd be back in D.C.?
Yuri was familiar with Pulowski and McFaddyen.
They had his full confidence.
Or so you thought.
Is it possible Yuri set them up?
Miss Lareau.
Anything is possible.
But if he did set them up, that means that you recruited a double agent.
Yes.
I'm aware.
Thank you.
Which means now somebody has to go find him.
What are you doing?
We're in the middle of a game here.
Where you going?
Ball game's over, boys.
You got this, bro.
Feel better.
Make sure that hole in your side heals quick.
Keep your heads down.
I'll be with you in spirit.
Hey, you ain't sat out a game since you had your tonsils out when you was six.
Appendix.
And I was nine.
All right.
So what's it now?
Nothing.
I'ma be fine.
Come on.
I want to show you something.
Hello, Edna.
Pastor George.
Flowers look beautiful.
Keyshawn Willis.
13 years old.
Killed in a drive-by Thursday.
52nd Street crew got themselves a new shot caller.
They using kids as corner boys again.
You know who?
Oh, yeah.
- You talk to the cops?
- What?
- The police.
You talk to the police?
- Please.
I got more use for a back pocket on my shirt.
'Cause what you're asking me to do, I don't do that anymore.
John, this is me asking.
And I know you know better than to ask me...
Your big brother.
Your own flesh and blood.
You done?
13 years old.
I understand.
Believe me.
I understand.
But you gotta work within the system on this.
Is that what I was supposed to say this afternoon at the funeral?
Isn't it your job to pray at the funeral?
_
Hey.
- You speak English?
- Please, let me go.
You're coming with us.
Okay, okay.
Gun.
We gotta keep him alive.
Yuri.
Real name or code name?
Real name.
Who are you?
CIA?
- You wish.
- Please.
What happened in Keykino, I had nothing to do with that.
Why didn't you show up?
It's complicated.
So boil it down.
Complicated and personal.
We got a tail.
_
- FSB.
- They with you?
No.
Please.
They must not see me.
I knew it.
They found out about me.
Now they kill me too.
Found out about what?
That I was trying to defect to CIA.
Two CIA officers were killed.
- Langley says you set them up.
- No, I didn't do that.
I swear on...
If they knew about the two CIA officers and the meeting place,
- why didn't they know about you?
- I don't know.
But now they do.
Look!
He was about to swear on someone's life.
- Ask him who.
- Sierra, this is Zero.
Question.
Can it wait a sec?
Roger.
12 minutes to Foxtrot Oscar.
Roger. 12 minutes.
Standing by.
Foxtrot Oscar.
What is... what is fox...
- Airplane out of here.
- What...
I can't leave Russia.
I thought you wanted to defect.
I got this.
Hey!
Get your ass back here!
Shooting Russian agents on Russian soil is an act of war.
- I'm telling you, he's playing us.
- I'm not playing you.
I swear.
Zero, this is Romeo.
Moving to the shrug now.
I do want to get out of Russia, yes, but I can't.
Why not?
Not without my girlfriend.
Your girlfriend?
There was no mention of a girlfriend to the CIA.
Well, no, because she is the wife of my superior officer,
Colonel Sergei Kuznikov.
What, you thought you'd just spring her on the CIA?
She got scared last second and wouldn't come to Keykino.
Anyone buying this crap?
She couldn't come.
Please.
It's true.
On Tatjana's...
That's her name:
Tatjana.
I swear on her life.
86 the extraction.
Stand by for further instructions.
- What?
- You heard.
We ain't done here yet.
Yuri's having an affair with Tatjana Kuznikov?
You had no idea.
- No.
None.
- Well, maybe she's the problem.
Kuznikov used her to get to Yuri.
Some vodka, a little pillow talk?
Suppose for a minute that neither Yuri nor Tatjana Kuznikov are responsible for the Keykino ambush.
Who else knew Yuri's identity?
Me and Pulowski and McFaddyen, that's it.
So no one else at Moscow Station or Langley knew anything at all about Yuri or the meeting at Keykino?
Not even Sy.
Okay.
Gretchen, I'm gonna need your help around the clock as I move my people through Saint Petersburg.
Of course.
Anything you need.
Move your people around doing exactly what?
What do you know about Kuznikov?
A nasty piece of work.
Backroom bully who rose through the ranks
- putting the wood to the Chechens.
- Anything else?
Our hands are pretty full right now with Russian activity in Syria, Iran, and Ukraine.
Khalid Murvan.
A Chechen activist rumored to have been kidnapped, tortured, and killed by Kuznikov last month.
Where did you get that?
A friend in German intelligence.
Are you crazy?
You kill FSB officers in the middle of Saint Petersburg!
You think you can get away with that?
For your hands.
Boss says to get the Colonel's wife.
You speak Chechen?
Wait.
No.
Tatjana, you don't understand.
She won't.
Do you speak Chechen:
Yes or no?
Yes.
- Some.
- Good.
You're gonna teach him a few words.
- Me?
- You.
We're going to need a safe house to debrief Tatjana.
Preferably one that you and only you know about.
We all have one of those.
For a rainy day.
_
_
Gonna deactivate the alarm system with what'll look like a routine software update.
No red flags.
Buys you ten minutes.
Hit it.
Three, two, one.
Roger.
We're a go.
Wait.
Take this.
She gave it to me.
Does Tatjana speak any English?
Yes, yes, she speaks it well.
- Can I tell you something?
- We gotta move.
- What is it?
- Becca.
Please...
Don't hurt her.
You all know Brant Pope,
Divisional Director of Eastern Europe.
Just in time.
Have a seat.
Bravo and Victor are in position.
Here we go.
Yuri's outside.
Okay?
Are you the CIA?
Cousins.
Plate check.
Send.
Kilo, eight, four, one, hotel.
I can't go with you.
- Sure you can.
- Come on.
Come on.
It's Colonel Kuznikov.
I thought you said you had eyes on the SVR building.
Maybe he came from somewhere else.
Bravo, Roger.
We gotta move now.
_
- We can't kill Kuznikov.
- He knows.
- That's heat we don't need.
- He knows.
We have one more problem.
She's pregnant.
Oh, come on.
You gotta laugh.
Scott, Tatjana.
Tatjana, Scott.
How many months?
Too many.
How is she?
She's fine.
Sorry to keep you.
Hello, Brant.
Christina.
I'm impressed.
I presume you're here to watch your back in your time of need.
He's here because I asked him to be here
- as her Divisional Director.
- Anything I should know?
You guys figure that out yet?
You gotta turn the power on first.
You all right?
Where's this Mook at?
_
False alarm?
Maybe.
Please.
Let me go to her.
Why didn't you tell us she was pregnant?
I didn't think that you would go and rescue her.
Lives being on the line and all.
Did you tell her about Keykino?
Yes, of course I did.
What, do you think that she is the one who told Kuznikov?
Do you mean her husband?
She would never do that.
She hates him.
He... he beats her for no reason.
Can you imagine what a man like that would do to her if he found out that the baby isn't his?
So why did she change her mind the other day?
The doctor put her on bed rest.
'Cause her pregnancy is at risk.
Please, can I see her now?
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking...
The SVR Colonel showing up unannounced back there...
Has got me thinking.
Yes?
Yuri!
Yuri says America is a beautiful place for a little girl to grow up.
You can handle that tonight, man.
Hey, lookit here, though.
Who this?
You need to leave the kids alone.
Who are you?
My name's John.
Bye, John.
Leave the kids alone.
Last time I tell you that.
I got two.
You?
One.
- Two.
- What?
Zero, it's Sierra.
We got incoming.
- Again.
- Ping John.
Get him in here.
All call signs, we got another situation.
Radio silence till further notice.
It's time to get Yuri and Tatjana out of here.
- Get up.
- Careful.
She's meant to be on bed rest.
_
Get Oscar Vertanan on a secure line.
- Who's Oscar Vertanan?
- An Asset.
Oil man from Finland who flies in and out of Saint Petersburg every week on his company helicopter, no questions asked.
How solid?
I got his daughter into Harvard.
Do it.
Which is the secure line?
All of them.
You, you, my office.
Come on.
This way.
Come on.
Okay!
Is it safe?
Come on.
We're going to Finland.
Contractions are getting closer!
You have to do something!
You want to get out and start directing traffic yourself, be my guest.
Oof.
Been there, done that.
Feel your pain, bro.
His pain?
You got kids?
- Get us out of here, Rem.
Let's go.
- Screw this.
Hold on!
What is it, Riley?
This Oscar Vertanan.
I just wonder if, with everything that's happened, we should be trusting other people's Assets.
Or trusting other people, period.
Right.
We're in.
Is that John?
Well, what do you know?
Bunch of secret crap that never should have gotten out of Langley
- buried deep in the hard drive.
- I think that's it.
Okay, we're good.
It's a private airfield.
Main gate to the west.
Vertanan's taking care of the security people.
How?
Money talks, young lady.
Money talks, especially in Russia.
Talk later.
Stay by your phone.
- Where have you been?
- Bathroom.
Who was that?
Our embassy in Helsinki.
They're scrambling an
- ambulance and a doctor.
- Thought we agreed to limit exposure.
They think it's for one of my staff.
It's fine.
What's going on?
She's also up to her neck in debt.
- Sick mother.
- Where was all this?
Her computer.
I mean, where was the computer?
Rolltop desk.
What's in her safe?
Didn't want to mess with it.
Not enough time.
Figured this was enough to be going in with.
They're three minutes from the airfield.
Vertanan's waiting on the helicopter.
Engine's running, security's on site.
There's that money talking.
Sierra, this is Zero.
Sierra, send.
We do this by the book.
We don't need another Srebrenica.
Sierra, Roger.
Out.
- What happened in Srebrenica?
- Nothing good.
You got your SVR card on you, Yuri?
Stop, stop.
_
_
_
Zero, this is Victor.
On final approach to airfield now.
Contact.
Ambush.
Son of a bitch.
The Russian military was waiting for us on the bird.
You want to really know what happened in Srebrenica?
We hunted down a mole.
Where did you find them?
Your home computer.
You broke into my house.
First there's the two CIA officers sold out to the Russians.
Then there's a near miss at Colonel Kuznikov's.
Then there's the fiasco at the safe house that you gave us.
You broke into my house and my home computer.
- And you planted these files.
- You know we didn't do that.
Put me on a polygraph.
Polygraph?
Like you never trained for that?
Then I want a lawyer.
If that's how you want to play it.
And I mean in the next hour.
- Not three days from now.
- Oh, trust me.
We're in a hurry too.
So what now?
Maybe you should take a run at her, sir.
Sure, I can do that.
What happened to having her back?
You're the one with folks in a bind in Russia.
Where I was raised, those in the field come first.
You're right.
Let's do this.
The good news is...
Your wife's having the baby.
Better news is, it's not yours.
Drive.
_
Gretchen.
Brant, this...
I didn't do this.
We know.
What?
Give us the room, please, Gretchen.
Sit down, Brant.
- Excuse me?
- Sir.
- I am the Divisional Director...
- Sit.
If Gretchen sold out her own officers, then why not give up Yuri too?
See, that doesn't make any sense, which means whoever gave up those guys didn't yet know Yuri's identity.
You just found reams of secret CIA communiqués in her home.
But they did have access to movement orders, plans, and reports of the officers in Moscow Station.
Seriously?
Someone, say, like their Divisional Director.
- Little desperate, are we?
- If Gretchen was taking
Russian money to pay her mother's medical bills, then why is she still in debt?
And why leave documents like that on her computer in her desk when she has a state-of-the-art safe?
- You need to ask her.
- Like you said, I've got my people in the field, and time is running out.
I wasn't even involved in this operation.
- Until...
- Until Kuznikov showed up at his home at exactly the right time.
Gretchen waited until she wasn't the only suspect.
She's smart.
So why isn't she pointing the finger at you?
Treason is front page stuff, Brant.
It doesn't just end your career.
It ruins your family for generations.
And then there's your son, Robert.
How does Robert live with that level of shame?
Sit down.
He's a bright boy, Robert.
He's got a bright future.
Unless, of course, this kind of behavior runs in the family.
But let's give him the benefit of a doubt for now.
So either I leak your arrest and you watch the bottom slowly drop out of Robert's world, or...
What is that?
Natural causes.
You have two minutes to decide.
You can't do this.
For our folks in the field?
You kidding?
Reestablish comms with the team.
We have our mole.
Why, Brant?
Money.
Money talks.
Robert's stronger than me.
He takes after his mom.
He'll be okay.
Let's hope so.
Harmless.
Saline.
No, no, no.
No.
We had a deal.
Please!
Please!
_
Take her hand.

Why me?

Let me go to her.
Why didn't you tell us she was pregnant?
I didn't think that you would go and rescue her.
Lives being on the line and all.
Did you tell her about Keykino?
Yes, of course I did.
What, do you think that she is the one who told Kuznikov?
Do you mean her husband?
She would never do that.
She hates him.
He... he beats her for no reason.
Can you imagine what a man like that would do to her if he found out that the baby isn't his?
So why did she change her mind the other day?
The doctor put her on bed rest.
'Cause her pregnancy is at risk.
Please, can I see her now?

Well, what do you know?
Bunch of secret crap that never should have gotten out of Langley

Okay, we're good.

Contact.
Ambush.
Son of a bitch.
The Russian military was waiting for us on the bird.
You want to really know what happened in Srebrenica?
We hunted down a mole.
Where did you find them?
Your home computer.
You broke into my house.
First there's the two CIA officers sold out to the Russians.
Then there's a near miss at Colonel Kuznikov's.
Then there's the fiasco at the safe house that you gave us.
You broke into my house and my home computer.
- And you planted these files.
- You know we didn't do that.
Put me on a polygraph.
Polygraph?
Like you never trained for that?
Then I want a lawyer.
If that's how you want to play it.
And I mean in the next hour.
- Not three days from now.
- Trust me.
We're in a hurry too.
So what now?
Maybe you should take a run at her, sir.
Sure, I can do that.
What happened to having her back?
You're the one with folks in a bind in Russia.
Where I was raised, those in the field come first.
You're right.
Let's do this.
The good news is...
Your wife's having the baby.
Better news is, it's not yours.
Drive.
Gretchen.
Brant, this...
I didn't do this.
We know.
What?
Give us the room, please, Gretchen.
Sit down, Brant.
- Excuse me?
- Sir.
- I am the Divisional Director...
- Sit.
If Gretchen sold out her own officers, then why not give up Yuri too?
See, that doesn't make any sense, which means whoever gave up those guys didn't yet know Yuri's identity.
You just found reams of secret CIA communiqués in her home.
But they did have access to movement orders, plans, and reports of the officers in Moscow Station.
Seriously?
Someone, say, like their Divisional Director.
- Little desperate, are we?
- If Gretchen was taking
Russian money to pay her mother's medical bills, then why is she still in debt?
And why leave documents like that on her computer in her desk when she has a state-of-the-art safe?
- You need to ask her.
- Like you said, I've got my people in the field, and time is running out.
I wasn't even involved in this operation.
- Until...
- Until Kuznikov showed up at his home at exactly the right time.
Gretchen waited until she wasn't the only suspect.
She's smart.
So why isn't she pointing the finger at you?
Treason is front page stuff, Brant.
It doesn't just end your career.
It ruins your family for generations.
And then there's your son, Robert.
How does Robert live with that level of shame?
Sit down.
He's a bright boy, Robert.
He's got a bright future.
Unless, of course, this kind of behavior runs in the family.
But let's give him the benefit of a doubt for now.
So either I leak your arrest and you watch the bottom slowly drop out of Robert's world, or...
What is that?
Natural causes.
You have two minutes to decide.
You can't do this.
For our folks in the field?
You kidding?
Reestablish comms with the team.
We have our mole.
Why, Brant?
Money.
Money talks.
Robert's stronger than me.
He takes after his mom.
He'll be okay.
Let's hope so.
Harmless.
Saline.
No, no, no.
No.
We had a deal.
Please!
Please!
Take her hand.
Why me?
I prayed for a solution, and he...
Gave me you.
I honestly believed you left that life behind a long time ago.
I honestly did.
Problem is, you never believed that I too left it behind.
That is not true.
I'm not the answer to your prayers, George.
You know why?
I don't think you praying right.
I think you praying like some kind of punk-ass hypocrite.
Maybe you should stop praying for solutions and just try harder to be one.
You ready to roll?
You really got kids?
Yep.
They're the reason I do this work.
You're crazy.
That's the other reason.

Do you understand, Miss Lareau, that the proceedings of this chamber are classified secret?
I do.
Miss Lareau, did the two
CIA case officers killed in Russia earlier this morning report to you?
Yes, they did.
And what were they doing in...
Keykino.
They were supposed to be meeting an Asset who had asked for our help to get him out of Russia.
An Asset?
From the SVR, Russia's Intelligence Service.
Yuri.
He wanted to defect?
Correct.
And what is Yuri's particular value?
He claims to know the identity and allegiance of over 300 Russian agents in the United States.
- And who recruited him to defect?
- I did.
For how long?
The last 14 months.
- Both:
So why...
- I'm sorry.
So why weren't you in Keykino to meet him?
Because I was back in Langley for a Divisional Directors meeting.
You scheduled this extraction while you knew you'd be back in D.C.?
Yuri was familiar with Pulowski and McFaddyen.
They had his full confidence.
Or so you thought.
Is it possible Yuri set them up?
Miss Lareau.
Anything is possible.
But if he did set them up, that means that you recruited a double agent.
Yes.
I'm aware.
Thank you.

Then there's the fiasco at the safe house that you gave us.
You broke into my house and my home computer.
- And you planted these files.
- You know we didn't do that.
Put me on a polygraph.
Polygraph?
Like you never trained for that?
Then I want a lawyer.
If that's how you want to play it.
And I mean in the next hour.
- Not three days from now.
- Oh, trust me.
We're in a hurry too.
So what now?
Maybe you should take a run at her, sir.
Sure, I can do that.
What happened to having her back?
You're the one with folks in a bind in Russia.
Where I was raised, those in the field come first.
You're right.
Let's do this.
The good news is...
Your wife's having the baby.
Better news is, it's not yours.
Drive.
[Engine turns over]
_
Gretchen.
Brant, this...
[Clears throat] I didn't do this.
We know.
What?
Give us the room, please, Gretchen.
Sit down, Brant.
- Excuse me?
- Sir.
- I am the Divisional Director...
- Sit.
[Sighs]
If Gretchen sold out her own officers, then why not give up Yuri too?
See, that doesn't make any sense, which means whoever gave up those guys didn't yet know Yuri's identity.
You just found reams of secret CIA communiqués in her home.
But they did have access to movement orders, plans, and reports of the officers in Moscow Station.
Seriously?
Someone, say, like their Divisional Director.
- Little desperate, are we?
- If Gretchen was taking
Russian money to pay her mother's medical bills, then why is she still in debt?
And why leave documents like that on her computer in her desk when she has a state-of-the-art safe?
- You need to ask her.
- Like you said, I've got my people in the field, and time is running out.
I wasn't even involved in this operation.
- Until...
- Until Kuznikov showed up at his home at exactly the right time.
Gretchen waited until she wasn't the only suspect.
She's smart.
So why isn't she pointing the finger at you?
Treason is front page stuff, Brant.
It doesn't just end your career.
It ruins your family for generations.
And then there's your son, Robert.
How does Robert live with that level of shame?
Sit down.
He's a bright boy, Robert.
He's got a bright future.
Unless, of course, this kind of behavior runs in the family.
But let's give him the benefit of a doubt for now.
So either I leak your arrest and you watch the bottom slowly drop out of Robert's world, or...
What is that?
Natural causes.
You have two minutes to decide.
You can't do this.
For our folks in the field?
You kidding?
[Latches snap]
[Tense music]
♪
Reestablish comms with the team.
We have our mole.
[Breathing heavily]
Why, Brant?
Money.
Money talks.
Robert's stronger than me.
He takes after his mom.
He'll be okay.
Let's hope so.
Harmless.
Saline.
No, no, no.
No.
We had a deal.
Please!
[Bangs on door] Please!

I honestly did.
Problem is, you never believed that I too left it behind.
That is not true.
I'm not the answer to your prayers, George.
You know why?
I don't think you praying right.
I think you praying like some kind of punk-ass hypocrite.
Maybe you should stop praying for solutions and just try harder to be one.

You really got kids, huh?
Yep.
They're the reason I do this work.
You're crazy.
That's the other reason.
[Both laugh]
Tatjana.
Where are your bags?
- Yura, I'm scared.
- We already talked about this.
No, I'm really scared.
Aren't you scared?
Let's talk about this in the car.
We really must rush.
My husband is going to kill me.
He's going to kill us.
Once we're gone, there's nothing, absolutely nothing that he can do to us.
He's a Colonel in the SVR, a trained assassin.
For god's sake, you think he's going to just let us go?
The CIA will protect us.
Trust me.
We're going to be safe in United States.
Believe me, we're going to be in a lot of danger if we stay here in Russia.
I can't do this, Yura.
Not today.
What?
What do you mean "not today"?
I shouldn't even be here right now.
Where is he?
You might have a point.
About what?
This not being right.
Get away from the window.
We can't get taken.
Not with what we know about Yuri.
What if it's Yuri who set us up?
You are surrounded!
We know you are CIA!
There's no escape!
You have 30 seconds to surrender!
But what if it wasn't him?
How else did this happen?
What if they've already rolled Yuri up?
- What if, what if?
- Do you really want to die?
If Yuri's still a live Asset.
- You want to die.
- We have to protect him.
Don't do this.
Please?
Joan.
There has to be another way out of this.
Five!
Four!
- God, I hope you're right.
- Three!
Two!
I can't do this.
I'm sorry.
Hey, who got...
Who's on shorty?
Remi, you sleeping again?
- Hey.
- Come on.
What the hell was that?
Ho, ho, ho.
Easy, boys.
Easy, boys.
- It's just a game.
- What's up with you?
You hurt?
We all just having a good time here, right?
Right.
Please say your name and job title.
Uh, Gretchen Lareau, Deputy Chief Moscow Station.
Do you understand, Miss Lareau, that the proceedings of this chamber are classified secret?
I do.
Miss Lareau, did the two
CIA case officers killed in Russia earlier this morning report to you?
Yes, they did.
And what were they doing in...
Keykino.
They were supposed to be meeting an Asset who had asked for our help to get him out of Russia.
An Asset?
From the SVR, Russia's Intelligence Service.
Yuri.
He wanted to defect?
Correct.
And what is Yuri's particular value?
He claims to know the identity and allegiance of over 300 Russian agents in the United States.
- And who recruited him to defect?
- I did.
For how long?
The last 14 months.
- So why...
- I'm sorry.
So why weren't you in Keykino to meet him?
Because I was back in Langley for a Divisional Directors meeting.
You scheduled this extraction while you knew you'd be back in D.C.?
Yuri was familiar with Pulowski and McFaddyen.
They had his full confidence.
Or so you thought.
Is it possible Yuri set them up?
Miss Lareau.
Anything is possible.
But if he did set them up, that means that you recruited a double agent.
Yes.
I'm aware.
Thank you.
Which means now somebody has to go find him.
What are you doing?
We're in the middle of a game here.
Where you going?
Ball game's over, boys.
You got this, bro.
Feel better.
Make sure that hole in your side heals quick.
Keep your heads down.
I'll be with you in spirit.
Hey, you ain't sat out a game since you had your tonsils out when you was six.
Appendix.
And I was nine.
All right.
So what's it now?
Nothing.
I'ma be fine.
Come on.
I want to show you something.
Hello, Edna.
Pastor George.
Flowers look beautiful.
Keyshawn Willis.
13 years old.
Killed in a drive-by Thursday.
52nd Street crew got themselves a new shot caller.
They using kids as corner boys again.
You know who?
Oh, yeah.
- You talk to the cops?
- What?
- The police.
You talk to the police?
- Please.
I got more use for a back pocket on my shirt.
'Cause what you're asking me to do, I don't do that anymore.
John, this is me asking.
And I know you know better than to ask me...
Your big brother.
Your own flesh and blood.
You done?
13 years old.
I understand.
Believe me.
I understand.
But you gotta work within the system on this.
Is that what I was supposed to say this afternoon at the funeral?
Isn't it your job to pray at the funeral?
Hey.
- You speak English?
- Please, let me go.
You're coming with us.
Okay, okay.
Gun.
We gotta keep him alive.
Yuri.
Real name or code name?
Real name.
Who are you?
CIA?
- You wish.
- Please.
What happened in Keykino, I had nothing to do with that.
Why didn't you show up?
It's complicated.
So boil it down.
Complicated and personal.
We got a tail.
- FSB.
- They with you?
No.
Please.
They must not see me.
I knew it.
They found out about me.
Now they kill me too.
Found out about what?
That I was trying to defect to CIA.
Two CIA officers were killed.
- Langley says you set them up.
- No, I didn't do that.
I swear on...
If they knew about the two CIA officers and the meeting place,
- why didn't they know about you?
- I don't know.
But now they do.
Look!
He was about to swear on someone's life.
- Ask him who.
- Sierra, this is Zero.
Question.
Can it wait a sec?
Roger.
12 minutes to Foxtrot Oscar.
Roger. 12 minutes.
Standing by.
Foxtrot Oscar.
What is... what is fox...
- Airplane out of here.
- What...
I can't leave Russia.
I thought you wanted to defect.
I got this.
Hey!
Get your ass back here!
Shooting Russian agents on Russian soil is an act of war.
- I'm telling you, he's playing us.
- I'm not playing you.
I swear.
Zero, this is Romeo.
Moving to the shrug now.
I do want to get out of Russia, yes, but I can't.
Why not?
Not without my girlfriend.
Your girlfriend?
There was no mention of a girlfriend to the CIA.
Well, no, because she is the wife of my superior officer,
Colonel Sergei Kuznikov.
What, you thought you'd just spring her on the CIA?
She got scared last second and wouldn't come to Keykino.
Anyone buying this crap?
She couldn't come.
Please.
It's true.
On Tatjana's...
That's her name:
Tatjana.
I swear on her life.
86 the extraction.
Stand by for further instructions.
- What?
- You heard.
We ain't done here yet.
Yuri's having an affair with Tatjana Kuznikov?
You had no idea.
- No.
None.
- Well, maybe she's the problem.
Kuznikov used her to get to Yuri.
Some vodka, a little pillow talk?
Suppose for a minute that neither Yuri nor Tatjana Kuznikov are responsible for the Keykino ambush.
Who else knew Yuri's identity?
Me and Pulowski and McFaddyen, that's it.
So no one else at Moscow Station or Langley knew anything at all about Yuri or the meeting at Keykino?
Not even Sy.
Okay.
Gretchen, I'm gonna need your help around the clock as I move my people through Saint Petersburg.
Of course.
Anything you need.
Move your people around doing exactly what?
What do you know about Kuznikov?
A nasty piece of work.
Backroom bully who rose through the ranks
- putting the wood to the Chechens.
- Anything else?
Our hands are pretty full right now with Russian activity in Syria, Iran, and Ukraine.
Khalid Murvan.
A Chechen activist rumored to have been kidnapped, tortured, and killed by Kuznikov last month.
Where did you get that?
A friend in German intelligence.
Are you crazy?
You kill FSB officers in the middle of Saint Petersburg!
You think you can get away with that?
For your hands.
Boss says to get the Colonel's wife.
You speak Chechen?
Wait.
No.
Tatjana, you don't understand.
She won't.
Do you speak Chechen:
Yes or no?
Yes.
- Some.
- Good.
You're gonna teach him a few words.
- Me?
- You.
We're going to need a safe house to debrief Tatjana.
Preferably one that you and only you know about.
We all have one of those.
For a rainy day.
Gonna deactivate the alarm system with what'll look like a routine software update.
No red flags.
Buys you ten minutes.
Hit it.
Three, two, one.
Roger.
We're a go.
Wait.
Take this.
She gave it to me.
Does Tatjana speak any English?
Yes, yes, she speaks it well.
- Can I tell you something?
- We gotta move.
- What is it?
- Becca.
Please...
Don't hurt her.
You all know Brant Pope,
Divisional Director of Eastern Europe.
Just in time.
Have a seat.
Bravo and Victor are in position.
Here we go.
Yuri's outside.
Okay?
Are you the CIA?
Cousins.
Plate check.
Send.
Kilo, eight, four, one, hotel.
I can't go with you.
- Sure you can.
- Come on.
Come on.
It's Colonel Kuznikov.
I thought you said you had eyes on the SVR building.
Maybe he came from somewhere else.
Bravo, Roger.
We gotta move now.
- We can't kill Kuznikov.
- He knows.
- That's heat we don't need.
- He knows.
We have one more problem.
She's pregnant.
Oh, come on.
You gotta laugh.
Scott, Tatjana.
Tatjana, Scott.
How many months?
Too many.
How is she?
She's fine.
Sorry to keep you.
Hello, Brant.
Christina.
I'm impressed.
I presume you're here to watch your back in your time of need.
He's here because I asked him to be here
- as her Divisional Director.
- Anything I should know?
You guys figure that out yet?
You gotta turn the power on first.
You all right?
Where's this Mook at?
False alarm?
Maybe.
Please.
Let me go to her.
Why didn't you tell us she was pregnant?
I didn't think that you would go and rescue her.
Lives being on the line and all.
Did you tell her about Keykino?
Yes, of course I did.
What, do you think that she is the one who told Kuznikov?
Do you mean her husband?
She would never do that.
She hates him.
He... he beats her for no reason.
Can you imagine what a man like that would do to her if he found out that the baby isn't his?
So why did she change her mind the other day?
The doctor put her on bed rest.
'Cause her pregnancy is at risk.
Please, can I see her now?
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking...
The SVR Colonel showing up unannounced back there...
Has got me thinking.
Yes?
Yuri!
Yuri says America is a beautiful place for a little girl to grow up.
You can handle that tonight, man.
Hey, lookit here, though.
Who this?
You need to leave the kids alone.
Who are you?
My name's John.
Bye, John.
Leave the kids alone.
Last time I tell you that.
I got two.
You?
One.
- Two.
- What?
Zero, it's Sierra.
We got incoming.
- Again.
- Ping John.
Get him in here.
All call signs, we got another situation.
Radio silence till further notice.
It's time to get Yuri and Tatjana out of here.
- Get up.
- Careful.
She's meant to be on bed rest.
Get Oscar Virtanen on a secure line.
- Who's Oscar Virtanen?
- An Asset.
Oil man from Finland who flies in and out of Saint Petersburg every week on his company helicopter, no questions asked.
How solid?
I got his daughter into Harvard.
Do it.
Which is the secure line?
All of them.
You, you, my office.
Come on.
This way.
Come on.
Okay!
Is it safe?
Come on.
We're going to Finland.
Contractions are getting closer!
You have to do something!
You want to get out and start directing traffic yourself, be my guest.
Oof.
Been there, done that.
Feel your pain, bro.
His pain?
You got kids?
- Get us out of here, Rem.
Let's go.
- Screw this.
Hold on!
What is it, Riley?
This Oscar Virtanen.
I just wonder if, with everything that's happened, we should be trusting other people's Assets.
Or trusting other people, period.
Right.
We're in.
Is that John?
Well, what do you know?
Bunch of secret crap that never should have gotten out of Langley
- buried deep in the hard drive.
- I think that's it.
Okay, we're good.
It's a private airfield.
Main gate to the west.
Virtanen's taking care of the security people.
How?
Money talks, young lady.
Money talks, especially in Russia.
Talk later.
Stay by your phone.
- Where have you been?
- Bathroom.
Who was that?
Our embassy in Helsinki.
They're scrambling an
- ambulance and a doctor.
- Thought we agreed to limit exposure.
They think it's for one of my staff.
It's fine.
What's going on?
She's also up to her neck in debt.
- Sick mother.
- Where was all this?
Her computer.
I mean, where was the computer?
Rolltop desk.
What's in her safe?
Didn't want to mess with it.
Not enough time.
Figured this was enough to be going in with.
They're three minutes from the airfield.
Virtanen's waiting on the helicopter.
Engine's running, security's on site.
There's that money talking.
Sierra, this is Zero.
Sierra, send.
We do this by the book.
We don't need another Srebrenica.
Sierra, Roger.
Out.
- What happened in Srebrenica?
- Nothing good.
You got your SVR card on you, Yuri?
Stop, stop.
Zero, this is Victor.
On final approach to airfield now.
Contact.
Ambush.
Son of a bitch.
The Russian military was waiting for us on the bird.
You want to really know what happened in Srebrenica?
We hunted down a mole.
Where did you find them?
Your home computer.
You broke into my house.
First there's the two CIA officers sold out to the Russians.
Then there's a near miss at Colonel Kuznikov's.
Then there's the fiasco at the safe house that you gave us.
You broke into my house and my home computer.
- And you planted these files.
- You know we didn't do that.
Put me on a polygraph.

Was that a rat?
I'm having a problem with my basement. vermin are getting in.
Will there be more?
I've put some of that poison you had in the box,
I put some of that down in a couple of saucers, so just be careful.
Yeah, who were those girls helping you put flyers in the doors earlier?
- They're my cousins, yeah, yeah...
- Look, I've never done this before.
I have never, ever slept with a man I've just met.
This is madness.
What would they say if they knew you were living in a garage?
It's all I can afford.
You're pathetic!
Stop it!
Stop mauling me, will you?
- A teacher?
What does he teach?
- PE.
Strong, good-looking fella.
Who is this?
'Just a friend.
'Let me protect you.'
Just give it to me!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God...!
Any sign of a note?
Not so far.
And did he seem in any kind of trouble to you?
- You'll have to talk to his wife.
- We are,
- but we're talking to you, too, so...
- I just wish I'd answered the phone!
(Paula.)
Paula?
They found my leg bent backwards.
Uh...
Who is it?
Do you want a cup of tea?
Just say it, Diane.
Just say it.
I'm not like you, Paula.
- No-one meant to hurt anyone.
- Yeah?
For some reason, I can't help thinking you opened up a door into his life and let all the bad things in.
I'm sorry, all right?
I'm sorry.
- What's going on here?
- Promotion list's out.
- Fucking McGlynn?
!
- You need to open your post from time to time, Mac.
- He's your new boss.
- Jesus Christ!
Right, "Injury consistent with a fall." No note?
No.
There was a phone message.
There you go.
To the wife?
No, his...
The one at work.
Paula Denny.
Service provider puts her phone at home all night.
His phone never went near her house.
Your call, Inspector.
Want us to keep digging?
Nah, looks like a jumper to me, Mac.
I need to get a message to James Morecroft, please.
I'd like him to price a job for me.
The address is quite tricky.
I'd need to meet him somewhere.
Do you know De Burca Square?
Outside the pub on the corner, at five?
You all right?
You waiting here long?
Only just told me you'd arrived.
Well, um...
There's no-one in here, we can...
Thanks.
So, your message said you wanted to talk to me.
Look, I know this is maybe kind of...
I think there may a be few things missing... to do with Philip.
- Missing from your house?
- Yes.
- What kind of things?
To do with me and Philip.
Personal stuff.
Cards, notes.
Could Philip have taken them?
Taken them back?
I don't think he would have.
He's not...
He wasn't like that.
Excuse me.
I have to...
Hello, Laurence.
Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
- Get out of here?
- Yeah.
Come on.
Thank you.
Skinny latte, cappuccino.
Thanks.
So, this guy said he'd fix up the basement - get rid of the rats.
- Yeah.
- What was his name?
Oh, um...
Here.
James Morecroft -- that's his address.
Any money missing?
Any jewellery?
No, not that I'm...
OK, but he might have been looking through your... personal...
I slept with him, OK?
- Philip?
- No.
I mean, yeah, but...
- The... builder?
- Yeah.
- As well?
- Yeah.
- I know it was a stupid thing to do, I'm not...
- No, I, um...
- When he came back, I think he wanted to...
He thought we were...
- Right.
- Jesus, will you stop fucking writing this all down?
- Sorry, I...
Actually, I wasn't.
I don't know what I'm writing.
Was he ever alone in the house?
- Just for a few minutes because...
because Philip arrived.
- Right.
- I went out to Philip's car, you know, breaking up with him.
- Right.
Jesus, I can't believe I'm fucking saying all this.
- If you prefer, you can speak with a female colleague.
- No, it's fine.
Can I keep hold of this?
I'm just writing his name down, that's all.
Where'd you go?
Couldn't hear a bleeding thing.
So, where'd you go?
MaGee's.
What?
!
For lunch?
No, just a coffee.
You can't fucking work in here.
- Did you caution her?
- Caution her?
She was making a complaint.
I couldn't hear anything.
Anyway, she's fucking mad.
YOU'RE fucking mad!
Did you get a written statement?
Here.
What's this?
Builder was working in her house.
- What, you want ME to check him out?
- Only if you have time.
Excuse me, you've dropped your boot.
Oh!
Thank you.
Should I put it on for you?
You've got your hands full.
Hello!
- No?
- No.
- No?
- Do you want some...
Have a bit of toast?
- No, no.
Oh, come on.
No?
How'd you get on?
Yeah, fine.

Don't lie to me again, OK.
You'll just make it worse for yourself.

Morgan....
Who were you talking to in the park today?
There was a woman talking to you.
She was asking me about burglaries.
What about burglaries?
She said there was burglaries in the area
- and she was asking people about it.
- Who was she?
- She was a garda!
- I told you!
She just asked me if we'd seen anything or heard anything.
- Who's "we"?
- What?
- You said she asked if we'd seen anything.
Was she talking about you or was she talking about us?
No, like, just if we'd...
- But you said "we".
- No...
Just...
- Was she asking about us?
- No!
No?
Well, that's not what you said.
- OK.
All right.
What did you tell her?
- She asked me where I lived.
And I was scared cos she was looking at my earrings.
- Don't mind your fucking earrings!
- Will you go to Shauna?
- Did she say something, you know, about the earrings?
- No!
- So, what did you tell her?
- Just that we lived on this street.
Who's "we", though?
You keep saying "we"!
- Me and Shauna!
- Did she ask about me?
- No!
- No?
She was talking to her for fucking ages.
She was asking me about Shauna.
- She was just being nice.
- See, this is what we have to deal with!
- Yeah, all right.
- So, what are you going to do about it?
- All right!
- Nothing?
- I said all right!
- It's all right, Shauna!
Mammy's coming!
- Well, I'll tell you, there's no way that's all they were talking about.
- James, are you listening to me?
- What?
What?
They were talking for fucking ages!
- Will you both just fucking leave me alone?
- What did I do?
Drive me round the fucking twist!
Yeah, just walk away!
What the fuck am I supposed to do with her?

I'm sorry, Paula.
I don't want to do this any more.
I don't want to have to deal with this.
I don't know what to say any more.
What is it?
Bad dreams, Mum.
What?
Just bad dreams.
Can I stay here tonight?
OK.
Don't upset your father.
Of course, we can do it over lunch, why wouldn't we?
You see this?
Hang on one minute, Charlie, will ya?
- Philip Byrden withdrew 1,500 quid the night he went missing.
- And?
- There was no money on the body.
- Could he have posted it to his kids?
- What?
When?
- Could he have had an envelope
- and some stamps with him?
- I don't know!
Or couldn't he have just stuck it through somebody's letterbox?
Who are we looking for here -
- Postman Pat?
!
Why are we looking for anyone, Mac?
I don't know!
Maybe someone was putting the squeeze on him.
Three jumpers at the bottom of that quarry in the last two years.
Yeah, I know, but you don't think...
- .. that there's something just a little bit...?
- Charlie.
- Mac?
Yeah.
No, nothing.
It's fine, mate.
In this experiment, it's advisable to use the minimum amount of solvent possible.
Can anyone tell me why?
Daly?
- To maximise the yield?
- Exactly so.
So, the benzoic acid does not remain in solution on cooling.
Now, who's going to tell me, is benzoic acid an ionic or a covalent compound?
Anyone?
Covalent?
You're having a field day, Daly.
I want this experiment written up for next time.
You have no other homework for the weekend.
Make sure you clear everything away, please!
Boys, boys, boys!
Thanks.
[What?
]
Yeah.
And the CCTV?
Let me call you back.
- James Morecroft -- did you arrest him?
No?
- We didn't, no.
My partner's been looking into him, but...
Yeah, fucking great.
I found that... on my windscreen.
Hello.
Let me give you a hand there.
- Yeah, all right, thank you.
- No bother.
Is James about?
- No, sorry, I don't know where he is.
- Well, if you had a sec,
- I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.
- I have to feed the kids.
We can do it here, or we can do it at the station.
All right, let's do it here.
When did you last see James?
A few nights ago.
What's "a few"?
Two nights ago.
- Know when he'll be back?
- No.
Sometimes he gets work off down the country.
You don't know where?
He works in different places.
I didn't ask him.
Who's number's this on the flyer?
That's mine.
Can I get HIS number off you?
What's he done?
I didn't say he'd done anything.
Well...
You know where he was on the evening of Thursday the 24th of last month?
- Yeah, he was here.
- You know that just off the top of your head?
He's always here if he's not working down the country.
We don't go out.
We're always here in the evenings.
- Who else lives here?
- Just me and him.
And the kids.
- These all your kids?
- Yeah.
- These two look very close in age.
- Yeah, they are. 10 months.
- Right.
- Yeah.
James, the father?
Yeah, he's all their fathers.
There isn't anyone else lives here?
- Or stays here?
- No.
- Let me get his number from you before I go.
- Yeah.
Here.
It's the pipes.
It's just an air block.
Shh!
What, are you a plumber, as well?
Stay back.
- No.
That's private.
- Stay there!
If you open one door in here without a warrant,
- I'll sue you in the High Court!
- What's in here?

Stay away from there, you hear me?

Aggh!
Jesus Christ!
Ah, fuck you!

Stay there!
Don't go in there!
No, fuck!
Don't go in there!

- Who's taking the kids?
- Social services.
- Anything?
- Building supplies receipts, invoices.
This is recent.
An estimate for a job he did out in Howth.
Good, bring all that.
I'll go out there in the morning.
Maybe he's still turning up for work.
Maybe I'll go and talk to the mother, see if she can tell us anything useful.
Let's get out of here.
Fucking place gives me the creeps.
Thanks.
(Hi.)
(Do you want a coffee?
)
Paula says yous have an idea who did this to Callum?
We're looking for someone.
Might know more tomorrow.
Boss I had in work said to me one time...
.."Don't worry about your kids getting older.
"You won't lose them.
"They actually grow towards you."
That's not my experience.
What's the word... from the doctor?
Touch and go.
Sure, what can you expect?
Living in a garage down an alleyway?
Sure... .. you've already thrown your life half away, haven't you?
I don't know.
People start again, you know?
Hmm.
Few and far between, I'd say.
I haven't had me daughter fall asleep on me for a very long time.
You can't tell anyone this, OK?
I was in James Morecroft's flat today.
He's been living with two women.
- His cousins.
- What?
He tells everyone they're his cousins.
Well, they both have kids for him.
Yeah.
- One of them had the other one locked in a cupboard.
- What?
!
You can't tell anyone this, OK?
- In a cupboard where?
!
- Where they live.
Fucking hell!
I mean...
You're going to catch him, right?
Tell me you're going to catch him?
If it was just down to me, there'd be no doubt in my mind.
But right now, it's only me and Laurence on this
- because our boss, he...
His priorities...
- Unbelievable!
I could kill him.
If they told me it was all legal --
I could have an hour in a room with this guy, and I wouldn't want him chained up, either.
Want to fight him.
Fucking kill him.
I know.
I can understand that.
Or keep him in a box... .. and feed him.
That's a natural emotion.
You wouldn't be normal if you didn't want to.
You know, last night I woke up,
- and I'd actually left my front door wide open.
- What?
At least I hope I did.
Well, I hope you didn't!
I dreamt he'd come in.
He was standing right there, watching me.
Do you want to me to come in?
I need to get something to eat.
Are you listening to me pee?
No.
I just...
This is nuts and you're right to be angry.
I should be, but I'm not.
I don't know what I am.
I know I should have listened to you, and I know I didn't.
And I was wrong.
And I'm sorry.
It's OK.
It's not your fault.
I should just go.
Yeah.
Morning, Miss Denny?
Yes.
Hi, hello.
It's just the door underneath the stairs there?
- Mr Hogan?
- Yes.
- Detective Sergeant McArthur.
Mrs Morecroft?
- Did you get my message?
- Yeah, what was it?
- Forensics on the fire in Callum Denny's garage.
- Yeah?
"Impossible, at this point, to determine
"the exact point of ignition
"due to the widespread presence of serious accelerants,
"intoxication of the injured person, who is a smoker,
"allied to the extensive damage to the..." Blah, blah, blah...
He did it to himself?
They do stress it's not conclusive.
Brilliant(!
)
Any sign of James Morecroft?
I saw his mother today, she's gaga.
No idea what we were talking about.
You heading down to the party?
The Christmas party, in the club?
Oh.
No, probably not.
I was just going to order some noodles if you want some.
Nah, I'd better...
Where you going to be at Christmas anyway?
Marianne's got the girls so... home, probably.
- In your flat?
- Yeah.
With one of those little meals for one you get in Tesco's?
- What's wrong with that?
- No, sounds good.
- I'm going to...
- Yeah.
Have a good one.
Yeah, you too.
(I'm sorry.)
- Hi.
- Hi.
- How's he doing?
- Yeah, he's...
- Where's your folks?
- I sent them home.
- Maybe you should get some sleep, too.
- I'm sleeping here.
- Have you eaten?
- I'll get something.
Do you want to get out of here for an hour?
Take a break?
- Oh, I fucking hate Christmas.
- I know.
- I fucking hate it, too.
- And New Year's Eve?
- I mean, what the fuck is all that about?
!
- Oh, I know!
I fucking hate New Year's Eve!
What is that?
!
It's so fucking stupid!
Jesus fucking Christ!
Thanks.
Anything else?
Just the bill.
Thanks.
Listen... .. you do know that after everything you've been through, it would be recommended that you really try to see someone like a counsellor.
Nah.
I'll be all right.
I'll tell you why?
Because I don't have feelings, Mac.
- Not proper ones.
- Right.
I'm serious.
It's like I know the whole world is there, but I'm not interested in any of it.
- Can you live like that?
- Yeah.
I can.
When I was 12, Callum...
Callum and I...
.. camped out one night in the back garden.
I was always a...
My favourite thing was to be a prisoner.
I was always wanting to be locked up and I didn't care if I was ever rescued or not.
And Callum... .. practised his knots on me.
Anyway, we were camping in the tent and I...
.. I got Callum... .. to put the skipping rope around my neck and pull it really tight, and tighter...
I mean, kids, they do that sort of stuff.
And...
I passed out.
I was completely gone, but it was the strangest thing because...
.. I went to some other place, like some other city in a different, older time, and I lived with another family.
And they really loved me.
I lived with them for years.
I grew up with them, and... .. it was like this life had all just been...
.. a fucking bad dream.
And then I woke up on the kitchen table at home.
My father had revived me, I was back... five minutes later.
But I had been away for years, Mac, like, I really had.
OK.
Will I tell you the weird part?
There's a weird part to this(?
)
When I'm with someone... physically...
.. in some ways, I can see it all again... .. where I was.
Gets me into trouble, Mac.
So, what about your partner?
Laurence, is that her name?
- That's her surname.
- You know she's mad about you.
- Don't say that.
- What, you just block it out?
- No, you're...
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.
- You don't even know her.
I don't know you either but I'm not wrong.
What's her first name?
Ruth.
We'd better get you back.
Thanks.
I'll take care of this.
Yeah.
I'm just going to...
Yeah.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

Stop him!
Get him!
Stop him!
Stop!

Ugh!

Well, here we are, eh?

What are we doing?

Hello!
Is there anyone in there?

Me and Amanda have been partnering together for, like, over ten years, so I've known her since, like,
I came out the womb.
Yeah.
You guys obviously have a connection.
There's a lot of trust there.
It was a very tight, clean performance.
Really, really amazing job.
[cheers and applause]
This was definitely a standard-setting performance for me, definitely so.
There's a certain criteria as to what needs to happen in order to win this competition, and when I say every single thing on this list y'all have in spades, and so you definitely have what it takes to win.
All right, should we lock it in?
- Let's lock it in, guys.
- Let's do it.

Each criteria is worth 20 points.
And between the five of them, the best score you can possibly get is 100.
And for the first round, they have to at least get an 80 to go through.
- Ready?
- Let's go!
My name is D'Angelo, and I'm 16 years old.
My name is Amanda, and I'm 17 years old.
And we're ballroom dancers from Miami, Florida.
We've been dancing for ten years together since I was seven and he was six...
Oh, you said forward before I step back.
Amanda, after, after, after.
Which is a very long time.
- Yeah, I'm right again.
- Oh, wow, look at that.
- Well, I was... mm.
We go to the same school, so I'm, like,
I'm with you 24-7.
Tha, and hup, and one.
- Manny's our choreographer, teacher, mentor, dictator...
Hold it.
Shape.
Shape, shape, shape, shape.
And he's also my dad.
Hup.
If you know you have to spot, spot.
When he's thinking, he'll be like this.
And then he'll go...
Manny pushes us very hard, but at the end of the day, we do it because we love it.
If we won?
Ooh.
I was just trying to think about getting to the next round.
I wasn't even trying to think about winning.
Please welcome D'Angelo and Amanda.

- These are juniors.
- Yeah.
All right, you know, me coming from a ballroom and latin background,
I just have to say, yeah, guys.
What up?
Way to represent.
First of all, I saw paso doble.
I saw cha-cha in there.
I even saw, like, a little jive action.
Very, very cool, and also, for ballroom dancers, don't normally have that extension
- that you have.
- Yeah.
Just make sure just to use those hips a little bit more, 'cause, like, I felt like he in some of those moments overpowered you from a rhythmical standpoint.
I was about to demonstrate, but I'm not going to;
I got shy.
- Please do.
- But...
Come on.
Show 'em what you mean.
Well, okay.
Well, I mean, I was like...
It just needs, like...
It just needs, like, a little, like, boom there, you know.
But overall, great job, and what we just witnessed was a possible routine for that million dollars.
It was great.
Amazing.
How long did you guys rehearse for this?
Because it was pretty flawless.
Me and Amanda have been partnering together for, like, over ten years, so I've known her since, like,
I came out the womb.
Yeah.
You guys obviously have a connection.
There's a lot of trust there.
It was a very tight, clean performance.
Really, really amazing job.
This was definitely a standard-setting performance for me, definitely so.
There's a certain criteria as to what needs to happen in order to win this competition, and when I say every single thing on this list y'all have in spades, and so you definitely have what it takes to win.
All right, should we lock it in?
- Let's lock it in, guys.
- Let's do it.
To make through the qualifier, you need to get an average score of 80 or above.
All right, let's see if you guys are going through.

Super clean.
Every hit super sharp.
I'm familiar with you guys' work.
This was a little more emotional than I've seen you.
- Like, is there a story behind...
- Yes, I have a girl named
Jessica.
And this girl left me.
And it's actually this woman being... supporting me when I had nothing, and when I came to here.
Hey, come on, man.
Whatever.
She left me, and that day I was...
Come on, bro.
This is just a testament to the fact that the best dancers in the world are here tonight.
I'm a big fan of you guys.
Your style is so unique.
But the fact that you're twins...
I have twins;
You know this.
- Oh, of course, we do.
- Yes, but...
I didn't know about it.
You were too busy with Jessica, okay?
Ohh.
It's that connection that you have as twins, I think, that there will be nobody ever like you guys ever again.
This is something that is such a beautiful thing to watch
- in the world of dance.
- Thank you.
You guys are able to create a world that everybody gets sucked into.
You know, that's how special your style is, to be able to transport an audience, and that is an amazing thing to do.
Wish you the best of luck.
You guys are amazing.
Peace.
All right, we ready to lock in?
Yes.
Lock in your score.
Wow.
We cannot wait to see what the next level of Les Twin is.
- You ain't ready for that.
- Cannot wait.
I don't think they're ready for this.
Whoo, yeah, there we go.
That's a man-size shoe right there boys.
We are NXT LVL, a clogging group from all over America.
- I love me some clogging.
- Yeah.
- I can't wait.
- I used to clog.
Can I clog with you a little bit?
- Absolutely.
- Okay.
Whoo.
♪ Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh ♪
This is nine of the truly most talented male cloggers you could ever find.
We actually have our own show, "Thunder Light,"
at the Calvin Gilmore Theater in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.
So when we hit the stage, we take it to the next level.
And that's what this is all about.
Go, go, go, go, go.

You guys seem like a group of guys that
I'd want to go grab a beer with.
Like, for real.
Hey, I'm telling you.
You guys' footwork was amazing;
It was fantastic.
- Those over the tops...
- Yes, sir.
Where you guys were holding the feet and going over the top,
Whoo, that was slick.
I loved it.
You guys are definitely not what I pictured when I heard "clogging," which is a great thing.
And you're definitely taking clogging to the next level.
But I'm thinking about the criteria here, and I just...
I personally, again, just needed a little more.
So you've got to bring it all out.
That was very clean for the intricacy of what you guys
- are doing with the clogging...
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.
- And everything.
- It was really, really great.
- Thank you.
You're obviously all great at what you do.
This is a type of dancing that could get a little bit repetitive after a while, but you actually did create a dynamic routine.
Is it at that level where I feel like you guys could take the whole competition?
I'm not sure.
We'll see if you make through the next round, and maybe you can up the routine ideas a little bit, you know.

And we've been married for four years.

♪ My mama don't like you, and she likes everyone ♪
I would say any couple that can choreograph together and stay with each other, major props.
We've gotten better at it over the years.
We've gotten better, we like to think.

I was like, "Augh."
- But that's their genius.
- You know what I mean?
- Rough start.
You guys are so loveable, likeable.
- And the musicality...
- Yeah.
Those little, like, "ba-da-da, da-da, da-da-da,"
it's amazing;
It's incredible.

In this particular number, just the way you told the story of your life.
You start out, you know.
It could be clumsy.
It could be weird.
But then once you start dancing, the world is perfect.
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Jennifer.
- Thank you.
From the technicality to just the passion, like, you can tell that you guys really enjoy dancing with each other.
All passion, all energy.
Beautiful performance.
- Thank you, Ne-Yo.
- Thank you.
I want to ask you guys a question.
What would winning this competition mean to you?
The obviously opportunity to showcase yourself amongst the best dancers in the world, but for us personally, we are so close to that point of our lives where we want to start a family.
- Look, I got the goosies.
- All right.
- I got the goosies.
Did you?
- I was like...
- You were about to...
- I felt it.
So I mean, I mean, obviously, a million dollars would help.

Round two.
Here we go.
Thanks to "World of Dance."
It was like a movie.
Every eye was, like, locked in.
You've got that live fire.
I can see it in you.
One, two, three.
All:
We're the Kinjaz.
Let's turn up our barbecue.
We're the Kinjaz.
We're a Los Angeles-based crew.
A kin is our family.
So this is a brotherhood of ninjas.
Raise your hand if you were ever, like, a ninja for Halloween or the Ninja Turtles or something.
A lot of us did martial arts when we were younger.
And we just genuinely loved it.
We're a really, really unique and specific type of brotherhood.
We go eat together.
We go to the movies together.
We do a lot of great and not so great things together.
Ahh!
Most of us are actually second generation, which meant that our parents immigrated over here.
They picked up jobs, like, running gas stations, to dry cleaners, to farming just to kind of give us an opportunity to follow out dreams, so we really want to make them proud through this competition.
Our style of dance is influenced by the ninja culture.
We're literally drawing inspiration from movies, from fantasy stories, from anime, and it allows us to transform into anything.
But we're here to win.
And we know that everybody else is here to do the same.
And that's what fires us up.
Next to take the stage, it's Kinjaz.
Kinjaz.
We live by one mantra:
Respect all, fear none.
♪ You don't know what's in store ♪
♪ But you know what you're here for ♪
♪ Close your eyes ♪
♪ Lay yourself beside me ♪
♪ Hold tight ♪
♪ For this ride ♪

That was dope.
Oh, my God.
I'm kind of at a loss for words.
Like, I'm just, like, "Whoo."
Like, I was just doing that the whole way through.
Man, like, the opening was...
it was like a movie.
It was just, like... ♪ Do-do-do ♪
"And I am..." You know, it was... it was...
It was so cool.
Every movement was intended.
Everything that you guys did was very carefully thought through.
You could see that.
You are incredible at what you do.
You did it perfectly.
So good.
All day we've been talking about the wow factor.
We've been talking about dynamics.
We've been talking about the bigness of it.
You guys came out here and made fingers dynamic.
I mean, how do you coordinate fingers like this?
A few hours.
Yeah, a few hours of just, "No, like this," yeah.
"No, guys, one more.
One more time.
"Nope, nope, one more time, nope."
- Yeah.
You didn't need big, crazy tricks to keep it interesting, and every eye was, like, locked in.
That is the power of synchronicity.
That is the power of movement.
Keep going.
Keep elevating.
I don't know.
For me, it just... it just... it wasn't enough.
I want more.
I want more.
Can I have some more?
It was too short.
And I was like, "Wait."
You can't be done.
There has to be more."
It was so damn good.
Wow.
Thank you.
I know when I perform with certain people, we become one on stage.
There's a unity that happens, like, your hearts and your souls unite, and I just feel like that's what I love about you guys.
I'd love to see even more of that.
Thank you.
All right, guys, ready?
Let's lock in our scores.
Yep.
- Okay, good?
- Okay, yep.
Let's see if you guys made it through.
Congratulations.
You are through to the next round.
- Man, that was... that was fun.
Yeah, I love the groups.
- The groups are so fun.
- So fun.

Just dance with your heart.
I believe in you.
Okay.
My name is Diana Pombo.
I'm 11 years old.
I am from Miami, Florida, and I am a contemporary dancer.
I've been naturally hyper since the day I was born.
And it hasn't changed.
Calm down;
You can't go out there like that.
Are you crazy?
She danced in my tummy when I was pregnant with her.
And my tummy would actually just do this wave, you know.
She was always extremely active.
My sister Andrea started dancing before me, and since I was, like, four I would watch her in recitals with her tutus, and I would put on her tutus and start running around the house.
And I haven't stopped.
I am so proud of Diana being here.
She's so brave.
Did you ever think you would be at this level of competition?
No, this is a dream come true.
- This is it.
- Okay.
Go do the best job ever.
It's your turn to shine.
Love.
This competition could change my life forever.

And looked like your face was going to cry, I...
She... she's... she's pumped.

It wasn't all the strength you had.

Just fantastic.

Over the next ten weeks, the best dancers in the world will compete for the chance to prove they are the world's greatest dance act.
This is "World of Dance."
The world's biggest dance competition starts now.
And introducing your host and dance mentor
Jenna Dewan Tatum, breakout star of "Step Up" and professional dancer.
I was a very competitive dancer so coming to this competition,
I really know what they're going through.
Dancers will compete within three divisions:
I'm so inspired, and I'm honored to be here.
I am so excited to show what we're made of.
We have the passion.
We have the fire.
We want this so bad.
The acts will be awarded points from zero to 20 in each of five categories, performance, technique, choreography, creativity, and presentation for a maximum possible score of 100.
__
__
__
__
Then in the World Final, the three division winners will go head-to-head for the life-changing $1 million prize.
Get ready...
As the best in the world...
Ahh!
Absolutely extraordinary.
Push themselves to the limit.
Whoa.
Now we're cooking with some hot sauce.
It's got to be the best you've ever done.
I want more.
Can I have some more?
They will have one shot to seriously impress three of the world's biggest dance legends.
Please welcome your judges.
Emmy Award-winning choreography and record six-time champion of "Dancing with the Stars," Derek Hough, multiplatinum Grammy Award-winning RB singer and dancer, Ne-Yo, and Jennifer Lopez, global pop phenomenon, who sold over 80 million albums worldwide,
movie icon and TV superstar, who got her break as a professional dancer.
I started as a dancer, and I know it takes commitment, passion, heart.
There's been dance shows, but we wanted to create the Olympics of dance.
This is a chance to say, "I am the best in the world."
That's what I'm talking about.
This is "World of Dance."
First day at school.
Where's the cool kids?
- What we doing?
- This is the cool kids.
I don't know if I've ever been at the cool kids' table.
This is the first time?
This is my first time at the cool kids' table.
- Thank you.
- Well, welcome.
When we're on that dance floor out there...
- No mercy.
- No mercy.
We are...
Super Cr3w.
From Las Vegas, and we are B-boys.
A B-boy is basically a break-dancer.
We do tricks like flips, freezes, and flairs.
We've been representing for 17 years.
And we've had success in the past, these guys winning Red Bull BC One, he's a two-time champion, and "Star Search" champion right here, my man Do-Knock.
This is by far the biggest competition we ever competed in, so for us to win would mean a lot.
It's our time.
And these three judges have the best credentials as dancers.
They've had so many experiences in their careers.
We're here to learn.
And now we're in our mid-30s.
Some of us are in our later 20s.
We're B-men now.
We were B-boys.
- Now we're B-men.
- We're B-men.
Yeah.
A lot of people probably think, you know,
"Oh, it's time to hang up the hat."
But we want to show that, "Yo, we're still chasing our dream."
What does this mean for you?
We want to compete with the best of the best, you know, and to win it, I mean, this is gonna change our lives.
All right, guys.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
Whoo!
Come on!
All right, here we go.
First to take the stage, Super Cr3w.
__
Whoo!
I'll tell you what.
I've worked with a lot of B-boys over the years, and one of the challenging things with choreographing
B-boys is that it can get repetitive or people don't know what to do with them.
What you guys did up there, honestly,
I was afraid to look away, 'cause I was afraid I was gonna miss something.
That's how exciting you made it.
I've got to say this for everybody here that doesn't know what it is to be a B-boy, they make it look so easy.
The difficulty of some of the things that you guys are doing, it's, like, God.
What was that one move in the front where you kind of-- what do you call those where you guys...
Wow.
Yes.
Hold on.
Wait.
My turn.
My turn.
No, no.
No, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
Super smooth, super together.
You guys are water, man, water, every move.
Derek.
Where--where are you guys all from?
You guys are from different places, am I right?
Brazil?
Japan.
Venezuela.
Venezuela, wow.
Korea.
You guys are "world of dance", like, right?
Like--like...
The acrobatics, the physicality, the musicality and also the synchronicity, those alpha kicks, you guys are perfectly in sync together.
I was like, "Dang."
Great job, guys.
Great job.
It is now time for us to lock in our scores.
We're judging on performance, technique, choreography, creativity, and presentation.
- Let's do it.
Let's do it.
- All right, let's do it.
All right, guys, if you get less than 80 points, you won't be going through.
Super Cr3w, let's see if you made it through.
Here we go.
Whoo!
Congratulations.
You are going through to the next round.
We'll see you there.
All right, way to set the bar.
Come on.
You just performed so well.
I mean, so unbelievable.
You couldn't have done that any better.
We've done it for a long time, and I think the time
- is now, and this is our year.
- This is it.
- Yeah.
- Vision board it together.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, visualize.
- Whoo.
- Visualize.
- So happy.
- Yeah.
- All right, we're good now.
All right, it's happening.
- Yeah, it's happening.
- All right, yeah, yeah.
We got it.
Yeah.
Whoo!
Wait, you can't be done.
There has to be more.
Use those hips a little bit more.
That is the power of synchronicity.
That is the power of movement.
You inspire people, and you inspire me as well.
I love the way that this is set up.
I might not have thought about the transitions or the musicality;
I might not have thought about it.
The cleanliness, the dynamics.
Judging a tapper against a contemporary dancer, it's so different.
It helps us that we have these five main categories.
Performance, technique, choreography, presentation, and creativity.
Each criteria is worth 20 points.
And between the five of them, the best score you can possibly get is 100.
And for the first round, they have to at least get an 80 to go through.
- Ready?
- Let's go!
My name is D'Angelo, and I'm 16 years old.
My name is Amanda, and I'm 17 years old.
And we're ballroom dancers from Miami, Florida.
We've been dancing for ten years together since I was seven and he was six...
Oh, you said forward before I step back.
Amanda, after, after, after.
Which is a very long time.
- Yeah, I'm right again.
- Oh, wow, look at that.
Well, I was--mm.
We go to the same school, so I'm, like,
I'm with you 24-7.
Tha, and hup, and one.
Manny's our choreographer, teacher, mentor, dictator...
Hold it.
Shape.
Shape, shape, shape, shape.
And he's also my dad.
Hup.
If you know you have to spot, spot.
When he's thinking, he'll be like this.
And then he'll go...
Manny pushes us very hard, but at the end of the day, we do it because we love it.
- __
- If we won?
Ooh.
I was just trying to think about getting to the next round.
I wasn't even trying to think about winning.
Please welcome D'Angelo and Amanda.
Whoo.
- Yes.
- That is my boy.
Oh!
Whoo!
Wait a minute.
- These are juniors.
- Yeah.
All right, you know, me coming from a ballroom and latin background,
I just have to say, yeah, guys.
What up?
Way to represent.
First of all, I saw paso doble.
I saw cha-cha in there.
I even saw, like, a little jive action.
Very, very cool, and also, for ballroom dancers, don't normally have that extension
- that you have.
- Yeah.
Just make sure just to use those hips a little bit more, 'cause, like, I felt like he in some of those moments overpowered you from a rhythmical standpoint.
I was about to demonstrate, but I'm not going to;
I got shy.
- Please do.
- But...
Come on.
Show 'em what you mean.
Well, okay.
Well, I mean, I was like...
It just needs, like....
It just needs, like, a little, like, boom there, you know.
But overall, great job, and what we just witnessed was a possible routine for that million dollars.
It was great.
Amazing.
How long did you guys rehearse for this?
Because it was pretty flawless.
Me and Amanda have been partnering together for, like, over ten years, so I've known her since, like,
I came out the womb.
Yeah.
You guys obviously have a connection.
There's a lot of trust there.
It was a very tight, clean performance.
Really, really amazing job.
This was definitely a standard-setting performance for me, definitely so.
There's a certain criteria as to what needs to happen in order to win this competition, and when I say every single thing on this list y'all have in spades, and so you definitely have what it takes to win.
All right, should we lock it in?
- Let's lock it in, guys.
- Let's do it.
To make through the qualifier, you need to get an average score of 80 or above.
All right, let's see if you guys are going through.
Congratulations.
From the second they came out to the second they left, in.
They was in the whole time.
Amazing.
Ohh, rough start.
This crew is what this competition is about.
This is just a testament to the fact that the best dancers in the world are here tonight.
And five, six, seven...
Ohh.
What is it like being twins?
Ahh.
Who's more fun?
Yaah!
Yaah!
Les Twins, they are living legends.
Being around them makes me want to just step up my game.
Next onstage, it's Les Twins!
Yes.
That's how you walk--that's how you come out, man.
Yes.
So good.
Super clean.
Every hit super sharp.
I'm familiar with you guys' work.
This was a little more emotional than I've seen you.
- Like, is there a story behind...
- Yes, I have a girl named
Jessica.
And this girl left me.
And it's actually this woman being--supporting me when I had nothing, and when I came to here.
Hey, come on, man.
Whatever.
She left me, and that day I was...
Come on, bro.
This is just a testament to the fact that the best dancers in the world are here tonight.
I'm a big fan of you guys.
Your style is so unique.
But the fact that you're twins-- I have twins; you know this.
- Oh, of course, we do.
- Yes, but--
I didn't know about it.
You were too busy with Jessica, okay?
Ohh.
It's that connection that you have as twins, I think, that there will be nobody ever like you guys ever again.
This is something that is such a beautiful thing to watch
- in the world of dance.
- Thank you.
You guys are able to create a world that everybody gets sucked into.
You know, that's how special your style is, to be able to transport an audience, and that is an amazing thing to do.
Wish you the best of luck.
You guys are amazing.
Peace.
All right, we ready to lock in?
Yes.
Lock in your score.
Wow.
We cannot wait to see what the next level of Les Twin is.
- You ain't ready for that.
- Cannot wait.
I don't think they're ready for this.
Whoo, yeah, there we go.
That's a man-size shoe right there boys.
We are NXT LVL, a clogging group from all over America.
- I love me some clogging.
- Yeah.
I can't wait.
I used to clog.
Can I clog with you a little bit?
- Absolutely.
- Okay.
Whoo.
This is nine of the truly most talented male cloggers you could ever find.
We actually have our own show, "Thunder Light,"
at the Calvin Gilmore Theater in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.
So when we hit the stage, we take it to the next level.
And that's what this is all about.
Go, go, go, go, go.
Whoo!
Next onstage, it's NXT LVL.
You guys seem like a group of guys that
I'd want to go grab a beer with.
Like, for real.
Hey, I'm telling you.
You guys' footwork was amazing;
it was fantastic.
- Those over the tops...
- Yes, sir.
Where you guys were holding the feet and going over the top,
Whoo, that was slick.
I loved it.
You guys are definitely not what I pictured when I heard "clogging," which is a great thing.
And you're definitely taking clogging to the next level.
But I'm thinking about the criteria here, and I just--I personally, again, just needed a little more.
So you've got to bring it all out.
That was very clean for the intricacy of what you guys
- are doing with the clogging...
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.
- And everything.
- It was really, really great.
- Thank you.
You're obviously all great at what you do.
This is a type of dancing that could get a little bit repetitive after a while, but you actually did create a dynamic routine.
Is it at that level where I feel like you guys could take the whole competition?
I'm not sure.
We'll see if you make through the next round, and maybe you can up the routine ideas a little bit, you know.
- Time to lock in scores.
- Here we go.
Hey, let's go grab that drink, though, all right.
- They're good but...
- They didn't have that thing.
They won't be-- they won't be competitive.
They needed just a little more oomph.
- Ready?
- I'm ready.
I'm Keone.
And I'm Mari.
And we've been married for four years.
We're both dancers, choreographers.
We're known for the videos that we post.
A lot of our videos have gone viral with one video having a billion views for Justin Bieber's "Love Yourself."
I would say any couple that can choreograph together and stay with each other, major props.
We've gotten better at it over the years.
We've gotten better, we like to think.
Let's welcome Keone and Mari.
"World of Dance" is a whole different level completely.
It's got the best of best, and we can't wait to be a part of it.
Ahh.
Ahh!
Whoo!
Keone and Mari.
I didn't know that was planned at the beginning.
- Me either.
- I was like, "Ooh."
- I was like, "Augh."
- But that's their genius.
- You know what I mean?
- Rough start.
You guys are so loveable, likeable.
- And the musicality...
- Yeah.
Those little, like, "ba-da-da, da-da, da-da-da,"
it's amazing;
it's incredible.
- I love you guys.
- Thank you.
And I can't wait to see more.
- Thank you, Derek.
Thank you.
- Thank you, Derek.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
You guys are married, right?
- Yes.
- We are.
In this particular number, just the way you told the story of your life.
You start out, you know.
It could be clumsy.
It could be weird.
But then once you start dancing, the world is perfect.
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Jennifer.
Thank you.
From the technicality to just the passion, like, you can tell that you guys really enjoy dancing with each other.
All passion, all energy.
Beautiful performance.
- Thank you, Ne-Yo.
- Thank you.
I want to ask you guys a question.
What would winning this competition mean to you?
The obviously opportunity to showcase yourself amongst the best dancers in the world, but for us personally, we are so close to that point of our lives where we want to start a family.
- Look, I got the goosies.
- All right.
- I got the goosies.
Did you?
- I was like...
- You were about to...
- I felt it.
So I mean, I mean, obviously, a million dollars would help.
It's time for us to lock in our scores.
Okay, let's see if you're going through.
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you.
You got me on the family thing.
- I was like...
- That was so cute.
So adorable.
Congratulations.
Round two.
Here we go.
Thanks to "World of Dance."
It was like a movie.
Every eye was, like, locked in.
You've got that live fire.
I can see it in you.
One, two, three.
We're the Kinjaz.
Let's turn up our barbecue.
We're the Kinjaz.
We're a Los Angeles-based crew.
A kin is our family.
So this is a brotherhood of ninjas.
Raise your hand if you were ever, like, a ninja for Halloween or the Ninja Turtles or something.
A lot of us did martial arts when we were younger.
And we just genuinely loved it.
We're a really, really unique and specific type of brotherhood.
We go eat together.
We go to the movies together.
We do a lot of great and not so great things together.
Ahh!
Most of us are actually second generation, which meant that our parents immigrated over here.
They picked up jobs, like, running gas stations, to dry cleaners, to farming just to kind of give us an opportunity to follow out dreams, so we really want to make them proud through this competition.
Our style of dance is influenced by the ninja culture.
We're literally drawing inspiration from movies, from fantasy stories, from anime, and it allows us to transform into anything.
But we're here to win.
And we know that everybody else is here to do the same.
And that's what fires us up.
Next to take the stage, it's Kinjaz.
Kinjaz.
respect all, fear none.
That was dope.
Oh, my God.
I'm kind of at a loss for words.
Like, I'm just, like, "Whoo."
Like, I was just doing that the whole way through.
Man, like, the opening was...
it was like a movie.
It was just, like....
"And I am..." You know, it was--it was...
It was so cool.
Every movement was intended.
Everything that you guys did was very carefully thought through.
You could see that.
You are incredible at what you do.
You did it perfectly.
So good.
All day we've been talking about the wow factor.
We've been talking about dynamics.
We've been talking about the bigness of it.
You guys came out here and made fingers dynamic.
I mean, how do you coordinate fingers like this?
A few hours.
Yeah, a few hours of just, "No, like this," yeah.
"No, guys, one more.
One more time.
"Nope, nope, one more time, nope."
Yeah.
You didn't need big, crazy tricks to keep it interesting, and every eye was, like, locked in.
That is the power of synchronicity.
That is the power of movement.
Keep going.
Keep elevating.
I don't know.
For me, it just--it just... it wasn't enough.
I want more.
I want more.
Can I have some more?
It was too short.
And I was like, "Wait."
You can't be done.
There has to be more."
It was so damn good.
Wow.
Thank you.
I know when I perform with certain people, we become one on stage.
There's a unity that happens, like, your hearts and your souls unite, and I just feel like that's what I love about you guys.
I'd love to see even more of that.
Thank you.
All right, guys, ready?
Let's lock in our scores.
Yep.
- Okay, good?
- Okay, yep.
Let's see if you guys made it through.
Congratulations.
You are through to the next round.
Man, that was--that was fun.
Yeah, I love the groups.
- The groups are so fun.
- So fun.
Coming up...
It wasn't just all the flexibility you had.
It was the passion.
Are you ready?
I'm gonna do my best.
Okay, you know what?
Just dance with your heart.
I believe in you.
Okay.
My name is Diana Pombo.
I'm 11 years old.
I am from Miami, Florida, and I am a contemporary dancer.
I've been naturally hyper since the day I was born.
And it hasn't changed.
Calm down; you can't go out there like that.
Are you crazy?
She danced in my tummy when I was pregnant with her.
And my tummy would actually just do this wave, you know.
She was always extremely active.
My sister Andrea started dancing before me, and since I was, like, four I would watch her in recitals with her tutus, and I would put on her tutus and start running around the house.
And I haven't stopped.
I am so proud of Diana being here.
She's so brave.
Did you ever think you would be at this level of competition?
No, this is a dream come true.
- This is it.
- Okay.
Go do the best job ever.
It's your turn to shine.
Love.
This competition could change my life forever.
And I'm just, like, whoa.
Look at this little munchkin.
Hi.
♪ I sing for love,
I sing for me *
Ahh!
Oh, my God.
She's incredible.
Man.
- Diana...
- Whoo-hoo-hoo.
Where are you from?
Miami, Florida.
Miami, Florida.
What's your background?
Well, my parents are from Colombia.
Yes, you've got that live fire.
- I can see it in you.
- Thank you.
When you took your foot and looked at me backwards and wiped your forehead with your foot...
And looked like your face was going to cry, I...
She--she's--she's pumped.
I--no, it wasn't just all the flexibility you had.
It wasn't all the strength you had.
It was the passion that you put into every move.
Thank you.
It was incredible.
I mean, I'm looking at the scoreboard right here, and it says "performance, technique, choreography, creativity, presentation,"
- I mean, you...
- Thank you.
You check all those boxes.
Just fantastic.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
For me, it's never so much about the five and six and seven and eight of it.
It's always about how it feels and the passion.
You are all passion, which is a very, very good thing.
I almost--I--I almost got-- you almost got me.
You almost got me.
- Quality work.
- Thank you so much.
Quality.
Miss JLo, I just want to say that you are my idol.
Oh, don't make me cry.
You inspire people, and you inspire me as well.
- Oh, my God, baby.
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.
You did such a beautiful job.
Honestly.
You're a very special little girl.
- Thank you.
- You hear me?
Shall we lock in our scores?
- Let's do it.
- Let's lock it in.
Let's see if you're going through.
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.
You're going through.
Congratulations.
Amazing.
- Congratulations, baby.
- Congrats.
Thank you so much.
Ohh.
Now I'm all emotional over here too.
Oh, and meeting your idol.
- That was insane.
- And you got kissed.
Look at this kiss.
It's like a beautiful, perfect Jennifer kiss.
- Yes.
- Ohh.
This is a dream come true.
Ohh, you guys.
Thank you.
Yes.
She did it.

-Sync corrections by QueenMaddie
[Sean] Ah, America.
You beacon of composure and proportionate response.
You bringer of calm and goodness to the world.
What do you do when the war you're fighting just can't possibly be won in any meaningful sense?
Well, obviously, you sack the guy not winning it, and you bring in some other guy.
In 2009, that war was Afghanistan.
-[intercom buzzing] -[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]
[Sean] And that other guy... was Glen.
You boys ready?
Let's go win this thing.
[Sean] Okay.
So this is what I learned about four-star General Glen McMahon.
He was born to a military family at Fort Leavenworth.
Graduated West Point in 1976.
Ranger school in '79.
He had a graduate degree in political affairs and military history from Yale.
He was both a straight-A student and a troublemaker.
He once famously attempted to stick a lit cherry bomb up his sleeping drill sergeant's ass.
He was loved by the men and women who served under him.
Three, two, one, let's go.
[Sean] Never afraid to get his hands dirty.
-Yeah, it's flash time.
-[men chuckling]
[Sean] Never willing to send his troops anywhere he wouldn't go himself.
He was known variously as the Lion King, the G-Man, Big Glen and, most commonly, the Glenimal.
He was like a throwback to another era.
His hand was bent into a permanent claw, like it was still clutching a World War II cigar his modern, fitness-fanatic self wouldn't allow him to smoke.
After a successful stint running the secretive special operations killing machine in Iraq,
Glen was appointed leader of US and coalition forces in Afghanistan.
A war which, as he saw it, wasn't being won 'cause it wasn't being led.
General.
We're all very excited to have you here.
It's an honor to meet you.
I'm excited to be here.
Ain't that right, Greg?
Yes, indeed, sir.
You're very excited.
[Sean] Somehow, while he was in Iraq,
Glen found time to author a book on leadership, entitled One Leg at a Time, Just Like Everybody Else.
In it, he wrote, "Men are imperfect creatures.
Left to their own devices, all they really want to do is play with their dicks and eat chicken."
[officer] For all his many achievements leading special operations in Iraq,
I think most of us here will know General McMahon as the man who took out al-Zarwaqi, who kicked al-Qaeda in the sack.
-[man whooping]
-You're welcome.
[officer] We have a warrior at the helm, and it's a pleasure to have you, sir.
[men cheering]
[Sean] Glen was known as a humble man.
But humble in that way that says, "My humility makes me better than you."
He was famous for his Spartan regime of routine and discipline.
He ate one meal a day.
He slept four hours per night.
He ran seven miles every morning.
In Iraq, he transformed special operations with what he called systemic negation of repetitive procedural practice.
Or, to the acronym-obsessed military, SNORPP.
[Cory] We got Italy in there.
That's the Dutch.
We got Poland, Macedonia, Ukraine.
We got Australia over there, Croatia, Belgium--
Okay, that'll do.
Bite-size chunks, hmm?
Let's knock this on the head.
All right.
[Sean] Basically, he was a master of systems organization.
-[speaking Italian]
-Which he'd kind of need to be, if he was to corral this 43-nation coalition of the willing.
-[in English] May I help you?
-No, finish your phone call.
The war can wait.
[continues speaking Italian]
[in English] What can I do for you, General?
I want to pull everyone out of their offices.
I want to open this place up.
I came in here to speak with you about that.
I have only ten men to lead here in Afghanistan, huh.
So it make no sense for me to be sit out there with everybody else.
I get it.
All right?
But everybody has a reason not to be out there with everybody else.
Austria only has two guys here.
Iceland has seven guys.
This country won't fight at night.
That country won't fight in the snow.
This country wants to do counter-narcotics.
That country won't do counter-narcotics.
But if we're in the same room...
[Sean] Cory Staggart was Glen's executive officer.
Ran the general's affairs.
He was a Ranger.
Although how he made it through Ranger school, I have no idea.
That's great.
Thank you, guys.
That's all the time we got.
Let's go.
Come on.
Greg Pulver.
General Greg Pulver graduated West Point in the same class as Glen.
Oh, that's interesting.
Does he have security clearance?
[Sean] And hadn't left his side since.
Then fucking let him in just like you would any other fucking person with a fucking security clearance!
[Sean] His official title was director of intelligence, but all I saw was a guy with anger management issues whose life had no meaning without Glen.
Andy Moon was Glen's tech whiz, providing the general with all forms of IT support.
Andy.
-Yes, sir?
-Which Glen needed often.
-How are you?
-Pretty good, sir.
How are you doing?
Uh, swell.
Can you come with me a moment?
-My electric razor is...
-Oh, yes, sir.
...yeah, broken.
Pete Duckman was a Navy SEAL.
Like Pulver, his job title had the word "intelligence" in it.
-What's going on?
-Boss is visiting with President Karzai.
Cool.
Why so fancy?
He's a world leader.
Cool.
Am I coming?
Yes, you are.
It's your job.
God damn it, Pete.
Why are you fat?
-I'm not fat.
-[Sean] I still, to this day, don't know exactly what it was that Duckman did for the general.
[stammering] It's a mixture of cross-pollinational collation...
[Sean] Admiral Simon Ball was Glen's public affairs officer.
-Cooperational, uh, cooperative...
-For three and a half years, he'd been trying to explain SNORPP to the Washington press gallery.
[Simon] ...with a centralized command centralization structure, and, um... things like that.
Matt Little was Glen's new civilian PR consultant.
Oh, I don't know.
Is this a good hand?
-He was a DC marketing hotshot...
-Straight flush.
Hello?
...and sometime lobbyist who had thought the war in Afghanistan to be entirely pointless.
Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm not going there.
Until he was offered a lot of money to sell it.
How much?
[Sean] And Willy Dunne.
-Right this way, boss.
Yeah.
-Willy was Glen's body man.
Put your things in here.
I'll let you spread them out how you like.
Why is this my room?
This was General Whelan's room.
It's got, uh, a great bathroom here.
[Sean] Willy laundered Glen's clothes.
He did Glen's ironing.
Yeah.
Uh, boss?
He polished Glen's shoes.
He always seemed like he was about to collapse from the weight of one too many of Glen's bags.
-[Glen] Willy!
-Yes, boss?
-Put my stuff in this room.
-Okay.
[Glen] Here to fight a goddamn war, not watch goddamn television.
[Sean] Willy was the first person that Glen saw every morning and the last person he saw every night.
Glen loved these men... and they loved him right back.
[Glen] I don't know how it looks to you, Cory, but it seems to me, everybody's forgotten we're fighting a war here.
We got the goddamn Pizza Kings and Burger Huts.
The entire base is rolling with Eurosexuals who are so drunk they can't even stand up.
[Pete] General McMahon here to see Ambassador MacKinnon.
-Glen.
-Pat.
Great to see you.
You know Dick Waddle, of course.
-Dick.
-Glen.
Ray Canucci.
-Ray.
-Glen.
Grab a seat, boys.
I'm calling myself Richard now, Pat, if you don't mind.
Oh?
Okay, fine.
Uh...
-That's fair.
My apologies.
-Hmm.
-Have you settled in, Glen?
-No, Pat, I haven't.
Seems to me that too much settling in might somehow be at the heart of the problem we have here.
Small talk.
-Should've gone with the weather.
-[chuckles] [both laughing]
Glen, the president wants you to get the lay of the land here.
This war's been running eight years now.
President Obama, as you know, is drawing down troops in Iraq to refocus our attention on Afghanistan.
Henry Whelan was a good man, he meant well, but he just wasn't getting the job done.
Now, given your reputation and your formidable drive, our hope is that you're the man who will get the job done.
First things first.
We want you to make an assessment of the situation here.
Travel the country, talk to people.
At the end of that assessment, you'll tell us what needs to be done, how you're gonna get it done and what you need in order to get it done.
-So, now--
-To that end...
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, you go.
-I thought you were finished.
-You go.
-You sure?
-You go.
-I thought you were finished.
-No.
To that end... [chuckles] uh, now is probably a good time to share with you where the president hopes that assessment might land.
Obviously, the endgame here is to just finish this thing.
So, how do we do that?
-Is it by reducing our footprint here?
-[Sean] The civilian executive.
These were guys who, in Glen's eyes, hadn't earned their power the way he had, through hard work and discipline.
I don't know.
But whatever it is, we want you to bring it on home, Glen.
But, [chuckles] whatever you do, please do not ask the president for more troops.
[coughs]
No more troops, Glen.
[Sean] These were men who'd acquired their power through charm and seduction, and who seemed to serve no purpose other than to stand in the way of his greatness.
God, it's so fucking hot!
[grunts] Fuck!
Another fucking assessment.
How many assessments do they need?
Just one fucking assessment after another.
They all point the same direction.
Bring General Glen McMahon in here and do whatever the fuck he says!
Oh...
Settle down, Greg.
They just wanna feel involved, is all.
[Sean] Wars aren't fought by nations or by armies.
Wars are fought by men.
There are two types of general in the American military.
There are those who believe they can win in the face of all evidence to the contrary.
And there are those who know they can't.
Unfortunately for the world, it's the believers who climb to the top of the ladder.
It's guys like Glen who get given the keys to the castle.
President Karzai is very much looking forward to meeting you.
I think you will like each other.
There is no need to be nervous.
[muezzin calling to prayer]
I'm not nervous.
Fuck!
Fuck it.
-Ah!
General, excuse me.
-Ah.
We are trying to make this Blu-ray player work.
-Uh, do you know how they function?
-Uh...
Normally, you have those wires with the red, the yellow and the white plug.
But, uh, this machine seems only to have this wire.
I can't find where to plug it into the television.
I'm sorry, Mr. President.
I'm afraid I don't know a whole lot about technology.
I'm sure I could have somebody come by and take a look at it for you.
Fuck it.
Never mind.
I think I need a new television.
I'm sorry, General.
Please, let's sit.
Welcome.
-Thank you, Mr. President.
-Please call me Hamid.
[sneezes] Excuse me.
Please.
Your predecessor, General Whelan, I liked him.
I'm not entirely certain he liked me.
He didn't visit very often.
Why was he dismissed?
It seems, uh, one minute he was here... the next minute, not here.
Ah.
Well, Mr. President,
I think our government simply felt it was... time our effort took a new direction.
-And, uh, what is this new direction?
-Ah!
It is most important to me that we build Afghanistan.
Together, we build Afghanistan into a free and prosperous nation.
Free from fear and conflict.
-I see.
I see.
-Yeah.
Sounds a lot like the old direction.
No.
But perhaps you yourself are the new direction.
New strong personality.
New energy.
New commitment.
[grunts softly]
Well, General, I wish you the best of luck.
Sir, uh... my team and I are about to embark on a, uh... a tour of the country
-so that we may make an assessment...
-[clattering] ...to precisely understand what is required of us here.
It would be an honor if you would consider joining me on the tour, so that our project might be a unified endeavor.
Hmm.
-A sharing of our purpose...
-[coughing]
Of our shared purpose.
Thank you for the invitation, General.
Hmm.
-It's very generous.
-Hmm.
-But... [coughing] -[clears throat]
I've seen the country.
[Sean] To get inside the mind of Glen McMahon, you really need first to get a handle on the madness of modern American war.
Lieutenant Colonel Frank Groom.
Welcome to Kandahar, sir.
Nice to meet you, Frank.
I'm here to get the lay of the land.
[narrator] Counterinsurgency.
[Sean] In the good old days, wars were fought against conventional armies from nation states.
Guys in uniforms, like Nazis and stuff.
When, however, you've just gone and invaded a place that you probably shouldn't have, you end up fighting against just regular people in regular-people clothes.
These guys are what are called insurgents.
Basically, they're just guys who picked up weapons 'cause... so would you, if someone invaded your country.
Funnily enough... insurgencies are next to impossible to defeat.
And so, if you wanna go on pretending you can win, you're really left with no option but to try to convince the country you've invaded that you're actually here to help.
[man speaking Farsi] [in English] He's saying the Americans are urinating in the streets, and, uh, they call us motherfuckers all day.
It's "motherfucker, motherfucker" all the time.
And it's considered in our culture a very bad thing to fuck your own mother.
In ours, too.
Uh... in ours, too.
[Sean] This is counterinsurgency.
It's a popularity contest.
Salaam alaikum.
[Sean] You're trying to convince the people that they're better off with you than they are with the insurgents.
Basically, it works like this.
You install a local government.
You provide security for the people so that that democracy can take root.
[officer] We're training them up, taking them out on maneuvers.
[Sean] You train up the local forces so that they can provide the security for themselves.
I mean, they're sweet kids.
They're good kids.
Good-natured.
Integrational.
You know, they are very integrational as a people.
You know, I mean, they are committed to, uh...
-But, uh...
-Or at least you try to.
I don't know, sir, they're also lazy.
I mean, they really seem like they don't wanna be here.
They steal our shit and, basically, they're on drugs all the time.
I mean, they are fucking high all the time.
Excuse my language, sir.
You do whatever you can to stimulate the local economy.
Heroin is the only thing bringing money in.
Not that I like to think where the money is going to, exactly, but money keeps the people happy, so we're rolling with that.
Can't they grow something else?
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, they could grow cotton.
Cotton would grow here.
-Why don't they grow cotton, then?
-Because the United States Congress will not allow any United States aid and development funds to be directed towards the cultivation of a crop that will end up on the world market in competition with US farmers.
Oh.
-Which pretty much rules out cotton.
-Sure.
-So we're growing heroin instead.
-Right.
I think we're doing a pretty good job here, sir.
[Sean] You build infrastructure.
Roads, schools, stuff like that.
What kind of presence does the Taliban have here?
-Who?
-The Taliban.
In short, you get off your bases and you go make friends with the people.
[groans]
Killing insurgents all the while, of course.
Nation building.
Hearts and minds.
Hello!
Hello, all.
[Frank] Let me break it down this way, General.
We've been in Helmand province for five years now, and in all that time, all we've really managed to secure is this base.
Now, you go out there, you go into Marjah, you go into Lashkar Gah, it's all Pashtun, as you know.
This is the Taliban.
We're not winning any hearts and minds there, I can tell you that.
I'm not sure we ever will.
Kandahar's the same, of course.
Can I be completely frank with you, sir?
If I was you, I'd cut Helmand loose.
I'd concentrate on those parts of the country that are at least, in some way, sympathetic to the mission, and I'd cut it loose.
It's a lost cause.
This whole province constitutes just 4% of the population of the country.
It's strategically meaningless.
I'd cut Helmand loose, sir.
[Sean] The thing about counterinsurgency is that it doesn't really work.
We tried it in Vietnam.
That went well.
The British and the French gave it a shot, trying to hang on to their crumbling empires.
It just hasn't worked.
To me, it would seem kind of simple why.
You can't win the trust of a country by invading it.
You can't build a nation at gunpoint.
For guys like Glen, however, counterinsurgency hasn't worked for one simple reason.
You ready, boss?
Nobody's ever done it right.
Yes, I am, Pete.
I sure as hell am.
-Andy?
-[Andy] Yes, sir.
-Good job.
-[Andy] Thank you.
Let's lose Fox News.
Won't do us any good to have a bunch of angry perverts yelling at us all day.
-[Andy] Yes, sir.
-[Greg] So... we probably need to get to work on this assessment.
-Already written it.
-When?
It's already written.
Did it last night.
Needs a little flesh on the bone, but, basically, it's written.
All right, what's it say?
Greg...
I wanna take Helmand province.
I wanna take Helmand province precisely because everyone else seems to think we can't have it.
If we're gonna win the trust of this country, we can't be seen to accept that there's a whole chunk of it we can't handle.
We're here to provide security.
I say the first order of business is we secure that corner of the country everyone else seems to think we can't control.
[Greg] Okay.
I didn't come here to manage this war, and I sure as shit didn't come here to close it out.
Came here to win.
I'm taking Helmand...
then I'm taking Kandahar.
What do you say to that?
All right, and another thing.
Being that this is a nation-building exercise and all, seems to me it'd behoove us to have someone in the room who's actually from the nation we're building.
Don't you think?
Copy.
We are here to build, to protect.
We are not here to harass, to intimidate.
We're not here to shoot first and ask questions later.
We must not be driven by fear and suspicion.
We are here, above all else... to support the civilian population.
And to that end, we must avoid killing it at all cost.
Civilian casualties cannot be seen as an unfortunate byproduct of conflict.
They must be treated as errors of the greatest consequence.
This is the war we are fighting.
It's a complex war, but it's a war nonetheless.
Let me reaffirmate that right from the get-go.
This is a war.
But it's a war that cannot be won by the virtues of our unassailable military might and power alone.
This war will be won primarily with the unassailable might and power of our ideals.
Yeah.
Yeah.
-[Dick] Forty thousand?
-I'm afraid so.
God damn it.
What did we tell you?
No more troops.
Don't ask for more troops.
What do you do?
You ask for 40,000 more troops.
Well, Dick, Helmand province ain't exactly about to secure itself.
Probably should've asked for a lot more.
I just thought 40,000 sounded like a reasonable number.
There's no reasonable number, Glen, except perhaps zero.
That's a reasonable number.
Zero.
I thought you understood that.
Yeah, this "no more troops" thing, is that coming from the president, or coming from you?
-Of course it's coming from the president.
-Ah.
Why would it be coming from me?
Why do I care if we send more troops over there or we don't?
I don't know, Dick.
I'm just trying to work this thing out.
The president gave me a job to do.
-This is what I need to get it done.
-God damn it.
I'll be there day after tomorrow with the secretary of state.
We'll figure this nonsense out then.
-Roger that.
-God damn it.
-God damn it.
-[computer beeps]
-[grunts] -[Greg] There it is.
What did I tell you?
He's on retired-general time.
His mind's on a golf cart somewhere, halfway down the fairway.
He doesn't have the constitution for the hard stuff anymore.
He's obviously in the wrong fucking job!
That thing's off, right?
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, General, but we're gonna sit on your report until after the Afghan elections.
With all due respect, Madam Secretary, uh, the election is a month away.
I know it is, but, as I'm sure you know, an election here is a fragile thing.
It's a very delicate thing, and nobody wants its smooth running to be muddied by a big new American offensive.
No, I told you no more troops, Glen.
Now we're gonna have to rethink the game plan.
Well, Dick, with all due respect, you told me you didn't care if I got more troops or I didn't, so I'm trying to work out how to get the job done.
No, I did not say I didn't care.
-I believe you did.
-I did not say that.
-I believe you did.
-No.
No, I didn't.
I...
-You did, Dick.
-Whoever said what, a troop surge and an election don't sit well together, so this is the way it's gotta be.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing in the meantime.
I have a strategy.
I'm ready to execute.
The suggestion now seems to be that I thumb twiddle.
Uh, with all due respect, Madam Secretary--
General, please spare me the "all due respect" stuff.
It's really giving me the fucking creeps.
[Dick groans]
I think...
I think we all understand your frustration, Glen, but these elections have to run smoothly.
We need a legitimate partner in power here.
You need a legitimate partner here.
So... we just have to sit tight.
Why don't you do that SNORPP thing you did in Iraq?
You know, get your systems in place, get everybody talking together.
The time will fly, you know?
Get everybody excited.
You know, you're the best in the business at this stuff.
[man 1 on TV] We've been operating at an extremely high optempo.
In the last week, we've conducted six air assaults into previously denied territories.
[man 2 on TV] Uh, we're also in final coordination with RC South to develop an ops box in the seams existing along the provincial border.
[inaudible]
[helicopter blades whirring] [soldier 1] You got that, uh, Lexus?
[Cory] No.
No, now we got a Prius.
She got the new Prius.
[soldier 1] Sweet.
[Cory] Yeah, my wife, too.
She's got one.
We both have one.
We love it.
My first car was a Taurus.
-My father bought it.
-[soldiers speaking indistinctly]
[soldier 2] What do you got?
Sir.
Where you boys headed?
Back to our patrol base, sir.
Sasquatch.
Where you coming from?
Where are we from in the States, or where have we just been?
Where have you just been?
-Italy, sir, on R R.
-Ah.
R R in Italy.
-Yes, sir.
-Well...
Attention on deck!
So why the long faces?
You just got back from Italy.
I'm guessing you ate some sensational food, saw some antiquities.
Hmm?
I bet you got yourselves good and drunk and bumped into beautiful girls.
So what's it like out there?
Out where, sir?
-Sasquatch, son.
-Oh, um... it's not good, sir.
You know, I mean, it's whatever.
-It's... it's okay.
-No, it's a fucking shithole, sir.
[Cory] No, I don't know.
We'll see where we land.
Cory, what time's that bird due?
-Uh, in about 20 minutes.
-Cancel it.
Uh, why's that, boss?
I'm going to Sasquatch with those boys there.
General, those boys are heading out to an inhospitable corner of the world.
I'm a goddamn Ranger, Frank.
Those boys, they need me.
[Glen] I've spent the last week or so talking to guys who I would call middle management.
But you boys are at the coal face.
After all the blah, blah, blah, you boys are where it actually happens.
I'd go so far as to say you boys are the only thing that counts.
If it doesn't happen here, it doesn't happen.
End of story.
-[sighs] Yes, son?
-If what doesn't happen, sir?
It, son.
Okay, thank you, sir.
Does anyone here know what "it" is?
Anyone?
Anyone?
To, uh, secure the area, sir.
To protect the people from the enemy so they can go about building their lives.
Okay.
Okay, thank you, Sergeant.
Okay, but I can't tell the difference between the people and the enemy.
They all look alike to me.
I'm pretty sure they're the same people, sir.
I understand it can be tough, son, but that's the job.
I have another question.
Um, I hear now they're giving out medals for heroic restraint.
Do I have that right?
Courageous restraint.
And that is right.
Well, I don't mean to be rude, sir, but I do not understand what the fuck that means.
It means, son, that sometimes when you're dealing with an insurgency, you're not gonna be 100% clear on who the enemy is.
It means you're gonna find yourself in situations where, when you're afraid or whatnot, you're gonna have to make a judgment call.
Because, as Sergeant Ortega here has so rightly pointed out, your mission is to protect the people, not kill them.
We can't help them and kill them at the same time.
It just ain't humanly possible.
Do you understand me?
No, not really, sir.
No.
What part are you struggling to comprehend, son?
I don't know, sir.
It seems to me that we all here with our guns and shit, trying to convince these people that...
deep down we're actually really nice guys.
And I don't know how to do that, sir, when every second one of them or every third one of them or every tenth one of them is trying to fucking kill me, sir.
'Cause I'm a marine. 'Cause we're marines.
And it seem like now they handing out medals for heroically not being a marine, sir.
I'm confused, is what I'm trying to say, sir.
Well, then you're just gonna have to get yourself unconfused, son.
[man speaking Arabic on megaphone]
[Sean] On the day of the Afghan general elections, for which Glen had waited so patiently,
Badi Bassim joined his team.
Cory wouldn't tell me where he found Glen his Afghan mascot.
No, I'm doing your job!
He said he just found him in the phone book.
Put the bag down.
I assume that was a joke.
My name is Captain Badi Bassim.
I'm here to start work with, uh, General McMahon.
-Who?
-McMahon.
-McMahon?
-Yeah.
-Why are you not wearing the uniform?
-Uh, my uniform is in my bag.
It's too dangerous for me to wear it while I am walking here from my home.
Unzip it.
Unzip the bag.
My uniform.
-Why are you walking in here?
-Why I am working here?
Walking!
Walking!
Walking here?
Walking.
I like to walk.
[machine beeps]
-[Glen] Badi!
Come in.
Come in.
-Ah!
[both speaking Arabic] [laughs]
Everyone, this is my new aide-de-camp, Badi Bassim.
He's a soldier and a scholar.
This is the face of the new Afghanistan.
Greg, you know.
That's Cory.
You know Cory.
Pete Duckman.
And, uh... we got people here from Spain and Italy and, uh...
-You know, places like that.
-Okay.
Ah.
[sighs]
-Have you voted?
-I wanted to report to you first.
-You haven't voted?
-No.
Good.
Good.
You can do it right here.
We got a polling booth right here, right around the corner.
Okay.
-Election day.
It's exciting.
-Yeah.
[man speaking Arabic on megaphone]
[Glen] This is important, Badi.
That long line of men, that slow shuffle there, that's the slow shuffle towards freedom.
The steps are small but, by God, their importance...
It's like the moon landing.
Small step, giant leap.
Yeah.
[stutters] Are you familiar with the moon landing, son?
-Yes, sir.
-It's like the goddamn moon landing.
Yes, sir, I agree.
It's very important.
-Yes, it is.
-Yeah.
-[Glen] A what?
-[Ray] We're gonna have another election.
We can't ignore these fraud allegations.
They're coming in from every corner of the country and everything points to a ridiculous Karzai victory.
I mean, the whole thing just smells stupid.
Sure.
Sure, there's gonna be irregularity now and again.
But surely a result is the best possible outcome.
Yeah?
The polling station, the one right there over where you are... 367 registered voters, 1,200 votes counted.
It's a joke.
We're going to a runoff election.
Tell them what you told me!
Uh... [clears throat]
-About what, sir?
-About the elections.
About the whole concept of elections in this country.
[clears throat] Well, I was just observing, sir, that, um, people don't quite understand elections.
They see that the president is alive, everything is okay.
So what's the big problem?
Why are we having an election?
[Glen] Yeah.
And then you have an election anyway, and people vote for whoever the local leaders tell them to vote for.
Yeah.
Because they don't want to have their heads chopped off.
See what I mean?
Thank you... for that.
Uh...
I'm sorry, Glen.
We're going to a runoff election.
[groans] Jesus H...
I got the White House sitting on my report till after these elections get done.
I can't do anything until the president approves my recommendations.
And now you're telling me that's not gonna be until after another goddamn election?
!
You need a legitimate partner here, Glen.
Karzai ain't that guy.
You gotta understand, what we're trying to do here is like raising a child.
And a child needs two parents.
Two parents who love it and each other very much.
That's what it needs, above all else.
Well, then your wife, Mrs. Karzai...
I'm assuming that you're the daddy in this metaphorical relationship--
We suspect your wife, Karzai,
-might be a drug addict.
-[scoffs]
He eliminated his chief opponent in this election by spreading a pretty vicious homosexual rumor, and we're pretty sure that his brother is a straight-up criminal warlord.
Oh, come on, Pat!
You got a bee in your bonnet.
You just don't like him for some reason, whatever it is.
And seriously...
Anyway, I wanna know, how is Washington any different, huh?
Seriously!
Tell me!
Hmm?
Yeah.
You can't.
[Sean] On page 74 of One Leg at a Time, Just Like Everybody Else,
Glen wrote, and I quote,
"A good leader lives by a set of rules.
A great leader knows when to break them."
Morning.
-Morning, all.
-[all] Sir.
-Morning.
-Morning, sir.
Morning, boys.
-Morning, sir.
-Boss.
Morning, Matt.
You're up early.
Uh, yes, sir.
We've got a problem.
Somebody leaked your report.
The Washington Post has a copy.
No.
-Somebody gave it to Bob Woodward.
-Woodward?
No.
Oh, my God almighty.
You find the source?
Sir, the source?
Uh, this is terrible.
Goddamn terrible news.
Do you hear that?
Someone leaked the assessment.
-Oh, terrible.
-Terrible.
Shocking.
-Shocking.
-Shocking.
-Terrible.
-Shocking.
Yeah, well... [grunts]
I don't think it really matters who leaked the assessment.
Question is, what are we gonna do about it?
I wanna do the 60 Minutes interview.
Sir, as your senior PAO, I must counsel strongly against it.
It would be foolhardy.
[stammers] I really don't think now's the time to court media attention.
At the very moment, allegations are being made
-that you leaked this report yourself.
-I'm choosing to embrace the leak, Simon.
I don't seem to be getting any traction.
Do you know what I'm saying?
Traction?
We got ourselves a president who appears not to be aware of the fact that the United States is at war right now, and he's that war's commander in chief.
-I gotta get me some traction.
-[Matt] You need cut through.
Exactly.
Cut through.
You need to get me some goddamn cut through.
I can handle that for you, sir.
Sorry.
No offense, Simon, how exactly are you gonna do that?
I'll quieten this whole situation down.
Again, I'm sorry, I don't wanna start a fight here.
And please forgive me for speaking for you, sir.
But the general didn't hire me to make things quiet, okay?
Look, you're so good at your job, but that job is basically writing press releases.
Here's the thing about press releases.
Nobody reads 'em, okay?
[chuckling] They're boring.
And they're bullshit.
And everyone knows they're bullshit.
Correct me if I'm wrong, you hired me to make some noise.
You know, the right kind of noise.
Our... noise.
[Glen] Pete.
-Boss.
-Move those vehicles to the right.
I wanna make sure the M-ATVs are clearly visible in the background.
Copy that.
They're...
They're completely blocking them.
-This one?
-Both of them.
Just get 'em out of there.
Get 'em out of there!
Hey.
How're we doing over here?
Good?
-Great.
-You good?
Good.
Okay.
-Yeah, I think we're getting close.
-Oh, that's exciting.
I don't wanna interrupt.
I mean, I know you have your own world of questions to ask in there.
You might wanna think about asking the general... how much face time he's had with the president since taking over the position.
Okay.
Yeah.
You know, if you run out of stuff to talk about or whatever.
You're welcome.
Yes, the leak was unfortunate.
There's no denying it.
It's unfortunate.
One would always choose to mull these things over in the... the sensible calm of the proper quiet places.
But this war is tough.
War is tough.
And...
And the president has tough decisions to make.
How many times have you spoken to the president since you've been here?
Since I've been here in Afghanistan, leading ISAF?
Yes.
Uh...
Once.
I've spoken to the president once.
By video teleconference.
You've spoken to the president once in, what, 70 days?
That's right.
You're the leader of US forces in Afghanistan, and you have spoken to the president once in 70 days?
-Yes, ma'am.
-Why is that?
Uh...
I don't know.
Uh...
I'm guessing he's... very busy.
Probably.
[clock ticking]
[Dick] What the fuck's the matter with you, Glen?
Are you out of your mind?
One second we're dealing with this so-called fucking leak, the next you're on the fucking television backing the president into the most ham-fisted corner I've ever seen.
I honestly believe you've made it your sole mission to fuck me.
Well, Dick, I answered the questions that were asked of me.
-I thought I was being fair.
-It's not a question of fair, Glen.
It's a question of what the fuck were you doing on the television?
-Why am I seeing you on the television?
-Oh.
Now we gotta fix this.
We gotta find a way of taking the heat out of this thing.
Now you've gone and lit a fucking fire under it!
Do you understand?
-Yeah, I see.
-Here's where we're gonna start.
You're gonna get on the phone to Bob Gates and--
Hang on, Dick.
You're cutting out.
I can't hear you.
Can you hear me?
Yeah, I can hear you.
And please stop calling me Dick!
Shit.
Something's wrong.
I can't hear a word you're saying.
Let me, uh...
let me try this.
-Can you hear me now?
-Yeah, I can hear you.
Okay, something's wrong here.
Hold on a minute, Dick.
-Oh, God.
-Andy, get your ass in here!
-Yes, sir.
-Got a problem.
-I can't hear a word Dick's saying.
-Uh-huh.
He can hear me, but I can't hear him.
-All right, can you hear us now?
-Yeah, I can hear you.
-What about now, Mr. Dick, sir?
-Yeah, I can hear you!
I'm...
I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry, Dick.
-Oh, gosh!
Can't hear a word you're saying.
Andy's gonna have to work on this, and pronto!
-Yes, sir.
-This is goddamn unacceptable.
-No, no, we need to talk.
-[Glen groans]
I'll talk to you later, Dick.
We need to finish...
We need to finish this thing.
-[computer beeps] -[laughs]
Well done.
-Thank you, sir.
-Well done.
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.
[crowd applauding]
[Obama] Thank you.
I wanna speak to you tonight about our effort in Afghanistan.
It's an extraordinary honor for me to do so here at West Point, where so many men and women have prepared to stand up for our security and to represent what is finest about our country.
As your commander in chief,
I owe you a mission that is clearly defined...
-Yes, you do.
-...and worthy of your service.
And that's why I insisted on a thorough review of our strategy.
And as commander in chief, I have determined that
-it is in our vital national interest...
-Mmm-hmm.
...to send an additional 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan.
After 18 months, our troops will begin to come home.
I do not make this decision lightly.
We have been at war now for eight years, at enormous cost in lives and resources.
-[Glen breathing heavily]
-Years of debate over Iraq and terrorism have left our unity on national security issues in tatters.
And having just experienced the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the American people are understandably focused on rebuilding our economy and putting people to work here at home.
[continues breathing heavily]
[Greg] Sir.
You got your troops.
Buddy here just announced to the whole of Afghanistan that we are about to abandon it!
That's like telling the bad guys all they gotta do
-is wait out the next 18 months...
-Yeah.
...and then we'll be gone!
And so he just told an auditorium full of young American soldiers the war they've been asked to fight these last eight years has been nothing more than one great monumental waste of everybody's time.
That was a clusterfuckingly stupid fucking speech!
Thank you, Greg.
Well, you heard him.
He's not giving us the full 40,000.
They're giving us 30.
I just got off the phone with the SecDef.
We gotta get the rest from our coalition partners.
Looks like we're going to Europe, boys.
So, uh, pack your, uh...
Oh, I don't know, fuck it!
Pack whatever it is they wear in Europe.
-Speedos and shit!
Willy.
-Hmm.
[siren whoops]
[Sean] The world stage.
It's always seemed funny to me how a man can go from looking at a map of,
I don't know, say Helmand province, to finding himself in Europe trying to persuade our friends and allies that his crazy dream is their crazy dream, too.
-[Glen grunts]
-Bonjour, General.
[sighs] Thank you.
-[guard] Bonjour, monsieur.
-Hello.
[Cory] Okay, so tomorrow afternoon, you have the presentation to I'École Militaire.
Uh...
Tomorrow night, dinner with the minister of defense.
That is a gala dinner, by the way.
Just a heads-up so you can prepare yourself mentally.
It's a big one.
Meetings the next day.
Then we got the night free.
-And then to Berlin.
-[Glen] Yeah.
Here we go.
Obama is in Copenhagen tonight.
They wanna know if you can spare time for a meeting on Air Force One tomorrow morning.
-The president wants some face time.
-[Greg chuckles]
Now he wants fucking face time.
Fucking dick.
So can you do that, boss?
Then we can jet across to Copenhagen at zero six.
The president's gonna be on the tarmac at 8:30.
Well, you're the keeper of my schedule, Cory.
You tell me if I can do it.
Uh, okay, yeah, we can have you back in Paris early afternoon, depending on how much time you two need.
And I can shift your morning meetings.
See that out there?
I'm calling that dusk.
That's close of fucking business.
Boss, you good with this?
Sure, Pete.
We're not in theater.
You boys earned it.
Sir, have you had a chance to say hello to your wife yet?
You know, she checked in this morning.
I think she's waiting for you in your room.
Shit.
Right, I should do that.
-What room am I in again?
-[all speaking]
-517.
-What?
-Five-seven-one.
-Five-one-seven.
-Stop.
Go.
-Five-one-seven.
Five-one-seven.
-[knocking on door] -[clears throat]
-Hi, boss.
-Hey, Willy.
[sighs]
-Hi.
Hi, honey.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Huh.
I'm sorry, I've been delayed.
The president is wanting time with me tomorrow, and we've been trying to ascertain whether... whether or not we can accommodate this request.
-I'm gonna leave you two be.
I'll be...
-[clears throat]
-I'll be right next door.
-Okay, thank you, Willy.
[sighs]
[sighs] Well, we're in Paris.
Yeah...
Hopefully we'll get to see some sights.
Yeah, I'll have, uh, Cory, uh, schedule some time.
-Yeah.
-Okay, but you do what you gotta do, because I am here for you.
-Oh, yeah?
-Uh-huh.
-How's Tim?
-Oh, he's good.
He's good.
-He sends his love.
-Okay.
Um...
He's...
He's got a new girlfriend now.
-Ooh!
-Yeah, I like her.
Yeah, her daddy's an ILE instructor over at Leavenworth.
-Huh.
-Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, she's sweet.
You'll like her.
Hmm.
Well...
Well, I...
I think it's just great you're getting to see the president, honey.
You must be very excited, huh?
[Pat] Hey, Glen.
Hope you don't mind me hitching a ride.
I'm on my own dash to see the president.
They told me you were heading over there this morning.
No problem, Pat.
My plane is your plane.
-Knock yourself out.
-Thanks, Glen.
So my hope is, depending on how long your meeting goes with the president, we can have you back in Paris NLT 1400, then straight to the École Militaire for 1500.
My uniform will be crushed after these flights.
I'll need a shower, a fresh shave.
I'm allowing for four solid hours with the president.
If it's less than that, we should be fine to go via the hotel.
I am just contingency planning for the possibility we may be running tight on time.
-Can we move the École Militaire back?
-Not really.
Gonna be a lot of people there.
We have the gala dinner right after.
We don't have any wiggle room here.
[Greg] You should wear the fatigues to the thing this afternoon.
The general, direct from the battlefield.
No need to shower when you're straight from the fight.
-That's good.
-Yeah.
-It's very good.
-[Matt] I like that.
Well, just make sure Willy has my fatigues on standby.
[Glen grunts]
Talking points for the president.
[Glen grunts]
How you doing, Glen?
Oh!
[sighs]
This one is a bitch, right?
Nothing about war is easy, Pat.
Right on.
Though I'm guessing, somewhere deep down, you were happier in Iraq.
A soldier leading soldiers.
Soldiers above you, soldiers below you.
Just a nice bubble of soldiers.
Just ordered.
Right?
'Cause it has to be.
War is chaos, so then the army has to be the opposite of chaos.
But now you find yourself in the real world.
Now you're dealing with civilians, and civilians don't make sense.
Not making sense is a luxury I can't afford.
Hmm.
Lives depend on it.
-No, of course.
-Yeah.
Absolutely.
And you can't live in the bubble forever.
You gotta rise as your talents dictate.
What do you want, Pat?
How do you think this ends?
Simple.
We either win it or we lose it.
Yeah, I don't know.
I think I'm gonna call bullshit on that, Glen.
All the winning we were ever gonna do, we did in the first six months.
And since then, we've just been making a mess.
And that's all it was ever gonna be.
You're not here to win.
You're here to clean up the mess.
You'll get your 40,000 troops.
Get 'em in there.
Get your PowerPoint presentation in order, you know?
Just move the needle a little bit.
Show everyone how all the graphs are pointing in the right direction.
That's all you gotta do.
That's how this ends best for you...
anyway.
A nice-looking set of graphs.
Or a nicer-looking set of graphs than the last set of graphs.
Either that or get yourself fired.
Then you can say "I told you so" when it all turns to shit or fizzles out or...
however it is this thing ends.
There's no street parade at the end of this one.
It's good to talk.
[inaudible]
-[cameras shutters clicking] -[indistinct chatter]
[Obama] Everybody.
How are you?
Morning.
Yeah, it's good to see you again.
[indistinct chatter]
-How you doing?
Good to see you.
Nice tie.
-[man 1] Thank you.
[Obama] All right.
How's it going?
-Morning, sir.
Nice to see you again.
-All right.
Take care now.
[woman] It's good to see you, Mr. President.
[Obama] All right, see you soon.
-Mr.
President.
-It's great to see you, General.
I'm sorry, but we're running behind schedule.
I was looking forward to getting some face time with you, but I gotta get this baby in the air.
So... all right.
Smile for the cameras, Glen.
All right.
Take care.
-Pat.
-Mr.
President.
-Let's get going.
-[Pat] Yes, sir.
All right, Magnus, talk to you soon.
Okay?
[Sean] You could argue that the main reason certain generals like war so much is... well, because it's only in war that they feel truly relevant.
It's only in war that they feel close to the center of power.
Only in war do they feel the warm glow of other people's attention.
[Matt] Good evening, sir.
The attention of people like me.
Okay, you know what?
You both look beautiful.
[chuckles] Really.
Uh, sir, before you get dragged into the hubbub there,
I want to introduce you to Sean Cullen here.
Sean's the writer from Rolling Stone.
He's been doing that profile piece on you.
He's gonna be tagging along for a couple days.
Thanks for having me, sir.
It's a real privilege.
-Rolling Stone?
-Yes, sir.
Just make sure I'm on the cover.
Well, it's between you and Lady Gaga, sir.
Well, put me in a heart-shaped bathtub with her.
-Rose petals.
Happy to share.
-[both chuckling]
Glen, stop joking. [laughing]
I'm deadly serious, son.
Put me on the cover.
[laughs] [clears throat]
Okay, here we are.
There's the boss.
There's Mrs. Boss.
[Greg] Oh, there's me.
There's you.
Where's me?
I guess you're on a different table.
Better keep looking.
-You serious?
-Hmm.
[clears throat]
-Sorry.
-Yes?
Excuse me.
I think you are sitting in my seat, sir.
Oh.
Oh, hey, there.
I'm sorry.
Pleased to meet you.
[indistinct chatter]
[Glen] Dear.
Thank you.
Hi.
[clears throat]
General.
Tom Howard, sir.
I'm the United States defense attaché here in Paris.
Pleased to meet you.
This is my wife, Jeanie.
Pleased to meet you, Jeanie.
Are you enjoying your time here in Paris?
Oh, yes, very much.
It's lovely.
Isn't it?
Have you managed to see any museums or exhibitions?
-Have you done the Louvre?
-Oh, um,
I...
I think we're gonna be too busy to see the Louvre.
But I've been wandering around by myself while Glen's at meetings, and... oh, my, it's... it's lovely.
General, I thought it went very well at the École Militaire today.
I didn't get the opportunity to introduce myself there.
But, uh, there were some very interesting people there today.
If you'd like, I'd be very happy to give you a rundown of the who's who if you get a little window in your schedule while--
I appreciate that.
My schedule's very tight.
Of course.
Totally understood.
General, I could introduce you to some people here tonight if you'd prefer.
No, I...
I think my team and I have a grip on the who's who.
Thank you.
-Cory, where's Badi?
-Hmm?
Uh, I don't know, boss.
He was here a minute ago.
I thought he was supposed to be sitting beside you and Jeanie.
[clears throat]
General, I thought it best if you and I took this opportunity to talk, so... so I switched places with your colleague over there, I...
Like you said, your schedule's very tight.
What'd you say your name was?
Tom Howard, sir.
What do you think this dinner is for, Tom Howard?
[stammers] General, this dinner is to honor you, sir.
Wrong.
This dinner is for Afghanistan.
We are here tonight because we're at war in Afghanistan.
And you got the goddamn gall to kick the only Afghan in the room
-off my goddamn table?
-I'm sorry--
Let me tell you what I want you to do, Tom Howard.
I want you to go sit your ass down wherever the fuck your ass was officially designated to sit, and I want you to tell Badi to bring his ass back over here!
-[people gasp]
-How's that sound, Tom Howard?
I'm sorry, sir.
Ma'am. [clears throat]
I apologize for my language.
-[Jeanie] Everything's okay, honey.
-[Greg] Uh, boss?
I'm pretty sure the Afghan ambassador here is from Afghanistan.
General.
Sir.
[Cory] Swell.
I don't want for this dinner to be awkward for you, General, so I will tell you now that we intend to give you our portion of the troops that you request.
I don't think the Germans will be so easy.
I think that they are feeling inclined to withdraw altogether.
And, uh, I should add that
I would hate for you to think that France is easy.
This must be a final moment, no?
We cannot stay in Afghanistan forever.
No, we can't.
That's why I'm gonna win it.
Thank you.
[sighs] That was strange.
[laughter echoing]
Writing a biography, is that something...
you might be open to?
Or...
For sure, yeah.
Something I'm absolutely open to...
[Matt] It's such a fascinating subject matter.
No offense, book could kinda write itself.
We may have a problem getting to Berlin tomorrow.
This volcano in Iceland.
It's, uh... canceling all flights because of the ash cloud.
-Dude, we got our own plane.
-Guess this cloud's huge.
Nothing's taking off in Europe.
They're grounding all air traffic.
[Pete] We got tonight free, right?
Then what's the plan?
We're drinking.
Tell me we're fucking drinking.
Today is Jeanie and my's 30th wedding anniversary, so, uh...
I'm taking her to dinner.
Just the two of you?
Yes.
It doesn't matter, honey.
I've had fun.
-Good.
Good.
-Mmm.
We'll come back again when everything's normal and we can do it together.
-Sure.
-Mmm-hmm.
[sighs] We're together.
Yeah.
-This is so special.
-Hmm.
Hmm. [chuckles]
You know, the other day I was, uh, calculating the...
I was working out that we've spent less than 30 days a year together for the last eight years. [chuckles]
-And...
-[clears throat] ...I was just thinking that it's really interesting, the way things happen.
Well, if we hadn't gone to war... if September 11th hadn't happened... if America hadn't been attacked and we hadn't gone to war,
I'd probably be barbecuing something in our backyard right now.
-Mmm.
-But 9/11 did happen, didn't it?
Hmm?
Yes.
Yes, I know.
I know.
I know, and I am...
I'm sorry.
-I didn't say that to make you feel bad.
-Why are you thinking about it?
No, I'm not...
I'm not...
I'm not thinking about it, I promise.
Yes, you are.
You're calculating days.
You just told me, one day you sat yourself down with a calendar and you calculated days.
Yes, I know.
I know.
But I just did that because...
I did it because I was proud of you, honey.
I'm proud of me, too.
You know?
[sighs]
Yeah, I'm proud of me, too.
Do you know?
[sighs]
Oh, honey.
No, honey, look at me.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I know.
Yes, every...
Everything...
Everything's okay.
Yeah.
[sighs]
Obama's not a leader.
He's an orator.
He hammered the whole world on, "Yes, we can.
Yes, we can."
Really, it's "No, we can't."
Yeah.
We can't do Iraq.
He's loud and clear now that we can't do Afghanistan.
We can't do Gitmo.
Where the fuck else we gonna put all these motherfuckers?
-That's a great orator.
Right there.
-Hmm.
He's sold us on, like, a double negative.
Yes, we can not do things.
You know?
Or is that a double negative?
Not really, but I know what you mean.
-Yo, look who it is!
-[all clamoring]
-Hey.
-[men cheering]
-Hi.
-[Cory] Hello, Mrs. Boss.
[pop music playing]
[Cory] Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
[Pete] Boss and Mrs. Boss, down there.
-You, drink!
-No, no.
-[Pete] You, drink!
-[Cory] Down the hatch.
Sir, I just want to say again what a privilege this is.
-You must be really proud.
-Hmm?
-You must be really proud of him.
-Oh, yes, I am.
[Pete] Ow!
-Ah, here we go!
Here we go!
-[officers] Oh, yeah!
-[Cory] Go, Pete!
-[all cheering]
[Andy] Come on!
I got your name all over this.
[Pete] I always loved this asshole!
[indistinct yelling] [cheering and hooting]
-We're not flying to Berlin tomorrow.
-What?
-[Cory] Not flying to Berlin tomorrow.
-What?
They won't give us clearance to fly to Berlin tomorrow.
USA!
Everybody now!
[all chanting] USA!
USA!
This is bullshit.
It's, like, one phone call.
"Hello, they won't let us take off.
Can you fix it?"
[in French accent] "Oh, no, monsieur.
Big volcano.
No take off."
"Well, this is General Glen McMahon we're talking about here."
"Oh, General Glen McMahon.
Oh, I did not know.
Why didn't you say that?
Pardon, monsieur, of course you may take off."
-Done!
How hard is that?
-I've made the calls.
Believe me.
[Greg] Listen, we are the fucking US military.
We practically invented everything!
And now we have some chinless fuck in Brussels who's telling us we can't fly our own plane because of a volcano in Greenland.
What are we supposed to do?
Sit around here in Paris and wait for it to "stop erupting"?
I don't know, Greg.
This isn't exactly a situation that I've been in before.
Okay, bear with me on this one.
I think I might have just solved our problem.
[inaudible]
[Sean] I really can't tell you why these guys got so loose in front of me.
Or why Glen let them get so loose.
I can only put it down to hubris.
These guys thought they were the most important guys in the world... with the most important jobs in the world.
Maybe they assumed I thought they were as amazing as they did.
What are you writing?
Hmm?
What are you writing?
You're always writing.
I don't like it.
[Sean] Maybe they thought they could do whatever they wanted.
I'm a writer.
I write.
I better like what it is you're writing.
Let's say you have ten insurgents.
Huh?
Now, let's say you kill two of 'em.
Now, how many insurgents do you have left?
Hmm?
Hmm?
Well, you'd say eight, of course.
Eight.
Right?
Right?
Wrong!
In this scenario, ten minus two equals 20.
Let's say the two insurgents you just killed, uh... each had six friends or brothers or some such, who are hovering on the brink of...
of joining the insurgency.
They're thinking about this insurgency thing.
"Looks interesting.
But, you know, for one reason or other, not for me."
But...
So, then you go and kill their friend.
Now you've just made up their minds for 'em.
Those hovering friends are now full, paid-up members of the enemy.
Yeah.
And so, in the math of counterinsurgency, ten minus two... equals 20.
Uh, yes, ma'am?
General, the US invaded Afghanistan because of the al-Qaeda attacks on September 11th.
-This is correct, yes?
-Yeah.
You have been speaking to us now for 45 minutes-- [man speaking German]
Oh, uh, where's the, uh...
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
[woman speaking German] [in English] You have been speaking to us now for 45 minutes, and yet in all of that time you have only mentioned al-Qaeda once.
Your own vice president has advocated a much smaller and simpler counterterrorism approach to incapacitate what is estimated to be little more than 100 al-Qaeda fighters that still remain in Afghanistan to refocus on what it was that started this war in the first place.
-Ah.
-Your analysis of the insurgency there suggests to me there is no monolithic Taliban.
You are spread over the entire country.
You are fighting 1,000 separate battles with locals whose principal ideological position would seem to be simply that they don't want foreign soldiers in their village.
And that, General, you must know, is a war you will never win.
[Glen] Ah.
Uh... with all due respect, ma'am.
Uh...
I must beg to differ.
I firmly believe, having traveled to all corners of the country, having spoken with many people from many walks of life... that what these people want is the very same thing that you and I want.
Hmm?
Freedom, security, stability, jobs.
Progress is being made.
Real Progress.
But challenges do remain.
[woman] Yes, I understand all of that, General.
And... and, please, let me say quite sincerely that I do not question the goodness of your intent.
I have been listening to you here this morning, and, uh...
I believe you are a good man.
I do.
What I question is... your belief in your power to deliver these things that you describe.
I question your belief in the power of your ideals.
Ah, well... [stuttering] I think what I am trying to say, and I apologize, General, if this is sounding impolite, but I question your sense of self.
[men clamoring in German]
No, no, no, that's all... all right.
I, uh, appreciate your, uh, commentary.
I do.
Um...
But I have a job to do.
Yes, I understand.
And I also have a job to do.
And I am trying to do mine.
As an elected representative of the people of Germany, it is my job to ensure that the personal ambitions of those who serve those people are kept in check.
You have devoted your entire life, General, to the fighting of war.
And this situation in Afghanistan, for you, it is the culmination of all your years of training, all your years of ambition.
-This is the great moment of your life.
-Well...
It's understandable to me that you should have, therefore, a fetish for completion to make your moment glorious.
It is my job, however, to ensure that your personal ambitions are not entirely delusional and do not carry with them an unacceptable cost for everybody else.
-[Jeanie] Honey, you okay?
-I'm fine.
Please don't shut down.
It's our last day together.
Be here with me.
One second.
Thank you.
So, just got an email from Gates.
Good news and bad news.
Spoke with the German defense minister...
We're getting our troops.
Turns out that crazy bitch...
lady back there was just some sad, lonely voice in the wilderness.
Bad news is, they won't let their guys leave the base.
Whatever that means.
But, hey, they're ponying up.
So I guess job here is done.
Boss?
[Sean] I used to think that men went gray because they had stressful jobs with stressful decisions to make.
Now, I think it happens when men start to feel in their bones that the great moments of their lives... might not turn out to be quite as great as they'd always hoped.
When the real world starts creeping in.
What separates the believers like Glen from everybody else is... their ability to block this real world out.
Some people call this insanity.
Welcome to Operation Moshtarak.
We're taking the Helmand province, gentlemen, once and for all.
Moshtarak will be the largest operation yet to be conducted since this war began.
So, needless to say, it is an important one.
This whole province has been a thorn in our ass since day one.
So this here will be a definitive test in our resolve.
And that starts right here in Marjah.
If we infill teams here and here tonight, we can set up our blocking positions, hopefully draw enough wiggle room for the marines tomorrow.
-Good.
-The forecast says tonight's the night.
If we don't go in tonight, likely have to wait maybe another week.
I want Karzai to sign off on this.
Cory, can you get him on the phone?
Copy.
And why these spots?
ISR is telling us these locations are where there still appears to be a concentration of movement.
Obviously, we're proceeding under the assumption that anyone who isn't a bad guy has moved on or at least hunkered down.
We've made it clear to the whole city that's the thing to do.
[Frank] If I could just ask a question, General.
Shoot!
[stutters] I know this is Marjah, but I'm still not quite clear as to why you're sending boys to Nawzad and Musa Qala.
I mean, there's nothing out there.
I'm just not quite clear what it is you're trying to control there.
Apart from nothing.
You see this map, Frank?
This one, hmm?
This here is the mess I'm having to clean up.
Now, we've been kind enough to plan this operation in such a way as to not make it look like the Americans are here to get done what you couldn't.
But that is what's happening.
Hmm?
So, Frank, uh... while your input is greatly appreciated...
It is.
I wouldn't want you to think that it isn't.
It is.
I'd also appreciate if you would take one nice, big step back and let me get this shit done.
-Yeah.
Hmm?
Yeah?
-[Cory clears throat]
-What?
-I can't get him.
They're telling me he's in bed with a cold.
Well, did you tell 'em what it's about?
I didn't tell 'em exactly what it was about.
-I said it was very important.
-Jesus H. Christ.
-Just dial the number again.
I'll talk.
-Right.
Copy.
Thanks, Bernie.
Let's assume this is happening.
I'll give you the green light soon as I get it.
-Yes, sir.
-I have General McMahon on the line.
Hello, who am I speaking with?
This is General McMahon.
I need to speak to President Karzai urgently.
I understand he's not feeling well, but I need to speak with him.
Is he awake?
Good.
Put him on.
Put the call through.
What do you mean, he doesn't have one?
What world leader doesn't have a phone in his bedroom?
Does he have a cell phone in there?
-Did you try his cell phone?
-Straight to voice mail.
What?
Well, tell him to turn it back on.
Please!
Please!
This is...
I can't...
Oh, fuck it!
I'm coming over there.
This is me doing that right now.
I'm making the appointment right now.
[laughing]
Oh!
[coughing] [continues laughing]
[knocking on door]
-Yes?
-[TV turns off]
-Oh, General, please come in.
-Mr.
President.
Please sit here.
Please, please sit.
Sit.
[grunts]
-How are you?
-I'm fine, sir.
I've been trying to contact you.
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.
I'm not feeling well.
I understand, sir.
But did they not tell you this is urgent?
Oh, you know how everything is at the top of the mountain, General.
Everybody's urgent about everything all the time.
Everything is important.
Nothing ever really is.
There's nothing that cannot wait until morning.
This is important, sir.
We hope to launch Operation Moshtarak tonight, and I need your official consent before doing so.
-Really?
-Yes, sir.
-Why?
-Because it's your mission.
-It is?
-Yes, sir.
[Karzai] Ah.
No one has ever asked me to approve a mission before.
Well, that needs to change.
This mission needs your consent.
If we're to win the trust of Helmand province, [stammers] it demands that this mission be seen to be of your design.
-[sneezes]
-I...
I don't mean to be rude, Mr. President, but it is imperative that you begin to take a leadership role here.
We cannot win this thing alone.
Without your active involvement, our presence here will never be anything more than a foreign occupation.
This is your war.
For your country.
Your people.
Again, I'm sorry, sir... but you need to behave like a leader.
But I am behaving like a leader.
I'm unavailable.
I am as unavailable to you as is your own president.
Hmm?
[clears throat]
You have my approval, General.
We both know it was never really mine to give.
But...
I thank you for inviting me to participate in the theater of it all.
And good luck.
I wish you much success.
[indistinct chatter on TV]
[door opens]
Good luck tonight, Glen.
Who told you about tonight?
I just mean... whatever you happen to find yourself doing tonight, good luck with it.
Go fuck yourself, Pat.
[Pat] Glen?
Glen.
-What?
-[sighs]
Look, I just want to apologize.
You know how the other day
I said there wasn't a parade at the end of all this?
I was wrong.
It was glib.
I just thought it was a pithy way to end the conversation, but I was wrong.
There's gonna be thousands of parades.
Thousands of 'em all over America.
Only none of them will be for you.
Now that was pithy, too, but it was true.
Fuck you!
[Pat] Roger that.
[Greg] What was that about, buddy?
[Glen] Nothing.
Let's get to Kandahar.
We got some fucking winning to do.
[North] Okay, listen up.
This is going to be tough.
I'm not gonna mince words about that.
This will be tough.
This will probably be the toughest mission that any of you all will experience.
This is the real deal.
Marjah is Taliban ground zero.
This is gonna be IEDs everywhere.
This is gonna be their best guys.
And they are gonna be prepared.
They know we're coming, gentlemen.
They've known we're coming for weeks.
So don't be under any illusion.
This will get ugly.
We're gonna lose guys.
I am not gonna lie to you about that.
There will be casualties.
But if you keep your wits about you, if you have faith in your ability, if you have faith in the ability of the men next to you, you will come out the tail end of this!
I have faith in you!
I know who you are!
You are proud members of the toughest fucking fighting force this world has ever known.
Carry that knowledge with you!
Carry it with pride!
Do you understand me?
[soldiers] Oorah!
-Do you understand me?
-[soldiers] Oorah!
[captain] That's right.
Any of you so inclined, I'm gonna ask this chaplain to say a prayer for us.
Thank you, Captain.
Let us pray!
Almighty God, as these marines prepare for battle, we pray that your Holy Spirit shall guide them.
As you brought down the walls of Jericho, as you dealt out your wrath upon the Philistines, as you crushed the Hittites and brought retribution upon all the enemies of the righteous, may your mighty hand be upon these men and assure their victories.
Be with them, mighty God... [officer] Let's move.
[indistinct radio chatter]
-What are you thinking about, buddy?
-[inhales sharply]
[Glen] Well, let's just see how this plays out.
The uncrackable nut.
If anyone's gonna crack this, it's gonna be you.
You're gonna smash this like a monkey on a rock.
Yeah.
-You're a killing machine, Glen.
-Hmm.
You are the terrorist hunter.
Remember?
-You're Big Glen.
-[grunts softly]
You're the Glenimal.
Thank you, General.
[exhales]
-[goat bleating]
-I'm hungry.
I wanna eat that motherfucker.
[soldier] Jesus Christ, man.
Farrenberg.
Move.
-[sniper rifle firing]
-Contact front!
[soldier] Move!
Move!
Up against the wall!
-Farrenberg.
-[soldier] Not too close.
Get off the walls.
Now!
-Fuck!
-[soldier] Over there, twelve o'clock!
[Ortega] Cole!
Cole!
I need to see a weapon.
He isn't a combatant until I see a weapon.
Fuck, man!
You think this nigga on his morning jog?
[Ortega] All right.
All right.
We're gonna head to that house over there at two o'clock.
All right?
We're gonna work this shit out.
Cutter, I need you, Song, Carroll and Trey, head over there and get us in, all right?
We're gonna move up to cover you.
I need ANA guys going in first.
Trey!
You take those first two guys with you.
Copy?
Oorah!
You two, up!
Up!
Get the fuck up!
Move in.
[Trey] Come on!
Let's go!
Clear.
Put that gun up, now.
[Cutter] We're getting ready to move now.
-[grunts] -[stones rattling]
Come on!
Come on.
Fucking move!
Come on!
Zah, zah, zah, you fuck!
Oh, you fat piece of shit!
Fucking move!
Move!
-[gate rattling] -[Trey yelling indistinctly]
Move!
[soldiers yelling indistinctly]
[Trey] To the right!
-[soldier] Clear!
-All right!
All clear!
Okay.
Farrenberg, let's go!
Move.
Go in.
All right.
Listen up.
We're gonna get on the roof of this place, figure out what we're looking at.
Cutter, Cole, you're coming with me.
The rest of you guys stay put.
Copy?
[soldiers] Copy.
[Ortega] Comin' up!
[Trey] We got movement, twelve o'clock.
About 300 meters, two guys on the roof.
-Are they armed?
-I don't know.
It's a simple fucking question, Trey.
Do you see a weapon?
No.
That's not what you asked.
You asked if they were armed.
The answer to that one is, I don't fucking know.
Obviously they're armed, Ortega.
Why else would they be running around up there?
I don't fucking know, do I?
I don't understand these fucking people.
All I know is we need to see weapons.
-[Trey] Ah!
-[gun firing]
-[Ortega] Are you hit?
Are you hit?
-[Trey] Fuck!
-I'm fucking hit!
-[Ortega] Where are you hit?
On my fucking eyes.
-Can you open 'em?
-What the fuck is going on?
Is he hit?
We're good.
We're good.
Trey's just got shit in his eyes.
[Cutter] Hey, yo, guys!
-Cutter, get the fuck over here!
-[Cutter] Fuck!
[Ortega] It's just water.
It's just water.
Give us...
Give me the 203.
Give me the 203.
-[Ortega] Trey, stay still!
-Give me your fucking gun!
[Song] Ortega!
What's going on up there?
What the fuck's going on up there, guys?
-[Trey groaning]
-Cover!
[Trey] Fuck.
Fucking short, man!
Fuck.
-Again!
-Zah!
-Short!
-I know.
One more!
Fuck, yeah!
[Ortega] Good job, Cole.
Nice shooting, boys.
-Farrenberg, you hit?
-Nah.
-Are you hit?
-No.
I'm good.
-Fuck.
-[gunfire continues]
-Fuck this shit!
-Cole, where the fuck are you going?
-Dude, where the fuck are you going?
-Fuck off!
-Corporal, what's happening?
-Wait, where the fuck are you going, man?
-Shut the fuck up!
-Wait, Cole!
Cole!
-Cole!
Get back here, Cole!
-[soldier 1] Cole!
[soldier 2] Cole, what the fuck, man?
Where you going?
[soldier 3] Where the fuck are you going, man?
-Fuck, Cole!
-Come back, Cole!
Cole!
[indistinct chatter in distance]
[breathing heavily]
[inaudible]
[Cory] They're crawling.
They're in the middle of an IED belt.
And first and second platoons, they're pinned down, and second is close to requesting QRF.
Tell me something good, Cory.
[Cory] I'm trying.
This info ain't meeting me halfway.
I wanna hear something good, God damn it.
I don't want the word "clusterfuck" featuring anywhere in tomorrow's news.
Don't worry about the headlines, buddy.
[indistinct radio chatter]
We got civilian casualties.
We got civilian casualties southeast corner of town, third platoon.
It's those boys from Sasquatch.
Cutter, find out who these fucking guys are.
If they're gonna stand there, I wanna know who they are.
How?
Get one of the ANA to talk to 'em.
Them motherfuckers speak Pashto.
The ANA don't speak Pashto.
I don't know.
Figure it out.
The fuck...
Cutter's fucking shit up outside.
-All right.
What's the deal here?
-He's saying he didn't know the bad guys.
They just commandeered his house, and there was nothing he could do about it.
Well, that's fucking bullshit.
We did leaflet drops and shit.
He shouldn't still be here.
Why are you still here?
What's your reason for being here?
[speaking Pashto] [speaking Pashto]
[in English] He says that he has nowhere to go.
He has no wife.
He is worried about leaving his goats.
He says that he's telling the truth.
You can search his house.
You will find no weapons.
[sighs]
Wait.
Farrenberg?
Farrenberg!
-[Farrenberg] Yeah, I'm here!
-Come here!
We're gonna give this guy some money, all right?
-You fucking serious?
-Yeah, I am serious.
Give me the fucking...
Open the fucking bag.
-What are those, 2.5?
-Yeah.
Okay, give me one of those.
My name is General Glen McMahon.
On behalf of the coalition forces,
I wanna apologize to you for the loss you've suffered here today.
[speaking Pashto]
I know the money that Sergeant Ortega gave you can't bring back your family.
But hopefully it can help you to rebuild, because rebuilding is what we're all about.
And providing you with the security you need to live a long and prosperous life.
[soldier speaking Pashto]
[Glen] Roads and schools and then jobs, so... you can raise your families, and jobs so you can put food on the table.
[soldier speaking Pashto]
The Taliban aren't gonna provide you jobs.
The Taliban aren't here to help you.
Only we can help you.
[soldier speaking Pashto]
We have a saying in America...
"You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs."
[soldier speaking Pashto]
I understand that sometimes it can be hard to see the helping hand, what with all the guns and the strange guys and the mess and what have you.
[soldier speaking Pashto]
But I assure you, this is the hand of helping.
This is the helping hand.
[soldier speaking Pashto]
[Glen] Yeah.
[man speaking Pashto]
He says that he likes roads and schools, but when you leave, it will all mean nothing and they will be left in a big mess.
And every day that you spend here longer, the worse it will be for them when you leave.
So please, leave now.
Please.
I understand your concerns.
I really do.
That's... [soldier speaking Pashto]
That's why we're doing everything we can to bring peace, and to train up your own Afghan forces.
[translating]
So that they can maintain your security, uh...
-[stammers] well into the future.
-[soldier interpreting] [speaking Pashto]
Please, leave now.
[men clamoring]
Dragonfly, this is Spartan Two.
Think we're ready to roll.
[clamoring continues]
Give 'em hell, boys!
Kill those motherfuckers!
Eat 'em alive!
[sighs] [indistinct chatter in distance]
[door opening]
Jesus Christ, Willy.
What time is it?
It's me, boss.
Um... sorry to wake you.
We have a problem.
That Rolling Stone article came out, and it's not good.
Sir, it says we're shit-talking our president.
And our vice president.
That we don't have the support of our coalition partners.
And that we're drunk all over Europe.
Basically, a fucking drinking tour.
All over Europe.
I mean, I don't even know what the legals on a thing like this are, you know?
Nothing he says in there is actually untrue.
I'll get the editor on the phone as soon as it's morning there and see if there's anything they can do.
I'm not sure what that's gonna be, though.
Bottom line, this is gonna play bad, all right?
It's gonna play really fucking bad.
So we are in damage control now.
Guys, guys...
Is this really that bad?
I mean, yeah, it's colorful, sure.
But... this is Rolling Stone, okay?
It's hip.
And you guys...
You guys are the operators.
You know, you're out there, you're getting shit done in, like, a totally non-square way.
[Cory] Yes, Little, you fucking idiot, it's that bad.
[Simon] This was always a terrible idea.
Why you would unnecessarily court attention like this is- [Matt] Simon, can you shut the fuck up?
-I will not shut up!
This is your mess.
You created it.
You invited this... this Cullen fellow in, you didn't properly consult me!
What?
I didn't properly consult you?
Are you fucking kidding me?
-We had a conversation.
-[knocking on door]
-Give me his phone number.
-[Matt] What?
Whose phone number?
This fucking Cullen fuck.
Give me his fucking phone number!
-I'm not gonna give you his phone number.
-Why the fuck not?
Because you're acting crazy!
You're acting like a fucking lunatic right now!
-[Pete] You think this is crazy, huh?
-[thudding]
-You think this is me being crazy?
-[Cory] Peter!
Calm down!
[Pete] You fucking calm down!
Duckman!
I'm gonna beat you down unless you chill out.
Oh, I'd like to see you try, old man.
Fucking come on!
[Glen] Settle down, fellas.
I do believe I'm finished.
So... do me a favor, and... be lovely to one another.
-Sir.
-Yes, sir.
[door opening]
[phone ringing]
Dick.
[Dick] Glen.
The president wants to see you in DC.
You need to be on a plane this afternoon.
-Okay.
-Okay.
Andy.
Badi.
Okay.
Let's go, Willy.
[Greg] Fall out.
-Do you need anything, boss?
-Uh, no.
Thank you, Willy.
Are you... are you sure you don't need me to come with you?
I'm fine, Willy.
-Thanks.
-Yeah.
[sniffles]
[Sean] And so Glen finally got his face time with the president.
Getting fired probably wasn't the kind of face time he was after, but, well,
I guess you could say it was kind of a page in the history books.
That was pretty exciting for me.
But, sadly, while I would've liked to have thought that my story had made a difference, it didn't.
It just became another celebrity-fall-from-grace story.
It would've been nice if the conversation after had been about the failure of counterinsurgency, or why we seem so desperate to be at war all the time, or how maybe what we're doing is just making more enemies
all in the name of keeping America safe.
It might've been nice if it had caused someone important to ask what any of this says about us.
But really, the only question anyone seemed to want to ask was,
"What the fuck was Glen McMahon doing talking to a Rolling Stone reporter anyway?"
Which, admittedly, is a good question.
Anyway, in the absence of any real soul searching, what do we do?
Well, obviously, we sack Glen and we bring in some other guy.
And that other guy... was Bob.
Ah, America.
You beacon of composure and proportionate response.
You bringer of calm and goodness to the world.
What do you do when the war you're fighting just can't possibly be won in any meaningful sense?
Well, obviously, you sack the guy not winning it, and you bring in some other guy.
In 2009, that war was Afghanistan.
And that other guy... was Glen.
You boys ready?
Let's go win this thing.
Okay.
So this is what I learned about four-star General Glen McMahon.
He was born to a military family at Fort Leavenworth.
Graduated West Point in 1976.
Ranger school in '79.
He had a graduate degree in political affairs and military history from Yale.
He was both a straight-A student and a troublemaker.
He once famously attempted to stick a lit cherry bomb up his sleeping drill sergeant's ass.
He was loved by the men and women who served under him.
Three, two, one, let's go.
Never afraid to get his hands dirty.
Yeah, it's flash time.
Never willing to send his troops anywhere he wouldn't go himself.
He was known variously as the Lion King, the G-Man, Big Glen and, most commonly, the Glenimal.
He was like a throwback to another era.
His hand was bent into a permanent claw, like it was still clutching a World War II cigar his modern, fitness-fanatic self wouldn't allow him to smoke.
After a successful stint running the secretive special operations killing machine in Iraq,
Glen was appointed leader of US and coalition forces in Afghanistan.
A war which, as he saw it, wasn't being won 'cause it wasn't being led.
General.
We're all very excited to have you here.
It's an honor to meet you.
I'm excited to be here.
Ain't that right, Greg?
Yes, indeed, sir.
You're very excited.
Somehow, while he was in Iraq,
Glen found time to author a book on leadership, entitled One Leg at a Time, Just Like Everybody Else.
In it, he wrote, men are imperfect creatures.
Left to their own devices, all they really want to do is play with their dicks and eat chicken.
For all his many achievements leading special operations in Iraq,
I think most of us here will know General McMahon as the man who took out al-Zarwaqi, who kicked al-Qaeda in the sack.
You're welcome.
We have a warrior at the helm, and it's a pleasure to have you, sir.
Glen was known as a humble man.
But humble in that way that says, my humility makes me better than you.
He was famous for his Spartan regime of routine and discipline.
He ate one meal a day.
He slept four hours per night.
He ran seven miles every morning.
In Iraq, he transformed special operations with what he called systemic negation of repetitive procedural practice.
Or, to the acronym-obsessed military, SNORPP.
We got Italy in there.
That's the Dutch.
We got Poland, Macedonia, Ukraine.
We got Australia over there, Croatia, Belgium...
Okay, that'll do.
Bite-size chunks, hmm?
Let's knock this on the head.
All right.
Basically, he was a master of systems organization.
Which he'd kind of need to be, if he was to corral this 43-nation coalition of the willing.
- May I help you?
- No, finish your phone call.
The war can wait.
What can I do for you, General?
I want to pull everyone out of their offices.
I want to open this place up.
I came in here to speak with you about that.
I have only ten men to lead here in Afghanistan, huh.
So it make no sense for me to be sit out there with everybody else.
I get it.
All right?
But everybody has a reason not to be out there with everybody else.
Austria only has two guys here.
Iceland has seven guys.
This country won't fight at night.
That country won't fight in the snow.
This country wants to do counter-narcotics.
That country won't do counter-narcotics.
But if we're in the same room...
Cory Staggart was Glen's executive officer.
Ran the general's affairs.
He was a Ranger.
Although how he made it through Ranger school, I have no idea.
That's great.
Thank you, guys.
That's all the time we got.
Let's go.
Come on.
Greg Pulver.
General Greg Pulver graduated West Point in the same class as Glen.
Oh, that's interesting.
Does he have security clearance?
And hadn't left his side since.
Then fucking let him in just like you would any other fucking person with a fucking security clearance!
His official title was director of intelligence, but all I saw was a guy with anger management issues whose life had no meaning without Glen.
Andy Moon was Glen's tech whiz, providing the general with all forms of IT support.
Andy.
- Yes, sir?
- Which Glen needed often.
- How are you?
- Pretty good, sir.
How are you doing?
Swell.
Can you come with me a moment?
- My electric razor is...
- Oh, yes, sir.
Yeah, broken.
Pete Duckman was a Navy SEAL.
Like Pulver, his job title had the word "intelligence" in it.
- What's going on?
- Boss is visiting with President Karzai.
Cool.
Why so fancy?
He's a world leader.
Cool.
Am I coming?
Yes, you are.
It's your job.
God damn it, Pete.
Why are you fat?
- I'm not fat.
- I still, to this day, don't know exactly what it was that Duckman did for the general.
It's a mixture of cross-pollinational collation...
Admiral Simon Ball was Glen's public affairs officer.
- Cooperational, cooperative...
- For three and a half years, he'd been trying to explain SNORPP to the Washington press gallery.
...with a centralized command centralization structure, and... things like that.
Matt Little was Glen's new civilian PR consultant.
Oh, I don't know.
Is this a good hand?
- He was a DC marketing hotshot...
- Straight flush.
Hello?
And sometime lobbyist who had thought the war in Afghanistan to be entirely pointless.
Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm not going there.
Until he was offered a lot of money to sell it.
How much?
And Willy Dunne.
- Right this way, boss.
Yeah.
- Willy was Glen's body man.
Put your things in here.
I'll let you spread them out how you like.
Why is this my room?
This was General Whelan's room.
It's got a great bathroom here.
Willy laundered Glen's clothes.
He did Glen's ironing.
Yeah.
Boss?
He polished Glen's shoes.
He always seemed like he was about to collapse from the weight of one too many of Glen's bags.
- Willy!
- Yes, boss?
- Put my stuff in this room.
- Okay.
Here to fight a goddamn war, not watch goddamn television.
Willy was the first person that Glen saw every morning and the last person he saw every night.
Glen loved these men... and they loved him right back.
I don't know how it looks to you, Cory, but it seems to me, everybody's forgotten we're fighting a war here.
We got the goddamn Pizza Kings and Burger Huts.
The entire base is rolling with Eurosexuals who are so drunk they can't even stand up.
General McMahon here to see Ambassador MacKinnon.
- Glen.
- Pat.
Great to see you.
You know Dick Waddle, of course.
- Dick.
- Glen.
Ray Canucci.
- Ray.
- Glen.
Grab a seat, boys.
I'm calling myself Richard now, Pat, if you don't mind.
Okay, fine...
That's fair.
My apologies.
- Have you settled in, Glen?
- No, Pat, I haven't.
Seems to me that too much settling in might somehow be at the heart of the problem we have here.
Small talk.
Should've gone with the weather.
Glen, the president wants you to get the lay of the land here.
This war's been running eight years now.
President Obama, as you know, is drawing down troops in Iraq to refocus our attention on Afghanistan.
Henry Whelan was a good man, he meant well, but he just wasn't getting the job done.
Now, given your reputation and your formidable drive, our hope is that you're the man who will get the job done.
First things first.
We want you to make an assessment of the situation here.
Travel the country, talk to people.
At the end of that assessment, you'll tell us what needs to be done, how you're gonna get it done and what you need in order to get it done.
- So, now...
- To that end...
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, you go.
- I thought you were finished.
- You go.
- You sure?
- You go.
- I thought you were finished.
- No.
To that end... now is probably a good time to share with you where the president hopes that assessment might land.
Obviously, the endgame here is to just finish this thing.
So, how do we do that?
- Is it by reducing our footprint here?
- The civilian executive.
These were guys who, in Glen's eyes, hadn't earned their power the way he had, through hard work and discipline.
I don't know.
But whatever it is, we want you to bring it on home, Glen.
But, whatever you do, please do not ask the president for more troops.
No more troops, Glen.
These were men who'd acquired their power through charm and seduction, and who seemed to serve no purpose other than to stand in the way of his greatness.
God, it's so fucking hot!
Fuck!
Another fucking assessment.
How many assessments do they need?
Just one fucking assessment after another.
They all point the same direction.
Bring General Glen McMahon in here and do whatever the fuck he says!
Settle down, Greg.
They just wanna feel involved, is all.
Wars aren't fought by nations or by armies.
Wars are fought by men.
There are two types of general in the American military.
There are those who believe they can win in the face of all evidence to the contrary.
And there are those who know they can't.
Unfortunately for the world, it's the believers who climb to the top of the ladder.
It's guys like Glen who get given the keys to the castle.
President Karzai is very much looking forward to meeting you.
I think you will like each other.
There is no need to be nervous.
I'm not nervous.
Fuck!
Fuck it.
Ah!
General, excuse me.
We are trying to make this Blu-ray player work.
Do you know how they function?
Normally, you have those wires with the red, the yellow and the white plug.
But this machine seems only to have this wire.
I can't find where to plug it into the television.
I'm sorry, Mr. President.
I'm afraid I don't know a whole lot about technology.
I'm sure I could have somebody come by and take a look at it for you.
Fuck it.
Never mind.
I think I need a new television.
I'm sorry, General.
Please, let's sit.
Welcome.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Please call me Hamid.
Excuse me.
Please.
Your predecessor, General Whelan, I liked him.
I'm not entirely certain he liked me.
He didn't visit very often.
Why was he dismissed?
It seems one minute he was here... the next minute, not here.
Well, Mr. President,
I think our government simply felt it was... time our effort took a new direction.
And what is this new direction?
It is most important to me that we build Afghanistan.
Together, we build Afghanistan into a free and prosperous nation.
Free from fear and conflict.
- I see.
I see.
- Yeah.
Sounds a lot like the old direction.
No.
But perhaps you yourself are the new direction.
New strong personality.
New energy.
New commitment.
Well, General, I wish you the best of luck.
Sir, my team and I are about to embark on a... a tour of the country so that we may make an assessment... to precisely understand what is required of us here.
It would be an honor if you would consider joining me on the tour, so that our project might be a unified endeavor.
A sharing of our purpose...
Of our shared purpose.
Thank you for the invitation, General.
It's very generous.
But...
I've seen the country.
To get inside the mind of Glen McMahon, you really need first to get a handle on the madness of modern American war.
Lieutenant Colonel Frank Groom.
Welcome to Kandahar, sir.
Nice to meet you, Frank.
I'm here to get the lay of the land.
Counterinsurgency.
In the good old days, wars were fought against conventional armies from nation states.
Guys in uniforms, like Nazis and stuff.
When, however, you've just gone and invaded a place that you probably shouldn't have, you end up fighting against just regular people in regular-people clothes.
These guys are what are called insurgents.
Basically, they're just guys who picked up weapons 'cause... so would you, if someone invaded your country.
Funnily enough... insurgencies are next to impossible to defeat.
And so, if you wanna go on pretending you can win, you're really left with no option but to try to convince the country you've invaded that you're actually here to help.
He's saying the Americans are urinating in the streets, and they call us motherfuckers all day.
It's motherfucker motherfucker all the time.
And it's considered in our culture a very bad thing to fuck your own mother.
In ours, too... in ours, too.
This is counterinsurgency.
It's a popularity contest.
Salaam alaikum.
You're trying to convince the people that they're better off with you than they are with the insurgents.
Basically, it works like this.
You install a local government.
You provide security for the people so that that democracy can take root.
We're training them up, taking them out on maneuvers.
You train up the local forces so that they can provide the security for themselves.
I mean, they're sweet kids.
They're good kids.
Good-natured.
Integrational.
You know, they are very integrational as a people.
You know, I mean, they are committed to...
- But...
- Or at least you try to.
I don't know, sir, they're also lazy.
I mean, they really seem like they don't wanna be here.
They steal our shit and basically, they're on drugs all the time.
I mean, they are fucking high all the time.
Excuse my language, sir.
You do whatever you can to stimulate the local economy.
Heroin is the only thing bringing money in.
Not that I like to think where the money is going to exactly, but money keeps the people happy, so we're rolling with that.
Can't they grow something else?
Yeah, they could grow cotton.
Cotton would grow here.
- Why don't they grow cotton then?
- Because the United States Congress will not allow any United States aid and development funds to be directed towards the cultivation of a crop that will end up on the world market in competition with US farmers.
- Which pretty much rules out cotton.
- Sure.
- So we're growing heroin instead.
- Right.
I think we're doing a pretty good job here, sir.
You build infrastructure.
Roads, schools, stuff like that.
What kind of presence does the Taliban have here?
- Who?
- The Taliban.
In short, you get off your bases and you go make friends with the people.
Killing insurgents all the while, of course.
Nation building.
Hearts and minds.
Hello!
Hello, all.
Let me break it down this way, General.
We've been in Helmand province for five years now, and in all that time, all we've really managed to secure is this base.
Now, you go out there, you go into Marjah, you go into Lashkar Gah, it's all Pashtun, as you know.
This is the Taliban.
We're not winning any hearts and minds there, I can tell you that.
I'm not sure we ever will.
Kandahar's the same, of course.
Can I be completely frank with you, sir?
If I was you, I'd cut Helmand loose.
I'd concentrate on those parts of the country that are at least, in some way, sympathetic to the mission, and I'd cut it loose.
It's a lost cause.
This whole province constitutes just 4% of the population of the country.
It's strategically meaningless.
I'd cut Helmand loose, sir.
The thing about counterinsurgency is that it doesn't really work.
We tried it in Vietnam.
That went well.
The British and the French gave it a shot, trying to hang on to their crumbling empires.
It just hasn't worked.
To me, it would seem kind of simple why.
You can't win the trust of a country by invading it.
You can't build a nation at gunpoint.
For guys like Glen however, counterinsurgency hasn't worked for one simple reason.
You ready, boss?
Nobody's ever done it right.
Yes, I am, Pete.
I sure as hell am.
- Andy?
- Yes, sir.
- Good job.
- Thank you.
Let's lose Fox News.
Won't do us any good to have a bunch of angry perverts yelling at us all day.
- Yes, sir.
- So... we probably need to get to work on this assessment.
- Already written it.
- When?
It's already written.
Did it last night.
Needs a little flesh on the bone, but basically it's written.
All right, what's it say?
Greg...
I wanna take Helmand province.
I wanna take Helmand province precisely because everyone else seems to think we can't have it.
If we're gonna win the trust of this country, we can't be seen to accept that there's a whole chunk of it we can't handle.
We're here to provide security.
I say the first order of business is we secure that corner of the country everyone else seems to think we can't control.
Okay.
I didn't come here to manage this war, and I sure as shit didn't come here to close it out.
Came here to win.
I'm taking Helmand then I'm taking Kandahar.
What do you say to that?
All right, and another thing.
Being that this is a nation-building exercise and all, seems to me it'd behoove us to have someone in the room who's actually from the nation we're building.
Don't you think?
Copy.
We are here to build, to protect.
We are not here to harass, to intimidate.
We're not here to shoot first and ask questions later.
We must not be driven by fear and suspicion.
We are here above all else... to support the civilian population.
And to that end, we must avoid killing it at all cost.
Civilian casualties cannot be seen as an unfortunate byproduct of conflict.
They must be treated as errors of the greatest consequence.
This is the war we are fighting.
It's a complex war, but it's a war nonetheless.
Let me reaffirmate that right from the get-go.
This is a war.
But it's a war that cannot be won by the virtues of our unassailable military might and power alone.
This war will be won primarily with the unassailable might and power of our ideals.
Yeah.
Yeah.
- Forty thousand?
- I'm afraid so.
God damn it.
What did we tell you?
No more troops.
Don't ask for more troops.
What do you do?
You ask for 40,000 more troops.
Well, Dick, Helmand province ain't exactly about to secure itself.
Probably should've asked for a lot more.
I just thought 40,000 sounded like a reasonable number.
There's no reasonable number, Glen, except perhaps zero.
That's a reasonable number.
Zero.
I thought you understood that.
Yeah, this "no more troops" thing, is that coming from the president, or coming from you?
Of course it's coming from the president.
Why would it be coming from me?
Why do I care if we send more troops over there or we don't?
I don't know, Dick.
I'm just trying to work this thing out.
The president gave me a job to do.
- This is what I need to get it done.
- God damn it.
I'll be there day after tomorrow with the secretary of state.
We'll figure this nonsense out then.
- Roger that.
- God damn it.
God damn it.
There it is.
What did I tell you?
He's on retired-general time.
His mind's on a golf cart somewhere, halfway down the fairway.
He doesn't have the constitution for the hard stuff anymore.
He's obviously in the wrong fucking job!
That thing's off, right?
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, General, but we're gonna sit on your report until after the Afghan elections.
With all due respect, Madam Secretary, the election is a month away.
I know it is but as I'm sure you know, an election here is a fragile thing.
It's a very delicate thing, and nobody wants its smooth running to be muddied by a big new American offensive.
No, I told you no more troops, Glen.
Now we're gonna have to rethink the game plan.
Well, Dick, with all due respect, you told me you didn't care if I got more troops or I didn't, so I'm trying to work out how to get the job done.
No, I did not say I didn't care.
- I believe you did.
- I did not say that.
- I believe you did.
- No.
No, I didn't.
I...
- You did, Dick.
- Whoever said what, a troop surge and an election don't sit well together, so this is the way it's gotta be.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing in the meantime.
I have a strategy.
I'm ready to execute.
The suggestion now seems to be that I thumb twiddle.
With all due respect, Madam Secretary...
General, please spare me the "all due respect" stuff.
It's really giving me the fucking creeps.
I think, I think we all understand your frustration, Glen, but these elections have to run smoothly.
We need a legitimate partner in power here.
You need a legitimate partner here.
So we just have to sit tight.
Why don't you do that SNORPP thing you did in Iraq?
You know, get your systems in place, get everybody talking together.
The time will fly, you know?
Get everybody excited.
You know, you're the best in the business at this stuff.
We've been operating at an extremely high optempo.
In the last week, we've conducted six air assaults into previously denied territories.
We're also in final coordination with RC South to develop an ops box in the seams existing along the provincial border.
You got that Lexus?
No.
No, now we got a Prius.
She got the new Prius.
Sweet.
Yeah, my wife, too.
She's got one.
We both have one.
We love it.
My first car was a Taurus.
My father bought it.
What do you got?
Sir.
Where you boys headed?
Back to our patrol base, sir.
Sasquatch.
Where you coming from?
Where are we from in the States, or where have we just been?
Where have you just been?
Italy, sir, on RR.
RR in Italy.
- Yes, sir.
- Well...
Attention on deck!
So why the long faces?
You just got back from Italy.
I'm guessing you ate some sensational food, saw some antiquities?
I bet you got yourselves good and drunk and bumped into beautiful girls.
So what's it like out there?
Out where, sir?
- Sasquatch, son.
- Oh... it's not good, sir.
You know, I mean, it's whatever.
- It's... it's okay.
- No, it's a fucking shithole, sir.
No, I don't know.
We'll see where we land.
Cory, what time's that bird due?
- In about 20 minutes.
- Cancel it.
Uh, why's that, boss?
I'm going to Sasquatch with those boys there.
General, those boys are heading out to an inhospitable corner of the world.
I'm a goddamn Ranger, Frank.
Those boys, they need me.
I've spent the last week or so talking to guys who I would call middle management.
But you boys are at the coal face.
After all the blah, blah, blah, you boys are where it actually happens.
I'd go so far as to say you boys are the only thing that counts.
If it doesn't happen here, it doesn't happen.
End of story.
- Yes, son?
- If what doesn't happen, sir?
It, son.
Okay, thank you, sir.
Does anyone here know what "it" is?
Anyone?
Anyone?
To secure the area, sir.
To protect the people from the enemy so they can go about building their lives.
Okay.
Okay, thank you, Sergeant.
Okay, but I can't tell the difference between the people and the enemy.
They all look alike to me.
I'm pretty sure they're the same people, sir.
I understand it can be tough, son, but that's the job.
I have another question.
I hear now they're giving out medals for heroic restraint.
Do I have that right?
Courageous restraint.
And that is right.
Well, I don't mean to be rude, sir, but I do not understand what the fuck that means.
It means, son, that sometimes when you're dealing with an insurgency, you're not gonna be 100% clear on who the enemy is.
It means you're gonna find yourself in situations where, when you're afraid or whatnot, you're gonna have to make a judgment call.
Because, as Sergeant Ortega here has so rightly pointed out, your mission is to protect the people, not kill them.
We can't help them and kill them at the same time.
It just ain't humanly possible.
Do you understand me?
No, not really, sir.
No.
What part are you struggling to comprehend, son?
I don't know, sir.
It seems to me that we all here with our guns and shit, trying to convince these people that deep down we're actually really nice guys.
And I don't know how to do that, sir, when every second one of them or every third one of them or every tenth one of them is trying to fucking kill me, sir.
'Cause I'm a marine. 'Cause we're marines.
And it seem like now they handing out medals for heroically not being a marine, sir.
I'm confused, is what I'm trying to say, sir.
Well, then you're just gonna have to get yourself unconfused, son.
On the day of the Afghan general elections, for which Glen had waited so patiently,
Badi Bassim joined his team.
Cory wouldn't tell me where he found Glen his Afghan mascot.
No, I'm doing your job!
He said he just found him in the phone book.
Put the bag down.
I assume that was a joke.
My name is Captain Badi Bassim.
I'm here to start work with General McMahon.
- Who?
- McMahon.
- McMahon?
- Yeah.
- Why are you not wearing the uniform?
- My uniform is in my bag.
It's too dangerous for me to wear it while I am walking here from my home.
Unzip it.
Unzip the bag.
My uniform.
- Why are you walking in here?
- Why I am working here?
Walking!
Walking!
Walking here?
Walking.
I like to walk.
Badi!
Come in.
Come in.
Everyone, this is my new aide-de-camp, Badi Bassim.
He's a soldier and a scholar.
This is the face of the new Afghanistan.
Greg, you know.
That's Cory.
You know Cory.
Pete Duckman.
And... we got people here from Spain and Italy and...
- You know, places like that.
- Okay.
- Have you voted?
- I wanted to report to you first.
- You haven't voted?
- No.
Good.
Good.
You can do it right here.
We got a polling booth right here, right around the corner.
Okay.
- Election day.
It's exciting.
- Yeah.
This is important, Badi.
That long line of men, that slow shuffle there, that's the slow shuffle towards freedom.
The steps are small but, by God, their importance...
It's like the moon landing.
Small step, giant leap.
Yeah.
Are you familiar with the moon landing, son?
- Yes, sir.
- It's like the goddamn moon landing.
Yes, sir, I agree.
It's very important.
- Yes, it is.
- Yeah.
- A what?
- We're gonna have another election.
We can't ignore these fraud allegations.
They're coming in from every corner of the country and everything points to a ridiculous Karzai victory.
I mean, the whole thing just smells stupid.
Sure.
Sure, there's gonna be irregularity now and again.
But surely a result is the best possible outcome.
Yeah?
The polling station, the one right there over where you are... 367 registered voters, 1,200 votes counted.
It's a joke.
We're going to a runoff election.
Tell them what you told me!
- About what, sir?
- About the elections.
About the whole concept of elections in this country.
Well, I was just observing, sir, that people don't quite understand elections.
They see that the president is alive, everything is okay.
So what's the big problem?
Why are we having an election?
Yeah.
And then you have an election anyway, and people vote for whoever the local leaders tell them to vote for.
Yeah.
Because they don't want to have their heads chopped off.
See what I mean?
Thank you for that...
I'm sorry, Glen.
We're going to a runoff election.
Jesus H...
I got the White House sitting on my report till after these elections get done.
I can't do anything until the president approves my recommendations.
And now you're telling me that's not gonna be until after another goddamn election?
!
You need a legitimate partner here, Glen.
Karzai ain't that guy.
You gotta understand, what we're trying to do here is like raising a child.
And a child needs two parents.
Two parents who love it and each other very much.
That's what it needs, above all else.
Well, then your wife, Mrs. Karzai...
I'm assuming that you're the daddy in this metaphorical relationship...
We suspect your wife Karzai might be a drug addict.
He eliminated his chief opponent in this election by spreading a pretty vicious homosexual rumor, and we're pretty sure that his brother is a straight-up criminal warlord.
Oh, come on, Pat!
You got a bee in your bonnet.
You just don't like him for some reason, whatever it is.
And seriously...
Anyway, I wanna know, how is Washington any different, huh?
Seriously!
Tell me!
Yeah.
You can't.
On page 74 of One Leg at a Time, Just Like Everybody Else,
Glen wrote, and I quote.
A good leader lives by a set of rules.
A great leader knows when to break them.
Morning.
- Morning, all.
- Sir.
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.
Morning, boys.
- Morning, sir.
- Boss.
Morning, Matt.
You're up early.
Yes, sir.
We've got a problem.
Somebody leaked your report.
The Washington Post has a copy.
No.
- Somebody gave it to Bob Woodward.
- Woodward?
No.
Oh, my God almighty.
You find the source?
Sir, the source?
This is terrible.
Goddamn terrible news.
Do you hear that?
Someone leaked the assessment.
- Oh, terrible.
- Terrible.
Shocking.
- Shocking.
- Shocking.
- Terrible.
- Shocking.
Yeah, well...
I don't think it really matters who leaked the assessment.
Question is, what are we gonna do about it?
I wanna do the 60 Minutes interview.
Sir, as your senior PAO, I must counsel strongly against it.
It would be foolhardy.
I really don't think now's the time to court media attention.
At the very moment, allegations are being made
- that you leaked this report yourself.
- I'm choosing to embrace the leak, Simon.
I don't seem to be getting any traction.
Do you know what I'm saying?
Traction?
We got ourselves a president who appears not to be aware of the fact that the United States is at war right now, and he's that war's commander in chief.
- I gotta get me some traction.
- You need cut through.
Exactly.
Cut through.
You need to get me some goddamn cut through.
I can handle that for you, sir.
Sorry.
No offense, Simon, how exactly are you gonna do that?
I'll quieten this whole situation down.
Again, I'm sorry, I don't wanna start a fight here.
And please forgive me for speaking for you, sir.
But the general didn't hire me to make things quiet, okay?
Look, you're so good at your job, but that job is basically writing press releases.
Here's the thing about press releases.
Nobody reads 'em, okay?
They're boring.
And they're bullshit.
And everyone knows they're bullshit.
Correct me if I'm wrong, you hired me to make some noise.
You know, the right kind of noise.
Our noise.
Pete.
- Boss.
- Move those vehicles to the right.
I wanna make sure the M-ATVs are clearly visible in the background.
Copy that.
They're...
They're completely blocking them.
- This one?
- Both of them.
Just get 'em out of there.
Get 'em out of there!
Hey.
How're we doing over here?
Good?
- Great.
- You good?
Good.
Okay.
- Yeah, I think we're getting close.
- Oh, that's exciting.
I don't wanna interrupt.
I mean, I know you have your own world of questions to ask in there.
You might wanna think about asking the general... how much face time he's had with the president since taking over the position.
Okay.
Yeah.
You know, if you run out of stuff to talk about or whatever.
You're welcome.
Yes, the leak was unfortunate.
There's no denying it.
It's unfortunate.
One would always choose to mull these things over in the sensible calm of the proper quiet places.
But this war is tough.
War is tough.
And the president has tough decisions to make.
How many times have you spoken to the president since you've been here?
Since I've been here in Afghanistan, leading ISAF?
Yes.
Once.
I've spoken to the president once.
By video teleconference.
You've spoken to the president once in, what, 70 days?
That's right.
You're the leader of US forces in Afghanistan, and you have spoken to the president once in 70 days?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Why is that?
I don't know...
I'm guessing he's very busy.
Probably.
What the fuck's the matter with you, Glen?
Are you out of your mind?
One second we're dealing with this so-called fucking leak, the next you're on the fucking television backing the president into the most ham-fisted corner I've ever seen.
I honestly believe you've made it your sole mission to fuck me.
Well, Dick, I answered the questions that were asked of me.
- I thought I was being fair.
- It's not a question of fair, Glen.
It's a question of what the fuck were you doing on the television?
Why am I seeing you on the television?
Now we gotta fix this.
We gotta find a way of taking the heat out of this thing.
Now you've gone and lit a fucking fire under it!
Do you understand?
- Yeah, I see.
- Here's where we're gonna start.
You're gonna get on the phone to Bob Gates and...
Hang on, Dick.
You're cutting out.
I can't hear you.
Can you hear me?
Yeah, I can hear you.
And please stop calling me Dick!
Shit.
Something's wrong.
I can't hear a word you're saying.
Let me...
let me try this.
- Can you hear me now?
- Yeah, I can hear you.
Okay, something's wrong here.
Hold on a minute, Dick.
- Oh, God.
- Andy, get your ass in here!
- Yes, sir.
- Got a problem.
I can't hear a word Dick's saying.
He can hear me, but I can't hear him.
- All right, can you hear us now?
- Yeah, I can hear you.
- What about now, Mr. Dick, sir?
- Yeah, I can hear you!
I'm...
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, Dick.
- Oh, gosh!
Can't hear a word you're saying.
Andy's gonna have to work on this, and pronto!
- Yes, sir.
- This is goddamn unacceptable.
No, no, we need to talk.
I'll talk to you later, Dick.
We need to finish...
We need to finish this thing.
Well done.
- Thank you, sir.
- Well done.
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.
Thank you.
I wanna speak to you tonight about our effort in Afghanistan.
It's an extraordinary honor for me to do so here at West Point, where so many men and women have prepared to stand up for our security and to represent what is finest about our country.
As your commander in chief,
I owe you a mission that is clearly defined...
- Yes, you do.
- And worthy of your service.
And that's why I insisted on a thorough review of our strategy.
And as commander in chief, I have determined that it is in our vital national interest... to send an additional 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan.
After 18 months, our troops will begin to come home.
I do not make this decision lightly.
We have been at war now for eight years, at enormous cost in lives and resources.
Years of debate over Iraq and terrorism have left our unity on national security issues in tatters.
And having just experienced the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the American people are understandably focused on rebuilding our economy and putting people to work here at home.
Sir.
You got your troops.
Buddy here just announced to the whole of Afghanistan that we are about to abandon it!
That's like telling the bad guys all they gotta do is wait out the next 18 months and then we'll be gone!
And so he just told an auditorium full of young American soldiers the war they've been asked to fight these last eight years has been nothing more than one great monumental waste of everybody's time.
That was a clusterfuckingly stupid fucking speech!
Thank you, Greg.
Well, you heard him.
He's not giving us the full 40,000.
They're giving us 30.
I just got off the phone with the SecDef.
We gotta get the rest from our coalition partners.
Looks like we're going to Europe, boys.
So pack your...
Oh, I don't know, fuck it!
Pack whatever it is they wear in Europe.
Speedos and shit!
Willy.
The world stage.
It's always seemed funny to me how a man can go from looking at a map of,
I don't know, say Helmand province, to finding himself in Europe trying to persuade our friends and allies that his crazy dream is their crazy dream too.
Bonjour, General.
Thank you.
- Bonjour, monsieur.
- Hello.
Okay, so tomorrow afternoon, you have the presentation to I'École Militaire.
Tomorrow night, dinner with the minister of defense.
That is a gala dinner, by the way.
Just a heads-up so you can prepare yourself mentally.
It's a big one.
Meetings the next day.
Then we got the night free.
- And then to Berlin.
- Yeah.
Here we go.
Obama is in Copenhagen tonight.
They wanna know if you can spare time for a meeting on Air Force One tomorrow morning.
The president wants some face time.
Now he wants fucking face time.
Fucking dick.
So can you do that, boss?
Then we can jet across to Copenhagen at zero six.
The president's gonna be on the tarmac at 8:30.
Well, you're the keeper of my schedule, Cory.
You tell me if I can do it.
Okay, yeah, we can have you back in Paris early afternoon, depending on how much time you two need.
And I can shift your morning meetings.
See that out there?
I'm calling that dusk.
That's close of fucking business.
Boss, you good with this?
Sure, Pete.
We're not in theater.
You boys earned it.
Sir, have you had a chance to say hello to your wife yet?
You know, she checked in this morning.
I think she's waiting for you in your room.
Shit.
Right, I should do that.
What room am I in again?
- 517.
- What?
- Five-seven-one.
- Five-one-seven.
- Stop.
Go.
- Five-one-seven.
Five-one-seven.
- Hi, boss.
- Hey, Willy.
- Hi.
Hi, honey.
- Hi.
Hi.
I'm sorry, I've been delayed.
The president is wanting time with me tomorrow, and we've been trying to ascertain whether... whether or not we can accommodate this request.
I'm gonna leave you two be.
I'll be...
- I'll be right next door.
- Okay, thank you, Willy.
Well, we're in Paris.
Yeah.
Hopefully we'll get to see some sights.
Yeah, I'll have Cory schedule some time.
- Yeah.
- Okay... but you do what you gotta do, because I am here for you.
Oh, yeah?
- How's Tim?
- Oh, he's good.
He's good.
- He sends his love.
- Okay.
He's got a new girlfriend now.
Yeah, I like her.
Yeah, her daddy's an ILE instructor over at Leavenworth.
Yeah, she's sweet.
You'll like her.
Well...
Well, I think it's just great you're getting to see the president, honey.
You must be very excited, huh?
Hey, Glen.
Hope you don't mind me hitching a ride.
I'm on my own dash to see the president.
They told me you were heading over there this morning.
No problem, Pat.
My plane is your plane.
- Knock yourself out.
- Thanks, Glen.
So my hope is, depending on how long your meeting goes with the president, we can have you back in Paris NLT 1400, then straight to the École Militaire for 1500.
My uniform will be crushed after these flights.
I'll need a shower, a fresh shave.
I'm allowing for four solid hours with the president.
If it's less than that, we should be fine to go via the hotel.
I am just contingency planning for the possibility we may be running tight on time.
- Can we move the École Militaire back?
- Not really.
Gonna be a lot of people there.
We have the gala dinner right after.
We don't have any wiggle room here.
You should wear the fatigues to the thing this afternoon.
The general, direct from the battlefield.
No need to shower when you're straight from the fight.
- That's good.
- Yeah.
- It's very good.
- I like that.
Well, just make sure Willy has my fatigues on standby.
Talking points for the president.
How you doing, Glen?
This one is a bitch, right?
Nothing about war is easy, Pat.
Right on.
Though I'm guessing, somewhere deep down, you were happier in Iraq.
A soldier leading soldiers.
Soldiers above you, soldiers below you.
Just a nice bubble of soldiers.
Just ordered.
Right?
'Cause it has to be.
War is chaos, so then the army has to be the opposite of chaos.
But now you find yourself in the real world.
Now you're dealing with civilians, and civilians don't make sense.
Not making sense is a luxury I can't afford.
Lives depend on it.
- No, of course.
- Yeah.
Absolutely.
And you can't live in the bubble forever.
You gotta rise as your talents dictate.
What do you want, Pat?
How do you think this ends?
Simple.
We either win it or we lose it.
Yeah, I don't know.
I think I'm gonna call bullshit on that, Glen.
All the winning we were ever gonna do, we did in the first six months.
And since then, we've just been making a mess.
And that's all it was ever gonna be.
You're not here to win.
You're here to clean up the mess.
You'll get your 40,000 troops.
Get 'em in there.
Get your PowerPoint presentation in order, you know?
Just move the needle a little bit.
Show everyone how all the graphs are pointing in the right direction.
That's all you gotta do.
That's how this ends best for you anyway.
A nice-looking set of graphs.
Or a nicer-looking set of graphs than the last set of graphs.
Either that or get yourself fired.
Then you can say "I told you so" when it all turns to shit or fizzles out or however it is this thing ends.
There's no street parade at the end of this one.
It's good to talk.
Everybody.
How are you?
Morning.
Yeah, it's good to see you again.
- How you doing?
Good to see you.
Nice tie.
- Thank you.
All right.
How's it going?
- Morning, sir.
Nice to see you again.
- All right.
Take care now.
It's good to see you, Mr. President.
All right, see you soon.
- Mr. President.
- It's great to see you, General.
I'm sorry, but we're running behind schedule.
I was looking forward to getting some face time with you, but I gotta get this baby in the air.
So all right.
Smile for the cameras, Glen.
All right.
Take care.
- Pat.
- Mr. President.
- Let's get going.
- Yes, sir.
All right, Magnus, talk to you soon.
Okay?
You could argue that the main reason certain generals like war so much is... well, because it's only in war that they feel truly relevant.
It's only in war that they feel close to the center of power.
Only in war do they feel the warm glow of other people's attention.
Good evening, sir.
The attention of people like me.
Okay, you know what?
You both look beautiful.
Really.
Sir, before you get dragged into the hubbub there,
I want to introduce you to Sean Cullen here.
Sean's the writer from Rolling Stone.
He's been doing that profile piece on you.
He's gonna be tagging along for a couple days.
Thanks for having me, sir.
It's a real privilege.
- Rolling Stone?
- Yes, sir.
Just make sure I'm on the cover.
Well, it's between you and Lady Gaga, sir.
Well, put me in a heart-shaped bathtub with her.
Rose petals.
Happy to share.
Glen, stop joking.
I'm deadly serious, son.
Put me on the cover.
Okay, here we are.
There's the boss.
There's Mrs. Boss.
Oh, there's me.
There's you.
Where's me?
I guess you're on a different table.
Better keep looking.
You serious?
- Sorry.
- Yes?
Excuse me.
I think you are sitting in my seat, sir.
Oh, hey, there.
I'm sorry.
Pleased to meet you.
Dear.
Thank you.
Hi.
General.
Tom Howard, sir.
I'm the United States defense attaché here in Paris.
Pleased to meet you.
This is my wife, Jeanie.
Pleased to meet you, Jeanie.
Are you enjoying your time here in Paris?
Oh, yes, very much.
It's lovely.
Isn't it?
Have you managed to see any museums or exhibitions?
Have you done the Louvre?
I think we're gonna be too busy to see the Louvre.
But I've been wandering around by myself while Glen's at meetings, and... oh, my, it's... it's lovely.
General, I thought it went very well at the École Militaire today.
I didn't get the opportunity to introduce myself there.
But there were some very interesting people there today.
If you'd like, I'd be very happy to give you a rundown of the who's who if you get a little window in your schedule while...
I appreciate that.
My schedule's very tight.
Of course.
Totally understood.
General, I could introduce you to some people here tonight if you'd prefer.
No, I think my team and I have a grip on the who's who.
Thank you.
Cory, where's Badi?
I don't know, boss.
He was here a minute ago.
I thought he was supposed to be sitting beside you and Jeanie.
General, I thought it best if you and I took this opportunity to talk, so... so I switched places with your colleague over there, I...
Like you said, your schedule's very tight.
What'd you say your name was?
Tom Howard, sir.
What do you think this dinner is for, Tom Howard?
General, this dinner is to honor you, sir.
Wrong.
This dinner is for Afghanistan.
We are here tonight because we're at war in Afghanistan.
And you got the goddamn gall to kick the only Afghan in the room
- off my goddamn table?
- I'm sorry...
Let me tell you what I want you to do, Tom Howard.
I want you to go sit your ass down wherever the fuck your ass was officially designated to sit, and I want you to tell Badi to bring his ass back over here!
How's that sound, Tom Howard?
I'm sorry, sir.
Ma'am.
I apologize for my language.
- Everything's okay, honey.
- Boss?
I'm pretty sure the Afghan ambassador here is from Afghanistan.
General.
Sir.
Swell.
I don't want for this dinner to be awkward for you, General, so I will tell you now that we intend to give you our portion of the troops that you request.
I don't think the Germans will be so easy.
I think that they are feeling inclined to withdraw altogether.
And I should add that
I would hate for you to think that France is easy.
This must be a final moment, no?
We cannot stay in Afghanistan forever.
No, we can't.
That's why I'm gonna win it.
Thank you.
That was strange.
Writing a biography, is that something you might be open to?
Or...
For sure, yeah.
Something I'm absolutely open to...
It's such a fascinating subject matter.
No offense, book could kinda write itself.
We may have a problem getting to Berlin tomorrow.
This volcano in Iceland.
It's... canceling all flights because of the ash cloud.
- Dude, we got our own plane.
- Guess this cloud's huge.
Nothing's taking off in Europe.
They're grounding all air traffic.
We got tonight free, right?
Then what's the plan?
We're drinking.
Tell me we're fucking drinking.
Today is Jeanie and my's 30th wedding anniversary, so...
I'm taking her to dinner.
Just the two of you?
Yes.
It doesn't matter, honey.
I've had fun.
Good.
Good.
We'll come back again when everything's normal and we can do it together.
Sure.
We're together.
Yeah.
This is so special.
You know, the other day I was calculating the...
I was working out that we've spent less than 30 days a year together for the last eight years.
And...
I was just thinking that it's really interesting, the way things happen.
Well, if we hadn't gone to war... if September 11th hadn't happened... if America hadn't been attacked and we hadn't gone to war,
I'd probably be barbecuing something in our backyard right now.
But 9/11 did happen, didn't it?
Yes.
Yes, I know.
I know.
I know, and I am...
I'm sorry.
- I didn't say that to make you feel bad.
- Why are you thinking about it?
No, I'm not...
I'm not...
I'm not thinking about it, I promise.
Yes, you are.
You're calculating days.
You just told me, one day you sat yourself down with a calendar and you calculated days.
Yes, I know.
I know.
But I just did that because...
I did it because I was proud of you, honey.
I'm proud of me too.
You know?
Yeah, I'm proud of me too.
Do you know?
Oh, honey.
No, honey, look at me.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I know.
Yes, every... everything...
Everything's okay.
Yeah.
Obama's not a leader.
He's an orator.
He hammered the whole world on.
Yes, we can.
Yes, we can.
Really, it's no, we can't.
Yeah.
We can't do Iraq.
He's loud and clear now that we can't do Afghanistan.
We can't do Gitmo.
Where the fuck else we gonna put all these motherfuckers?
That's a great orator.
Right there.
He's sold us on, like a double negative.
Yes, we can not do things.
You know?
Or is that a double negative?
Not really, but I know what you mean.
Yo, look who it is!
Hey.
- Hi.
- Hello, Mrs. Boss.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Boss and Mrs. Boss, down there.
- You, drink!
- No, no.
- You, drink!
- Down the hatch.
Sir, I just want to say again what a privilege this is.
You must be really proud.
- You must be really proud of him.
- Oh, yes, I am.
- Ah, here we go!
Here we go!
- Oh, yeah!
Go, Pete!
Come on!
I got your name all over this.
I always loved this asshole!
- We're not flying to Berlin tomorrow.
- What?
- Not flying to Berlin tomorrow.
- What?
They won't give us clearance to fly to Berlin tomorrow.
USA!
Everybody now!
USA!
USA!
This is bullshit.
It's like one phone call.
Hello, they won't let us take off.
Can you fix it?
Oh, no, monsieur.
Big volcano.
No take off.
Well, this is General Glen McMahon we're talking about here.
Oh, General Glen McMahon.
Oh, I did not know.
Why didn't you say that?
Pardon, monsieur, of course you may take off.
- Done!
How hard is that?
- I've made the calls.
Believe me.
Listen, we are the fucking US military.
We practically invented everything!
And now we have some chinless fuck in Brussels who's telling us we can't fly our own plane because of a volcano in Greenland.
What are we supposed to do?
Sit around here in Paris and wait for it to "stop erupting"?
I don't know, Greg.
This isn't exactly a situation that I've been in before.
Okay, bear with me on this one.
I think I might have just solved our problem.
I really can't tell you why these guys got so loose in front of me.
Or why Glen let them get so loose.
I can only put it down to hubris.
These guys thought they were the most important guys in the world... with the most important jobs in the world.
Maybe they assumed I thought they were as amazing as they did.
What are you writing?
What are you writing?
You're always writing.
I don't like it.
Maybe they thought they could do whatever they wanted.
I'm a writer.
I write.
I better like what it is you're writing.
Let's say you have ten insurgents.
Now, let's say you kill two of 'em.
Now, how many insurgents do you have left?
Well, you'd say eight, of course.
Eight.
Right?
Right?
Wrong!
In this scenario, ten minus two equals 20.
Let's say the two insurgents you just killed... each had six friends or brothers or some such, who are hovering on the brink of joining the insurgency.
They're thinking about this insurgency thing.
Looks interesting.
But, you know, for one reason or other, not for me.
But...
So, then you go and kill their friend.
Now you've just made up their minds for 'em.
Those hovering friends are now full, paid-up members of the enemy.
Yeah.
And so, in the math of counterinsurgency, ten minus two... equals 20.
Yes, ma'am?
General, the US invaded Afghanistan because of the al-Qaeda attacks on September 11th.
- This is correct, yes?
- Yeah.
You have been speaking to us now for 45 minutes...
Oh, where's the...
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
You have been speaking to us now for 45 minutes, and yet in all of that time you have only mentioned al-Qaeda once.
Your own vice president has advocated a much smaller and simpler counterterrorism approach to incapacitate what is estimated to be little more than 100 al-Qaeda fighters that still remain in Afghanistan to refocus on what it was that started this war in the first place.
Your analysis of the insurgency there suggests to me there is no monolithic Taliban.
You are spread over the entire country.
You are fighting 1,000 separate battles with locals whose principal ideological position would seem to be simply that they don't want foreign soldiers in their village.
And that, General, you must know, is a war you will never win.
with all due respect, ma'am...
I must beg to differ.
I firmly believe, having traveled to all corners of the country, having spoken with many people from many walks of life... that what these people want is the very same thing that you and I want.
Freedom, security, stability, jobs.
Progress is being made.
Real progress.
But challenges do remain.
Yes, I understand all of that, General.
And... and, please, let me say quite sincerely that I do not question the goodness of your intent.
I have been listening to you here this morning, and...
I believe you are a good man.
I do.
What I question is... your belief in your power to deliver these things that you describe.
I question your belief in the power of your ideals.
Ah, well...
I think what I am trying to say, and I apologize, General, if this is sounding impolite, but I question your sense of self.
No, no, no, that's all... all right.
I appreciate your commentary.
I do...
But I have a job to do.
Yes, I understand.
And I also have a job to do.
And I am trying to do mine.
As an elected representative of the people of Germany, it is my job to ensure that the personal ambitions of those who serve those people are kept in check.
You have devoted your entire life, General, to the fighting of war.
And this situation in Afghanistan, for you, it is the culmination of all your years of training, all your years of ambition.
- This is the great moment of your life.
- Well...
It's understandable to me that you should have, therefore, a fetish for completion to make your moment glorious.
It is my job, however, to ensure that your personal ambitions are not entirely delusional and do not carry with them an unacceptable cost for everybody else.
- Honey, you okay?
- I'm fine.
Please don't shut down.
It's our last day together.
Be here with me.
One second.
Thank you.
So, just got an email from Gates.
Good news and bad news.
Spoke with the German defense minister.
We're getting our troops.
Turns out that crazy bitch lady back there was just some sad, lonely voice in the wilderness.
Bad news is, they won't let their guys leave the base.
Whatever that means.
But, hey, they're ponying up.
So I guess job here is done.
Boss?
I used to think that men went gray because they had stressful jobs with stressful decisions to make.
Now, I think it happens when men start to feel in their bones that the great moments of their lives... might not turn out to be quite as great as they'd always hoped.
When the real world starts creeping in.
What separates the believers like Glen from everybody else is... their ability to block this real world out.
Some people call this insanity.
Welcome to Operation Moshtarak.
We're taking the Helmand province, gentlemen, once and for all.
Moshtarak will be the largest operation yet to be conducted since this war began.
So, needless to say, it is an important one.
This whole province has been a thorn in our ass since day one.
So this here will be a definitive test in our resolve.
And that starts right here in Marjah.
If we infill teams here and here tonight, we can set up our blocking positions, hopefully draw enough wiggle room for the marines tomorrow.
- Good.
- The forecast says tonight's the night.
If we don't go in tonight, likely have to wait maybe another week.
I want Karzai to sign off on this.
Cory, can you get him on the phone?
Copy.
And why these spots?
ISR is telling us these locations are where there still appears to be a concentration of movement.
Obviously, we're proceeding under the assumption that anyone who isn't a bad guy has moved on or at least hunkered down.
We've made it clear to the whole city that's the thing to do.
If I could just ask a question, General.
Shoot!
I know this is Marjah, but I'm still not quite clear as to why you're sending boys to Nawzad and Musa Qala.
I mean, there's nothing out there.
I'm just not quite clear what it is you're trying to control there.
Apart from nothing.
You see this map, Frank?
This one, hmm?
This here is the mess I'm having to clean up.
Now, we've been kind enough to plan this operation in such a way as to not make it look like the Americans are here to get done what you couldn't.
But that is what's happening.
So, Frank... while your input is greatly appreciated...
It is.
I wouldn't want you to think that it isn't.
It is.
I'd also appreciate if you would take one nice, big step back and let me get this shit done.
Yeah.
Yeah?
- What?
- I can't get him.
They're telling me he's in bed with a cold.
Well, did you tell 'em what it's about?
I didn't tell 'em exactly what it was about.
- I said it was very important.
- Jesus H. Christ.
- Just dial the number again.
I'll talk.
- Right.
Copy.
Thanks, Bernie.
Let's assume this is happening.
I'll give you the green light soon as I get it.
- Yes, sir.
- I have General McMahon on the line.
Hello, who am I speaking with?
This is General McMahon.
I need to speak to President Karzai urgently.
I understand he's not feeling well, but I need to speak with him.
Is he awake?
Good.
Put him on.
Put the call through.
What do you mean, he doesn't have one?
What world leader doesn't have a phone in his bedroom?
Does he have a cell phone in there?
- Did you try his cell phone?
- Straight to voice mail.
What?
Well, tell him to turn it back on.
Please!
Please!
This is...
I can't...
Oh, fuck it!
I'm coming over there.
This is me doing that right now.
I'm making the appointment right now.
Yes?
- Oh, General, please come in.
- Mr. President.
Please sit here.
Please, please sit.
Sit.
- How are you?
- I'm fine, sir.
I've been trying to contact you.
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.
I'm not feeling well.
I understand, sir.
But did they not tell you this is urgent?
Oh, you know how everything is at the top of the mountain, General.
Everybody's urgent about everything all the time.
Everything is important.
Nothing ever really is.
There's nothing that cannot wait until morning.
This is important, sir.
We hope to launch Operation Moshtarak tonight, and I need your official consent before doing so.
- Really?
- Yes, sir.
- Why?
- Because it's your mission.
- It is?
- Yes, sir.
No one has ever asked me to approve a mission before.
Well, that needs to change.
This mission needs your consent.
If we're to win the trust of Helmand province, it demands that this mission be seen to be of your design.
I...
I don't mean to be rude, Mr. President, but it is imperative that you begin to take a leadership role here.
We cannot win this thing alone.
Without your active involvement, our presence here will never be anything more than a foreign occupation.
This is your war.
For your country.
Your people.
Again, I'm sorry, sir... but you need to behave like a leader.
But I am behaving like a leader.
I'm unavailable.
I am as unavailable to you as is your own president.
You have my approval, General.
We both know it was never really mine to give.
But...
I thank you for inviting me to participate in the theater of it all.
And good luck.
I wish you much success.
Good luck tonight, Glen.
Who told you about tonight?
I just mean... whatever you happen to find yourself doing tonight, good luck with it.
Go fuck yourself, Pat.
Glen?
Glen.
What?
Look, I just want to apologize.
You know how the other day
I said there wasn't a parade at the end of all this?
I was wrong.
It was glib.
I just thought it was a pithy way to end the conversation, but I was wrong.
There's gonna be thousands of parades.
Thousands of 'em all over America.
Only none of them will be for you.
Now that was pithy too, but it was true.
Fuck you!
Roger that.
What was that about, buddy?
Nothing.
Let's get to Kandahar.
We got some fucking winning to do.
Okay, listen up.
This is going to be tough.
I'm not gonna mince words about that.
This will be tough.
This will probably be the toughest mission that any of you all will experience.
This is the real deal.
Marjah is Taliban ground zero.
This is gonna be IEDs everywhere.
This is gonna be their best guys.
And they are gonna be prepared.
They know we're coming, gentlemen.
They've known we're coming for weeks.
So don't be under any illusion.
This will get ugly.
We're gonna lose guys.
I am not gonna lie to you about that.
There will be casualties.
But if you keep your wits about you, if you have faith in your ability, if you have faith in the ability of the men next to you, you will come out the tail end of this!
I have faith in you!
I know who you are!
You are proud members of the toughest fucking fighting force this world has ever known.
Carry that knowledge with you!
Carry it with pride!
Do you understand me?
Do you understand me?
That's right.
Any of you so inclined, I'm gonna ask this chaplain to say a prayer for us.
Thank you, Captain.
Let us pray!
Almighty God, as these marines prepare for battle, we pray that your Holy Spirit shall guide them.
As you brought down the walls of Jericho, as you dealt out your wrath upon the Philistines, as you crushed the Hittites and brought retribution upon all the enemies of the righteous, may your mighty hand be upon these men and assure their victories.
Be with them, mighty God...
Let's move.
What are you thinking about, buddy?
Well, let's just see how this plays out.
The uncrackable nut.
If anyone's gonna crack this, it's gonna be you.
You're gonna smash this like a monkey on a rock.
Yeah.
You're a killing machine, Glen.
You are the terrorist hunter.
Remember?
You're Big Glen.
You're the Glenimal.
Thank you, General.
I'm hungry.
I wanna eat that motherfucker.
Jesus Christ, man.
Farrenberg.
Move.
Contact front!
Move!
Move!
Up against the wall!
- Farrenberg.
- Not too close.
Get off the walls.
Now!
- Fuck!
- Over there, twelve o'clock!
Cole!
Cole!
I need to see a weapon.
He isn't a combatant until I see a weapon.
Fuck, man!
You think this nigga on his morning jog?
All right.
All right.
We're gonna head to that house over there at two o'clock.
All right?
We're gonna work this shit out.
Cutter, I need you, Song, Carroll and Trey, head over there and get us in, all right?
We're gonna move up to cover you.
I need ANA guys going in first.
Trey!
You take those first two guys with you.
Copy?
You two, up!
Up!
Get the fuck up!
Move in.
Come on!
Let's go!
Clear.
Put that gun up, now.
We're getting ready to move now.
Come on!
Come on.
Fucking move!
Come on!
Zah, zah, zah, you fuck!
Oh, you fat piece of shit!
Fucking move!
Move!
Move!
To the right!
- Clear!
- All right!
All clear!
Okay.
Farrenberg, let's go!
Move.
Go in.
All right.
Listen up.
We're gonna get on the roof of this place, figure out what we're looking at.
Cutter, Cole, you're coming with me.
The rest of you guys stay put.
Copy?
Copy.
Comin' up!
We got movement, twelve o'clock.
About 300 meters, two guys on the roof.
- Are they armed?
- I don't know.
It's a simple fucking question, Trey.
Do you see a weapon?
No.
That's not what you asked.
You asked if they were armed.
The answer to that one is, I don't fucking know.
Obviously they're armed, Ortega.
Why else would they be running around up there?
I don't fucking know, do I?
I don't understand these fucking people.
All I know is we need to see weapons.
- Are you hit?
Are you hit?
- Fuck!
- I'm fucking hit!
- Where are you hit?
On my fucking eyes.
- Can you open 'em?
- What the fuck is going on?
Is he hit?
We're good.
We're good.
Trey's just got shit in his eyes.
Hey, yo, guys!
- Cutter, get the fuck over here!
- Fuck!
It's just water.
It's just water.
Give us...
Give me the 203.
Give me the 203.
- Trey, stay still!
- Give me your fucking gun!
Ortega!
What's going on up there?
What the fuck's going on up there, guys?
Cover!
Fuck.
Fucking short, man!
Fuck.
- Again!
- Zah!
- Short!
- I know.
One more!
Fuck, yeah!
Good job, Cole.
Nice shooting, boys.
- Farrenberg, you hit?
- Nah.
- Are you hit?
- No.
I'm good.
Fuck.
- Fuck this shit!
- Cole, where the fuck are you going?
- Dude, where the fuck are you going?
- Fuck off!
- Corporal, what's happening?
- Wait, where the fuck are you going, man?
- Shut the fuck up!
- Wait, Cole!
Cole!
- Cole!
Get back here, Cole!
- Cole!
Cole, what the fuck, man?
Where you going?
Where the fuck are you going, man?
- Fuck, Cole!
- Come back, Cole!
Cole!
They're crawling.
They're in the middle of an IED belt.
And first and second platoons, they're pinned down, and second is close to requesting QRF.
Tell me something good, Cory.
I'm trying.
This info ain't meeting me halfway.
I wanna hear something good, God damn it.
I don't want the word "clusterfuck" featuring anywhere in tomorrow's news.
Don't worry about the headlines, buddy.
We got civilian casualties.
We got civilian casualties southeast corner of town, third platoon.
It's those boys from Sasquatch.
Cutter, find out who these fucking guys are.
If they're gonna stand there, I wanna know who they are.
How?
Get one of the ANA to talk to 'em.
Them motherfuckers speak Pashto.
The ANA don't speak Pashto.
I don't know.
Figure it out.
The fuck...
Cutter's fucking shit up outside.
- All right.
What's the deal here?
- He's saying he didn't know the bad guys.
They just commandeered his house, and there was nothing he could do about it.
Well, that's fucking bullshit.
We did leaflet drops and shit.
He shouldn't still be here.
Why are you still here?
What's your reason for being here?
He says that he has nowhere to go.
He has no wife.
He is worried about leaving his goats.
He says that he's telling the truth.
You can search his house.
You will find no weapons.
Wait.
Farrenberg?
Farrenberg!
- Yeah, I'm here!
- Come here!
We're gonna give this guy some money, all right?
- You fucking serious?
- Yeah, I am serious.
Give me the fucking...
Open the fucking bag.
- What are those, 2.5?
- Yeah.
Okay, give me one of those.
My name is General Glen McMahon.
On behalf of the coalition forces,
I wanna apologize to you for the loss you've suffered here today.
I know the money that Sergeant Ortega gave you can't bring back your family.
But hopefully it can help you to rebuild, because rebuilding is what we're all about.
And providing you with the security you need to live a long and prosperous life.
Roads and schools and then jobs, so... you can raise your families, and jobs so you can put food on the table.
The Taliban aren't gonna provide you jobs.
The Taliban aren't here to help you.
Only we can help you.
We have a saying in America.
You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.
I understand that sometimes it can be hard to see the helping hand, what with all the guns and the strange guys and the mess and what have you.
But I assure you, this is the hand of helping.
This is the helping hand.
Yeah.
He says that he likes roads and schools, but when you leave, it will all mean nothing and they will be left in a big mess.
And every day that you spend here longer, the worse it will be for them when you leave.
So please, leave now.
Please.
I understand your concerns.
I really do.
That's...
That's why we're doing everything we can to bring peace, and to train up your own Afghan forces.
So that they can maintain your security... well into the future.
Please, leave now.
Dragonfly, this is Spartan Two.
Think we're ready to roll.
Give 'em hell, boys!
Kill those motherfuckers!
Eat 'em alive!
Jesus Christ, Willy.
What time is it?
It's me, boss.
Sorry to wake you.
We have a problem.
That Rolling Stone article came out, and it's not good.
Sir, it says we're shit-talking our president.
And our vice president.
That we don't have the support of our coalition partners.
And that we're drunk all over Europe.
Basically, a fucking drinking tour.
All over Europe.
I mean, I don't even know what the legals on a thing like this are, you know?
Nothing he says in there is actually untrue.
I'll get the editor on the phone as soon as it's morning there and see if there's anything they can do.
I'm not sure what that's gonna be, though.
Bottom line, this is gonna play bad, all right?
It's gonna play really fucking bad.
So we are in damage control now.
Guys, guys...
Is this really that bad?
I mean, yeah, it's colorful, sure.
But... this is Rolling Stone, okay?
It's hip.
And you guys...
You guys are the operators.
You know, you're out there, you're getting shit done in like a totally non-square way.
Yes, Little, you fucking idiot, it's that bad.
This was always a terrible idea.
Why you would unnecessarily court attention like this is...
- Simon, can you shut the fuck up?
- I will not shut up!
This is your mess.
You created it.
You invited this Cullen fellow in, you didn't properly consult me!
What?
I didn't properly consult you?
Are you fucking kidding me?
We had a conversation.
- Give me his phone number.
- What?
Whose phone number?
This fucking Cullen fuck.
Give me his fucking phone number!
- I'm not gonna give you his phone number.
- Why the fuck not?
Because you're acting crazy!
You're acting like a fucking lunatic right now!
You think this is crazy, huh?
- You think this is me being crazy?
- Peter!
Calm down!
You fucking calm down!
Duckman!
I'm gonna beat you down unless you chill out.
Oh, I'd like to see you try, old man.
Fucking come on!
Settle down, fellas.
I do believe I'm finished.
So... do me a favor, and... be lovely to one another.
- Sir.
- Yes, sir.
Dick.
Glen.
The president wants to see you in DC.
You need to be on a plane this afternoon.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Andy.
Badi.
Okay.
Let's go, Willy.
Fall out.
- Do you need anything, boss?
- No.
Thank you, Willy.
Are you... are you sure you don't need me to come with you?
I'm fine, Willy.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
And so Glen finally got his face time with the president.
Getting fired probably wasn't the kind of face time he was after, but, well,
I guess you could say it was kind of a page in the history books.
That was pretty exciting for me.
But, sadly, while I would've liked to have thought that my story had made a difference, it didn't.
It just became another celebrity-fall-from-grace story.
It would've been nice if the conversation after had been about the failure of counterinsurgency, or why we seem so desperate to be at war all the time, or how maybe what we're doing is just making more enemies
all in the name of keeping America safe.
It might've been nice if it had caused someone important to ask what any of this says about us.
But really, the only question anyone seemed to want to ask was...
What the fuck was Glen McMahon doing talking to a Rolling Stone reporter anyway?
Which, admittedly, is a good question.
Anyway, in the absence of any real soul searching, what do we do?
Well, obviously, we sack Glen and we bring in some other guy.
And that other guy... was Bob.
Ah, America.
You beacon of composure and proportionate response.
You bringer of calm and goodness to the world.
What do you do when the war you're fighting just can't possibly be won in any meaningful sense?
Well, obviously, you sack the guy not winning it, and you bring in some other guy.
In 2009, that war was Afghanistan.
And that other guy... was Glen.
You boys ready?
Let's go win this thing.
Okay.
So this is what I learned about four-star General Glen McMahon.
He was born to a military family at Fort Leavenworth.
Graduated West Point in 1976.
Ranger school in '79.
He had a graduate degree in political affairs and military history from Yale.
He was both a straight-A student and a troublemaker.
He once famously attempted to stick a lit cherry bomb up his sleeping drill sergeant's ass.
He was loved by the men and women who served under him.
Three, two, one, let's go.
Never afraid to get his hands dirty.
Yeah, it's flash time.
Never willing to send his troops anywhere he wouldn't go himself.
He was known variously as the Lion King, the G-Man, Big Glen and, most commonly, the Glenimal.
He was like a throwback to another era.
His hand was bent into a permanent claw, like it was still clutching a World War II cigar his modern, fitness-fanatic self wouldn't allow him to smoke.
After a successful stint running the secretive special operations killing machine in Iraq,
Glen was appointed leader of US and coalition forces in Afghanistan.
A war which, as he saw it, wasn't being won 'cause it wasn't being led.
General.
We're all very excited to have you here.
It's an honor to meet you.
I'm excited to be here.
Ain't that right, Greg?
Yes, indeed, sir.
You're very excited.
Somehow, while he was in Iraq,
Glen found time to author a book on leadership, entitled One Leg at a Time, Just Like Everybody Else.
In it, he wrote, "Men are imperfect creatures."
Left to their own devices,
"all they really want to do is play with their dicks and eat chicken."
For all his many achievements leading special operations in Iraq,
I think most of us here will know General McMahon as the man who took out al-Zarwaqi, who kicked al-Qaeda in the sack.
You're welcome.
We have a warrior at the helm, and it's a pleasure to have you, sir.
Glen was known as a humble man.
But humble in that way that says, "My humility makes me better than you."
He was famous for his Spartan regime of routine and discipline.
He ate one meal a day.
He slept four hours per night.
He ran seven miles every morning.
In Iraq, he transformed special operations with what he called systemic negation of repetitive procedural practice.
Or, to the acronym-obsessed military, SNORPP.
We got Italy in there.
That's the Dutch.
We got Poland, Macedonia, Ukraine.
We got Australia over there, Croatia, Belgium...
Okay, that'll do.
Bite-size chunks, hmm?
Let's knock this on the head.
All right.
Basically, he was a master of systems organization.
Which he'd kind of need to be, if he was to corral this 43-nation coalition of the willing.
- May I help you?
- No, finish your phone call.
The war can wait.
What can I do for you, General?
I want to pull everyone out of their offices.
I want to open this place up.
I came in here to speak with you about that.
I have only ten men to lead here in Afghanistan, huh.
So it make no sense for me to be sit out there with everybody else.
I get it.
All right?
But everybody has a reason not to be out there with everybody else.
Austria only has two guys here.
Iceland has seven guys.
This country won't fight at night.
That country won't fight in the snow.
This country wants to do counter-narcotics.
That country won't do counter-narcotics.
But if we're in the same room...
Cory Staggart was Glen's executive officer.
Ran the general's affairs.
He was a Ranger.
Although how he made it through Ranger school, I have no idea.
That's great.
Thank you, guys.
That's all the time we got.
Let's go.
Come on.
Greg Pulver.
General Greg Pulver graduated West Point in the same class as Glen.
Oh, that's interesting.
Does he have security clearance?
And hadn't left his side since.
Then fucking let him in just like you would any other fucking person with a fucking security clearance!
His official title was director of intelligence, but all I saw was a guy with anger management issues whose life had no meaning without Glen.
Andy Moon was Glen's tech whiz, providing the general with all forms of IT support.
Andy.
- Yes, sir?
- Which Glen needed often.
- How are you?
- Pretty good, sir.
How are you doing?
Uh, swell.
Can you come with me a moment?
- My electric razor is...
- Oh, yes, sir.
Yeah, broken.
Pete Duckman was a Navy SEAL.
Like Pulver, his job title had the word "intelligence" in it.
- What's going on?
- Boss is visiting with President Karzai.
Cool.
Why so fancy?
He's a world leader.
Cool.
Am I coming?
Yes, you are.
It's your job.
God damn it, Pete.
Why are you fat?
- I'm not fat.
- I still, to this day, don't know exactly what it was that Duckman did for the general.
It's a mixture of cross-pollinational collation...
Admiral Simon Ball was Glen's public affairs officer.
- Cooperational, uh, cooperative...
- For three and a half years, he'd been trying to explain SNORPP to the Washington press gallery.
With a centralized command centralization structure, and, um... things like that.
Matt Little was Glen's new civilian PR consultant.
Oh, I don't know.
Is this a good hand?
- He was a DC marketing hotshot...
- Straight flush.
Hello?
And sometime lobbyist who had thought the war in Afghanistan to be entirely pointless.
Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm not going there.
Until he was offered a lot of money to sell it.
How much?
And Willy Dunne.
- Right this way, boss.
Yeah.
- Willy was Glen's body man.
Put your things in here.
I'll let you spread them out how you like.
Why is this my room?
This was General Whelan's room.
It's got, uh, a great bathroom here.
Willy laundered Glen's clothes.
He did Glen's ironing.
Yeah.
Uh, boss?
He polished Glen's shoes.
He always seemed like he was about to collapse from the weight of one too many of Glen's bags.
- Willy!
- Yes, boss?
- Put my stuff in this room.
- Okay.
Here to fight a goddamn war, not watch goddamn television.
Willy was the first person that Glen saw every morning and the last person he saw every night.
Glen loved these men... and they loved him right back.
I don't know how it looks to you, Cory, but it seems to me, everybody's forgotten we're fighting a war here.
We got the goddamn Pizza Kings and Burger Huts.
The entire base is rolling with Eurosexuals who are so drunk they can't even stand up.
General McMahon here to see Ambassador MacKinnon.
- Glen.
- Pat.
Great to see you.
You know Dick Waddle, of course.
- Dick.
- Glen.
Ray Canucci.
- Ray.
- Glen.
Grab a seat, boys.
I'm calling myself Richard now, Pat, if you don't mind.
Oh?
Okay, fine.
Uh...
- That's fair.
My apologies.
- Hmm.
- Have you settled in, Glen?
- No, Pat, I haven't.
Seems to me that too much settling in might somehow be at the heart of the problem we have here.
Small talk.
Should've gone with the weather.
Glen, the president wants you to get the lay of the land here.
This war's been running eight years now.
President Obama, as you know, is drawing down troops in Iraq to refocus our attention on Afghanistan.
Henry Whelan was a good man, he meant well, but he just wasn't getting the job done.
Now, given your reputation and your formidable drive, our hope is that you're the man who will get the job done.
First things first.
We want you to make an assessment of the situation here.
Travel the country, talk to people.
At the end of that assessment, you'll tell us what needs to be done, how you're gonna get it done and what you need in order to get it done.
- So, now...
- To that end...
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, you go.
- I thought you were finished.
- You go.
- You sure?
- You go.
- I thought you were finished.
- No.
To that end...
Uh, now is probably a good time to share with you where the president hopes that assessment might land.
Obviously, the endgame here is to just finish this thing.
So, how do we do that?
- Is it by reducing our footprint here?
- The civilian executive.
These were guys who, in Glen's eyes, hadn't earned their power the way he had, through hard work and discipline.
I don't know.
But whatever it is, we want you to bring it on home, Glen.
But, whatever you do, please do not ask the president for more troops.
No more troops, Glen.
These were men who'd acquired their power through charm and seduction, and who seemed to serve no purpose other than to stand in the way of his greatness.
God, it's so fucking hot!
Fuck!
Another fucking assessment.
How many assessments do they need?
Just one fucking assessment after another.
They all point the same direction.
Bring General Glen McMahon in here and do whatever the fuck he says!
Oh...
Settle down, Greg.
They just wanna feel involved, is all.
Wars aren't fought by nations or by armies.
Wars are fought by men.
There are two types of general in the American military.
There are those who believe they can win in the face of all evidence to the contrary.
And there are those who know they can't.
Unfortunately for the world, it's the believers who climb to the top of the ladder.
It's guys like Glen who get given the keys to the castle.
President Karzai is very much looking forward to meeting you.
I think you will like each other.
There is no need to be nervous.
I'm not nervous.
Fuck!
Fuck it.
- Ah!
General, excuse me.
- Ah.
We are trying to make this Blu-ray player work.
- Uh, do you know how they function?
- Uh...
Normally, you have those wires with the red, the yellow and the white plug.
But, uh, this machine seems only to have this wire.
I can't find where to plug it into the television.
I'm sorry, Mr. President.
I'm afraid I don't know a whole lot about technology.
I'm sure I could have somebody come by and take a look at it for you.
Fuck it.
Never mind.
I think I need a new television.
I'm sorry, General.
Please, let's sit.
Welcome.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Please call me Hamid.
Excuse me.
Please.
Your predecessor, General Whelan, I liked him.
I'm not entirely certain he liked me.
He didn't visit very often.
Why was he dismissed?
It seems, uh, one minute he was here... the next minute, not here.
Ah.
Well, Mr. President,
I think our government simply felt it was... time our effort took a new direction.
- And, uh, what is this new direction?
- Ah!
It is most important to me that we build Afghanistan.
Together, we build Afghanistan into a free and prosperous nation.
Free from fear and conflict.
- I see.
I see.
- Yeah.
Sounds a lot like the old direction.
No.
But perhaps you yourself are the new direction.
New strong personality.
New energy.
New commitment.
Well, General, I wish you the best of luck.
Sir, uh... my team and I are about to embark on a, uh... a tour of the country so that we may make an assessment...
To precisely understand what is required of us here.
It would be an honor if you would consider joining me on the tour, so that our project might be a unified endeavor.
Hmm.
A sharing of our purpose...
Of our shared purpose.
Thank you for the invitation, General.
Hmm.
- It's very generous.
- Hmm.
But...
I've seen the country.
To get inside the mind of Glen McMahon, you really need first to get a handle on the madness of modern American war.
Lieutenant Colonel Frank Groom.
Welcome to Kandahar, sir.
Nice to meet you, Frank.
I'm here to get the lay of the land.
Counterinsurgency.
In the good old days, wars were fought against conventional armies from nation states.
Guys in uniforms, like Nazis and stuff.
When, however, you've just gone and invaded a place that you probably shouldn't have, you end up fighting against just regular people in regular-people clothes.
These guys are what are called insurgents.
Basically, they're just guys who picked up weapons 'cause... so would you, if someone invaded your country.
Funnily enough... insurgencies are next to impossible to defeat.
And so, if you wanna go on pretending you can win, you're really left with no option but to try to convince the country you've invaded that you're actually here to help.
He's saying the Americans are urinating in the streets, and, uh, they call us motherfuckers all day.
It's "motherfucker, motherfucker" all the time.
And it's considered in our culture a very bad thing to fuck your own mother.
In ours, too.
Uh... in ours, too.
This is counterinsurgency.
It's a popularity contest.
Salaam alaikum.
You're trying to convince the people that they're better off with you than they are with the insurgents.
Basically, it works like this.
You install a local government.
You provide security for the people so that that democracy can take root.
We're training them up, taking them out on maneuvers.
You train up the local forces so that they can provide the security for themselves.
I mean, they're sweet kids.
They're good kids.
Good-natured.
Integrational.
You know, they are very integrational as a people.
You know, I mean, they are committed to, uh...
- But, uh...
- Or at least you try to.
I don't know, sir, they're also lazy.
I mean, they really seem like they don't wanna be here.
They steal our shit and, basically, they're on drugs all the time.
I mean, they are fucking high all the time.
Excuse my language, sir.
You do whatever you can to stimulate the local economy.
Heroin is the only thing bringing money in.
Not that I like to think where the money is going to, exactly, but money keeps the people happy, so we're rolling with that.
Can't they grow something else?
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, they could grow cotton.
Cotton would grow here.
- Why don't they grow cotton, then?
- Because the United States Congress will not allow any United States aid and development funds to be directed towards the cultivation of a crop that will end up on the world market in competition with US farmers.
Oh.
- Which pretty much rules out cotton.
- Sure.
- So we're growing heroin instead.
- Right.
I think we're doing a pretty good job here, sir.
You build infrastructure.
Roads, schools, stuff like that.
What kind of presence does the Taliban have here?
- Who?
- The Taliban.
In short, you get off your bases and you go make friends with the people.
Killing insurgents all the while, of course.
Nation building.
Hearts and minds.
Hello!
Hello, all.
Let me break it down this way, General.
We've been in Helmand province for five years now, and in all that time, all we've really managed to secure is this base.
Now, you go out there, you go into Marjah, you go into Lashkar Gah, it's all Pashtun, as you know.
This is the Taliban.
We're not winning any hearts and minds there, I can tell you that.
I'm not sure we ever will.
Kandahar's the same, of course.
Can I be completely frank with you, sir?
If I was you, I'd cut Helmand loose.
I'd concentrate on those parts of the country that are at least, in some way, sympathetic to the mission, and I'd cut it loose.
It's a lost cause.
This whole province constitutes just 4% of the population of the country.
It's strategically meaningless.
I'd cut Helmand loose, sir.
The thing about counterinsurgency is that it doesn't really work.
We tried it in Vietnam.
That went well.
The British and the French gave it a shot, trying to hang on to their crumbling empires.
It just hasn't worked.
To me, it would seem kind of simple why.
You can't win the trust of a country by invading it.
You can't build a nation at gunpoint.
For guys like Glen, however, counterinsurgency hasn't worked for one simple reason.
You ready, boss?
Nobody's ever done it right.
Yes, I am, Pete.
I sure as hell am.
- Andy?
- Yes, sir.
- Good job.
- Thank you.
Let's lose Fox News.
Won't do us any good to have a bunch of angry perverts yelling at us all day.
- Yes, sir.
- So... we probably need to get to work on this assessment.
- Already written it.
- When?
It's already written.
Did it last night.
Needs a little flesh on the bone, but, basically, it's written.
All right, what's it say?
Greg...
I wanna take Helmand province.
I wanna take Helmand province precisely because everyone else seems to think we can't have it.
If we're gonna win the trust of this country, we can't be seen to accept that there's a whole chunk of it we can't handle.
We're here to provide security.
I say the first order of business is we secure that corner of the country everyone else seems to think we can't control.
Okay.
I didn't come here to manage this war, and I sure as shit didn't come here to close it out.
Came here to win.
I'm taking Helmand...
then I'm taking Kandahar.
What do you say to that?
All right, and another thing.
Being that this is a nation-building exercise and all, seems to me it'd behoove us to have someone in the room who's actually from the nation we're building.
Don't you think?
Copy.
We are here to build, to protect.
We are not here to harass, to intimidate.
We're not here to shoot first and ask questions later.
We must not be driven by fear and suspicion.
We are here, above all else... to support the civilian population.
And to that end, we must avoid killing it at all cost.
Civilian casualties cannot be seen as an unfortunate byproduct of conflict.
They must be treated as errors of the greatest consequence.
This is the war we are fighting.
It's a complex war, but it's a war nonetheless.
Let me reaffirmate that right from the get-go.
This is a war.
But it's a war that cannot be won by the virtues of our unassailable military might and power alone.
This war will be won primarily with the unassailable might and power of our ideals.
Yeah.
Yeah.
- Forty thousand?
- I'm afraid so.
God damn it.
What did we tell you?
No more troops.
Don't ask for more troops.
What do you do?
You ask for 40,000 more troops.
Well, Dick, Helmand province ain't exactly about to secure itself.
Probably should've asked for a lot more.
I just thought 40,000 sounded like a reasonable number.
There's no reasonable number, Glen, except perhaps zero.
That's a reasonable number.
Zero.
I thought you understood that.
Yeah, this "no more troops" thing, is that coming from the president, or coming from you?
- Of course it's coming from the president.
- Ah.
Why would it be coming from me?
Why do I care if we send more troops over there or we don't?
I don't know, Dick.
I'm just trying to work this thing out.
The president gave me a job to do.
- This is what I need to get it done.
- God damn it.
I'll be there day after tomorrow with the secretary of state.
We'll figure this nonsense out then.
- Roger that.
- God damn it.
God damn it.
There it is.
What did I tell you?
He's on retired-general time.
His mind's on a golf cart somewhere, halfway down the fairway.
He doesn't have the constitution for the hard stuff anymore.
He's obviously in the wrong fucking job!
That thing's off, right?
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, General, but we're gonna sit on your report until after the Afghan elections.
With all due respect, Madam Secretary, uh, the election is a month away.
I know it is, but, as I'm sure you know, an election here is a fragile thing.
It's a very delicate thing, and nobody wants its smooth running to be muddied by a big new American offensive.
No, I told you no more troops, Glen.
Now we're gonna have to rethink the game plan.
Well, Dick, with all due respect, you told me you didn't care if I got more troops or I didn't, so I'm trying to work out how to get the job done.
No, I did not say I didn't care.
- I believe you did.
- I did not say that.
- I believe you did.
- No.
No, I didn't.
I...
- You did, Dick.
- Whoever said what, a troop surge and an election don't sit well together, so this is the way it's gotta be.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing in the meantime.
I have a strategy.
I'm ready to execute.
The suggestion now seems to be that I thumb twiddle.
Uh, with all due respect, Madam Secretary...
General, please spare me the "all due respect" stuff.
It's really giving me the fucking creeps.
I think...
I think we all understand your frustration, Glen, but these elections have to run smoothly.
We need a legitimate partner in power here.
You need a legitimate partner here.
So... we just have to sit tight.
Why don't you do that SNORPP thing you did in Iraq?
You know, get your systems in place, get everybody talking together.
The time will fly, you know?
Get everybody excited.
You know, you're the best in the business at this stuff.
We've been operating at an extremely high optempo.
In the last week, we've conducted six air assaults into previously denied territories.
Uh, we're also in final coordination with RC South to develop an ops box in the seams existing along the provincial border.
You got that, uh, Lexus?
No.
No, now we got a Prius.
She got the new Prius.
Sweet.
Yeah, my wife, too.
She's got one.
We both have one.
We love it.
My first car was a Taurus.
My father bought it.
What do you got?
Sir.
Where you boys headed?
Back to our patrol base, sir.
Sasquatch.
Where you coming from?
Where are we from in the States, or where have we just been?
Where have you just been?
- Italy, sir, on R R.
- Ah.
R R in Italy.
- Yes, sir.
- Well...
Attention on deck!
So why the long faces?
You just got back from Italy.
I'm guessing you ate some sensational food, saw some antiquities.
Hmm?
I bet you got yourselves good and drunk and bumped into beautiful girls.
So what's it like out there?
Out where, sir?
- Sasquatch, son.
- Oh, um... it's not good, sir.
You know, I mean, it's whatever.
- It's... it's okay.
- No, it's a fucking shithole, sir.
No, I don't know.
We'll see where we land.
Cory, what time's that bird due?
- Uh, in about 20 minutes.
- Cancel it.
Uh, why's that, boss?
I'm going to Sasquatch with those boys there.
General, those boys are heading out to an inhospitable corner of the world.
I'm a goddamn Ranger, Frank.
Those boys, they need me.
I've spent the last week or so talking to guys who I would call middle management.
But you boys are at the coal face.
After all the blah, blah, blah, you boys are where it actually happens.
I'd go so far as to say you boys are the only thing that counts.
If it doesn't happen here, it doesn't happen.
End of story.
- Yes, son?
- If what doesn't happen, sir?
It, son.
Okay, thank you, sir.
Does anyone here know what "it" is?
Anyone?
Anyone?
To, uh, secure the area, sir.
To protect the people from the enemy so they can go about building their lives.
Okay.
Okay, thank you, Sergeant.
Okay, but I can't tell the difference between the people and the enemy.
They all look alike to me.
I'm pretty sure they're the same people, sir.
I understand it can be tough, son, but that's the job.
I have another question.
Um, I hear now they're giving out medals for heroic restraint.
Do I have that right?
Courageous restraint.
And that is right.
Well, I don't mean to be rude, sir, but I do not understand what the fuck that means.
It means, son, that sometimes when you're dealing with an insurgency, you're not gonna be 100% clear on who the enemy is.
It means you're gonna find yourself in situations where, when you're afraid or whatnot, you're gonna have to make a judgment call.
Because, as Sergeant Ortega here has so rightly pointed out, your mission is to protect the people, not kill them.
We can't help them and kill them at the same time.
It just ain't humanly possible.
Do you understand me?
No, not really, sir.
No.
What part are you struggling to comprehend, son?
I don't know, sir.
It seems to me that we all here with our guns and shit, trying to convince these people that...
deep down we're actually really nice guys.
And I don't know how to do that, sir, when every second one of them or every third one of them or every tenth one of them is trying to fucking kill me, sir.
'Cause I'm a marine. 'Cause we're marines.
And it seem like now they handing out medals for heroically not being a marine, sir.
I'm confused, is what I'm trying to say, sir.
Well, then you're just gonna have to get yourself unconfused, son.
On the day of the Afghan general elections, for which Glen had waited so patiently,
Badi Bassim joined his team.
Cory wouldn't tell me where he found Glen his Afghan mascot.
No, I'm doing your job!
He said he just found him in the phone book.
Put the bag down.
I assume that was a joke.
My name is Captain Badi Bassim.
I'm here to start work with, uh, General McMahon.
- Who?
- McMahon.
- McMahon?
- Yeah.
- Why are you not wearing the uniform?
- Uh, my uniform is in my bag.
It's too dangerous for me to wear it while I am walking here from my home.
Unzip it.
Unzip the bag.
My uniform.
- Why are you walking in here?
- Why I am working here?
Walking!
Walking!
Walking here?
Walking.
I like to walk.
- Badi!
Come in.
Come in.
- Ah!
Everyone, this is my new aide-de-camp, Badi Bassim.
He's a soldier and a scholar.
This is the face of the new Afghanistan.
Greg, you know.
That's Cory.
You know Cory.
Pete Duckman.
And, uh... we got people here from Spain and Italy and, uh...
- You know, places like that.
- Okay.
Ah.
- Have you voted?
- I wanted to report to you first.
- You haven't voted?
- No.
Good.
Good.
You can do it right here.
We got a polling booth right here, right around the corner.
Okay.
- Election day.
It's exciting.
- Yeah.
This is important, Badi.
That long line of men, that slow shuffle there, that's the slow shuffle towards freedom.
The steps are small but, by God, their importance...
It's like the moon landing.
Small step, giant leap.
Yeah.
Are you familiar with the moon landing, son?
- Yes, sir.
- It's like the goddamn moon landing.
Yes, sir, I agree.
It's very important.
- Yes, it is.
- Yeah.
- A what?
- We're gonna have another election.
We can't ignore these fraud allegations.
They're coming in from every corner of the country and everything points to a ridiculous Karzai victory.
I mean, the whole thing just smells stupid.
Sure.
Sure, there's gonna be irregularity now and again.
But surely a result is the best possible outcome.
Yeah?
The polling station, the one right there over where you are... 367 registered voters, 1,200 votes counted.
It's a joke.
We're going to a runoff election.
Tell them what you told me!
Uh...
- About what, sir?
- About the elections.
About the whole concept of elections in this country.
Well, I was just observing, sir, that, um, people don't quite understand elections.
They see that the president is alive, everything is okay.
So what's the big problem?
Why are we having an election?
Yeah.
And then you have an election anyway, and people vote for whoever the local leaders tell them to vote for.
Yeah.
Because they don't want to have their heads chopped off.
See what I mean?
Thank you... for that.
Uh...
I'm sorry, Glen.
We're going to a runoff election.
Jesus H...
I got the White House sitting on my report till after these elections get done.
I can't do anything until the president approves my recommendations.
And now you're telling me that's not gonna be until after another goddamn election?
!
You need a legitimate partner here, Glen.
Karzai ain't that guy.
You gotta understand, what we're trying to do here is like raising a child.
And a child needs two parents.
Two parents who love it and each other very much.
That's what it needs, above all else.
Well, then your wife, Mrs. Karzai...
I'm assuming that you're the daddy in this metaphorical relationship...
We suspect your wife, Karzai, might be a drug addict.
He eliminated his chief opponent in this election by spreading a pretty vicious homosexual rumor, and we're pretty sure that his brother is a straight-up criminal warlord.
Oh, come on, Pat!
You got a bee in your bonnet.
You just don't like him for some reason, whatever it is.
And seriously...
Anyway, I wanna know, how is Washington any different, huh?
Seriously!
Tell me!
Hmm?
Yeah.
You can't.
On page 74 of One Leg at a Time, Just Like Everybody Else,
Glen wrote, and I quote,
"A good leader lives by a set of rules.
A great leader knows when to break them."
Morning.
- Morning, all.
- Sir.
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.
Morning, boys.
- Morning, sir.
- Boss.
Morning, Matt.
You're up early.
Uh, yes, sir.
We've got a problem.
Somebody leaked your report.
The Washington Post has a copy.
No.
- Somebody gave it to Bob Woodward.
- Woodward?
No.
Oh, my God almighty.
You find the source?
Sir, the source?
Uh, this is terrible.
Goddamn terrible news.
Do you hear that?
Someone leaked the assessment.
- Oh, terrible.
- Terrible.
Shocking.
- Shocking.
- Shocking.
- Terrible.
- Shocking.
Yeah, well...
I don't think it really matters who leaked the assessment.
Question is, what are we gonna do about it?
I wanna do the 60 Minutes interview.
Sir, as your senior PAO, I must counsel strongly against it.
It would be foolhardy.
I really don't think now's the time to court media attention.
At the very moment, allegations are being made
- that you leaked this report yourself.
- I'm choosing to embrace the leak, Simon.
I don't seem to be getting any traction.
Do you know what I'm saying?
Traction?
We got ourselves a president who appears not to be aware of the fact that the United States is at war right now, and he's that war's commander in chief.
- I gotta get me some traction.
- You need cut through.
Exactly.
Cut through.
You need to get me some goddamn cut through.
I can handle that for you, sir.
Sorry.
No offense, Simon, how exactly are you gonna do that?
I'll quieten this whole situation down.
Again, I'm sorry, I don't wanna start a fight here.
And please forgive me for speaking for you, sir.
But the general didn't hire me to make things quiet, okay?
Look, you're so good at your job, but that job is basically writing press releases.
Here's the thing about press releases.
Nobody reads 'em, okay?
They're boring.
And they're bullshit.
And everyone knows they're bullshit.
Correct me if I'm wrong, you hired me to make some noise.
You know, the right kind of noise.
Our... noise.
Pete.
- Boss.
- Move those vehicles to the right.
I wanna make sure the M-ATVs are clearly visible in the background.
Copy that.
They're...
They're completely blocking them.
- This one?
- Both of them.
Just get 'em out of there.
Get 'em out of there!
Hey.
How're we doing over here?
Good?
- Great.
- You good?
Good.
Okay.
- Yeah, I think we're getting close.
- Oh, that's exciting.
I don't wanna interrupt.
I mean, I know you have your own world of questions to ask in there.
You might wanna think about asking the general... how much face time he's had with the president since taking over the position.
Okay.
Yeah.
You know, if you run out of stuff to talk about or whatever.
You're welcome.
Yes, the leak was unfortunate.
There's no denying it.
It's unfortunate.
One would always choose to mull these things over in the... the sensible calm of the proper quiet places.
But this war is tough.
War is tough.
And...
And the president has tough decisions to make.
How many times have you spoken to the president since you've been here?
Since I've been here in Afghanistan, leading ISAF?
Yes.
Uh...
Once.
I've spoken to the president once.
By video teleconference.
You've spoken to the president once in, what, 70 days?
That's right.
You're the leader of US forces in Afghanistan, and you have spoken to the president once in 70 days?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Why is that?
Uh...
I don't know.
Uh...
I'm guessing he's... very busy.
Probably.
What the fuck's the matter with you, Glen?
Are you out of your mind?
One second we're dealing with this so-called fucking leak, the next you're on the fucking television backing the president into the most ham-fisted corner I've ever seen.
I honestly believe you've made it your sole mission to fuck me.
Well, Dick, I answered the questions that were asked of me.
- I thought I was being fair.
- It's not a question of fair, Glen.
It's a question of what the fuck were you doing on the television?
- Why am I seeing you on the television?
- Oh.
Now we gotta fix this.
We gotta find a way of taking the heat out of this thing.
Now you've gone and lit a fucking fire under it!
Do you understand?
- Yeah, I see.
- Here's where we're gonna start.
You're gonna get on the phone to Bob Gates and...
Hang on, Dick.
You're cutting out.
I can't hear you.
Can you hear me?
Yeah, I can hear you.
And please stop calling me Dick!
Shit.
Something's wrong.
I can't hear a word you're saying.
Let me, uh...
let me try this.
- Can you hear me now?
- Yeah, I can hear you.
Okay, something's wrong here.
Hold on a minute, Dick.
- Oh, God.
- Andy, get your ass in here!
- Yes, sir.
- Got a problem.
- I can't hear a word Dick's saying.
- Uh-huh.
He can hear me, but I can't hear him.
- All right, can you hear us now?
- Yeah, I can hear you.
- What about now, Mr. Dick, sir?
- Yeah, I can hear you!
I'm...
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, Dick.
- Oh, gosh!
Can't hear a word you're saying.
Andy's gonna have to work on this, and pronto!
- Yes, sir.
- This is goddamn unacceptable.
No, no, we need to talk.
I'll talk to you later, Dick.
We need to finish...
We need to finish this thing.
Well done.
- Thank you, sir.
- Well done.
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.
Thank you.
I wanna speak to you tonight about our effort in Afghanistan.
It's an extraordinary honor for me to do so here at West Point, where so many men and women have prepared to stand up for our security and to represent what is finest about our country.
As your commander in chief,
I owe you a mission that is clearly defined...
- Yes, you do.
- And worthy of your service.
And that's why I insisted on a thorough review of our strategy.
And as commander in chief, I have determined that
- it is in our vital national interest...
- Mmm-hmm.
To send an additional 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan.
After 18 months, our troops will begin to come home.
I do not make this decision lightly.
We have been at war now for eight years, at enormous cost in lives and resources.
Years of debate over Iraq and terrorism have left our unity on national security issues in tatters.
And having just experienced the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the American people are understandably focused on rebuilding our economy and putting people to work here at home.
Sir.
You got your troops.
Buddy here just announced to the whole of Afghanistan that we are about to abandon it!
That's like telling the bad guys all they gotta do
- is wait out the next 18 months...
- Yeah.
And then we'll be gone!
And so he just told an auditorium full of young American soldiers the war they've been asked to fight these last eight years has been nothing more than one great monumental waste of everybody's time.
That was a clusterfuckingly stupid fucking speech!
Thank you, Greg.
Well, you heard him.
He's not giving us the full 40,000.
They're giving us 30.
I just got off the phone with the SecDef.
We gotta get the rest from our coalition partners.
Looks like we're going to Europe, boys.
So, uh, pack your, uh...
Oh, I don't know, fuck it!
Pack whatever it is they wear in Europe.
- Speedos and shit!
Willy.
- Hmm.
The world stage.
It's always seemed funny to me how a man can go from looking at a map of,
I don't know, say Helmand province, to finding himself in Europe trying to persuade our friends and allies that his crazy dream is their crazy dream, too.
Bonjour, General.
Thank you.
- Bonjour, monsieur.
- Hello.
Okay, so tomorrow afternoon, you have the presentation to I'École Militaire.
Uh...
Tomorrow night, dinner with the minister of defense.
That is a gala dinner, by the way.
Just a heads-up so you can prepare yourself mentally.
It's a big one.
Meetings the next day.
Then we got the night free.
- And then to Berlin.
- Yeah.
Here we go.
Obama is in Copenhagen tonight.
They wanna know if you can spare time for a meeting on Air Force One tomorrow morning.
The president wants some face time.
Now he wants fucking face time.
Fucking dick.
So can you do that, boss?
Then we can jet across to Copenhagen at zero six.
The president's gonna be on the tarmac at 8:30.
Well, you're the keeper of my schedule, Cory.
You tell me if I can do it.
Uh, okay, yeah, we can have you back in Paris early afternoon, depending on how much time you two need.
And I can shift your morning meetings.
See that out there?
I'm calling that dusk.
That's close of fucking business.
Boss, you good with this?
Sure, Pete.
We're not in theater.
You boys earned it.
Sir, have you had a chance to say hello to your wife yet?
You know, she checked in this morning.
I think she's waiting for you in your room.
Shit.
Right, I should do that.
What room am I in again?
- 517.
- What?
- Five-seven-one.
- Five-one-seven.
- Stop.
Go.
- Five-one-seven.
Five-one-seven.
- Hi, boss.
- Hey, Willy.
- Hi.
Hi, honey.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Huh.
I'm sorry, I've been delayed.
The president is wanting time with me tomorrow, and we've been trying to ascertain whether... whether or not we can accommodate this request.
I'm gonna leave you two be.
I'll be...
- I'll be right next door.
- Okay, thank you, Willy.
Well, we're in Paris.
Yeah...
Hopefully we'll get to see some sights.
Yeah, I'll have, uh, Cory, uh, schedule some time.
- Yeah.
- Okay, but you do what you gotta do, because I am here for you.
- Oh, yeah?
- Uh-huh.
- How's Tim?
- Oh, he's good.
He's good.
- He sends his love.
- Okay.
Um...
He's...
He's got a new girlfriend now.
- Ooh!
- Yeah, I like her.
Yeah, her daddy's an ILE instructor over at Leavenworth.
- Huh.
- Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, she's sweet.
You'll like her.
Hmm.
Well...
Well, I...
I think it's just great you're getting to see the president, honey.
You must be very excited, huh?
Hey, Glen.
Hope you don't mind me hitching a ride.
I'm on my own dash to see the president.
They told me you were heading over there this morning.
No problem, Pat.
My plane is your plane.
- Knock yourself out.
- Thanks, Glen.
So my hope is, depending on how long your meeting goes with the president, we can have you back in Paris NLT 1400, then straight to the École Militaire for 1500.
My uniform will be crushed after these flights.
I'll need a shower, a fresh shave.
I'm allowing for four solid hours with the president.
If it's less than that, we should be fine to go via the hotel.
I am just contingency planning for the possibility we may be running tight on time.
- Can we move the École Militaire back?
- Not really.
Gonna be a lot of people there.
We have the gala dinner right after.
We don't have any wiggle room here.
You should wear the fatigues to the thing this afternoon.
The general, direct from the battlefield.
No need to shower when you're straight from the fight.
- That's good.
- Yeah.
- It's very good.
- I like that.
Well, just make sure Willy has my fatigues on standby.
Talking points for the president.
How you doing, Glen?
Oh!
This one is a bitch, right?
Nothing about war is easy, Pat.
Right on.
Though I'm guessing, somewhere deep down, you were happier in Iraq.
A soldier leading soldiers.
Soldiers above you, soldiers below you.
Just a nice bubble of soldiers.
Just ordered.
Right?
'Cause it has to be.
War is chaos, so then the army has to be the opposite of chaos.
But now you find yourself in the real world.
Now you're dealing with civilians, and civilians don't make sense.
Not making sense is a luxury I can't afford.
Hmm.
Lives depend on it.
- No, of course.
- Yeah.
Absolutely.
And you can't live in the bubble forever.
You gotta rise as your talents dictate.
What do you want, Pat?
How do you think this ends?
Simple.
We either win it or we lose it.
Yeah, I don't know.
I think I'm gonna call bullshit on that, Glen.
All the winning we were ever gonna do, we did in the first six months.
And since then, we've just been making a mess.
And that's all it was ever gonna be.
You're not here to win.
You're here to clean up the mess.
You'll get your 40,000 troops.
Get 'em in there.
Get your PowerPoint presentation in order, you know?
Just move the needle a little bit.
Show everyone how all the graphs are pointing in the right direction.
That's all you gotta do.
That's how this ends best for you...
anyway.
A nice-looking set of graphs.
Or a nicer-looking set of graphs than the last set of graphs.
Either that or get yourself fired.
Then you can say "I told you so" when it all turns to shit or fizzles out or...
however it is this thing ends.
There's no street parade at the end of this one.
It's good to talk.
Everybody.
How are you?
Morning.
Yeah, it's good to see you again.
- How you doing?
Good to see you.
Nice tie.
- Thank you.
All right.
How's it going?
- Morning, sir.
Nice to see you again.
- All right.
Take care now.
It's good to see you, Mr. President.
All right, see you soon.
- Mr. President.
- It's great to see you, General.
I'm sorry, but we're running behind schedule.
I was looking forward to getting some face time with you, but I gotta get this baby in the air.
So... all right.
Smile for the cameras, Glen.
All right.
Take care.
- Pat.
- Mr. President.
- Let's get going.
- Yes, sir.
All right, Magnus, talk to you soon.
Okay?
You could argue that the main reason certain generals like war so much is... well, because it's only in war that they feel truly relevant.
It's only in war that they feel close to the center of power.
Only in war do they feel the warm glow of other people's attention.
Good evening, sir.
The attention of people like me.
Okay, you know what?
You both look beautiful.
Really.
Uh, sir, before you get dragged into the hubbub there,
I want to introduce you to Sean Cullen here.
Sean's the writer from Rolling Stone.
He's been doing that profile piece on you.
He's gonna be tagging along for a couple days.
Thanks for having me, sir.
It's a real privilege.
- Rolling Stone?
- Yes, sir.
Just make sure I'm on the cover.
Well, it's between you and Lady Gaga, sir.
Well, put me in a heart-shaped bathtub with her.
Rose petals.
Happy to share.
Glen, stop joking.
I'm deadly serious, son.
Put me on the cover.
Okay, here we are.
There's the boss.
There's Mrs. Boss.
Oh, there's me.
There's you.
Where's me?
I guess you're on a different table.
Better keep looking.
- You serious?
- Hmm.
- Sorry.
- Yes?
Excuse me.
I think you are sitting in my seat, sir.
Oh.
Oh, hey, there.
I'm sorry.
Pleased to meet you.
Dear.
Thank you.
Hi.
General.
Tom Howard, sir.
I'm the United States defense attaché here in Paris.
Pleased to meet you.
This is my wife, Jeanie.
Pleased to meet you, Jeanie.
Are you enjoying your time here in Paris?
Oh, yes, very much.
It's lovely.
Isn't it?
Have you managed to see any museums or exhibitions?
- Have you done the Louvre?
- Oh, um,
I...
I think we're gonna be too busy to see the Louvre.
But I've been wandering around by myself while Glen's at meetings, and... oh, my, it's... it's lovely.
General, I thought it went very well at the École Militaire today.
I didn't get the opportunity to introduce myself there.
But, uh, there were some very interesting people there today.
If you'd like, I'd be very happy to give you a rundown of the who's who if you get a little window in your schedule while...
I appreciate that.
My schedule's very tight.
Of course.
Totally understood.
General, I could introduce you to some people here tonight if you'd prefer.
No, I...
I think my team and I have a grip on the who's who.
Thank you.
- Cory, where's Badi?
- Hmm?
Uh, I don't know, boss.
He was here a minute ago.
I thought he was supposed to be sitting beside you and Jeanie.
General, I thought it best if you and I took this opportunity to talk, so... so I switched places with your colleague over there, I...
Like you said, your schedule's very tight.
What'd you say your name was?
Tom Howard, sir.
What do you think this dinner is for, Tom Howard?
General, this dinner is to honor you, sir.
Wrong.
This dinner is for Afghanistan.
We are here tonight because we're at war in Afghanistan.
And you got the goddamn gall to kick the only Afghan in the room
- off my goddamn table?
- I'm sorry...
Let me tell you what I want you to do, Tom Howard.
I want you to go sit your ass down wherever the fuck your ass was officially designated to sit, and I want you to tell Badi to bring his ass back over here!
How's that sound, Tom Howard?
I'm sorry, sir.
Ma'am.
I apologize for my language.
- Everything's okay, honey.
- Uh, boss?
I'm pretty sure the Afghan ambassador here is from Afghanistan.
General.
Sir.
Swell.
I don't want for this dinner to be awkward for you, General, so I will tell you now that we intend to give you our portion of the troops that you request.
I don't think the Germans will be so easy.
I think that they are feeling inclined to withdraw altogether.
And, uh, I should add that
I would hate for you to think that France is easy.
This must be a final moment, no?
We cannot stay in Afghanistan forever.
No, we can't.
That's why I'm gonna win it.
Thank you.
That was strange.
Writing a biography, is that something...
you might be open to?
Or...
For sure, yeah.
Something I'm absolutely open to...
It's such a fascinating subject matter.
No offense, book could kinda write itself.
We may have a problem getting to Berlin tomorrow.
This volcano in Iceland.
It's, uh... canceling all flights because of the ash cloud.
- Dude, we got our own plane.
- Guess this cloud's huge.
Nothing's taking off in Europe.
They're grounding all air traffic.
We got tonight free, right?
Then what's the plan?
We're drinking.
Tell me we're fucking drinking.
Today is Jeanie and my's 30th wedding anniversary, so, uh...
I'm taking her to dinner.
Just the two of you?
Yes.
It doesn't matter, honey.
I've had fun.
- Good.
Good.
- Mmm.
We'll come back again when everything's normal and we can do it together.
- Sure.
- Mmm-hmm.
We're together.
Yeah.
- This is so special.
- Hmm.
Hmm.
You know, the other day I was, uh, calculating the...
I was working out that we've spent less than 30 days a year together for the last eight years.
And...
I was just thinking that it's really interesting, the way things happen.
Well, if we hadn't gone to war... if September 11th hadn't happened... if America hadn't been attacked and we hadn't gone to war,
I'd probably be barbecuing something in our backyard right now.
- Mmm.
- But 9/11 did happen, didn't it?
Hmm?
Yes.
Yes, I know.
I know.
I know, and I am...
I'm sorry.
- I didn't say that to make you feel bad.
- Why are you thinking about it?
No, I'm not...
I'm not...
I'm not thinking about it, I promise.
Yes, you are.
You're calculating days.
You just told me, one day you sat yourself down with a calendar and you calculated days.
Yes, I know.
I know.
But I just did that because...
I did it because I was proud of you, honey.
I'm proud of me, too.
You know?
Yeah, I'm proud of me, too.
Do you know?
Oh, honey.
No, honey, look at me.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I know.
Yes, every...
Everything...
Everything's okay.
Yeah.
Obama's not a leader.
He's an orator.
He hammered the whole world on, "Yes, we can.
Yes, we can."
Really, it's "No, we can't."
Yeah.
We can't do Iraq.
He's loud and clear now that we can't do Afghanistan.
We can't do Gitmo.
Where the fuck else we gonna put all these motherfuckers?
- That's a great orator.
Right there.
- Hmm.
He's sold us on, like, a double negative.
Yes, we can not do things.
You know?
Or is that a double negative?
Not really, but I know what you mean.
Yo, look who it is!
Hey.
- Hi.
- Hello, Mrs. Boss.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Boss and Mrs. Boss, down there.
- You, drink!
- No, no.
- You, drink!
- Down the hatch.
Sir, I just want to say again what a privilege this is.
- You must be really proud.
- Hmm?
- You must be really proud of him.
- Oh, yes, I am.
Ow!
- Ah, here we go!
Here we go!
- Oh, yeah!
Go, Pete!
Come on!
I got your name all over this.
I always loved this asshole!
- We're not flying to Berlin tomorrow.
- What?
- Not flying to Berlin tomorrow.
- What?
They won't give us clearance to fly to Berlin tomorrow.
USA!
Everybody now!
USA!
USA!
This is bullshit.
It's, like, one phone call.
"Hello, they won't let us take off.
Can you fix it?"
"Oh, no, monsieur.
Big volcano.
No take off."
"Well, this is General Glen McMahon we're talking about here."
"Oh, General Glen McMahon."
Oh, I did not know.
Why didn't you say that?
"Pardon, monsieur, of course you may take off."
- Done!
How hard is that?
- I've made the calls.
Believe me.
Listen, we are the fucking US military.
We practically invented everything!
And now we have some chinless fuck in Brussels who's telling us we can't fly our own plane because of a volcano in Greenland.
What are we supposed to do?
Sit around here in Paris and wait for it to "stop erupting"?
I don't know, Greg.
This isn't exactly a situation that I've been in before.
Okay, bear with me on this one.
I think I might have just solved our problem.
I really can't tell you why these guys got so loose in front of me.
Or why Glen let them get so loose.
I can only put it down to hubris.
These guys thought they were the most important guys in the world... with the most important jobs in the world.
Maybe they assumed I thought they were as amazing as they did.
What are you writing?
Hmm?
What are you writing?
You're always writing.
I don't like it.
Maybe they thought they could do whatever they wanted.
I'm a writer.
I write.
I better like what it is you're writing.
Let's say you have ten insurgents.
Huh?
Now, let's say you kill two of 'em.
Now, how many insurgents do you have left?
Hmm?
Hmm?
Well, you'd say eight, of course.
Eight.
Right?
Right?
Wrong!
In this scenario, ten minus two equals 20.
Let's say the two insurgents you just killed, uh... each had six friends or brothers or some such, who are hovering on the brink of...
of joining the insurgency.
They're thinking about this insurgency thing.
"Looks interesting.
But, you know, for one reason or other, not for me."
But...
So, then you go and kill their friend.
Now you've just made up their minds for 'em.
Those hovering friends are now full, paid-up members of the enemy.
Yeah.
And so, in the math of counterinsurgency, ten minus two... equals 20.
Uh, yes, ma'am?
General, the US invaded Afghanistan because of the al-Qaeda attacks on September 11th.
- This is correct, yes?
- Yeah.
You have been speaking to us now for 45 minutes...
Oh, uh, where's the, uh...
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
You have been speaking to us now for 45 minutes, and yet in all of that time you have only mentioned al-Qaeda once.
Your own vice president has advocated a much smaller and simpler counterterrorism approach to incapacitate what is estimated to be little more than 100 al-Qaeda fighters that still remain in Afghanistan to refocus on what it was that started this war in the first place.
- Ah.
- Your analysis of the insurgency there suggests to me there is no monolithic Taliban.
You are spread over the entire country.
You are fighting 1,000 separate battles with locals whose principal ideological position would seem to be simply that they don't want foreign soldiers in their village.
And that, General, you must know, is a war you will never win.
Ah.
Uh... with all due respect, ma'am.
Uh...
I must beg to differ.
I firmly believe, having traveled to all corners of the country, having spoken with many people from many walks of life... that what these people want is the very same thing that you and I want.
Hmm?
Freedom, security, stability, jobs.
Progress is being made.
Real Progress.
But challenges do remain.
Yes, I understand all of that, General.
And... and, please, let me say quite sincerely that I do not question the goodness of your intent.
I have been listening to you here this morning, and, uh...
I believe you are a good man.
I do.
What I question is... your belief in your power to deliver these things that you describe.
I question your belief in the power of your ideals.
Ah, well...
I think what I am trying to say, and I apologize, General, if this is sounding impolite, but I question your sense of self.
No, no, no, that's all... all right.
I, uh, appreciate your, uh, commentary.
I do.
Um...
But I have a job to do.
Yes, I understand.
And I also have a job to do.
And I am trying to do mine.
As an elected representative of the people of Germany, it is my job to ensure that the personal ambitions of those who serve those people are kept in check.
You have devoted your entire life, General, to the fighting of war.
And this situation in Afghanistan, for you, it is the culmination of all your years of training, all your years of ambition.
- This is the great moment of your life.
- Well...
It's understandable to me that you should have, therefore, a fetish for completion to make your moment glorious.
It is my job, however, to ensure that your personal ambitions are not entirely delusional and do not carry with them an unacceptable cost for everybody else.
- Honey, you okay?
- I'm fine.
Please don't shut down.
It's our last day together.
Be here with me.
One second.
Thank you.
So, just got an email from Gates.
Good news and bad news.
Spoke with the German defense minister...
We're getting our troops.
Turns out that crazy bitch...
lady back there was just some sad, lonely voice in the wilderness.
Bad news is, they won't let their guys leave the base.
Whatever that means.
But, hey, they're ponying up.
So I guess job here is done.
Boss?
I used to think that men went gray because they had stressful jobs with stressful decisions to make.
Now, I think it happens when men start to feel in their bones that the great moments of their lives... might not turn out to be quite as great as they'd always hoped.
When the real world starts creeping in.
What separates the believers like Glen from everybody else is... their ability to block this real world out.
Some people call this insanity.
Welcome to Operation Moshtarak.
We're taking the Helmand province, gentlemen, once and for all.
Moshtarak will be the largest operation yet to be conducted since this war began.
So, needless to say, it is an important one.
This whole province has been a thorn in our ass since day one.
So this here will be a definitive test in our resolve.
And that starts right here in Marjah.
If we infill teams here and here tonight, we can set up our blocking positions, hopefully draw enough wiggle room for the marines tomorrow.
- Good.
- The forecast says tonight's the night.
If we don't go in tonight, likely have to wait maybe another week.
I want Karzai to sign off on this.
Cory, can you get him on the phone?
Copy.
And why these spots?
ISR is telling us these locations are where there still appears to be a concentration of movement.
Obviously, we're proceeding under the assumption that anyone who isn't a bad guy has moved on or at least hunkered down.
We've made it clear to the whole city that's the thing to do.
If I could just ask a question, General.
Shoot!
I know this is Marjah, but I'm still not quite clear as to why you're sending boys to Nawzad and Musa Qala.
I mean, there's nothing out there.
I'm just not quite clear what it is you're trying to control there.
Apart from nothing.
You see this map, Frank?
This one, hmm?
This here is the mess I'm having to clean up.
Now, we've been kind enough to plan this operation in such a way as to not make it look like the Americans are here to get done what you couldn't.
But that is what's happening.
Hmm?
So, Frank, uh... while your input is greatly appreciated...
It is.
I wouldn't want you to think that it isn't.
It is.
I'd also appreciate if you would take one nice, big step back and let me get this shit done.
Yeah.
Hmm?
Yeah?
- What?
- I can't get him.
They're telling me he's in bed with a cold.
Well, did you tell 'em what it's about?
I didn't tell 'em exactly what it was about.
- I said it was very important.
- Jesus H. Christ.
- Just dial the number again.
I'll talk.
- Right.
Copy.
Thanks, Bernie.
Let's assume this is happening.
I'll give you the green light soon as I get it.
- Yes, sir.
- I have General McMahon on the line.
Hello, who am I speaking with?
This is General McMahon.
I need to speak to President Karzai urgently.
I understand he's not feeling well, but I need to speak with him.
Is he awake?
Good.
Put him on.
Put the call through.
What do you mean, he doesn't have one?
What world leader doesn't have a phone in his bedroom?
Does he have a cell phone in there?
- Did you try his cell phone?
- Straight to voice mail.
What?
Well, tell him to turn it back on.
Please!
Please!
This is...
I can't...
Oh, fuck it!
I'm coming over there.
This is me doing that right now.
I'm making the appointment right now.
Oh!
Yes?
- Oh, General, please come in.
- Mr. President.
Please sit here.
Please, please sit.
Sit.
- How are you?
- I'm fine, sir.
I've been trying to contact you.
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.
I'm not feeling well.
I understand, sir.
But did they not tell you this is urgent?
Oh, you know how everything is at the top of the mountain, General.
Everybody's urgent about everything all the time.
Everything is important.
Nothing ever really is.
There's nothing that cannot wait until morning.
This is important, sir.
We hope to launch Operation Moshtarak tonight, and I need your official consent before doing so.
- Really?
- Yes, sir.
- Why?
- Because it's your mission.
- It is?
- Yes, sir.
Ah.
No one has ever asked me to approve a mission before.
Well, that needs to change.
This mission needs your consent.
If we're to win the trust of Helmand province, it demands that this mission be seen to be of your design.
I...
I don't mean to be rude, Mr. President, but it is imperative that you begin to take a leadership role here.
We cannot win this thing alone.
Without your active involvement, our presence here will never be anything more than a foreign occupation.
This is your war.
For your country.
Your people.
Again, I'm sorry, sir... but you need to behave like a leader.
But I am behaving like a leader.
I'm unavailable.
I am as unavailable to you as is your own president.
Hmm?
You have my approval, General.
We both know it was never really mine to give.
But...
I thank you for inviting me to participate in the theater of it all.
And good luck.
I wish you much success.
Good luck tonight, Glen.
Who told you about tonight?
I just mean... whatever you happen to find yourself doing tonight, good luck with it.
Go fuck yourself, Pat.
Glen?
Glen.
What?
Look, I just want to apologize.
You know how the other day
I said there wasn't a parade at the end of all this?
I was wrong.
It was glib.
I just thought it was a pithy way to end the conversation, but I was wrong.
There's gonna be thousands of parades.
Thousands of 'em all over America.
Only none of them will be for you.
Now that was pithy, too, but it was true.
Fuck you!
Roger that.
What was that about, buddy?
Nothing.
Let's get to Kandahar.
We got some fucking winning to do.
Okay, listen up.
This is going to be tough.
I'm not gonna mince words about that.
This will be tough.
This will probably be the toughest mission that any of you all will experience.
This is the real deal.
Marjah is Taliban ground zero.
This is gonna be IEDs everywhere.
This is gonna be their best guys.
And they are gonna be prepared.
They know we're coming, gentlemen.
They've known we're coming for weeks.
So don't be under any illusion.
This will get ugly.
We're gonna lose guys.
I am not gonna lie to you about that.
There will be casualties.
But if you keep your wits about you, if you have faith in your ability, if you have faith in the ability of the men next to you, you will come out the tail end of this!
I have faith in you!
I know who you are!
You are proud members of the toughest fucking fighting force this world has ever known.
Carry that knowledge with you!
Carry it with pride!
Do you understand me?
Oorah!
- Do you understand me?
- Oorah!
That's right.
Any of you so inclined, I'm gonna ask this chaplain to say a prayer for us.
Thank you, Captain.
Let us pray!
Almighty God, as these marines prepare for battle, we pray that your Holy Spirit shall guide them.
As you brought down the walls of Jericho, as you dealt out your wrath upon the Philistines, as you crushed the Hittites and brought retribution upon all the enemies of the righteous, may your mighty hand be upon these men and assure their victories.
Be with them, mighty God...
Let's move.
What are you thinking about, buddy?
Well, let's just see how this plays out.
The uncrackable nut.
If anyone's gonna crack this, it's gonna be you.
You're gonna smash this like a monkey on a rock.
Yeah.
- You're a killing machine, Glen.
- Hmm.
You are the terrorist hunter.
Remember?
You're Big Glen.
You're the Glenimal.
Thank you, General.
I'm hungry.
I wanna eat that motherfucker.
Jesus Christ, man.
Farrenberg.
Move.
Contact front!
Move!
Move!
Up against the wall!
- Farrenberg.
- Not too close.
Get off the walls.
Now!
- Fuck!
- Over there, twelve o'clock!
Cole!
Cole!
I need to see a weapon.
He isn't a combatant until I see a weapon.
Fuck, man!
You think this nigga on his morning jog?
All right.
All right.
We're gonna head to that house over there at two o'clock.
All right?
We're gonna work this shit out.
Cutter, I need you, Song, Carroll and Trey, head over there and get us in, all right?
We're gonna move up to cover you.
I need ANA guys going in first.
Trey!
You take those first two guys with you.
Copy?
Oorah!
You two, up!
Up!
Get the fuck up!
Move in.
Come on!
Let's go!
Clear.
Put that gun up, now.
We're getting ready to move now.
Come on!
Come on.
Fucking move!
Come on!
Zah, zah, zah, you fuck!
Oh, you fat piece of shit!
Fucking move!
Move!
Move!
To the right!
- Clear!
- All right!
All clear!
Okay.
Farrenberg, let's go!
Move.
Go in.
All right.
Listen up.
We're gonna get on the roof of this place, figure out what we're looking at.
Cutter, Cole, you're coming with me.
The rest of you guys stay put.
Copy?
Copy.
Comin' up!
We got movement, twelve o'clock.
About 300 meters, two guys on the roof.
- Are they armed?
- I don't know.
It's a simple fucking question, Trey.
Do you see a weapon?
No.
That's not what you asked.
You asked if they were armed.
The answer to that one is, I don't fucking know.
Obviously they're armed, Ortega.
Why else would they be running around up there?
I don't fucking know, do I?
I don't understand these fucking people.
All I know is we need to see weapons.
Ah!
- Are you hit?
Are you hit?
- Fuck!
- I'm fucking hit!
- Where are you hit?
On my fucking eyes.
- Can you open 'em?
- What the fuck is going on?
Is he hit?
We're good.
We're good.
Trey's just got shit in his eyes.
Hey, yo, guys!
- Cutter, get the fuck over here!
- Fuck!
It's just water.
It's just water.
Give us...
Give me the 203.
Give me the 203.
- Trey, stay still!
- Give me your fucking gun!
Ortega!
What's going on up there?
What the fuck's going on up there, guys?
Cover!
Fuck.
Fucking short, man!
Fuck.
- Again!
- Zah!
- Short!
- I know.
One more!
Fuck, yeah!
Good job, Cole.
Nice shooting, boys.
- Farrenberg, you hit?
- Nah.
- Are you hit?
- No.
I'm good.
Fuck.
- Fuck this shit!
- Cole, where the fuck are you going?
- Dude, where the fuck are you going?
- Fuck off!
- Corporal, what's happening?
- Wait, where the fuck are you going, man?
- Shut the fuck up!
- Wait, Cole!
Cole!
- Cole!
Get back here, Cole!
- Cole!
Cole, what the fuck, man?
Where you going?
Where the fuck are you going, man?
- Fuck, Cole!
- Come back, Cole!
Cole!
They're crawling.
They're in the middle of an IED belt.
And first and second platoons, they're pinned down, and second is close to requesting QRF.
Tell me something good, Cory.
I'm trying.
This info ain't meeting me halfway.
I wanna hear something good, God damn it.
I don't want the word "clusterfuck" featuring anywhere in tomorrow's news.
Don't worry about the headlines, buddy.
We got civilian casualties.
We got civilian casualties southeast corner of town, third platoon.
It's those boys from Sasquatch.
Cutter, find out who these fucking guys are.
If they're gonna stand there, I wanna know who they are.
How?
Get one of the ANA to talk to 'em.
Them motherfuckers speak Pashto.
The ANA don't speak Pashto.
I don't know.
Figure it out.
The fuck...
Cutter's fucking shit up outside.
- All right.
What's the deal here?
- He's saying he didn't know the bad guys.
They just commandeered his house, and there was nothing he could do about it.
Well, that's fucking bullshit.
We did leaflet drops and shit.
He shouldn't still be here.
Why are you still here?
What's your reason for being here?
He says that he has nowhere to go.
He has no wife.
He is worried about leaving his goats.
He says that he's telling the truth.
You can search his house.
You will find no weapons.
Wait.
Farrenberg?
Farrenberg!
- Yeah, I'm here!
- Come here!
We're gonna give this guy some money, all right?
- You fucking serious?
- Yeah, I am serious.
Give me the fucking...
Open the fucking bag.
- What are those, 2.5?
- Yeah.
Okay, give me one of those.
My name is General Glen McMahon.
On behalf of the coalition forces,
I wanna apologize to you for the loss you've suffered here today.
I know the money that Sergeant Ortega gave you can't bring back your family.
But hopefully it can help you to rebuild, because rebuilding is what we're all about.
And providing you with the security you need to live a long and prosperous life.
Roads and schools and then jobs, so... you can raise your families, and jobs so you can put food on the table.
The Taliban aren't gonna provide you jobs.
The Taliban aren't here to help you.
Only we can help you.
We have a saying in America...
"You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs."
I understand that sometimes it can be hard to see the helping hand, what with all the guns and the strange guys and the mess and what have you.
But I assure you, this is the hand of helping.
This is the helping hand.
Yeah.
He says that he likes roads and schools, but when you leave, it will all mean nothing and they will be left in a big mess.
And every day that you spend here longer, the worse it will be for them when you leave.
So please, leave now.
Please.
I understand your concerns.
I really do.
That's...
That's why we're doing everything we can to bring peace, and to train up your own Afghan forces.
So that they can maintain your security, uh... well into the future.
Please, leave now.
Dragonfly, this is Spartan Two.
Think we're ready to roll.
Give 'em hell, boys!
Kill those motherfuckers!
Eat 'em alive!
Jesus Christ, Willy.
What time is it?
It's me, boss.
Um... sorry to wake you.
We have a problem.
That Rolling Stone article came out, and it's not good.
Sir, it says we're shit-talking our president.
And our vice president.
That we don't have the support of our coalition partners.
And that we're drunk all over Europe.
Basically, a fucking drinking tour.
All over Europe.
I mean, I don't even know what the legals on a thing like this are, you know?
Nothing he says in there is actually untrue.
I'll get the editor on the phone as soon as it's morning there and see if there's anything they can do.
I'm not sure what that's gonna be, though.
Bottom line, this is gonna play bad, all right?
It's gonna play really fucking bad.
So we are in damage control now.
Guys, guys...
Is this really that bad?
I mean, yeah, it's colorful, sure.
But... this is Rolling Stone, okay?
It's hip.
And you guys...
You guys are the operators.
You know, you're out there, you're getting shit done in, like, a totally non-square way.
Yes, Little, you fucking idiot, it's that bad.
This was always a terrible idea.
Why you would unnecessarily court attention like this is...
- Simon, can you shut the fuck up?
- I will not shut up!
This is your mess.
You created it.
You invited this... this Cullen fellow in, you didn't properly consult me!
What?
I didn't properly consult you?
Are you fucking kidding me?
We had a conversation.
- Give me his phone number.
- What?
Whose phone number?
This fucking Cullen fuck.
Give me his fucking phone number!
- I'm not gonna give you his phone number.
- Why the fuck not?
Because you're acting crazy!
You're acting like a fucking lunatic right now!
You think this is crazy, huh?
- You think this is me being crazy?
- Peter!
Calm down!
You fucking calm down!
Duckman!
I'm gonna beat you down unless you chill out.
Oh, I'd like to see you try, old man.
Fucking come on!
Settle down, fellas.
I do believe I'm finished.
So... do me a favor, and... be lovely to one another.
- Sir.
- Yes, sir.
Dick.
Glen.
The president wants to see you in DC.
You need to be on a plane this afternoon.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Andy.
Badi.
Okay.
Let's go, Willy.
Fall out.
- Do you need anything, boss?
- Uh, no.
Thank you, Willy.
Are you... are you sure you don't need me to come with you?
I'm fine, Willy.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
And so Glen finally got his face time with the president.
Getting fired probably wasn't the kind of face time he was after, but, well,
I guess you could say it was kind of a page in the history books.
That was pretty exciting for me.
But, sadly, while I would've liked to have thought that my story had made a difference, it didn't.
It just became another celebrity-fall-from-grace story.
It would've been nice if the conversation after had been about the failure of counterinsurgency, or why we seem so desperate to be at war all the time, or how maybe what we're doing is just making more enemies
all in the name of keeping America safe.
It might've been nice if it had caused someone important to ask what any of this says about us.
But really, the only question anyone seemed to want to ask was,
"What the fuck was Glen McMahon doing talking to a Rolling Stone reporter anyway?"
Which, admittedly, is a good question.
Anyway, in the absence of any real soul searching, what do we do?
Well, obviously, we sack Glen and we bring in some other guy.
And that other guy... was Bob.
[Sean] Ah, America.
You beacon of composure and proportionate response.
You bringer of calm and goodness to the world.
What do you do when the war you're fighting just can't possibly be won in any meaningful sense?
Well, obviously, you sack the guy not winning it, and you bring in some other guy.
In 2009, that war was Afghanistan.
- [intercom buzzing] - [woman speaking indistinctly on PA]
[Sean] And that other guy... was Glen.
You boys ready?
Let's go win this thing.
[Sean] Okay.
So this is what I learned about four-star General Glen McMahon.
He was born to a military family at Fort Leavenworth.
Graduated West Point in 1976.
Ranger school in '79.
He had a graduate degree in political affairs and military history from Yale.
He was both a straight-A student and a troublemaker.
He once famously attempted to stick a lit cherry bomb up his sleeping drill sergeant's ass.
He was loved by the men and women who served under him.
Three, two, one, let's go.
[Sean] Never afraid to get his hands dirty.
- Yeah, it's flash time.
- [men chuckling]
[Sean] Never willing to send his troops anywhere he wouldn't go himself.
He was known variously as the Lion King, the G-Man, Big Glen and, most commonly, the Glenimal.
He was like a throwback to another era.
His hand was bent into a permanent claw, like it was still clutching a World War II cigar his modern, fitness-fanatic self wouldn't allow him to smoke.
After a successful stint running the secretive special operations killing machine in Iraq,
Glen was appointed leader of US and coalition forces in Afghanistan.
A war which, as he saw it, wasn't being won 'cause it wasn't being led.
General.
We're all very excited to have you here.
It's an honor to meet you.
I'm excited to be here.
Ain't that right, Greg?
Yes, indeed, sir.
You're very excited.
[Sean] Somehow, while he was in Iraq,
Glen found time to author a book on leadership, entitled One Leg at a Time, Just Like Everybody Else.
In it, he wrote, "Men are imperfect creatures.
Left to their own devices, all they really want to do is play with their dicks and eat chicken."
[officer] For all his many achievements leading special operations in Iraq,
I think most of us here will know General McMahon as the man who took out Al-Zarwaqi, who kicked Al-Qaeda in the sack.
- [man whooping]
- You're welcome.
[officer] We have a warrior at the helm, and it's a pleasure to have you, sir.
[men cheering]
[Sean] Glen was known as a humble man.
But humble in that way that says, "My humility makes me better than you."
He was famous for his Spartan regime of routine and discipline.
He ate one meal a day.
He slept four hours per night.
He ran seven miles every morning.
In Iraq, he transformed special operations with what he called systemic negation of repetitive procedural practice.
Or, to the acronym-obsessed military, SNORPP.
[Cory] We got Italy in there.
That's the Dutch.
We got Poland, Macedonia, Ukraine.
We got Australia over there, Croatia, Belgium...
Okay, that'll do.
Bite-size chunks, hmm?
Let's knock this on the head.
All right.
[Sean] Basically, he was a master of systems organization.
- [speaking Italian]
- Which he'd kind of need to be, if he was to corral this 43-nation coalition of the willing.
- [in English] May I help you?
- No, finish your phone call.
The war can wait.
[continues speaking Italian]
[in English] What can I do for you, General?
I want to pull everyone out of their offices.
I want to open this place up.
I came in here to speak with you about that.
I have only ten men to lead here in Afghanistan, huh.
So it make no sense for me to be sit out there with everybody else.
I get it.
All right?
But everybody has a reason not to be out there with everybody else.
Austria only has two guys here.
Iceland has seven guys.
This country won't fight at night.
That country won't fight in the snow.
This country wants to do counter-narcotics.
That country won't do counter-narcotics.
But if we're in the same room...
[Sean] Cory Staggart was Glen's executive officer.
Ran the general's affairs.
He was a Ranger.
Although how he made it through Ranger school, I have no idea.
That's great.
Thank you, guys.
That's all the time we got.
Let's go.
Come on.
Greg Pulver.
General Greg Pulver graduated West Point in the same class as Glen.
Oh, that's interesting.
Does he have security clearance?
[Sean] And hadn't left his side since.
Then fucking let him in just like you would any other fucking person with a fucking security clearance!
[Sean] His official title was director of intelligence, but all I saw was a guy with anger management issues whose life had no meaning without Glen.
Andy Moon was Glen's tech whiz, providing the general with all forms of IT support.
Andy.
- Yes, sir?
- Which Glen needed often.
- How are you?
- Pretty good, sir.
How are you doing?
Uh, swell.
Can you come with me a moment?
- My electric razor is...
- Oh, yes, sir.
...yeah, broken.
Pete Duckman was a Navy SEAL.
Like Pulver, his job title had the word "intelligence" in it.
- What's going on?
- Boss is visiting with President Karzai.
Cool.
Why so fancy?
He's a world leader.
Cool.
Am I coming?
Yes, you are.
It's your job.
God damn it, Pete.
Why are you fat?
- I'm not fat.
- [Sean] I still, to this day, don't know exactly what it was that Duckman did for the general.
[stammering] It's a mixture of cross-pollinational collation...
[Sean] Admiral Simon Ball was Glen's public affairs officer.
- Co-operational, uh, cooperative...
- For three and a half years, he'd been trying to explain SNORPP to the Washington press gallery.
[Simon] ...with a centralized command centralization structure, and, um... things like that.
Matt Little was Glen's new civilian PR consultant.
Oh, I don't know.
Is this a good hand?
- He was a DC marketing hotshot...
- Straight flush.
Hello?
...and sometime lobbyist who had thought the war in Afghanistan to be entirely pointless.
Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm not going there.
Until he was offered a lot of money to sell it.
How much?
[Sean] And Willy Dunne.
- Right this way, boss.
Yeah.
- Willy was Glen's body man.
Put your things in here.
I'll let you spread them out how you like.
Why is this my room?
This was General Whelan's room.
It's got, uh, a great bathroom here.
[Sean] Willy laundered Glen's clothes.
He did Glen's ironing.
Yeah.
Uh, boss?
He polished Glen's shoes.
He always seemed like he was about to collapse from the weight of one too many of Glen's bags.
- [Glen] Willy!
- Yes, boss?
- Put my stuff in this room.
- Okay.
[Glen] Here to fight a goddamn war, not watch goddamn television.
[Sean] Willy was the first person that Glen saw every morning and the last person he saw every night.
Glen loved these men... and they loved him right back.
[Glen] I don't know how it looks to you, Cory, but it seems to me, everybody's forgotten we're fighting a war here.
We got the goddamn Pizza Kings and Burger Huts.
The entire base is rolling with Eurosexuals who are so drunk they can't even stand up.
[Pete] General McMahon here to see Ambassador MacKinnon.
- Glen.
- Pat.
Great to see you.
You know Dick Waddle, of course.
- Dick.
- Glen.
Ray Canucci.
- Ray.
- Glen.
Grab a seat, boys.
I'm calling myself Richard now, Pat, if you don't mind.
Oh?
Okay, fine.
Uh...
- That's fair.
My apologies.
- Hmm.
- Have you settled in, Glen?
- No, Pat, I haven't.
Seems to me that too much settling in might somehow be at the heart of the problem we have here.
Small talk.
- Should've gone with the weather.
- [chuckles] [both laughing]
Glen, the president wants you to get the lay of the land here.
This war's been running eight years now.
President Obama, as you know, is drawing down troops in Iraq to refocus our attention on Afghanistan.
Henry Whelan was a good man, he meant well, but he just wasn't getting the job done.
Now, given your reputation and your formidable drive, our hope is that you're the man who will get the job done.
First things first.
We want you to make an assessment of the situation here.
Travel the country, talk to people.
At the end of that assessment, you'll tell us what needs to be done, how you're gonna get it done and what you need in order to get it done.
- So, now...
- To that end...
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, you go.
- I thought you were finished.
- You go.
- You sure?
- You go.
- I thought you were finished.
- No.
To that end... [chuckles]
Uh, now is probably a good time to share with you where the president hopes that assessment might land.
Obviously, the endgame here is to just finish this thing.
So, how do we do that?
- Is it by reducing our footprint here?
- [Sean] The civilian executive.
These were guys who, in Glen's eyes, hadn't earned their power the way he had, through hard work and discipline.
I don't know.
But whatever it is, we want you to bring it on home, Glen.
But, [chuckles] whatever you do, please do not ask the president for more troops.
[coughs]
No more troops, Glen.
[Sean] These were men who'd acquired their power through charm and seduction, and who seemed to serve no purpose other than to stand in the way of his greatness.
God, it's so fucking hot!
[grunts] Fuck!
Another fucking assessment.
How many assessments do they need?
Just one fucking assessment after another.
They all point the same direction.
Bring General Glen McMahon in here and do whatever the fuck he says!
Oh...
Settle down, Greg.
They just wanna feel involved, is all.
[Sean] Wars aren't fought by nations or by armies.
Wars are fought by men.
There are two types of general in the American military.
There are those who believe they can win in the face of all evidence to the contrary.
And there are those who know they can't.
Unfortunately for the world, it's the believers who climb to the top of the ladder.
It's guys like Glen who get given the keys to the castle.
President Karzai is very much looking forward to meeting you.
I think you will like each other.
There is no need to be nervous.
[muezzin calling to prayer]
I'm not nervous.
Fuck!
Fuck it.
- Ah!
General, excuse me.
- Ah.
We are trying to make this Blu-ray player work.
- Uh, do you know how they function?
- Uh...
Normally, you have those wires with the red, the yellow and the white plug.
But, uh, this machine seems only to have this wire.
I can't find where to plug it into the television.
I'm sorry, Mr. President.
I'm afraid I don't know a whole lot about technology.
I'm sure I could have somebody come by and take a look at it for you.
Fuck it.
Never mind.
I think I need a new television.
I'm sorry, General.
Please, let's sit.
Welcome.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Please call me Hamid.
[sneezes] Excuse me.
Please.
Your predecessor, General Whelan, I liked him.
I'm not entirely certain he liked me.
He didn't visit very often.
Why was he dismissed?
It seems, uh, one minute he was here... the next minute, not here.
Ah.
Well, Mr. President,
I think our government simply felt it was... time our effort took a new direction.
- And, uh, what is this new direction?
- Ah!
It is most important to me that we build Afghanistan.
Together, we build Afghanistan into a free and prosperous nation.
Free from fear and conflict.
- I see.
I see.
- Yeah.
Sounds a lot like the old direction.
No.
But perhaps you yourself are the new direction.
New strong personality.
New energy.
New commitment.
[grunts softly]
Well, General, I wish you the best of luck.
Sir, uh... my team and I are about to embark on a, uh... a tour of the country
- so that we may make an assessment...
- [clattering] ...to precisely understand what is required of us here.
It would be an honor if you would consider joining me on the tour, so that our project might be a unified endeavor.
Hmm.
- A sharing of our purpose...
- [coughing]
Of our shared purpose.
Thank you for the invitation, General.
Hmm.
- It's very generous.
- Hmm.
- But... [coughing] - [clears throat]
I've seen the country.
[Sean] To get inside the mind of Glen McMahon, you really need first to get a handle on the madness of modern American war.
Lieutenant Colonel Frank Groom.
Welcome to Kandahar, sir.
Nice to meet you, Frank.
I'm here to get the lay of the land.
[narrator] Counterinsurgency.
[Sean] In the good old days, wars were fought against conventional armies from nation states.
Guys in uniforms, like Nazis and stuff.
When, however, you've just gone and invaded a place that you probably shouldn't have, you end up fighting against just regular people in regular-people clothes.
These guys are what are called insurgents.
Basically, they're just guys who picked up weapons 'cause... so would you, if someone invaded your country.
Funnily enough... insurgencies are next to impossible to defeat.
And so, if you wanna go on pretending you can win, you're really left with no option but to try to convince the country you've invaded that you're actually here to help.
[man speaking Farsi] [in English] He's saying the Americans are urinating in the streets, and, uh, they call us motherfuckers all day.
It's "motherfucker, motherfucker" all the time.
And it's considered in our culture a very bad thing to fuck your own mother.
In ours, too.
Uh... in ours, too.
[Sean] This is counterinsurgency.
It's a popularity contest.
Salaam alaikum.
[Sean] You're trying to convince the people that they're better off with you than they are with the insurgents.
Basically, it works like this.
You install a local government.
You provide security for the people so that that democracy can take root.
[officer] We're training them up, taking them out on maneuvers.
[Sean] You train up the local forces so that they can provide the security for themselves.
I mean, they're sweet kids.
They're good kids.
Good-natured.
Integrational.
You know, they are very integrational as a people.
You know, I mean, they are committed to, uh...
- But, uh...
- Or at least you try to.
I don't know, sir, they're also lazy.
I mean, they really seem like they don't wanna be here.
They steal our shit and, basically, they're on drugs all the time.
I mean, they are fucking high all the time.
Excuse my language, sir.
You do whatever you can to stimulate the local economy.
Heroin is the only thing bringing money in.
Not that I like to think where the money is going to, exactly, but money keeps the people happy, so we're rolling with that.
Can't they grow something else?
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, they could grow cotton.
Cotton would grow here.
- Why don't they grow cotton, then?
- Because the United States Congress will not allow any United States aid and development funds to be directed towards the cultivation of a crop that will end up on the world market in competition with US farmers.
Oh.
- Which pretty much rules out cotton.
- Sure.
- So we're growing heroin instead.
- Right.
I think we're doing a pretty good job here, sir.
[Sean] You build infrastructure.
Roads, schools, stuff like that.
What kind of presence does the Taliban have here?
- Who?
- The Taliban.
In short, you get off your bases and you go make friends with the people.
[groans]
Killing insurgents all the while, of course.
Nation building.
Hearts and minds.
Hello!
Hello, all.
[Frank] Let me break it down this way, General.
We've been in Helmand province for five years now, and in all that time, all we've really managed to secure is this base.
Now, you go out there, you go into Marjah, you go into Lashkar Gah, it's all Pashtun, as you know.
This is the Taliban.
We're not winning any hearts and minds there, I can tell you that.
I'm not sure we ever will.
Kandahar's the same, of course.
Can I be completely frank with you, sir?
If I was you, I'd cut Helmand loose.
I'd concentrate on those parts of the country that are at least, in some way, sympathetic to the mission, and I'd cut it loose.
It's a lost cause.
This whole province constitutes just 4% of the population of the country.
It's strategically meaningless.
I'd cut Helmand loose, sir.
[Sean] The thing about counterinsurgency is that it doesn't really work.
We tried it in Vietnam.
That went well.
The British and the French gave it a shot, trying to hang on to their crumbling empires.
It just hasn't worked.
To me, it would seem kind of simple why.
You can't win the trust of a country by invading it.
You can't build a nation at gunpoint.
For guys like Glen, however, counterinsurgency hasn't worked for one simple reason.
You ready, boss?
Nobody's ever done it right.
Yes, I am, Pete.
I sure as hell am.
- Andy?
- [Andy] Yes, sir.
- Good job.
- [Andy] Thank you.
Let's lose Fox News.
Won't do us any good to have a bunch of angry perverts yelling at us all day.
- [Andy] Yes, sir.
- [Greg] So... we probably need to get to work on this assessment.
- Already written it.
- When?
It's already written.
Did it last night.
Needs a little flesh on the bone, but, basically, it's written.
All right, what's it say?
Greg...
I wanna take Helmand province.
I wanna take Helmand province precisely because everyone else seems to think we can't have it.
If we're gonna win the trust of this country, we can't be seen to accept that there's a whole chunk of it we can't handle.
We're here to provide security.
I say the first order of business is we secure that corner of the country everyone else seems to think we can't control.
[Greg] Okay.
I didn't come here to manage this war, and I sure as shit didn't come here to close it out.
Came here to win.
I'm taking Helmand...
then I'm taking Kandahar.
What do you say to that?
All right, and another thing.
Being that this is a nation-building exercise and all, seems to me it'd behoove us to have someone in the room who's actually from the nation we're building.
Don't you think?
Copy.
We are here to build, to protect.
We are not here to harass, to intimidate.
We're not here to shoot first and ask questions later.
We must not be driven by fear and suspicion.
We are here, above all else... to support the civilian population.
And to that end, we must avoid killing it at all cost.
Civilian casualties cannot be seen as an unfortunate byproduct of conflict.
They must be treated as errors of the greatest consequence.
This is the war we are fighting.
It's a complex war, but it's a war nonetheless.
Let me reaffirmate that right from the get-go.
This is a war.
But it's a war that cannot be won by the virtues of our unassailable military might and power alone.
This war will be won primarily with the unassailable might and power of our ideals.
Yeah.
Yeah.
- [Dick] Forty thousand?
- I'm afraid so.
God damn it.
What did we tell you?
No more troops.
Don't ask for more troops.
What do you do?
You ask for 40,000 more troops.
Well, Dick, Helmand province ain't exactly about to secure itself.
Probably should've asked for a lot more.
I just thought 40,000 sounded like a reasonable number.
There's no reasonable number, Glen, except perhaps zero.
That's a reasonable number.
Zero.
I thought you understood that.
Yeah, this "no more troops" thing, is that coming from the president, or coming from you?
- Of course it's coming from the president.
- Ah.
Why would it be coming from me?
Why do I care if we send more troops over there or we don't?
I don't know, Dick.
I'm just trying to work this thing out.
The president gave me a job to do.
- This is what I need to get it done.
- God damn it.
I'll be there day after tomorrow with the secretary of state.
We'll figure this nonsense out then.
- Roger that.
- God damn it.
- God damn it.
- [computer beeps]
- [grunts] - [Greg] There it is.
What did I tell you?
He's on retired-general time.
His mind's on a golf cart somewhere, halfway down the fairway.
He doesn't have the constitution for the hard stuff anymore.
He's obviously in the wrong fucking job!
That thing's off, right?
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, General, but we're gonna sit on your report until after the Afghan elections.
With all due respect, Madam Secretary, uh, the election is a month away.
I know it is, but, as I'm sure you know, an election here is a fragile thing.
It's a very delicate thing, and nobody wants its smooth running to be muddied by a big new American offensive.
No, I told you no more troops, Glen.
Now we're gonna have to rethink the game plan.
Well, Dick, with all due respect, you told me you didn't care if I got more troops or I didn't, so I'm trying to work out how to get the job done.
No, I did not say I didn't care.
- I believe you did.
- I did not say that.
- I believe you did.
- No.
No, I didn't.
I...
- You did, Dick.
- Whoever said what, a troop surge and an election don't sit well together, so this is the way it's gotta be.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing in the meantime.
I have a strategy.
I'm ready to execute.
The suggestion now seems to be that I thumb twiddle.
Uh, with all due respect, Madam Secretary...
General, please spare me the "all due respect" stuff.
It's really giving me the fucking creeps.
[Dick groans]
I think...
I think we all understand your frustration, Glen, but these elections have to run smoothly.
We need a legitimate partner in power here.
You need a legitimate partner here.
So... we just have to sit tight.
Why don't you do that SNORPP thing you did in Iraq?
You know, get your systems in place, get everybody talking together.
The time will fly, you know?
Get everybody excited.
You know, you're the best in the business at this stuff.
[man 1 on TV] We've been operating at an extremely high optempo.
In the last week, we've conducted six air assaults into previously denied territories.
[man 2 on TV] Uh, we're also in final coordination with RC South to develop an ops box in the seams existing along the provincial border.
[inaudible]
[helicopter blades whirring] [soldier 1] You got that, uh, Lexus?
[Cory] No.
No, now we got a Prius.
She got the new Prius.
[soldier 1] Sweet.
[Cory] Yeah, my wife, too.
She's got one.
We both have one.
We love it.
My first car was a Taurus.
- My father bought it.
- [soldiers speaking indistinctly]
[soldier 2] What do you got?
Sir.
Where you boys headed?
Back to our patrol base, sir.
Sasquatch.
Where you coming from?
Where are we from in the States, or where have we just been?
Where have you just been?
- Italy, sir, on R R.
- Ah.
R R in Italy.
- Yes, sir.
- Well...
Attention on deck!
So why the long faces?
You just got back from Italy.
I'm guessing you ate some sensational food, saw some antiquities.
Hmm?
I bet you got yourselves good and drunk and bumped into beautiful girls.
So what's it like out there?
Out where, sir?
- Sasquatch, son.
- Oh, um... it's not good, sir.
You know, I mean, it's whatever.
- It's... it's okay.
- No, it's a fucking shithole, sir.
[Cory] No, I don't know.
We'll see where we land.
Cory, what time's that bird due?
- Uh, in about 20 minutes.
- Cancel it.
Uh, why's that, boss?
I'm going to Sasquatch with those boys there.
General, those boys are heading out to an inhospitable corner of the world.
I'm a goddamn Ranger, Frank.
Those boys, they need me.
[Glen] I've spent the last week or so talking to guys who I would call middle management.
But you boys are at the coal face.
After all the blah, blah, blah, you boys are where it actually happens.
I'd go so far as to say you boys are the only thing that counts.
If it doesn't happen here, it doesn't happen.
End of story.
- [sighs] Yes, son?
- If what doesn't happen, sir?
It, son.
Okay, thank you, sir.
Does anyone here know what "it" is?
Anyone?
Anyone?
To, uh, secure the area, sir.
To protect the people from the enemy so they can go about building their lives.
Okay.
Okay, thank you, Sergeant.
Okay, but I can't tell the difference between the people and the enemy.
They all look alike to me.
I'm pretty sure they're the same people, sir.
I understand it can be tough, son, but that's the job.
I have another question.
Um, I hear now they're giving out medals for heroic restraint.
Do I have that right?
Courageous restraint.
And that is right.
Well, I don't mean to be rude, sir, but I do not understand what the fuck that means.
It means, son, that sometimes when you're dealing with an insurgency, you're not gonna be 100% clear on who the enemy is.
It means you're gonna find yourself in situations where, when you're afraid or whatnot, you're gonna have to make a judgment call.
Because, as Sergeant Ortega here has so rightly pointed out, your mission is to protect the people, not kill them.
We can't help them and kill them at the same time.
It just ain't humanly possible.
Do you understand me?
No, not really, sir.
No.
What part are you struggling to comprehend, son?
I don't know, sir.
It seems to me that we all here with our guns and shit, trying to convince these people that...
deep down we're actually really nice guys.
And I don't know how to do that, sir, when every second one of them or every third one of them or every tenth one of them is trying to fucking kill me, sir.
'Cause I'm a marine. 'Cause we're marines.
And it seem like now they handing out medals for heroically not being a marine, sir.
I'm confused, is what I'm trying to say, sir.
Well, then you're just gonna have to get yourself unconfused, son.
[man speaking Arabic on megaphone]
[Sean] On the day of the Afghan general elections, for which Glen had waited so patiently,
Badi Bassim joined his team.
Cory wouldn't tell me where he found Glen his Afghan mascot.
No, I'm doing your job!
He said he just found him in the phone book.
Put the bag down.
I assume that was a joke.
My name is Captain Badi Bassim.
I'm here to start work with, uh, General McMahon.
- Who?
- McMahon.
- McMahon?
- Yeah.
- Why are you not wearing the uniform?
- Uh, my uniform is in my bag.
It's too dangerous for me to wear it while I am walking here from my home.
Unzip it.
Unzip the bag.
My uniform.
- Why are you walking in here?
- Why I am working here?
Walking!
Walking!
Walking here?
Walking.
I like to walk.
[machine beeps]
- [Glen] Badi!
Come in.
Come in.
- Ah!
[both speaking Arabic] [laughs]
Everyone, this is my new aide-de-camp, Badi Bassim.
He's a soldier and a scholar.
This is the face of the new Afghanistan.
Greg, you know.
That's Cory.
You know Cory.
Pete Duckman.
And, uh... we got people here from Spain and Italy and, uh...
- You know, places like that.
- Okay.
Ah.
[sighs]
- Have you voted?
- I wanted to report to you first.
- You haven't voted?
- No.
Good.
Good.
You can do it right here.
We got a polling booth right here, right around the corner.
Okay.
- Election day.
It's exciting.
- Yeah.
[man speaking Arabic on megaphone]
[Glen] This is important, Badi.
That long line of men, that slow shuffle there, that's the slow shuffle towards freedom.
The steps are small but, by God, their importance...
It's like the moon landing.
Small step, giant leap.
Yeah.
[stutters] Are you familiar with the moon landing, son?
- Yes, sir.
- It's like the goddamn moon landing.
Yes, sir, I agree.
It's very important.
- Yes, it is.
- Yeah.
- [Glen] A what?
- [Ray] We're gonna have another election.
We can't ignore these fraud allegations.
They're coming in from every corner of the country and everything points to a ridiculous Karzai victory.
I mean, the whole thing just smells stupid.
Sure.
Sure, there's gonna be irregularity now and again.
But surely a result is the best possible outcome.
Yeah?
The polling station, the one right there over where you are... 367 registered voters, 1,200 votes counted.
It's a joke.
We're going to a runoff election.
Tell them what you told me!
Uh... [clears throat]
- About what, sir?
- About the elections.
About the whole concept of elections in this country.
[clears throat] Well, I was just observing, sir, that, um, people don't quite understand elections.
They see that the president is alive, everything is okay.
So what's the big problem?
Why are we having an election?
[Glen] Yeah.
And then you have an election anyway, and people vote for whoever the local leaders tell them to vote for.
Yeah.
Because they don't want to have their heads chopped off.
See what I mean?
Thank you... for that.
Uh...
I'm sorry, Glen.
We're going to a runoff election.
[groans] Jesus H...
I got the White House sitting on my report till after these elections get done.
I can't do anything until the president approves my recommendations.
And now you're telling me that's not gonna be until after another goddamn election?
!
You need a legitimate partner here, Glen.
Karzai ain't that guy.
You gotta understand, what we're trying to do here is like raising a child.
And a child needs two parents.
Two parents who love it and each other very much.
That's what it needs, above all else.
Well, then your wife, Mrs. Karzai...
I'm assuming that you're the daddy in this metaphorical relationship...
We suspect your wife, Karzai,
- might be a drug addict.
- [scoffs]
He eliminated his chief opponent in this election by spreading a pretty vicious homosexual rumor, and we're pretty sure that his brother is a straight-up criminal warlord.
Oh, come on, Pat!
You got a bee in your bonnet.
You just don't like him for some reason, whatever it is.
And seriously...
Anyway, I wanna know, how is Washington any different, huh?
Seriously!
Tell me!
Hmm?
Yeah.
You can't.
[Sean] On page 74 of One Leg at a Time, Just Like Everybody Else,
Glen wrote, and I quote,
"A good leader lives by a set of rules.
A great leader knows when to break them."
Morning.
- Morning, all.
- [all] Sir.
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.
Morning, boys.
- Morning, sir.
- Boss.
Morning, Matt.
You're up early.
Uh, yes, sir.
We've got a problem.
Somebody leaked your report.
The Washington Post has a copy.
No.
- Somebody gave it to Bob Woodward.
- Woodward?
No.
Oh, my God almighty.
You find the source?
Sir, the source?
Uh, this is terrible.
Goddamn terrible news.
Do you hear that?
Someone leaked the assessment.
- Oh, terrible.
- Terrible.
Shocking.
- Shocking.
- Shocking.
- Terrible.
- Shocking.
Yeah, well... [grunts]
I don't think it really matters who leaked the assessment.
Question is, what are we gonna do about it?
I wanna do the 60 Minutes interview.
Sir, as your senior PAO, I must counsel strongly against it.
It would be foolhardy.
[stammers] I really don't think now's the time to court media attention.
At the very moment, allegations are being made
- that you leaked this report yourself.
- I'm choosing to embrace the leak, Simon.
I don't seem to be getting any traction.
Do you know what I'm saying?
Traction?
We got ourselves a president who appears not to be aware of the fact that the United States is at war right now, and he's that war's commander in chief.
- I gotta get me some traction.
- [Matt] You need cut through.
Exactly.
Cut through.
You need to get me some goddamn cut through.
I can handle that for you, sir.
Sorry.
No offense, Simon, how exactly are you gonna do that?
I'll quieten this whole situation down.
Again, I'm sorry, I don't wanna start a fight here.
And please forgive me for speaking for you, sir.
But the general didn't hire me to make things quiet, okay?
Look, you're so good at your job, but that job is basically writing press releases.
Here's the thing about press releases.
Nobody reads 'em, okay?
[chuckling] They're boring.
And they're bullshit.
And everyone knows they're bullshit.
Correct me if I'm wrong, you hired me to make some noise.
You know, the right kind of noise.
Our... noise.
[Glen] Pete.
- Boss.
- Move those vehicles to the right.
I wanna make sure the M-ATVs are clearly visible in the background.
Copy that.
They're...
They're completely blocking them.
- This one?
- Both of them.
Just get 'em out of there.
Get 'em out of there!
Hey.
How're we doing over here?
Good?
- Great.
- You good?
Good.
Okay.
- Yeah, I think we're getting close.
- Oh, that's exciting.
I don't wanna interrupt.
I mean, I know you have your own world of questions to ask in there.
You might wanna think about asking the general... how much face time he's had with the president since taking over the position.
Okay.
Yeah.
You know, if you run out of stuff to talk about or whatever.
You're welcome.
Yes, the leak was unfortunate.
There's no denying it.
It's unfortunate.
One would always choose to mull these things over in the... the sensible calm of the proper quiet places.
But this war is tough.
War is tough.
And...
And the president has tough decisions to make.
How many times have you spoken to the president since you've been here?
Since I've been here in Afghanistan, leading ISAF?
Yes.
Uh...
Once.
I've spoken to the president once.
By video teleconference.
You've spoken to the president once in, what, 70 days?
That's right.
You're the leader of US forces in Afghanistan, and you have spoken to the president once in 70 days?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Why is that?
Uh...
I don't know.
Uh...
I'm guessing he's... very busy.
Probably.
[clock ticking]
[Dick] What the fuck's the matter with you, Glen?
Are you out of your mind?
One second we're dealing with this so-called fucking leak, the next you're on the fucking television backing the president into the most ham-fisted corner I've ever seen.
I honestly believe you've made it your sole mission to fuck me.
Well, Dick, I answered the questions that were asked of me.
- I thought I was being fair.
- It's not a question of fair, Glen.
It's a question of what the fuck were you doing on the television?
- Why am I seeing you on the television?
- Oh.
Now we gotta fix this.
We gotta find a way of taking the heat out of this thing.
Now you've gone and lit a fucking fire under it!
Do you understand?
- Yeah, I see.
- Here's where we're gonna start.
You're gonna get on the phone to Bob Gates and...
Hang on, Dick.
You're cutting out.
I can't hear you.
Can you hear me?
Yeah, I can hear you.
And please stop calling me Dick!
Shit.
Something's wrong.
I can't hear a word you're saying.
Let me, uh...
let me try this.
- Can you hear me now?
- Yeah, I can hear you.
Okay, something's wrong here.
Hold on a minute, Dick.
- Oh, God.
- Andy, get your ass in here!
- Yes, sir.
- Got a problem.
- I can't hear a word Dick's saying.
- Uh-huh.
He can hear me, but I can't hear him.
- All right, can you hear us now?
- Yeah, I can hear you.
- What about now, Mr. Dick, sir?
- Yeah, I can hear you!
I'm...
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, Dick.
- Oh, gosh!
Can't hear a word you're saying.
Andy's gonna have to work on this, and pronto!
- Yes, sir.
- This is goddamn unacceptable.
- No, no, we need to talk.
- [Glen groans]
I'll talk to you later, Dick.
We need to finish...
We need to finish this thing.
- [computer beeps] - [laughs]
Well done.
- Thank you, sir.
- Well done.
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.
[crowd applauding]
[Obama] Thank you.
I wanna speak to you tonight about our effort in Afghanistan.
It's an extraordinary honor for me to do so here at West Point, where so many men and women have prepared to stand up for our security and to represent what is finest about our country.
As your commander in chief,
I owe you a mission that is clearly defined...
- Yes, you do.
- ...and worthy of your service.
And that's why I insisted on a thorough review of our strategy.
And as commander in chief, I have determined that
- it is in our vital national interest...
- Mmm-hmm.
...to send an additional 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan.
After 18 months, our troops will begin to come home.
I do not make this decision lightly.
We have been at war now for eight years, at enormous cost in lives and resources.
- [Glen breathing heavily]
- Years of debate over Iraq and terrorism have left our unity on national security issues in tatters.
And having just experienced the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the American people are understandably focused on rebuilding our economy and putting people to work here at home.
[continues breathing heavily]
[Greg] Sir.
You got your troops.
Buddy here just announced to the whole of Afghanistan that we are about to abandon it!
That's like telling the bad guys all they gotta do
- is wait out the next 18 months...
- Yeah.
...and then we'll be gone!
And so he just told an auditorium full of young American soldiers the war they've been asked to fight these last eight years has been nothing more than one great monumental waste of everybody's time.
That was a clusterfuckingly stupid fucking speech!
Thank you, Greg.
Well, you heard him.
He's not giving us the full 40,000.
They're giving us 30.
I just got off the phone with the SecDef.
We gotta get the rest from our coalition partners.
Looks like we're going to Europe, boys.
So, uh, pack your, uh...
Oh, I don't know, fuck it!
Pack whatever it is they wear in Europe.
- Speedos and shit!
Willy.
- Hmm.
[siren whoops]
[Sean] The world stage.
It's always seemed funny to me how a man can go from looking at a map of,
I don't know, say Helmand province, to finding himself in Europe trying to persuade our friends and allies that his crazy dream is their crazy dream, too.
- [Glen grunts]
- Bonjour, General.
[sighs] Thank you.
- [guard] Bonjour, monsieur.
- Hello.
[Cory] Okay, so tomorrow afternoon, you have the presentation to I'École Militaire.
Uh...
Tomorrow night, dinner with the minister of defense.
That is a gala dinner, by the way.
Just a heads-up so you can prepare yourself mentally.
It's a big one.
Meetings the next day.
Then we got the night free.
- And then to Berlin.
- [Glen] Yeah.
Here we go.
Obama is in Copenhagen tonight.
They wanna know if you can spare time for a meeting on Air Force One tomorrow morning.
- The president wants some face time.
- [Greg chuckles]
Now he wants fucking face time.
Fucking dick.
So can you do that, boss?
Then we can jet across to Copenhagen at zero six.
The president's gonna be on the tarmac at 8:30.
Well, you're the keeper of my schedule, Cory.
You tell me if I can do it.
Uh, okay, yeah, we can have you back in Paris early afternoon, depending on how much time you two need.
And I can shift your morning meetings.
See that out there?
I'm calling that dusk.
That's close of fucking business.
Boss, you good with this?
Sure, Pete.
We're not in theater.
You boys earned it.
Sir, have you had a chance to say hello to your wife yet?
You know, she checked in this morning.
I think she's waiting for you in your room.
Shit.
Right, I should do that.
- What room am I in again?
- [all speaking]
- 517.
- What?
- Five-seven-one.
- Five-one-seven.
- Stop.
Go.
- Five-one-seven.
Five-one-seven.
- [knocking on door] - [clears throat]
- Hi, boss.
- Hey, Willy.
[sighs]
- Hi.
Hi, honey.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Huh.
I'm sorry, I've been delayed.
The president is wanting time with me tomorrow, and we've been trying to ascertain whether... whether or not we can accommodate this request.
- I'm gonna leave you two be.
I'll be...
- [clears throat]
- I'll be right next door.
- Okay, thank you, Willy.
[sighs]
[sighs] Well, we're in Paris.
Yeah...
Hopefully we'll get to see some sights.
Yeah, I'll have, uh, Cory, uh, schedule some time.
- Yeah.
- Okay, but you do what you gotta do, because I am here for you.
- Oh, yeah?
- Uh-huh.
- How's Tim?
- Oh, he's good.
He's good.
- He sends his love.
- Okay.
Um...
He's...
He's got a new girlfriend now.
- Ooh!
- Yeah, I like her.
Yeah, her daddy's an ILE instructor over at Leavenworth.
- Huh.
- Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, she's sweet.
You'll like her.
Hmm.
Well...
Well, I...
I think it's just great you're getting to see the president, honey.
You must be very excited, huh?
[Pat] Hey, Glen.
Hope you don't mind me hitching a ride.
I'm on my own dash to see the president.
They told me you were heading over there this morning.
No problem, Pat.
My plane is your plane.
- Knock yourself out.
- Thanks, Glen.
So my hope is, depending on how long your meeting goes with the president, we can have you back in Paris NLT 1400, then straight to the École Militaire for 1500.
My uniform will be crushed after these flights.
I'll need a shower, a fresh shave.
I'm allowing for four solid hours with the president.
If it's less than that, we should be fine to go via the hotel.
I am just contingency planning for the possibility we may be running tight on time.
- Can we move the École Militaire back?
- Not really.
Gonna be a lot of people there.
We have the gala dinner right after.
We don't have any wiggle room here.
[Greg] You should wear the fatigues to the thing this afternoon.
The general, direct from the battlefield.
No need to shower when you're straight from the fight.
- That's good.
- Yeah.
- It's very good.
- [Matt] I like that.
Well, just make sure Willy has my fatigues on standby.
[Glen grunts]
Talking points for the president.
[Glen grunts]
How you doing, Glen?
Oh!
[sighs]
This one is a bitch, right?
Nothing about war is easy, Pat.
Right on.
Though I'm guessing, somewhere deep down, you were happier in Iraq.
A soldier leading soldiers.
Soldiers above you, soldiers below you.
Just a nice bubble of soldiers.
Just ordered.
Right?
'Cause it has to be.
War is chaos, so then the army has to be the opposite of chaos.
But now you find yourself in the real world.
Now you're dealing with civilians, and civilians don't make sense.
Not making sense is a luxury I can't afford.
Hmm.
Lives depend on it.
- No, of course.
- Yeah.
Absolutely.
And you can't live in the bubble forever.
You gotta rise as your talents dictate.
What do you want, Pat?
How do you think this ends?
Simple.
We either win it or we lose it.
Yeah, I don't know.
I think I'm gonna call bullshit on that, Glen.
All the winning we were ever gonna do, we did in the first six months.
And since then, we've just been making a mess.
And that's all it was ever gonna be.
You're not here to win.
You're here to clean up the mess.
You'll get your 40,000 troops.
Get 'em in there.
Get your PowerPoint presentation in order, you know?
Just move the needle a little bit.
Show everyone how all the graphs are pointing in the right direction.
That's all you gotta do.
That's how this ends best for you...
anyway.
A nice-looking set of graphs.
Or a nicer-looking set of graphs than the last set of graphs.
Either that or get yourself fired.
Then you can say "I told you so" when it all turns to shit or fizzles out or...
however it is this thing ends.
There's no street parade at the end of this one.
It's good to talk.
[inaudible]
- [cameras shutters clicking] - [indistinct chatter]
[Obama] Everybody.
How are you?
Morning.
Yeah, it's good to see you again.
[indistinct chatter]
- How you doing?
Good to see you.
Nice tie.
- [man 1] Thank you.
[Obama] All right.
How's it going?
- Morning, sir.
Nice to see you again.
- All right.
Take care now.
[woman] It's good to see you, Mr. President.
[Obama] All right, see you soon.
- Mr. President.
- It's great to see you, General.
I'm sorry, but we're running behind schedule.
I was looking forward to getting some face time with you, but I gotta get this baby in the air.
So... all right.
Smile for the cameras, Glen.
All right.
Take care.
- Pat.
- Mr. President.
- Let's get going.
- [Pat] Yes, sir.
All right, Magnus, talk to you soon.
Okay?
[Sean] You could argue that the main reason certain generals like war so much is... well, because it's only in war that they feel truly relevant.
It's only in war that they feel close to the center of power.
Only in war do they feel the warm glow of other people's attention.
[Matt] Good evening, sir.
The attention of people like me.
Okay, you know what?
You both look beautiful.
[chuckles] Really.
Uh, sir, before you get dragged into the hubbub there,
I want to introduce you to Sean Cullen here.
Sean's the writer from Rolling Stone.
He's been doing that profile piece on you.
He's gonna be tagging along for a couple days.
Thanks for having me, sir.
It's a real privilege.
- Rolling Stone?
- Yes, sir.
Just make sure I'm on the cover.
Well, it's between you and Lady Gaga, sir.
Well, put me in a heart-shaped bathtub with her.
- Rose petals.
Happy to share.
- [both chuckling]
Glen, stop joking. [laughing]
I'm deadly serious, son.
Put me on the cover.
[laughs] [clears throat]
Okay, here we are.
There's the boss.
There's Mrs. Boss.
[Greg] Oh, there's me.
There's you.
Where's me?
I guess you're on a different table.
Better keep looking.
- You serious?
- Hmm.
[clears throat]
- Sorry.
- Yes?
Excuse me.
I think you are sitting in my seat, sir.
Oh.
Oh, hey, there.
I'm sorry.
Pleased to meet you.
[indistinct chatter]
[Glen] Dear.
Thank you.
Hi.
[clears throat]
General.
Tom Howard, sir.
I'm the United States defense attaché here in Paris.
Pleased to meet you.
This is my wife, Jeanie.
Pleased to meet you, Jeanie.
Are you enjoying your time here in Paris?
Oh, yes, very much.
It's lovely.
Isn't it?
Have you managed to see any museums or exhibitions?
- Have you done the Louvre?
- Oh, um,
I...
I think we're gonna be too busy to see the Louvre.
But I've been wandering around by myself while Glen's at meetings, and... oh, my, it's... it's lovely.
General, I thought it went very well at the École Militaire today.
I didn't get the opportunity to introduce myself there.
But, uh, there were some very interesting people there today.
If you'd like, I'd be very happy to give you a rundown of the who's who if you get a little window in your schedule while...
I appreciate that.
My schedule's very tight.
Of course.
Totally understood.
General, I could introduce you to some people here tonight if you'd prefer.
No, I...
I think my team and I have a grip on the who's who.
Thank you.
- Cory, where's Badi?
- Hmm?
Uh, I don't know, boss.
He was here a minute ago.
I thought he was supposed to be sitting beside you and Jeanie.
[clears throat]
General, I thought it best if you and I took this opportunity to talk, so... so I switched places with your colleague over there, I...
Like you said, your schedule's very tight.
What'd you say your name was?
Tom Howard, sir.
What do you think this dinner is for, Tom Howard?
[stammers] General, this dinner is to honor you, sir.
Wrong.
This dinner is for Afghanistan.
We are here tonight because we're at war in Afghanistan.
And you got the goddamn gall to kick the only Afghan in the room
- off my goddamn table?
- I'm sorry...
Let me tell you what I want you to do, Tom Howard.
I want you to go sit your ass down wherever the fuck your ass was officially designated to sit, and I want you to tell Badi to bring his ass back over here!
- [people gasp]
- How's that sound, Tom Howard?
I'm sorry, sir.
Ma'am. [clears throat]
I apologize for my language.
- [Jeanie] Everything's okay, honey.
- [Greg] Uh, boss?
I'm pretty sure the Afghan ambassador here is from Afghanistan.
General.
Sir.
[Cory] Swell.
I don't want for this dinner to be awkward for you, General, so I will tell you now that we intend to give you our portion of the troops that you request.
I don't think the Germans will be so easy.
I think that they are feeling inclined to withdraw altogether.
And, uh, I should add that
I would hate for you to think that France is easy.
This must be a final moment, no?
We cannot stay in Afghanistan forever.
No, we can't.
That's why I'm gonna win it.
Thank you.
[sighs] That was strange.
[laughter echoing]
Writing a biography, is that something...
you might be open to?
Or...
For sure, yeah.
Something I'm absolutely open to...
[Matt] It's such a fascinating subject matter.
No offense, book could kinda write itself.
We may have a problem getting to Berlin tomorrow.
This volcano in Iceland.
It's, uh... canceling all flights because of the ash cloud.
- Dude, we got our own plane.
- Guess this cloud's huge.
Nothing's taking off in Europe.
They're grounding all air traffic.
[Pete] We got tonight free, right?
Then what's the plan?
We're drinking.
Tell me we're fucking drinking.
Today is Jeanie and my's 30th wedding anniversary, so, uh...
I'm taking her to dinner.
Just the two of you?
Yes.
It doesn't matter, honey.
I've had fun.
- Good.
Good.
- Mmm.
We'll come back again when everything's normal and we can do it together.
- Sure.
- Mmm-hmm.
[sighs] We're together.
Yeah.
- This is so special.
- Hmm.
Hmm. [chuckles]
You know, the other day I was, uh, calculating the...
I was working out that we've spent less than 30 days a year together for the last eight years. [chuckles]
- And...
- [clears throat] ...I was just thinking that it's really interesting, the way things happen.
Well, if we hadn't gone to war... if September 11th hadn't happened... if America hadn't been attacked and we hadn't gone to war,
I'd probably be barbecuing something in our backyard right now.
- Mmm.
- But 9/11 did happen, didn't it?
Hmm?
Yes.
Yes, I know.
I know.
I know, and I am...
I'm sorry.
- I didn't say that to make you feel bad.
- Why are you thinking about it?
No, I'm not...
I'm not...
I'm not thinking about it, I promise.
Yes, you are.
You're calculating days.
You just told me, one day you sat yourself down with a calendar and you calculated days.
Yes, I know.
I know.
But I just did that because...
I did it because I was proud of you, honey.
I'm proud of me, too.
You know?
[sighs]
Yeah, I'm proud of me, too.
Do you know?
[sighs]
Oh, honey.
No, honey, look at me.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I know.
Yes, every...
Everything...
Everything's okay.
Yeah.
[sighs]
Obama's not a leader.
He's an orator.
He hammered the whole world on, "Yes, we can.
Yes, we can."
Really, it's "No, we can't."
Yeah.
We can't do Iraq.
He's loud and clear now that we can't do Afghanistan.
We can't do Gitmo.
Where the fuck else we gonna put all these motherfuckers?
- That's a great orator.
Right there.
- Hmm.
He's sold us on, like, a double negative.
Yes, we can not do things.
You know?
Or is that a double negative?
Not really, but I know what you mean.
- Yo, look who it is!
- [all clamoring]
- Hey.
- [men cheering]
- Hi.
- [Cory] Hello, Mrs. Boss.
[pop music playing]
[Cory] Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
[Pete] Boss and Mrs. Boss, down there.
- You, drink!
- No, no.
- [Pete] You, drink!
- [Cory] Down the hatch.
Sir, I just want to say again what a privilege this is.
- You must be really proud.
- Hmm?
- You must be really proud of him.
- Oh, yes, I am.
[Pete] Ow!
- Ah, here we go!
Here we go!
- [officers] Oh, yeah!
- [Cory] Go, Pete!
- [all cheering]
[Andy] Come on!
I got your name all over this.
[Pete] I always loved this asshole!
[indistinct yelling] [cheering and hooting]
- We're not flying to Berlin tomorrow.
- What?
- [Cory] Not flying to Berlin tomorrow.
- What?
They won't give us clearance to fly to Berlin tomorrow.
USA!
Everybody now!
[all chanting] USA!
USA!
This is bullshit.
It's, like, one phone call.
"Hello, they won't let us take off.
Can you fix it?"
[in French accent] "Oh, no, monsieur.
Big volcano.
No take off."
"Well, this is General Glen McMahon we're talking about here."
"Oh, General Glen McMahon.
Oh, I did not know.
Why didn't you say that?
Pardon, monsieur, of course you may take off."
- Done!
How hard is that?
- I've made the calls.
Believe me.
[Greg] Listen, we are the fucking US military.
We practically invented everything!
And now we have some chinless fuck in Brussels who's telling us we can't fly our own plane because of a volcano in Greenland.
What are we supposed to do?
Sit around here in Paris and wait for it to "stop erupting"?
I don't know, Greg.
This isn't exactly a situation that I've been in before.
Okay, bear with me on this one.
I think I might have just solved our problem.
[inaudible]
[Sean] I really can't tell you why these guys got so loose in front of me.
Or why Glen let them get so loose.
I can only put it down to hubris.
These guys thought they were the most important guys in the world... with the most important jobs in the world.
Maybe they assumed I thought they were as amazing as they did.
What are you writing?
Hmm?
What are you writing?
You're always writing.
I don't like it.
[Sean] Maybe they thought they could do whatever they wanted.
I'm a writer.
I write.
I better like what it is you're writing.
Let's say you have ten insurgents.
Huh?
Now, let's say you kill two of 'em.
Now, how many insurgents do you have left?
Hmm?
Hmm?
Well, you'd say eight, of course.
Eight.
Right?
Right?
Wrong!
In this scenario, ten minus two equals 20.
Let's say the two insurgents you just killed, uh... each had six friends or brothers or some such, who are hovering on the brink of...
of joining the insurgency.
They're thinking about this insurgency thing.
"Looks interesting.
But, you know, for one reason or other, not for me."
But...
So, then you go and kill their friend.
Now you've just made up their minds for 'em.
Those hovering friends are now full, paid-up members of the enemy.
Yeah.
And so, in the math of counterinsurgency, ten minus two... equals 20.
Uh, yes, ma'am?
General, the US invaded Afghanistan because of the Al-Qaeda attacks on September 11th.
- This is correct, yes?
- Yeah.
You have been speaking to us now for 45 minutes... [man speaking German]
Oh, uh, where's the, uh...
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
[woman speaking German] [in English] You have been speaking to us now for 45 minutes, and yet in all of that time you have only mentioned Al-Qaeda once.
Your own vice president has advocated a much smaller and simpler counterterrorism approach to incapacitate what is estimated to be little more than 100 Al-Qaeda fighters that still remain in Afghanistan to refocus on what it was that started this war in the first place.
- Ah.
- Your analysis of the insurgency there suggests to me there is no monolithic Taliban.
You are spread over the entire country.
You are fighting 1,000 separate battles with locals whose principal ideological position would seem to be simply that they don't want foreign soldiers in their village.
And that, General, you must know, is a war you will never win.
[Glen] Ah.
Uh... with all due respect, ma'am.
Uh...
I must beg to differ.
I firmly believe, having traveled to all corners of the country, having spoken with many people from many walks of life... that what these people want is the very same thing that you and I want.
Hmm?
Freedom, security, stability, jobs.
Progress is being made.
Real Progress.
But challenges do remain.
[woman] Yes, I understand all of that, General.
And... and, please, let me say quite sincerely that I do not question the goodness of your intent.
I have been listening to you here this morning, and, uh...
I believe you are a good man.
I do.
What I question is... your belief in your power to deliver these things that you describe.
I question your belief in the power of your ideals.
Ah, well... [stuttering] I think what I am trying to say, and I apologize, General, if this is sounding impolite, but I question your sense of self.
[men clamoring in German]
No, no, no, that's all... all right.
I, uh, appreciate your, uh, commentary.
I do.
Um...
But I have a job to do.
Yes, I understand.
And I also have a job to do.
And I am trying to do mine.
As an elected representative of the people of Germany, it is my job to ensure that the personal ambitions of those who serve those people are kept in check.
You have devoted your entire life, General, to the fighting of war.
And this situation in Afghanistan, for you, it is the culmination of all your years of training, all your years of ambition.
- This is the great moment of your life.
- Well...
It's understandable to me that you should have, therefore, a fetish for completion to make your moment glorious.
It is my job, however, to ensure that your personal ambitions are not entirely delusional and do not carry with them an unacceptable cost for everybody else.
- [Jeanie] Honey, you okay?
- I'm fine.
Please don't shut down.
It's our last day together.
Be here with me.
One second.
Thank you.
So, just got an email from Gates.
Good news and bad news.
Spoke with the German defense minister...
We're getting our troops.
Turns out that crazy bitch...
lady back there was just some sad, lonely voice in the wilderness.
Bad news is, they won't let their guys leave the base.
Whatever that means.
But, hey, they're ponying up.
So I guess job here is done.
Boss?
[Sean] I used to think that men went gray because they had stressful jobs with stressful decisions to make.
Now, I think it happens when men start to feel in their bones that the great moments of their lives... might not turn out to be quite as great as they'd always hoped.
When the real world starts creeping in.
What separates the believers like Glen from everybody else is... their ability to block this real world out.
Some people call this insanity.
Welcome to Operation Moshtarak.
We're taking the Helmand province, gentlemen, once and for all.
Moshtarak will be the largest operation yet to be conducted since this war began.
So, needless to say, it is an important one.
This whole province has been a thorn in our ass since day one.
So this here will be a definitive test in our resolve.
And that starts right here in Marjah.
If we infill teams here and here tonight, we can set up our blocking positions, hopefully draw enough wiggle room for the marines tomorrow.
- Good.
- The forecast says tonight's the night.
If we don't go in tonight, likely have to wait maybe another week.
I want Karzai to sign off on this.
Cory, can you get him on the phone?
Copy.
And why these spots?
ISR is telling us these locations are where there still appears to be a concentration of movement.
Obviously, we're proceeding under the assumption that anyone who isn't a bad guy has moved on or at least hunkered down.
We've made it clear to the whole city that's the thing to do.
[Frank] If I could just ask a question, General.
Shoot!
[stutters] I know this is Marjah, but I'm still not quite clear as to why you're sending boys to Nawzad and Musa Qala.
I mean, there's nothing out there.
I'm just not quite clear what it is you're trying to control there.
Apart from nothing.
You see this map, Frank?
This one, hmm?
This here is the mess I'm having to clean up.
Now, we've been kind enough to plan this operation in such a way as to not make it look like the Americans are here to get done what you couldn't.
But that is what's happening.
Hmm?
So, Frank, uh... while your input is greatly appreciated...
It is.
I wouldn't want you to think that it isn't.
It is.
I'd also appreciate if you would take one nice, big step back and let me get this shit done.
- Yeah.
Hmm?
Yeah?
- [Cory clears throat]
- What?
- I can't get him.
They're telling me he's in bed with a cold.
Well, did you tell 'em what it's about?
I didn't tell 'em exactly what it was about.
- I said it was very important.
- Jesus H. Christ.
- Just dial the number again.
I'll talk.
- Right.
Copy.
Thanks, Bernie.
Let's assume this is happening.
I'll give you the green light soon as I get it.
- Yes, sir.
- I have General McMahon on the line.
Hello, who am I speaking with?
This is General McMahon.
I need to speak to President Karzai urgently.
I understand he's not feeling well, but I need to speak with him.
Is he awake?
Good.
Put him on.
Put the call through.
What do you mean, he doesn't have one?
What world leader doesn't have a phone in his bedroom?
Does he have a cell phone in there?
- Did you try his cell phone?
- Straight to voice mail.
What?
Well, tell him to turn it back on.
Please!
Please!
This is...
I can't...
Oh, fuck it!
I'm coming over there.
This is me doing that right now.
I'm making the appointment right now.
[laughing]
Oh!
[coughing] [continues laughing]
[knocking on door]
- Yes?
- [TV turns off]
- Oh, General, please come in.
- Mr. President.
Please sit here.
Please, please sit.
Sit.
[grunts]
- How are you?
- I'm fine, sir.
I've been trying to contact you.
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.
I'm not feeling well.
I understand, sir.
But did they not tell you this is urgent?
Oh, you know how everything is at the top of the mountain, General.
Everybody's urgent about everything all the time.
Everything is important.
Nothing ever really is.
There's nothing that cannot wait until morning.
This is important, sir.
We hope to launch Operation Moshtarak tonight, and I need your official consent before doing so.
- Really?
- Yes, sir.
- Why?
- Because it's your mission.
- It is?
- Yes, sir.
[Karzai] Ah.
No one has ever asked me to approve a mission before.
Well, that needs to change.
This mission needs your consent.
If we're to win the trust of Helmand province, [stammers] it demands that this mission be seen to be of your design.
- [sneezes]
- I...
I don't mean to be rude, Mr. President, but it is imperative that you begin to take a leadership role here.
We cannot win this thing alone.
Without your active involvement, our presence here will never be anything more than a foreign occupation.
This is your war.
For your country.
Your people.
Again, I'm sorry, sir... but you need to behave like a leader.
But I am behaving like a leader.
I'm unavailable.
I am as unavailable to you as is your own president.
Hmm?
[clears throat]
You have my approval, General.
We both know it was never really mine to give.
But...
I thank you for inviting me to participate in the theater of it all.
And good luck.
I wish you much success.
[indistinct chatter on TV]
[door opens]
Good luck tonight, Glen.
Who told you about tonight?
I just mean... whatever you happen to find yourself doing tonight, good luck with it.
Go fuck yourself, Pat.
[Pat] Glen?
Glen.
- What?
- [sighs]
Look, I just want to apologize.
You know how the other day
I said there wasn't a parade at the end of all this?
I was wrong.
It was glib.
I just thought it was a pithy way to end the conversation, but I was wrong.
There's gonna be thousands of parades.
Thousands of 'em all over America.
Only none of them will be for you.
Now that was pithy, too, but it was true.
Fuck you!
[Pat] Roger that.
[Greg] What was that about, buddy?
[Glen] Nothing.
Let's get to Kandahar.
We got some fucking winning to do.
[North] Okay, listen up.
This is going to be tough.
I'm not gonna mince words about that.
This will be tough.
This will probably be the toughest mission that any of you all will experience.
This is the real deal.
Marjah is Taliban ground zero.
This is gonna be IEDs everywhere.
This is gonna be their best guys.
And they are gonna be prepared.
They know we're coming, gentlemen.
They've known we're coming for weeks.
So don't be under any illusion.
This will get ugly.
We're gonna lose guys.
I am not gonna lie to you about that.
There will be casualties.
But if you keep your wits about you, if you have faith in your ability, if you have faith in the ability of the men next to you, you will come out the tail end of this!
I have faith in you!
I know who you are!
You are proud members of the toughest fucking fighting force this world has ever known.
Carry that knowledge with you!
Carry it with pride!
Do you understand me?
[soldiers] Oorah!
- Do you understand me?
- [soldiers] Oorah!
[captain] That's right.
Any of you so inclined, I'm gonna ask this chaplain to say a prayer for us.
Thank you, Captain.
Let us pray!
Almighty God, as these marines prepare for battle, we pray that your Holy Spirit shall guide them.
As you brought down the walls of Jericho, as you dealt out your wrath upon the Philistines, as you crushed the Hittites and brought retribution upon all the enemies of the righteous, may your mighty hand be upon these men and assure their victories.
Be with them, mighty God... [officer] Let's move.
[indistinct radio chatter]
- What are you thinking about, buddy?
- [inhales sharply]
[Glen] Well, let's just see how this plays out.
The uncrackable nut.
If anyone's gonna crack this, it's gonna be you.
You're gonna smash this like a monkey on a rock.
Yeah.
- You're a killing machine, Glen.
- Hmm.
You are the terrorist hunter.
Remember?
- You're Big Glen.
- [grunts softly]
You're the Glenimal.
Thank you, General.
[exhales]
- [goat bleating]
- I'm hungry.
I wanna eat that motherfucker.
[soldier] Jesus Christ, man.
Farrenberg.
Move.
- [sniper rifle firing]
- Contact front!
[soldier] Move!
Move!
Up against the wall!
- Farrenberg.
- [soldier] Not too close.
Get off the walls.
Now!
- Fuck!
- [soldier] Over there, twelve o'clock!
[Ortega] Cole!
Cole!
I need to see a weapon.
He isn't a combatant until I see a weapon.
Fuck, man!
You think this nigga on his morning jog?
[Ortega] All right.
All right.
We're gonna head to that house over there at two o'clock.
All right?
We're gonna work this shit out.
Cutter, I need you, Song, Carroll and Trey, head over there and get us in, all right?
We're gonna move up to cover you.
I need ANA guys going in first.
Trey!
You take those first two guys with you.
Copy?
Oorah!
You two, up!
Up!
Get the fuck up!
Move in.
[Trey] Come on!
Let's go!
Clear.
Put that gun up, now.
[Cutter] We're getting ready to move now.
- [grunts] - [stones rattling]
Come on!
Come on.
Fucking move!
Come on!
Zah, zah, zah, you fuck!
Oh, you fat piece of shit!
Fucking move!
Move!
- [gate rattling] - [Trey yelling indistinctly]
Move!
[soldiers yelling indistinctly]
[Trey] To the right!
- [soldier] Clear!
- All right!
All clear!
Okay.
Farrenberg, let's go!
Move.
Go in.
All right.
Listen up.
We're gonna get on the roof of this place, figure out what we're looking at.
Cutter, Cole, you're coming with me.
The rest of you guys stay put.
Copy?
[soldiers] Copy.
[Ortega] Comin' up!
[Trey] We got movement, twelve o'clock.
About 300 meters, two guys on the roof.
- Are they armed?
- I don't know.
It's a simple fucking question, Trey.
Do you see a weapon?
No.
That's not what you asked.
You asked if they were armed.
The answer to that one is, I don't fucking know.
Obviously they're armed, Ortega.
Why else would they be running around up there?
I don't fucking know, do I?
I don't understand these fucking people.
All I know is we need to see weapons.
- [Trey] Ah!
- [gun firing]
- [Ortega] Are you hit?
Are you hit?
- [Trey] Fuck!
- I'm fucking hit!
- [Ortega] Where are you hit?
On my fucking eyes.
- Can you open 'em?
- What the fuck is going on?
Is he hit?
We're good.
We're good.
Trey's just got shit in his eyes.
[Cutter] Hey, yo, guys!
- Cutter, get the fuck over here!
- [Cutter] Fuck!
[Ortega] It's just water.
It's just water.
Give us...
Give me the 203.
Give me the 203.
- [Ortega] Trey, stay still!
- Give me your fucking gun!
[Song] Ortega!
What's going on up there?
What the fuck's going on up there, guys?
- [Trey groaning]
- Cover!
[Trey] Fuck.
Fucking short, man!
Fuck.
- Again!
- Zah!
- Short!
- I know.
One more!
Fuck, yeah!
[Ortega] Good job, Cole.
Nice shooting, boys.
- Farrenberg, you hit?
- Nah.
- Are you hit?
- No.
I'm good.
- Fuck.
- [gunfire continues]
- Fuck this shit!
- Cole, where the fuck are you going?
- Dude, where the fuck are you going?
- Fuck off!
- Corporal, what's happening?
- Wait, where the fuck are you going, man?
- Shut the fuck up!
- Wait, Cole!
Cole!
- Cole!
Get back here, Cole!
- [soldier 1] Cole!
[soldier 2] Cole, what the fuck, man?
Where you going?
[soldier 3] Where the fuck are you going, man?
- Fuck, Cole!
- Come back, Cole!
Cole!
[indistinct chatter in distance]
[breathing heavily]
[inaudible]
[Cory] They're crawling.
They're in the middle of an IED belt.
And first and second platoons, they're pinned down, and second is close to requesting QRF.
Tell me something good, Cory.
[Cory] I'm trying.
This info ain't meeting me halfway.
I wanna hear something good, God damn it.
I don't want the word "clusterfuck" featuring anywhere in tomorrow's news.
Don't worry about the headlines, buddy.
[indistinct radio chatter]
We got civilian casualties.
We got civilian casualties southeast corner of town, third platoon.
It's those boys from Sasquatch.
Cutter, find out who these fucking guys are.
If they're gonna stand there, I wanna know who they are.
How?
Get one of the ANA to talk to 'em.
Them motherfuckers speak Pashto.
The ANA don't speak Pashto.
I don't know.
Figure it out.
The fuck...
Cutter's fucking shit up outside.
- All right.
What's the deal here?
- He's saying he didn't know the bad guys.
They just commandeered his house, and there was nothing he could do about it.
Well, that's fucking bullshit.
We did leaflet drops and shit.
He shouldn't still be here.
Why are you still here?
What's your reason for being here?
[speaking Pashto] [speaking Pashto]
[in English] He says that he has nowhere to go.
He has no wife.
He is worried about leaving his goats.
He says that he's telling the truth.
You can search his house.
You will find no weapons.
[sighs]
Wait.
Farrenberg?
Farrenberg!
- [Farrenberg] Yeah, I'm here!
- Come here!
We're gonna give this guy some money, all right?
- You fucking serious?
- Yeah, I am serious.
Give me the fucking...
Open the fucking bag.
- What are those, 2.5?
- Yeah.
Okay, give me one of those.
My name is General Glen McMahon.
On behalf of the coalition forces,
I wanna apologize to you for the loss you've suffered here today.
[speaking Pashto]
I know the money that Sergeant Ortega gave you can't bring back your family.
But hopefully it can help you to rebuild, because rebuilding is what we're all about.
And providing you with the security you need to live a long and prosperous life.
[soldier speaking Pashto]
[Glen] Roads and schools and then jobs, so... you can raise your families, and jobs so you can put food on the table.
[soldier speaking Pashto]
The Taliban aren't gonna provide you jobs.
The Taliban aren't here to help you.
Only we can help you.
[soldier speaking Pashto]
We have a saying in America...
"You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs."
[soldier speaking Pashto]
I understand that sometimes it can be hard to see the helping hand, what with all the guns and the strange guys and the mess and what have you.
[soldier speaking Pashto]
But I assure you, this is the hand of helping.
This is the helping hand.
[soldier speaking Pashto]
[Glen] Yeah.
[man speaking Pashto]
He says that he likes roads and schools, but when you leave, it will all mean nothing and they will be left in a big mess.
And every day that you spend here longer, the worse it will be for them when you leave.
So please, leave now.
Please.
I understand your concerns.
I really do.
That's... [soldier speaking Pashto]
That's why we're doing everything we can to bring peace, and to train up your own Afghan forces.
[translating]
So that they can maintain your security, uh...
- [stammers] well into the future.
- [soldier interpreting] [speaking Pashto]
Please, leave now.
[men clamoring]
Dragonfly, this is Spartan Two.
Think we're ready to roll.
[clamoring continues]
Give 'em hell, boys!
Kill those motherfuckers!
Eat 'em alive!
[sighs] [indistinct chatter in distance]
[door opening]
Jesus Christ, Willy.
What time is it?
It's me, boss.
Um... sorry to wake you.
We have a problem.
That Rolling Stone article came out, and it's not good.
Sir, it says we're shit-talking our president.
And our vice president.
That we don't have the support of our coalition partners.
And that we're drunk all over Europe.
Basically, a fucking drinking tour.
All over Europe.
I mean, I don't even know what the legals on a thing like this are, you know?
Nothing he says in there is actually untrue.
I'll get the editor on the phone as soon as it's morning there and see if there's anything they can do.
I'm not sure what that's gonna be, though.
Bottom line, this is gonna play bad, all right?
It's gonna play really fucking bad.
So we are in damage control now.
Guys, guys...
Is this really that bad?
I mean, yeah, it's colorful, sure.
But... this is Rolling Stone, okay?
It's hip.
And you guys...
You guys are the operators.
You know, you're out there, you're getting shit done in, like, a totally non-square way.
[Cory] Yes, Little, you fucking idiot, it's that bad.
[Simon] This was always a terrible idea.
Why you would unnecessarily court attention like this is...
- [Matt] Simon, can you shut the fuck up?
- I will not shut up!
This is your mess.
You created it.
You invited this... this Cullen fellow in, you didn't properly consult me!
What?
I didn't properly consult you?
Are you fucking kidding me?
- We had a conversation.
- [knocking on door]
- Give me his phone number.
- [Matt] What?
Whose phone number?
This fucking Cullen fuck.
Give me his fucking phone number!
- I'm not gonna give you his phone number.
- Why the fuck not?
Because you're acting crazy!
You're acting like a fucking lunatic right now!
- [Pete] You think this is crazy, huh?
- [thudding]
- You think this is me being crazy?
- [Cory] Peter!
Calm down!
[Pete] You fucking calm down!
Duckman!
I'm gonna beat you down unless you chill out.
Oh, I'd like to see you try, old man.
Fucking come on!
[Glen] Settle down, fellas.
I do believe I'm finished.
So... do me a favor, and... be lovely to one another.
- Sir.
- Yes, sir.
[door opening]
[phone ringing]
Dick.
[Dick] Glen.
The president wants to see you in DC.
You need to be on a plane this afternoon.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Andy.
Badi.
Okay.
Let's go, Willy.
[Greg] Fall out.
- Do you need anything, boss?
- Uh, no.
Thank you, Willy.
Are you... are you sure you don't need me to come with you?
I'm fine, Willy.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
[sniffles]
[Sean] And so Glen finally got his face time with the president.
Getting fired probably wasn't the kind of face time he was after, but, well,
I guess you could say it was kind of a page in the history books.
That was pretty exciting for me.
But, sadly, while I would've liked to have thought that my story had made a difference, it didn't.
It just became another celebrity-fall-from-grace story.
It would've been nice if the conversation after had been about the failure of counterinsurgency, or why we seem so desperate to be at war all the time, or how maybe what we're doing is just making more enemies
all in the name of keeping America safe.
It might've been nice if it had caused someone important to ask what any of this says about us.
But really, the only question anyone seemed to want to ask was,
"What the fuck was Glen McMahon doing talking to a Rolling Stone reporter anyway?"
Which, admittedly, is a good question.
Anyway, in the absence of any real soul searching, what do we do?
Well, obviously, we sack Glen and we bring in some other guy.
And that other guy... was Bob.
My beautiful ceres.
I've given you so many chances...
Time and time again.
Have I not been patient with you?
You have, father.
When you came to me, what did you have?
Nothing.
And who were you?
No one.
And now?
I am ceres, goddess of crabs and fertility.
That's right.
It's in your nature to grow.
But you can't grow unless you plant roots.
And when you rip those roots from the earth, you're denying your own ascension.
It won't happen again, father.
I know, my love.
I know.
Reach for the light.
It's all there.
As per tradition...
Congratulations on another one in the bag.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
So, was it worth it?
Worth what?
That shiner you're trying to cover up.
Anything for the story, right?
You completely ghosted on me.
I can handle myself.
Bite off more than you can chew, and your sister is gonna handle me.
Between you and Sophie, it's like my parents are still around.
All right, all right.
What do you got?
What's next?
Melanie, it's Haley.
Um...
I know it's been forever, but, uh, I really need your help.
Um, I'm in idyllwild.
He won't let anyone leave.
I don't have my phone, and I don't have any money, and I don't know where else to...
Oh, my god!
He found me!
Haley copper, a friend from smc.
So, call the police.
Tell Sophie.
Sophie's not a cop anymore.
Okay, well, she still has friends in the department.
Yeah, here, not in the San jacinto mountains.
It's probably just some asshole boyfriend.
You really wanna get in the middle of that?
In the last year, four Southern California girls have gone missing.
They were all last spotted in or around idyllwild.
People go missing every day.
You ever done a wider search?
It's like flipping through the white pages.
You don't have any other leads beside where she's calling from.
This is all pure conjecture.
You have nothing.
This is no story.
- A coffee shop?
- Mm-hmm.
And the people who work there all belong to this ascension family commune, some hippy cult.
I know Haley.
This is exactly the kind of place she'd end up.
I've had journalists cover this kind of story before, and if this cult actually exists...
You're exactly the type of girl they'd prey on.
This isn't just about Haley.
What if the other girls are in the same situation?
You'll send me regular updates?
Check in with notes?
Of course.
So, that's a yes?
Check in with Sophie first.
And fix that makeup.
She sees that black eye, she's gonna kill me.
Melanie, I haven't seen you for six months.
You can't just keep disappearing like this.
I knew you'd do this.
You always freak out.
Somebody has to.
There's this commune in idyllwild.
I think some of the girls there might be in trouble.
I can't keep worrying about you like this.
Waiting to hear some awful report on the news.
Four girls have gone missing.
All in their 20s.
Sophie, you were a detective.
You know what happens when the world forgets about these girls.
So call the police.
Let someone else be in danger for once.
Police aren't gonna do anything.
I didn't come here to ask permission.
I'm telling you.
And I'd appreciate it if you stopped treating me like a child.
Then stop acting like one.
I am not having this fight again.
You know what?
I have two kids.
I can't be your mom too.
I don't want you to.
Just because you gave up on what you believe in, doesn't mean the rest of us have to.
- Real nice, Mel.
Mel, it's me.
I didn't wanna leave things the way we did.
I'm sorry, okay?
I know you're an adult, and I know you don't need me to look after you.
But you can't stop me from worrying.
I saw too many things over the years.
I know what people are capable of.
Just promise me you'll be careful.
And know that I'm gonna hit Gavin up for information if I don't hear from you, okay?
Okay.
I love you.
Bye.
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, ma'am?
Sorry to bother your coffee break.
I was just wondering if, by chance, you recognize this girl.
I can't say that I do.
There a problem?
No, she's just a friend.
I heard she was in town.
Well, we get all kinds passing through.
It's a peaceful community, but it does seem to attract a certain element.
What does that mean?
People looking for something, running from something.
Middle of the mountains, not too hard to figure why.
I'm sorry I couldn't be more help.
More tea?
Oh, no, thank you.
Luna.
That's pretty.
Is it a family name?
You need some help with that?
Please save me.
Thanks.
Seriously, I was about ready to lose my shit.
I mean stuff.
Sorry.
I know we're not supposed to curse in front of the customers.
No, that's okay.
I won't tell anyone.
I'm Venus.
I know.
It's a dirty hippy name.
Try not to judge me.
I'm...
Mary.
Are you new to the area?
I haven't seen you here before.
Oh, I'm just passing through.
Oh, well, I'm sure you'll love the town.
You know, first week I was here,
I thought I was gonna kill myself, but it grows on you.
You're in a band?
Guilty as charged.
What kind of music do you play?
It's really hard to define a genre, so I would say...
Experimental folk.
Okay, no, that actually makes it sound terrible.
No, not at all.
I think it's right for up here.
Really?
And who's that?
Isn't he dreamy?
That's Brent.
He actually owns the shop.
Are you guys close?
Um...
I guess you could say that.
We all live in the same place, and we run the shop to, you know, support us, but we're mostly self-sufficient, off the grid.
That's amazing.
I'd love to check it out.
It's private.
Oh, come on.
Brent would love her.
He wouldn't love strangers coming over.
I don't have a place to stay.
And whose fault is that?
- Whoa!
Whoa!
- Easy.
Take it...
- Let go of me!
Back off!
Calm down... please?
You okay?
Yes.
Is that a question or a statement?
Yes, I'm okay.
We're as startled as you are here.
You realize you're on private property, right?
I'm just a little lost.
Bullshit.
She was at the shop today asking about you.
Is that true?
I don't have anywhere to stay.
Venus told me what a nice place you have here.
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to see it for myself.
I never told her where it was.
Then how did you find it?
I sort of hitched a ride in the back of your pickup.
I like this one.
What's your name?
Mary.
Brent.
Please don't blind me.
I just wanna shake your hand.
Why don't you come inside from the cold?
We'll discuss this over some dinner.
Come on.
Introductions.
Of course, you've already met Venus and Luna, and then we have our silent sisters, Helen and clytemnestra.
They haven't spoken a word since they joined us, except to each other.
And last, but certainly not least, rhea... my first.
To our guest of honor, Mary.
We are grateful that she has found us in the darkness.
Thanks for having me.
Cheers.
Is this everyone?
How do you mean?
Just, uh... everyone who lives here?
For now.
I hope you're not vegetarian.
No.
What is it?
Rabbit.
Everything you see on this table was raised, grown, and prepared here by us.
Except the wine.
Mmm!
That's great.
Everyone should really try growing their own food.
I'm glad you think so.
Unfortunately, the majority of this country is oblivious to the fact that gmos are being knowingly and maliciously introduced into their food supply as a means to poison and pacify the population with cancer and obesity.
You really believe that?
I know it.
But...
Forgive me.
I'm a little passionate when it comes to these things.
And is that why you're doing the whole...
Amish thing here?
We're taking a stab at an alternative lifestyle...
But I wouldn't call it amish.
We have power.
We just choose to use it sparingly.
The world is filled with enough energy leeches as it is.
Yeah, I know.
That's why I left L.A.
I needed a break from it all.
Let me ask you something, Mary.
What really brought you here?
I'm looking for a friend.
Hmm.
Aren't we all?
Look around this table.
Everyone here was lost in the darkness at one point, just like you...
Alone, afraid...
Strangers in a strange land.
But then, we found each other, and now, we're one.
You'll be bunking with Luna.
I know it's a little cramped, but there will be more space once we build the bunkhouse.
No, it's great.
Thank you.
You're lucky we even have space.
This bed just opened up.
Whose was it?
Her name was ceres.
"Was"?
She renounced her new name.
The average snake will shed its skin two to four times per year.
Some people will go their entire lives without doing it once.
Unfortunately, ceres wasn't ready to embrace her new self.
How come?
This lifestyle isn't for everyone.
We're a nation of addicts...
Opioids, social media, the white noise of a bar on a Friday night.
Some people would rather be dependent than free.
Voluntary slavery.
So, what happened to her?
"Happened"?
You mean where is she?
Where does anyone ever go?
Away.
Here.
Take this.
There's gonna be a lot to take in, but I promise you it's all for a good reason.
A big part of this community is shedding the things we don't need.
I'll do whatever it takes.
You can set it down and leave.
Thank you.
What's this?
I'm sorry to say that most of the girls who end up here show up with bruises.
Whoever did this to you will never touch you again.
This is a place of healing.
Arnica is an herb that will reduce the swelling and heal the eye muscles as well as any other tissue that may have been damaged.
That's better.
I'll let you get some rest.
It's been quite a day.
Hey, Brent.
Thank you... for everything.
It's been my pleasure.
Oh!
Before I leave...
I'm gonna need your phone.
I know.
Why don't I just take your arm, right?
But trust me.
It's for your own good.
Technology is the enemy out here.
You must be really worried to bother calling me.
Why does she do this?
I mean, at least send a text, something.
I'm sure she's fine.
She just needs to get the lay of the land before she can reach out.
I don't have a good feeling about this.
You always do.
At least, you used to.
I know.
It's just we parted on bad terms, and I just don't want...
Promise you'll call the second she reaches out.
I promise.
You're not gonna let Mel know that I checked in on her, right?
Why start now?
We'll talk soon.
Hang in there.
Thank you, Gavin.
Hey.
So, what does a girl do around here for fun after dinner?
Sleep.
Are you serious?
It can't even be 9:00 yet.
We get up at dawn.
Days are long.
Get used to it.
Do you want me to leave?
You have no idea.
Look, I know I'm kind of invading your space here,
- but that doesn't mean we have to hate each other.
Were you close with the girl before me, ceres?
Go to sleep.
Why did she leave?
Shut up!
This isn't a slumber party.
We're not gonna braid each other's hair.
I don't wanna be your friend.
I want you gone.
Shit.
Good morning.
How did you sleep?
Like a rock.
I don't usually sleep in like this.
You needed it.
We didn't wanna disturb you.
I see that arnica worked like a charm.
Yeah, thanks.
Hey, listen, I know I gave you my phone, but I should probably let some people know where I am.
My, my!
Not even 12 hours, and already, you gotta be plugged back in.
No, it's just what if someone needs me?
What if there's an emergency?
I promise if you get any messages, I'll return it immediately.
But we need to break you of your addiction.
I don't want you staring at the world through that tiny, electronic screen
- rather than...
- Living in the moment.
It's good to get lost out here.
The only way to truly find yourself.
Speaking of which, hop in.
Oh, I can't.
This is all I've got to wear.
Take it off.
I can't just take it off.
Relax.
I'm kidding.
We got plenty of extra clean clothes.
They'll fit you like a glove.
Come on.
I'll give you a tour of the property after breakfast.
Come on.
Let's get you comfy.
Okay, but I'm not very good.
There's no competition here.
We're all perfect in our imperfection.
Off this mountain, the name of the game is to hold on tight...
To your youth, your money, your job, your lover.
And they wonder why we're all going insane.
This entire world is suffering a systemic nervous breakdown because we're all terrified to just...
let... go.
But letting go is the sanest thing you can do.
Remember that nothing here is ours.
What is ours?
Nothing, father.
What's with this whole "father" thing?
Don't ask.
I called him it one time as a joke, and I guess it just kind of stuck.
It's not even funny anymore.
It's kind of creepy.
Yeah, kinda.
Nothing is ours...
Not these bodies...
Not this planet...
Not this life.
We're renters here.
So, we might as well live free before we're all evicted.
I was wondering if I could stay.
What about your big city life?
I really wouldn't call it a life.
It's more like a distraction.
Hmm.
But you really think the whole world can live like this, without all the creature comforts they're addicted to?
What?
You said "they."
- I did?
- Mm-hmm.
There's a knot in your stomach...
Something urging you back to the world you know.
I know that feeling...
All too well.
But there's a reason you came here, and I think you deserve the chance to discover it.
I'd like to try.
This is our creative space where we rehearse and write our music, sometimes meditate.
We even make odds and ends at our neighboring properties to sell at the shop...
Candles, lip balm, things like that.
Wow!
You guys are really organized.
We could use an extra pair of hands.
They're so cute.
Can't I just do laundry?
This is the food chain, not some convenient death in a box children are conditioned to equate with happiness.
This is reality.
It's death feeding life, and life feeding death.
Everyone did this before I let them stay here.
Think of it as a rite of passage.
Hey.
Every savory piece of meat you've ever relished in your entire life was the result of a moment just like this.
Do it.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Sorry.
This isn't the bathroom?
This is Brent's study.
Don't ever touch this door again, okay?
We're not allowed in here.
I'm sorry.
It's just that Brent is so particular, and this is where he mixes our music, and he doesn't want anybody to disturb his sanctum, okay?
- Okay.
- Bathroom's right there.
Come find me when you're done.
I have a job for you.
Okay, yeah, that's it.
Um...
Spread your feet apart.
Measure it out.
Yeah.
Now, just bring it up over your head...
And bring it down.
Oh!
Your poor, little city mouse.
Okay, get out of the way.
Come on.
Can I ask you something?
Are you happy here?
Have you ever thought about leaving?
And going where?
Back to Lexington?
I'll pass.
But you could leave, right, any time you wanted to?
Of course.
I mean, nobody is chaining us to the wall here, Mary.
No, I know.
It's just...
I was wondering how long people stay.
Like that girl who was rooming with Luna, she just decided to leave?
Ceres?
Look, all I know is that one night, she apparently got into Brent's study, and he totally flipped on her.
She ran away, no money, no ID.
I mean, Brent eventually found her and brought her back, and she settled in.
But I guess it just wasn't enough for her, so Brent let her go.
Why the sudden interest?
Oh, no interest.
It's just an interesting name.
You all have interesting names.
Oh.
Well, yeah.
It's Brent's doing.
He wants us to shed our old selves and all that jazz.
Wait.
You didn't think Venus was my real name, did you?
Maybe.
Good thing you're pretty.
So, what is your name?
Sorry.
House rules.
No real names.
Really?
Yeah.
I mean, Brent wants us to look to the future, not the past.
Chin up.
You'll be sharing your new name soon enough.
You're not gonna be Mary for much longer.
Is this becoming a regular thing?
Don't get me wrong.
I love hearing from you.
I wouldn't get used to it.
I'm calling about that picture you sent.
Any idea what to do with it?
It's not rocket science.
I called my buddy at the department to run the plates.
Right.
What kind of journalist are you?
An editor.
Think she's okay?
She hasn't sent anything else?
I'm sure she's fine.
Just the text I sent.
Probably just bad reception up there.
Yeah.
You know, you don't have to call me.
You can email or text.
- Use a carrier pigeon.
Yeah, I could have.
I'll, uh...
Call back when I hear something on that plate.
Looking forward to it.
Shh!
"Nothing makes sense out here anymore."
"There's a sadness in everyone's eyes that breaks my heart."
"It's like they know they're all trapped"
"and wanna scream, but they can't,"
"so their eyes scream for them."
"I miss our mountain and our music."
'What we had was special.
"What we had is the cure to this sickness."
"If I stay off this mountain for much longer, I will die."
"So, I'm coming home soon."
"With love, ceres."
I knew she couldn't stay away forever.
She's right.
What we have is special.
What we have is the cure.
Before we eat, let's go around again and share what we're curing within us.
Because if we can't heal ourselves, how can we heal the world?
I'll go first.
My father committed suicide when I was 12 years old.
He made some bad investments.
Lost everything.
Couldn't support us.
He felt like such a failure...
That killing himself seemed like the only way out.
Figured we could survive on his life insurance policy for a while.
My father wasted his life because he thought money was the cure.
Money is not the cure.
I used to validate my self-worth through sex.
The more men I was with, the more important I felt.
Because in that moment...
They were mine.
In that moment, I was their entire world...
Life, death...
And everything in between.
Sex is not the cure.
My dad used to hit us to make himself feel strong.
My mom was too scared to leave.
The one night, when he was whipping me with a belt,
I decided to fight back.
I broke his jaw with an iron.
They sent me to prison for aggravated assault, and when I got home, my mom kicked me out, blamed me for my dad leaving.
I was so scared.
Then I found Brent.
Fear is not the cure.
Um, I guess...
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I guess I'm still trying to figure it out.
Self-discovery is the ultimate journey any of us will ever go on.
Let us eat.
Oh, sorry.
Don't be.
I can think of worse people to bump into.
Insulin.
You're diabetic.
Getting diagnosed was my wakeup call.
Gave up all my old bad habits, started eating clean, living clean.
In a way, it's how I ended up here with all of you.
- Well, I guess it's a good thing then.
- Hmm.
I don't think I've seen that room before.
My study.
You're not missing anything.
Trust me.
Sometimes, I just have to block myself off from all external stimuli and meditate.
But I thought that's something we did together.
What can I say?
Sometimes, I can be a lone wolf.
Well, I'll leave you alone then.
Hey.
I'm glad you're still here.
Me too.
One moment, Mary.
Why don't you take a break from field work for a day?
Sure.
Whatever you need me to do.
You can take Luna's shift at the cafe.
- Really?
- Really.
It's a privilege, and I think you've earned it.
What about Luna?
Like I said, it's a privilege.
Some field work and arnica will do her some good.
I'm fine doing this if she'd rather...
Please.
Indulge me.
It's for the best.
Come on.
I'll give you a ride.
Sure beats chopping wood, right?
Yeah, this is definitely more my speed.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm just worried about Luna.
Did you see her this morning?
She'll be fine.
You know, Brent says that she sleepwalks sometimes and wanders off into the woods.
She banged herself up pretty good last night.
You really believe that's what happened to her?
Well, sure.
She wouldn't be the only one.
I mean, I know I've gone on autopilot a few times.
I'm gonna get some more lids.
Have so much fun.
Hi.
Hello?
Hey, it's me.
Mel, where the hell are you?
I've tried calling you, like, 20 times.
- I'm sorry.
They took my phone.
- They took your phone?
I have everything under control.
The guy running this place completely bought my helpless Doe act.
I just have to sink my teeth in a little more.
How do you plan on doing that?
Whatever it takes.
Mel, you...
Listen, I need you to get a message to Gavin.
Still no Haley.
Her disappearance is looking worse every day.
What makes you say that?
I hope I'm wrong.
- Mary?
- I have to go.
What are you doing?
Why do we lock the bathroom?
I almost peed my pants looking for this.
How'd she do?
Like a fish to water.
Good girl.
How about some tunes?
Venus, will you do the honors?
There are messages in this music if you listen with the right kind of ears.
Messages that can change the world.
Go to track four.
That's ceres's song.
She sang?
Like an angel.
If that license plate is correct,
Mel is in way over her head.
He's had a record since he was 17.
The charges over the years range from sexual assault to indecent exposure.
His mother has been institutionalized in New York since he was a kid.
His father... ugh!
His father is Johnathan burns, ceo of burns pharmaceuticals.
He was one of the most powerful lobbyists in the industry.
They own judges.
So this rich, little sicko has had a free pass his entire life?
- What did Mel say his name was?
- Brent.
That's just his latest alias.
Real name Matthew burns.
This guy is untouchable.
Mel has no idea who she is living with.
Mary!
Mary!
Hey!
Help.
Luna.
It's okay.
Everything is okay.
What's going on?
You don't remember?
I found you in the woods.
That actually happened?
But how did I get there?
You don't need to worry.
These things just happen sometimes.
I used to tell ceres the same thing.
Sometimes, I find myself...
In the middle of the night folding laundry or... cooking dinner.
I'd have a knife in my hand and...
Food just chopped up right in front of me.
But none of it's familiar, like a dream just snapped into reality.
Doesn't that scare you?
It did at first, but eventually, it just became routine.
Normal.
Luna, this is not normal.
Something is causing this.
It's my fault.
What do you mean?
I thought I could handle what happened, that I was strong enough, but I'm just...
I'm losing my mind.
Luna...
I saw you in the woods.
You placed flowers at a rock in the clearing.
I know this is hard, but I need you to tell me who's buried there.
We were worried about you.
My sweet Luna.
Hey, Mary is just fine.
Right?
Yeah.
You've taken your first step.
Your mind is ready.
Let's give her some time to rest.
Yes, father.
Get better.
And I'm sorry I haven't been the easiest person to get along with.
No, that's okay.
And I feel all right if you wanna talk some more.
You rest.
Luna has got plenty to do anyway.
You can talk to me.
I don't know what's wrong.
It's like part of my brain was removed.
Like I just lost control.
You don't like losing control.
Who does?
I just showed up in the woods.
But how did I get there?
And the things I saw...
What did you see?
It doesn't matter.
How do you make sense of something like that?
Well, that I can help you with.
I've had this same conversation with Luna...
And Venus.
Everybody here, actually.
Ceres?
Yes, before she left.
You've all had the same experience and asked the same questions.
Isn't that remarkable?
But what does it mean?
It means you're ready.
You've received your calling.
My calling to do what?
To learn your true purpose...
The family's purpose.
Congratulations, Mary.
You're one of us.
Come on.
Let's go for a walk.
Look at that.
Absolutely beautiful.
- You know what this is?
-
-No.
It's a borrachero seed.
This tiny seed can blossom into a large tree, and when it blooms...
I wish I could show you the flowers.
Actually, you've seen the cafe logo.
A crude representation, but you get the idea.
I told you my dad died when I was 12.
I remember.
We buried him in our backyard with one of these.
His flesh and bones fed the earth, and...
He broke free from the dirt.
I realized how connected everything is.
You, me, the grass, the trees, we're all the same matter.
We're one magnificent organism with billions of parts stretching out across the universe.
That sounds nice.
That's why I wanna change things.
We've become so separate, so wrapped up in ourselves.
I mean, look at the world.
We steal from each other, hurt each other, kill each other, and for what?
Money?
I wanna show people they can get by on less.
I don't want anyone to ever kill themselves over money again.
This is our family's purpose...
To help people see, or if necessary, to make them see.
Make them?
Yes.
And you can help.
Don't you wanna heal the broken world?
Yes.
I thought so.
It's time you received your new name.
My sister is living with a psychopath.
We have no way to contact her.
I'm not just gonna sit around and hope that she's okay.
So your solution is to walk into the lion's den
- just like she did?
What's your plan?
Is that a gun?
Maybe.
Are you insane?
Wait.
Aren't you supposed to turn in your gun when you quit?
I have my own private arsenal.
We don't know who's involved.
We don't know what a guy like Brent will do when he thinks people are poking into his business.
I'm not taking any chances.
Just... do me a favor, okay?
Be careful.
I heard the voice of god.
I felt the devil's breath.
They wailed the pain of life.
They sang the joy of death.
Took a heart full of trouble deep inside an earthy womb.
I'll pass along death's beauty when my bones help flowers bloom.
Good evening, ladies.
Good evening, father.
It gives me great pleasure to tell you that Mary has heard the calling and is ready to be reborn into our family.
And with that, she needs a name...
A name to fit her new life, her new purpose, to help us spread our music and love to the four corners of this tortured earth...
To heal it...
Inside and out.
Make no mistake.
This world is sick.
And what do we do when we're sick?
We take our medicine.
We...
We are the cure.
We are the cure.
But what name would suit a woman like you?
Mary?
Like the virgin mother?
That hardly seems appropriate.
Not Mary.
What about...
Melanie?
I don't know.
Are you a Melanie?
No.
Maybe in another life.
Not anymore.
Just beyond pluto lies the icy dwarf planet, eris...
Named after the Greek goddess of discord.
Eris.
Now, that sounds right.
Say hello to your new sister.
Welcome, eris.
Yes.
Welcome home.
Are you ready to serve your new family?
I'm ready.
Good girl.
Now, take off your clothes.
Mary is dead.
And eris is born.
Go ahead.
Put it on.
Wait.
No.
No, this is not real.
- This is not...
- This is very real.
Eris!
Eris, stop!
What the hell?
Miss, are you okay?
It's all right.
I got you.
Come on.
Let's get you off your feet.
I recognize you...
From the cafe.
What's your name?
Melanie.
Okay, Melanie.
Can you tell me what happened?
I don't remember how I got here.
The last thing I remember, I was running through the woods, and someone was...
Someone was chasing me.
Okay.
What about before that?
Was there anybody else with you?
Yeah, I was living on a farm with some other women.
Brent's place?
What the hell did he do to you?
Hey, it's all right.
You don't have to talk about it.
Here.
I'm gonna make sure nobody is hiding out there.
I promise I'll be right back.
It's okay.
You're safe now.
I found her on the side of the road.
Yeah.
Copy that.
Nobody out there.
Are we heading back into town?
Yes, ma'am.
Where are we going?
How about some music?
- Please!
No!
No!
Venus!
Thank god!
Please, you have to do something.
Shh.
It's okay.
I know.
I'm here to help.
I was so scared.
This is all so insane.
Oh, I know, but don't worry.
It'll all be better soon.
You're not pure enough to wear this.
See?
It's filthy, just like you.
But why?
You're not like the rest of them.
No, she isn't.
Venus is the best of you.
So faithful...
So devoted to convincing our girls to stay.
Venus, he's controlling you.
Oh, you poor, little city mouse.
I don't need drugs to do what I'm told.
I believe.
What are we going to do with you?
Tried love...
Empathy, sex, medicine.
Why are some souls so resistant to enlightenment?
I'm disappointed.
You seemed so promising...
Even after I realized who you really were.
Imagine... convincing an investigative journalist to join the cause.
What a triumph!
How did you know?
Oh, it pays to have people on the right side of the law.
Start digging.
Don't stop until I tell you.
Go to hell!
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Now, now...
Let's behave.
I can make you do it if need be.
You know I can.
I employ a diverse cocktail of pharmaceuticals to encourage personal growth around here.
But of them all, my favorite by far is scopolamine, otherwise known as devil's breath.
You take the seed of the borrachero tree...
Mash it up, you have a powder that can make people do your bidding.
A tiny amount, and you can make people do anything you want.
They won't even remember.
There are a dozen ways to get it into someone's system, wine, food...
Or my preferred method.
Why doesn't it affect you?
I don't have diabetes.
I do have antilirium, which acts as an antidote, rendering me immune.
So, what'll it be?
I'll see you tonight.
It'll give us both some time to reflect on things.
Diane hunt?
Who are you?
Do you have a minute to talk?
No, I have a long walk ahead of me.
- I can give you a ride.
- Just leave me alone.
It's about my sister.
Please.
Why are you telling me all of this?
Because I'm scared.
I don't have time to be as cautious as I would like, and you look like a good person.
I'm worried about my sister, and I'm horrified about the idea of never seeing her again.
I just need you to point me in the right direction.
- I'm sorry.
I can't.
- Please.
Put yourself in my shoes.
If you had the opportunity to save the person that you love the most, wouldn't you do that?
There's a room Brent uses...
For the girls who misbehave.
I spent a week in there one time.
Brent tried to get me to move on.
The things he did...
A shed near the woods by the edge of the property.
My beautiful eris.
I have good news.
Your ascension has come.
There's a lock on the door, but I...
I don't know where the key is.
He gets in your head, and then there's no stopping him.
I hope you can save her.
Reach for the light.
I wasn't so lucky.
Good girl.
Melanie!
I'm here to help.
Are you okay?
What's your name?
Ceres.
I mean, Haley.
Haley Cooper?
Do I know you?
No.
I'll explain when we're out of here.
Come on.
Your old self...
Is lying in that hole.
Bury her.
You'll be safe in my car down the road.
As soon as I get a signal, I'll call the cops.
We can't trust them.
What do you mean?
Thank you for joining us.
Good evening.
Good evening, father.
I come to you tonight with a heavy heart.
It pains me to upset you, because I love you all very much.
We love you, father.
We're a family, and families are supposed to take care of each other, to support each other, to trust each other.
It's up to the father to discipline those who misbehave.
Your sister, eris, has betrayed you, and her blood sister has come to take what is not hers!
And for that...
And for that, they must all be punished.
You wanna see them punished, don't you?
Yes, father.
You heard them.
Why are you doing this?
To change the world.
We talked about this.
Of course, that was all lies, wasn't it?
But why do you need them?
They don't deserve this.
I'm doing this to make them stronger, to blur the lines between what they want and what they think they want.
The only way we're ever going to be able to make a difference is to be willing to die for what we believe in.
You're pathetic.
You have no power.
You have to brainwash them to follow you.
Oh, I only have to persuade the unfaithful.
My true believers obey the cause willingly.
Ladies, take off your masks.
Look into their eyes.
Clear devotion.
It's their choice to be here.
And as for no power...
Oh, I disagree.
- Give me the gun.
- Yes, father.
Venus, come here.
What are you doing?
Proving a point.
Venus, put the gun to your head.
Stop it!
Venus, pull the trigger.
No!
Anything else?
Imagine what can be done with devotion like this.
Now, for your punishment.
Luna was kind enough to tell me what your relationship was with our guest...
With a little persuading.
In order to prove your loyalty to your new family, we need to sever ties with the old.
You don't touch her!
You don't do anything to her!
Don't worry.
I'm not going to do anything to her.
You are.
Deputy, do you have a light?
- Eris.
Join your sisters, your true sisters.
Stop!
Stop!
Please, don't make me.
I wish it didn't have to come to this.
You were my favorite.
How could it end like this?
Stay.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Oh!
Look out!
I was so scared, Haley.
You didn't give up.
Thank you.
You... and your sister.
I never got a chance to tell you...
Who's buried there.
You don't have to.
Brent said we didn't need to go to the hospital.
We could do it on our own.
But something was wrong with her.
My poor baby girl!
Oh.
Luna, I had no idea.
When I lost her,
I had nothing left.
Even when I realized what Brent was doing...
I had nobody.
You have family.
Protect that, no matter what.
I will.
And you should too.
You still have family.
Come on.
Thank you.
It's what sisters do.
Whew!
I think I've earned a break.
Yeah.
Can we just go home and hang out for a while?
Sure.
And after...
You need to write one hell of a story.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Family!
I have exciting news!
Oh Good.
David, I hoped you were home.
Thanks.
You're aware of the extraordinary work of New York-Based photographer Sebastien Raine?
You mean my ex?
When did you date Sebastien Raine?
They dated for like a month and a half and David got very upset about it.
Okay, It was almost three months.
Four, if you include the month that he was seeing other people.
And you met him through me.
That's nonsense.
I met Sebastien Raine at an art opening years ago.
At my gallery.
And can you please stop saying his full name.
He's a monster, who uses people,
- and leaves them for dead.
- Yeah.
I hate to play contrarian, David, but The Times and I, both consider Sebastien Raine a dear friend.
Remember when he dumped you?
And you ate all those mall pretzels, and watched "Bridget Jones's Diary"
every day for a year.
It wasn't a whole year,
And I will not feel shame about the mall pretzels.
Okay, that's enough news for today.
Ummm no, what about him?
He's coming here.
What?
Wha...
Why?
Sebastien Raine wants to collaborate on a project.
With me.
And you his commitment to his work.
He's willing to come all the way here.
When flying me to New York would be a lot easier.
And a welcome escape.
But Sebastien Raine puts his subjects first.
And he told me I must respect that.
Okay.
You know what?
I don't care.
So you can do whatever you like.
I could cancel, but you just told me you don't care so now I have no choice but to meet him.
I think he's coming.
So could you please go to the window and check for me?
- Who's he?
- Uh, Sebastien Raine.
He's most likely wearing a very expensive sweater, that doesn't look very expensive.
Is he like, really...
Really handsome in a homeless-y way sort of way?
Yes.
Yup.
Then he is coming here.
Oh, he is?
Okay.
- He's walking.
- He's walking.
- He's walking towards here.
- Where is he walking to?
- And now he's coming in
- Now he's coming in... and so he's here.
He's here.
All right.
David.
- Oh...
- Wow.
This is... exactly how I pictured it.
Sebastien.
Ah...
You're-you're here.
I thought you were supposed to be with my mother.
So good to see you.
Look at you...
You look really...
Healthy.
Thanks.
I can't believe this is where you live.
I think you're brave.
Hi.
Stevie.
I like your sweater.
You must be David's girlfriend.
- No...
- No, I own The Motel, so that makes me more like your landlord?
No.
It doesn't.
Stevie, Stevie.
Stevie.
I'd love to Polaroid you naked one day.
Okay.
Okay?
!
David, I'm thinking maybe I'll stay the night, so I hope we can, you know... catch up.
Yeah, I'm super busy these days...
Yeah, I just feel like we have unfinished business, you and I.
Room five is available.
Room five sounds great.
So brave.
Hm-hm.
- So brave.
- Okay.
Moira!
Sebastien Raine!
- Hello!
- Ohhh!
Is this place not funny?
I think it might just be one of my favorite local dives.
I love it.
It's just so unassertive.
You can't find this in New York City.
New York misses you, Moira.
You're too kind.
And correct.
Tell me things, Sebastien.
Tell me everything!
Well, I just got back from London.
I was touring with Madonna.
She commissioned a series of anti-portraits.
Whoa.
Well, it sounds brilliant.
I want to do something even more brilliant with you, Moira.
Hm.
Come, let's walk.
Creativity lives on its feet.
Anything else is bullshit.
I just ordered you a Sanka-ccino.
It's a beautiful day.
And you're a beautiful subject.
Sebastian, I must insist you stop with the flattery...
In due time.
So I have a quick little school form you to fill out.
Sure.
What is this?
Um nothing.
It just says that I work here.
Uh-huh.
This is for volunteer hours.
But you don't volunteer here.
You work here.
But, I volunteer to work here.
Because it's your job.
Okay but, I need these hours to graduate so...
So looks like you're gonna have to find somewhere to volunteer.
Okay.
It's just, I thought my community service hours would apply but they don't count because their court-ordered.
So...
Yeah, I think the whole point of volunteering is to give something back, right?
Okay.
Sure.
But whatever I give back has to happen within two weeks.
Well, I might have something for you but...
I don't think you're going to be interested.
Try me.
Well, I work with some seniors a couple times a month.
Wow.
So cute.
Um, it's just I have a thing with skin tags and old smells.
So I might just need to think on it.
Well, tonight's gonna be fun though, dance lessons!
We'd have to touch them.
Oh psst!
Hey, Johnny!
Come here!
Come here!
Come here!
- Hey Roland.
- Here sit down.
Sit.
Sit!
Okay.
Now act like you're talking to me.
I am talking to you.
No.
Not like that.
It's got to be more conversational.
You know, like, um...
"Yes the weather is cold."
Okay, I'm not following.
Okay, that's better.
- But try it a little more casually.
- What is going on?
Bob is trying to get his poker night together again and he wants me to play.
And I can't afford it.
Well then just say no, politely decline.
Well that's not gonna work, Johnny.
Tell him that we're doing something together tonight, okay?
Tell him... you're taking me for a haircut tonight.
- Haircut?
- Hey Johnny.
- Roland.
- Oh, Bob.
- Almost didn't see you there.
- Right.
I was just Chattin' away with Johnny.
Well, I just wanted to let you know that we're starting the big poker night again, so if you're interested...
Uh well...
I wouldn't mind playing, Bob.
- Really?
- Well..
That's great!
Well, listen I'll see you both at my place, uh... around seven.
Seven o'clock.
Can I ask you something?
Um, do you have even the slightest concept of what just happened here?
- Oh!
It is so nice to get away.
- Hm.
There's something very cathartic about stepping into someone else's world.
Hm.
That's one of the reasons we chose to settle here.
- David seems well.
- Well he...
Excuse me?
I ran into him earlier at the motel.
At the motel?
And here I thought I gave you very specific instructions to go directly to the cafe.
Ever the renegade.
Yeah, I got here and decided it was probably best to get a room.
Only a day just didn't seem enough.
You got yourself a room?
Oh, aren't you lucky!
They're usually booked up.
You must have used our name.
But Sebastien, I was under the impression that you were here just for today for a quick consult...
Hey!
What are you doing?
Sorry, it's the way the light is catching you.
The photo took itself.
Ah, but you had to push the button.
Sebastien don't, please.
This is my talk now, shoot later look.
So, this visage is off-limits for-for the moment.
Plea...
Don't worry, I'm just using you for scale.
It's this backdrop.
There's a provincial romanticism to all this, that's just... terrifying and important.
Far be it from me to stand in the way of your inspiration.
Well, why don't you actually stand over there?
Where?
- Further into the field.
- Oh...
Yes!
No, into the field.
- Further!
- Huh?
- Yeah, into the field.
- Umm?
Yes.
Further!
Sebastien, I was...
Let the field reveal itself to you.
Okay...
I was wondering when we do the actual shoot... um...
Are we thinking studio or on location?
Because I bet Mr. Schnabel would love to loan us the Palazzo...
Yes!
Okay.
As long as you can still hear me.
I was also thinking Berlin...
Oh hi!
Nice day with Sebastien?
Very productive.
I think we've laid the groundwork for an exciting enterprise.
I'm sure you'll be a wonderful subject.
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.
Today was more about discussing theme,
- and tone, mise en scene.
- Uh-huh.
You know, he may have taken a few reference photos, but...
So he photographed you today then?
Hm-hm.
You know just a few dozens snaps about town... picturettes, really.
Why would you have allowed this to happen?
I don't know he just started shooting and shouting and I did what he told me to do and I "leaned in" to the moment.
How did that work out for you?
I leaned in!
I don't know, David.
Why don't you try it... sometime!
Everybody, I'd like to introduce Alexis, she's going to be joining us tonight.
So that way we'll all have partners.
That's great!
Dot, you won't need the Swiffer.
I guess I'll be dancing with Ted.
I thought Carol assigns the dance partners.
We'll all get a chance to dance with Ted.
Everyone up!
Come on.
This is actually very cute.
Although I did think that there would be more of them.
Yeah, well there used to be, but... you know.
Oh, okay, but these ones actually smell like very clean, like baby powder.
Yeah, I think it's probably better if you call the girls by their names.
Ted, could you give me a hand with these chairs here?
Of course!
We've heard a lot about you.
That is so sweet.
Why would he bring her here?
Are you talking about me?
You can be my dance partner, dear.
Dot.
Does Dot have arthritis?
Because it looks like she's giving me the finger.
Well, she has arthritis, but not in that hand.
Full house.
Read 'em and weep.
And I think I come in second because I got a pair of Queens.
There's no second place, Roland.
Well, you were right about Bob.
He's quite the player.
I'll go see if Gwen's has any more of these bacon-wrapped scallops.
Yeah, I guess it's another trip to Bob's laundromat, right?
You know, because he keeps taking us to the cleaners.
Yeah, we get it, Roland.
I don't think it's an accident that Bob keeps winning.
What are you talking about?
Haven't you noticed how Gwen circles the table with appetizers, constantly eying Bob.
Then he lays down a big fat bet and wins.
You know, come to think of it, those matching visors they're a little suspicious
I don't want to believe this,
But ah, I do miss my wristwatch.
I just think it'd be interesting to see what happens if Gwen wasn't around for the next hand.
Ahhh.
Like if she had an "accident" or something?
I don't mean bump her off, Roland.
I mean, if she's not here, if she had to go to the store.
I want to see how Bob's luck gonna hold if when Gwen's not here.
It's worth a shot.
Okay, uh, do you want me to handle this?
I'm pretty good in high-stakes situations.
No.
I think, I've got it.
Okay.
Well, I'll ride shotgun with you.
So Bob.
Were just talking about how delicious the food is and you know the only thing missing is...
Gwen's gotta go!
I think what Roland is saying is... if she could maybe go to the store to perhaps pick up some a little more...
Kosher?
And halal.
Gwen, you called it!
Yeah.
Sure.
Sure.
That would do it.
Yeah and some gluten-free options, for the ladies.
Oh Gosh,
I'm sorry I didn't think of this.
But you know, maybe...
maybe Roland could go?
He's running pretty low on chips.
Sure.
I can drive.
I don't think you want to drive, Roland.
I don't mind.
I love driving.
I don't think you do.
Yeah, I don't love driving.
Not at night.
No!
And I'm drunk.
Okay.
I'm all right, dear.
I could go.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Good.
All right, so my deal.
David.
I'm glad you're here.
Come in.
Um yeah, I was just getting a drink... by the uh... the vending machine... so...
I had a prolific day with your mother today.
Yes she said.
Very excited about the shoot.
The photos are really haunting.
Haunting.
Sure she'd be thrilled about that adjective.
Umm, she told me this little... trip was supposed to be more of a creative discussion.
David, your Mother is a revelation.
This is the way she was meant to be presented to the world.
I'm sorry.
Is this you deciding what someone else wants again?
I-I want you to know that I care about what happened between you and me.
And while my therapist said I should never feel sorrow,
I do appreciate your pain.
Okay.
And I wanna explore that.
Uh-huh.
Maybe... even... physically.
Oh...
Well, I shouldn't.
Oh you should.
Okay, fine, but um, I can't stay.
Um, okay...
Joan, I'm probably wrong, but I feel like the other ladies are very... un-soothed by the fact that I'm here.
Oh they are, but don't worry.
It's just that we've just all grown very fond Of Ted.
Oh well... we're not dating.
But I do understand that old women can get very possessive about young... younger...
Dear, we know all about the failed engagements.
But don't worry,
I'm not going to rake you over the coals to find out how on earth you ever let that one get away.
Or why?
Okay...
It's none of my business and I'm sure you have your reasons.
I'd just want to know what they are?
Aggressive move, Joan.
Well, I've been trying to set Ted up with my granddaughter
For two years now.
And nothing.
Do you want me to put in a good word?
It wouldn't matter.
And you know why?
Is she not cute?
She's not you.
You must know that Ted is still stuck on you.
I think you ladies are just a little bit confused.
Ted and I are just very close friends.
Hm.
My husband and I were really close friends for 52 years.
Mind if I cut in?
Oh, yeah.
But I'm also happy to keep dancing with one of them.
No, I meant I could dance with Joan.
Just the ladies get pretty upset if I don't divide my time between them.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah...
Uh...
Well then I will dance with Dot!
I would rather dance with the Swiffer.
Okay...
Oh, I can't believe I took that with three sevens.
Well, I guess it wasn't Gwen, was it, Johnny?
Sorry?
Nothing, nothing, Bob.
Well, uh, Johnny had this theory that Gwen and you were...
Johnny, why don't you tell Bob your theory.
Well, Uh...
You thought we were cheating?
No!
No...
I
No offense, but I don't need to cheat to beat any of you.
It's just, you win a lot, Bob.
And there's a reason for that.
Listen now Ronnie, when you - when you have a good hand, you close your cards real quick.
And Ray, when you've got a bad hand, you start tapping your foot.
And Johnny your right eyebrow kind of just pops up
And Roland... well, you know...
I don't even know if you know the rules.
I don't know all of them.
No.
Well you know, truth is we put most of the winnings towards the snacks that Gwen serves up.
We thought it was kind of a special evening for everyone.
In my defense, I didn't believed any of this, Bob.
Gwen is very trustworthy.
- Ray, you're tapping your foot.
- Okay.
- Moira
- Good morning, Sebastien.
I was up all night evaluating our little project and I've come to the unfortunate conclusion that you may have misrepresented your intentions.
I wanted to capture the real Moira Rose.
Does the real Moira Rose live in a studio?
Or the Palazzo?
I have.
And I will again.
If you're planning to capitalize on those images...
You just have to trust me.
With this work you will, once again, sit atop the summit of cultural conversation, with your inspired unfettering.
Oh, I'd love to believe you, but there's a big fat line between charm and bullshit.
Give me your camera.
David?
!
Umm, yes Sebastien and I just had some um, stuff that we needed to talk about.
Well, I'm having a hard time landing on surprise or betrayal.
Yeah, I should probably go.
So...
Give me the memory card, Sebastien.
Moira, I'm scared for us.
Oh, you mean this memory card?
Yeah, I'd give it back, but I don't think it'll be of much use to you.
It accidentally fell out of your camera into my hand last night.
And then fell out of my hand into my drink.
And then I stepped on it a lot.
So...
It was really good to see you, Sebastien.
Good luck with the rest of this project.
David, I feel terrible that you had to do that just for me.
It wasn't just for you.
Let's just say we both won.
Okay folks, we're going to start with something a little different tonight.
The game is called crazy eights.
And the diamond shaped things are wild.
Roland, shush.
Well I'm just glad we're back here again, and that we could put all that unpleasantness behind us.
Gwen, these Teriyaki meatballs they're delicious.
Wow and those sliders look incredible.
Those aren't for you.
How's that watch working out for you?
I love it.
Thanks.
Johnny...
Joahnny...
Family!
I have exciting news!
Oh Good.
David, I hoped you were home.
Thanks.
You're aware of the extraordinary work of New York-Based photographer Sebastien Raine?

I'll go see if Gwen's has any more of these bacon-wrapped scallops.
Yeah, I guess it's another trip to Bob's laundromat, right?
You know, because he keeps taking us to the cleaners.
Yeah, we get it, Roland.
I don't think it's an accident that Bob keeps winning.
What are you talking about?
Haven't you noticed how Gwen circles the table with appetizers, constantly eying Bob.
Then he lays down a big fat bet and wins.
You know, come to think of it, those matching visors they're a little suspicious
I don't want to believe this,
But ah, I do miss my wristwatch.
I just think it'd be interesting to see what happens if Gwen wasn't around for the next hand.
Ahhh.
Like if she had an "accident" or something?
I don't mean bump her off, Roland.
I mean, if she's not here, if she had to go to the store.
I want to see how Bob's luck gonna hold if when Gwen's not here.
It's worth a shot.
Okay, uh, do you want me to handle this?
I'm pretty good in high-stakes situations.
No.
I think, I've got it.
Okay.
Well, I'll ride shotgun with you.
So Bob.
Were just talking about how delicious the food is and you know the only thing missing is...
Gwen's gotta go!
I think what Roland is saying is... if she could maybe go to the store to perhaps pick up some a little more...
Kosher?
And halal.
Gwen, you called it!
Yeah.
Sure.
Sure.
That would do it.
Yeah and some gluten-free options, for the ladies.
Oh Gosh,
I'm sorry I didn't think of this.
But you know, maybe...
maybe Roland could go?
He's running pretty low on chips.
Sure.
I can drive.
I don't think you want to drive, Roland.
I don't mind.
I love driving.
I don't think you do.
Yeah, I don't love driving.
Not at night.
No!
And I'm drunk.
Okay.
I'm all right, dear.
I could go.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Good.
All right, so my deal.
- (Crickets chirp) - (Knock on door)
David.
I'm glad you're here.
Come in.
Um yeah, I was just getting a drink... by the uh... the vending machine... so...
I had a prolific day with your mother today.
Yes she said.
Very excited about the shoot.
The photos are really haunting.
Haunting.
Sure she'd be thrilled about that adjective.
Umm, she told me this little... trip was supposed to be more of a creative discussion.
David, your Mother is a revelation.
This is the way she was meant to be presented to the world.
I'm sorry.
Is this you deciding what someone else wants again?
(Exhales) I-I want you to know that I care about what happened between you and me.
And while my therapist said I should never feel sorrow,
I do appreciate your pain.
Okay.
And I wanna explore that.
Uh-huh.
Maybe... even... physically.
Oh...
Well, I shouldn't.
Oh you should.
Okay, fine, but um, I can't stay.
(Slow Jazz tune plays)
Um, okay...
Joan, I'm probably wrong, but I feel like the other ladies are very... un-soothed by the fact that I'm here.
Oh they are, but don't worry.
It's just that we've just all grown very fond Of Ted.
Oh well... we're not dating.
But I do understand that old women can get very possessive about young... younger...
Dear, we know all about the failed engagements.
But don't worry,
I'm not going to rake you over the coals to find out how on earth you ever let that one get away.
Or why?
Okay...
It's none of my business and I'm sure you have your reasons.
I'd just want to know what they are?
Aggressive move, Joan.
Well, I've been trying to set Ted up with my granddaughter
For two years now.
And nothing.
Do you want me to put in a good word?
It wouldn't matter.
And you know why?
Is she not cute?
She's not you.
You must know that Ted is still stuck on you.
I think you ladies are just a little bit confused.
Ted and I are just very close friends.
Hm.
My husband and I were really close friends for 52 years.
♪
Mind if I cut in?
Oh, yeah.
But I'm also happy to keep dancing with one of them.
No, I meant I could dance with Joan.
Just the ladies get pretty upset if I don't divide my time between them.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah...
Uh...
Well then I will dance with Dot!
I would rather dance with the Swiffer.
Okay... (Slow Jazz tune plays)
Oh, I can't believe I took that with three sevens.
Well, I guess it wasn't Gwen, was it, Johnny?
Sorry?
Nothing, nothing, Bob.
Well, uh, Johnny had this theory that Gwen and you were...
Johnny, why don't you tell Bob your theory.
(Crickets chirp)
Well, Uh...
You thought we were cheating?
No!
No...
I
No offense, but I don't need to cheat to beat any of you.
It's just, you win a lot, Bob.
And there's a reason for that.
Listen now Ronnie, when you - when you have a good hand, you close your cards real quick.
And Ray, when you've got a bad hand, you start tapping your foot.
And Johnny your right eyebrow kind of just pops up
And Roland... well, you know...
I don't even know if you know the rules.
I don't know all of them.
No.
Well you know, truth is we put most of the winnings towards the snacks that Gwen serves up.
We thought it was kind of a special evening for everyone.
In my defense, I didn't believed any of this, Bob.
(Foot tapping) Gwen is very trustworthy.
- Ray, you're tapping your foot.
- Okay.
♪
(Kicking thud)
(Door opens)
- Moira
- Good morning, Sebastien.
I was up all night evaluating our little project and I've come to the unfortunate conclusion that you may have misrepresented your intentions.
I wanted to capture the real Moira Rose.
Does the real Moira Rose live in a studio?
Or the Palazzo?
I have.
And I will again.
If you're planning to capitalize on those images...
You just have to trust me.
With this work you will, once again, sit atop the summit of cultural conversation, with your inspired unfettering.
Oh, I'd love to believe you, but there's a big fat line between charm and bullshit.
- Give me your camera.
- (Door opens)
David?
!
Umm, yes Sebastien and I just had some um, stuff that we needed to talk about.
Well, I'm having a hard time landing on surprise or betrayal.
Yeah, I should probably go.
So...
Give me the memory card, Sebastien.
Moira, I'm scared for us.
Oh, you mean this memory card?
Yeah, I'd give it back, but I don't think it'll be of much use to you.
It accidentally fell out of your camera into my hand last night.
And then fell out of my hand into my drink.
And then I stepped on it a lot.
So...
It was really good to see you, Sebastien.
Good luck with the rest of this project.
David, I feel terrible that you had to do that just for me.
It wasn't just for you.
Let's just say we both won.
Okay folks, we're going to start with something a little different tonight.
The game is called crazy eights.
And the diamond shaped things are wild.
Roland, shush.
Well I'm just glad we're back here again, and that we could put all that unpleasantness behind us.
Gwen, these Teriyaki meatballs they're delicious.
Wow and those sliders look incredible.
Those aren't for you.
How's that watch working out for you?
I love it.
Thanks.
(Roland teasing quietly):
Johnny...
Joahnny... (Amused chuckle) [knocking]
With every roar of an engine and turn of a steering wheel, there is an undeniabl e expression of artistry.
Everything has bee n louvered, channeled, manipulated, and blended.
A craftsman's ey e for precision and a designer's obsessio n with perfection.
It's sort of timeless design, and it's just pure design.
And there's n o greater example of this than the handmade automobile.
I'm gonna go build my own car.
Tonight we'll explor e the dying art of working with your hands.
I just had to get a car, cut it up, mess it up, keep going, and keep learning.
Creating oneofakind work s of automotive design.
The only two things that are not modified on the car are the doors.
From the highend worl d of bespoke luxury...
It has a massage button right here.
To the, , not so highend world of buildityourself kit cars.
Get me out of this thing!
Now, these vehicle s can look unpolished...
Stuff like this is only old once.
They can be impractical...
- Guess there's no seatbelts.
- We are the airbags.
And even slow...
Watch when I step on it.
But there all as unique as the builder's own fingerprints.
Go for it.
Don't make excuses.
Just do it.
This is my 1931 Shotwell, built by a 17yearold kid named Robert Shotwell.
The reason I'm driving it is because this episode is called "Handmade."
When Bob built this in 1931, it was the heigh t of the Depression.
His family was broke.
He told his father he wanted a car.
His father said, "You want a car?
Why don't you go build one?"
So he went down to the junkyard.
He found an Indian motorcycle 4cylinder engine.
He got some Model A parts, some Model T parts, some angle iron, and he built this car.
This is what people did before Netflix.
They actually made stuff.
Right now I'm on my way to the Old Crow Speed Shop in Burbank, California, not far from my shop.
Today you're gonna see a garage filled with homemade stuff from almost every era, from today all the way back to the '20s, and even before that.
Come on, let's go check it out.
Hey, Bobby.
I love this car.
This is a great car.
Yeah, you don't have to get out of it.
Good to see you.
- Good to see you.
- You too.
Welcome t o Old Crow Speed Shop, were my friend Bobby Green stores his vintage car s and motorcycles.
You know, my favorite thing about this place is, it looks like a closed in 1939 and then just kind of opened a couple of years ago.
I've been collecting for probably 30 years.
So, after cramming garagefulls at my house,
I finally had to get a shop where I could start growing.
Most guys call that divorce.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, same thing.
Bobby was born in the 1970s, just about the same tim e I got these jeans.
But he has the sou I and the style of someone from the 1940s.
His whole life is vintage.
Bobby run s The Race of Gentlemen, and annual competitio n of prewar vintage cars held on the beache s of Wildwood, New Jersey.
And he also own s several bars across L.A.
known for their throwback vibe.
It's like he lives in a worl d where FDR was just reelected.
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
So how did you get into this?
I just remember being probably 12 years old and seeing some '50s cars driving down Ventura Boulevard.
I just knew instantly, that's what I want to be into.
All your stuff seems to be, get it to mechanical perfection, running, and then just walk away and leave the aesthetics to somebody else.
Yeah, I've never been the polish and show type of guy.
- Really?
- Yeah, can't you tell?
Welcome to the club.
Now, this car here looks like a perfect example of what you're talking about.
Yeah, this is the most beautiful thing I've ever found.
A Whippet.
Yeah, it's a '20s Whippet.
Came out of a farm in Minnesota.
It was a little racecar.
And no one has any history on it.
We built the motor.
We did some interior work.
We did some wiring, the gas, just enough to make it run.
Stuff like this is only old once.
Right.
If you go and restore this, it's never the same again.
This is an unusual motor.
What is this?
So this is a '32 Ford Model B.
Okay, with the overhead conversion kit on it.
Exactly.
Now, this is the motor that we run in the Old Crow, in the belly tank.
And explain to folks what a belly tanker is.
So these were gas tanks that they would strap to the bottom of World War II airplanes.
All the teenagers that were hotrodding before World War II all went off to war, and then they see these things, and they think, wow, this is aerodynamic.
I'm gonna make a car out of It and try to go faste r than I did in my roadster.
Right, right, and they're aluminum, not steel, correct?
Right, aluminum, lightweight, completely handbuilt from scratch.
PostWorld War II was a tim e when Americans believed that, with a little ingenuit y and a lot of hard work, anything was possible.
And these handmad e belly tankers are a perfect example of that.
You know, there's an old expression.
The heart is happiest when the head and the hand work together.
I agree with that.
Because you're using everything.
You're using your mind, and you're using your hands.
You know, people just sit and do this all day.
They don't fix anything.
So true, they never connect with their machine.
Yeah.
So we got to try to get you in one of these, Jay, and hit the Dry Lake.
Well, Bobby and I are out here at the Rabbit Dry Lake, which is aptly named.
There's no rabbits and there's no Lake.
They should have named it the Windy Dry Lake.
My hair is just a mess, as you can see.
It's normally so nice.
You know, one thing I discovered pretty early, if you're going to be a belly racer, you can't have actual belly.
I couldn't even get in it.
I couldn't fit.
I was so disappointed.
Even using Vaseline and tire tools,
I couldn't get in the thing.
They're small, and you've got to be smal I to get in it.
But again, this one, no safety equipment, no roll bar.
No, your head just sticks out of a hole.
If it flips over, you break your neck.
Yeah, well, they were kind of coined the flying guillotine.
The flying guillotine, yeah.
Because you can see why.
Yeah, tell your insurance company that.
This is exactly the cars that ran in the period, and exactly the same place.
And we're gonna run them today?
Were gonna do it today, yeah.
Now, since these belly cars are mean t to just go fast and straight, many were bull t without even a low gear.
So, to get Bobby's car up to speed,
I'm getting behind the wheel of this 1939 Ford pickup truck to give him a little push.
You think this place is lonely now?
Imagine it back in the '40s and '50s.
No cell phones, no telephones, there's nothing out here.
So if something happens, you're on your own, pal.
The nice thing about these belly tanks is, you just put handles on them, and the pallbearers can just dump the whole thing right in the ground.
You never have to leave it.
This is exactly how it was in the old days.
There's nothing aroun d to gauge your speed.
You're not whizzing g past telephone poles or anything like that.
So it can be very deceptive.
I'll get Bobby ou t to about 40 miles an hour and set him off.
You know, I wish I could fi t in one of these cars.
It looks incredible.
Looks really cool from where I'm driving.
You know, it really doesn't get more handmade than this, the car you built yourself using parts you found in a junkyard for a couple hundred bucks.
Sure, it's about how fast you go, but it's more about how well you made it.
Coming up, the luxury sid e of handmade.
It has a massage button right here.
It says "happy ending."
How does that work?
The car I'm driving right now, a 19243liter Bentley.
Actually, to be more specific, it's a 3liter Bentley chassis with an 8liter Bentley engine.
When W.O. Bentley built his cars, he built them to be racecars.
They were fast.
They were powerful.
They're still one of the greatest English sports cars.
And all Bentley s were essentially handmade.
Bentley's client s were pretty wealthy, and the cars were bull t almost without regard to cost.
Every one was individual.
It was always buil t to the client's desire.
If you wanted to Bentley with a big heavy limousine body on it, they'd build you that.
If you want a racecar like the ones that won at Le Mans five or six times, he would build you that.
And that's a tradition that continues to this very day.
You go into a Bentley dealership, and they'll show you leather samples, and how would you like your interior, and what kind of wheels would you want, and you can design the car the way you like it.
In fact, right now I'm on my way to see fellow comedian Russell Peters.
He's a big car aficionado, and he likes his cars built the Russell Peters way.
And we're gonna see what his tastes are.
Come on, this will be fun.
Russalot!
- Jay!
- Good to see you, my friend.
How are you?
I'm glad this made it.
Russell Peters is probabl y the most successful comedian you've never heard of.
He's from Canad a and known the world over for his hilariou s standup comedy specials.
There are no professionals in my family on either side, just a bunch of dummies.
You know what I mean?
My mom worked in Kmart.
I never really understood what my dad did, though.
I remember I was 5 years old, I go, "What you do?"
"I work at a chicken plant."
And then he left.
I'm 5 years old.
I can't comprehend what a chicken plant is.
For the next seven years,
I told people that my dad planted chickens.
Now Russell seem s to be accumulating quite a collection.
They've all go t one thing in common.
They're all about luxury.
That's the Bentley I've been hearing about.
Yes.
This is not as graceful to get out of is that Bentley.
No, you look good.
This is the more sporting car.
I would say.
This is the 2015 Bentley Flying Spur.
Flying Spur, I had one of those in my leg once.
Hey.
Very nice.
I like the wheels.
Yeah, I did pick that on my own.
You must have been exhausted.
Two options, I believe.
And then I went for the gangster red interior.
Very nice, I like all the stitching.
Yeah, I like the white and the red contrast.
So that's sort of bespoke.
You order that, and you...
Yeah.
Sit with the auto book.
And then I've seen a lot of these with the dark wood interior.
I went for the lightskinned wood.
I don't really know what that's called.
That's called being racist.
Well, I think it's been racially specific.
Yeah.
And now, these really make me...
Can I pull this one out?
Yeah, absolutely.
Look at this.
This is the floor mat.
It's very soft.
It is very lovely.
Wonderful thing, this is.
And that also shows that I'm not wearing any makeup.
Yes, this is a natural beauty.
You can't get this in a nonbespoke car.
You actually went out of your way to get this.
Well, it was an option, and I said I'll take as much as I can get.
I mean, it's actually a really beautiful interior.
It is quite nice.
One day, a vegan friend of mine was driving in it, and she said that it smelled like death in there because of all the leather.
Yeah, that's the trouble with driving vegans in a car like this.
Now, do you have the Hello Kitty red floor mats in this one?
Absolutely, and then it's got the tables.
The rear picnic tables.
The rear tables, yeah.
But I love that you can actually move the rear seat.
Yes.
We have to show you doing that.
Sit in there.
Let me get in there and do that.
Bring the camera around.
Here we go.
So, you know, you're sitting in the back.
You want to get a little more comfortable.
You slide yourself forward.
See, this is for people whose buttocks are so large, they cannot move them under their own power, so that have a huge motor here to move the buttock area for you, back and forth.
See how good this is?
Yeah.
Now I can just recline.
And it goes back as well.
Yeah.
And it has massage button right here.
It says "happy ending."
How does that work?
Well, what happens is, the table...
Never mind, we won't go there.
All right, enough chitchat.
Let's take a rid e in the greatgreatgrandfather of Russell's Bentley.
Guess there's no seatbelts, ?
No seatbelts?
We are the airbags.
Our job is to protect the car from being damaged.
The cool ocean air.
Good thing I don't have a toupee.
Obviously this Bentle y doesn't have massaging chairs, but that means the bod y only weighs 75 pounds.
For a 100yearold car, this thing could really fly.
So what was your first car?
Obviously you like the Bentleys.
You like the highend stuff.
What was your first car?
My first ca r was a 1992 Saturn.
I'm sorry.
I wouldn't have asked.
It only had the one mirror.
To have a second mirror was an option.
It didn't have airconditioning, didn't have a stereo.
But it had the automatic seatbelts.
Well, there you go.
And that, to me, was everything.
Yeah, yeah, that was the key.
What was the car that said, "I've made it"?
When I moved to America and I bought a Porsche Cayenne Turbo.
Wow.
That was my first ca r in America.
So you never got into the old cars?
You never wanted an old MG or a Triumph or an early Mustang or anything like that?
The problem is, I really appreciate those cars, but you need to know a little bit more about cars than I know.
Yeah, yeah.
Because if something goes wrong or it's making a knocking noise, I'm gonna panic.
Okay.
Somebody once described you as the most successful comedian most people have never heard of.
Is that fair or unfair?
You know, I mean, it's fair.
I'd rather be famous and unknown than famous and untalented.
Yeah, well, there you go.
I get to go to places most comics don't ever get to go to.
And when I go to the Middle East,
I'm not performing for the troops;
I'm performing for the...
The terrorists, is that right?
Yeah.
I know you did that the ISIS show.
I understand they were thrilled.
Yeah.
They even corrected me.
They said it's "is is."
They've been misunderstood the whole time.
Now, is it true... and I was always wondering this about you.
Yeah?
I heard that you never, ever spent any of the money you made on "The Tonight Show."
No, never.
Never touched it to this day.
To this day, that's incredible.
You know, I consider myself a standup, so I like to live on the money I make in standup.
When I was a kid, I always had two jobs.
The job I made the most money at, I'd save, and then I try to live on the other money.
And that worked for me.
That's actually a really cool thing to do.
Now, you seem to do the opposite.
You take one job and then just spend all the money.
I sure do.
Well, this is my problem, Jay.
You know, as they said on the "Chappelle's Show,"
they should've never given me money.
Right, yeah.
Well, congratulations on all your success.
Thank you, Jay, I appreciate it.
Good job.
And I'm glad to do the show, because I've been watching it for a while.
Yeah, and you get to drive in a real Bentley, not one of those fancyass Bentleys you got.
Yeah!
Coming up, we try and stum p a professional car nerd.
But it's got very good airconditioning.
German?
Yes, it is cool air.
I feel so Alpine in this, yeah.
Just feel so alpine in this car.
It's time for another episod e of Stump a Car Nerd.
Welcome to another episode of Stump a Car Nerd:
Professional Edition.
This time, we have our own Donald Osborne, professional appraiser.
And we wanted to find three cars that could stump Donald.
You ready to try this, Donald?
I'm terrified, Jay.
All right, here, let's put on your blindfold.
Put your glasses away.
We don't even need a blindfold.
Here you go.
Jay, you still here?
Put on your training bra.
Okay, yup.
I'm gonna take your word for it.
You can't see, is that correct?
I can see absolutely nothing.
Okay, all right.
May we see our first car?
I've chose n some of the hardest cars
I could find to stump Donald.
All right, I'm gonna guide you towards it.
Let's star t with the 2006 Panoz coupe.
Panoz is a tin y American car company that makes custo m highperformance sports cars.
This car's got the reliabilit y of a Mustang V-8 with personalized styling to make it a tru e oneofakind.
Donald, first impression, classic or modern?
Modern, and it's a performance car, because we are definitely being held in by these seats.
Interesting guess.
Definitely an American engine.
There's no doubt about that.
American engine is correct.
This is got to be a Dodge Viper coupe.
No, not even close, my friend.
This is a handmade car.
It'd be fair to say boutique manufacturer.
Okay.
My first thought is that it's an American manufacturer.
Okay, first thought is correct.
Okay, American engine, handmade, it's a full coupe.
Is it manufactured on the East or West Coast?
It's not on any coast, really.
Okay.
It's somewhere...
The Panoz!
Panoz is correct.
Very good, Donald.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Yes!
You may remove the blindfold.
Yes.
Very good, very good.
Fantastic.
I would contend there are people who are car fans who are watching this program might not recognize that, because this is such a limited production automobile, built, I believe, in Atlanta.
- Yes, exactly.
- Atlanta, Georgia.
That was the kickoff.
When it wasn't East Coast or West Coast,
I said, it can only be Panoz.
Let's move on to car number two.
I sense a door opening.
Very perceptive.
This I s a 2010 Morgan Aero Super Sport, a car that combine s German engineering with classi c English craftsmanship.
It's made b y the Morgan motor company, which started back in 1909, making it one o f the oldest automobile companies still in existence.
In fact, the factor y is still overseen by members of the original Morgan family.
My gosh.
Apparently a very humorous car.
It is.
Must be owned by comedian.
All right, here we go.
Comfortable car.
Yeah, it's built for the narrower of hip
- than our last car.
- Right.
When it comes to hip, you are the man.
I am so hip.
Continuing our handmade theme.
That is the one thing all three cars having common today.
They are handmade.
This car does not feel American.
Why doesn't it feel American?
American cars aren't as nervous as this car is.
Let's step on it a little bit and see what it does.
It's got a lot of power, and it's got a really deep exhaust note.
But it doesn't scream, so it's not Italian.
But is got very good airconditioning.
German?
Is the airconditioning German?
Is that what you're asking?
Yes, is the airconditioning German?
I believe it is.
Yes, it is cool air.
It is cool air, yeah?
It is very cool air, as cool as the mountains in Germany.
I feel so Alpine in this, yeah.
Just feel so alpine in this car.
The roof panels must come off.
Yeah, well, feel to the front.
I feel the handles.
If I release these handles now...
We're about to be hit by a train!
So, fair to say Targa Topped car.
Targa Topped car, indeed.
We've got removable tops.
We have quilting.
The car's frontengined, rearwheel drive.
That is correct.
I know exactly what this is.
It's the Morgan Aero 8.
It's the Morgan Aero 8.
That is correct!
What we got from Dicker and Dicker of Beverly Hills?
My gosh, I wanted that.
A case of Turtle Wax.
All right, let's go to car number three.
All right, come along in here.
Okay.
Here we go.
Our final car, 1951 Muntz Jet, a flashy ca r made by a flashy guy known as Madman Muntz, known fo r his wacky TV commercials selling TVs and radios.
If someone back in the '50 s wanted something new and showy, they got a Muntz.
Pretty dark in here.
There's a clue.
What's the clue?
It's got an antenna, so it's not a new car.
All right.
And it's got a soft top.
Right, watch your head.
Ooh, definitely vintage.
All right, let's take him for a ride.
Okay, Donald, initial impression, anything?
Early '50s, early, mid-'50s.
Early to mid-'50s, interesting.
And American.
Why American?
Well, the engine sounds like a big American V8, and it also smells like an old American car.
Smells like... what does that smell like, exactly?
Is it of Hai Karate?
I mean, what does it smell like?
Wow, what's that aftershave you're wearing?
Ha!
Be careful how you use it.
It's slightly musty, but it's not old leather;
It's old plastic.
Okay, the guy just picked up his cell phone,
"Leno has a black man blindfolded in his car."
Amber alert.
We're gonna get pulled over by the cops.
Any other clues?
It's very interesting, because this is a soft top, but it does not feel like a convertible top.
Interesting.
What does that tell you?
That makes me think that it's some kind of a Carson Top.
Do you think the top comes off?
I think the top comes off.
Do you feel you're about to venture a guess?
I'm about to venture a guess.
So far, your two for two.
If you get this right, you'll be the alltime winner.
If not, another alsoran.
What is your guess?
Well, Jay, is this, by any chance, a Muntz Jet?
That is correct!
It is a Muntz Jet, very good.
Whoohoo!
I think these are among the coolest cars ever created.
Well, this car has a celebrity connection.
It was owned by Mickey Rooney.
Mickey Rooney.
I can't imagine Mickey Rooney actually sitting in a car this big.
Well, not without a booster seat.
Coming up, personalize d Porsches unlike any other.
The car was originally a sunroofed car.
I just don't like sunroofs.
You're English.
Sun!
Agh!
Agh!
I knew I should've called first.
I'll never get a seat now.
Hey, Jay, great to see you.
Hello there, mate, good to see you.
Good to see you, man;
Very, very good.
How was your drive up?
Very nice, actually.
It's a spectacular road to drive on.
It really is.
Magnus Walke r is a living example of,
"Never judge a boo k by its cover,"
because Magnu s is one of the world's preeminent Porsche collectors, known for turnin g vintage Porsches into oneofakind work s of handmade art.
For me, my inspiration comes from the late '60s, early '70s, which I think is Porsche's sort of milestone of racing.
Right.
And I just throw those influences in a blender, and out comes my sort of artistic interpretation of my ideal 911.
Back in 1992, he founded a very successful handmade clothing company, and that eventuall y afforded him the chance to live ou t his childhood dream of curating the ultimat e early Porsche 911 collection.
This episode is all about handmade, because the era of modifying cars mechanically is kind of going away.
I mean, you go to a parts store now, and it's just air fresheners and, you know, trinkets, and they don't sell performance parts anymore.
So you wind up modifying your car visually.
And that's what you really enjoy, isn't it?
Yeah, I mean, for me, the great thing about being in L.A.
is the accessibility to a vast pool of talented craftsmen that enable me to sort of interpret my vision into the early Porsche 911s that I love to drive and collect.
And this 1990964 Porsch e really captures Magnus's singular visio n of his ideal car.
So tell our audience what we have here.
Essentially, Jay, the only two things that are not modified on the car are the doors.
But the sort of real key features are the louvered fenders, the channeled hood, the front bumper was modified, and the channeled roof.
So everything has sort of been louvered, stretched, channeled, manipulated, and blended to the point where there's not really a square edge on the car.
The car was originally a sunroofed car.
I had this whole custom roof section fabricated.
And why did you want to delete the sunroof?
I just don't like sunroofs.
I'm a tall guy.
There's less headroom.
And you're also wearing a hat.
Yeah, something about being in the wind, so I've always got the hat on.
And you're English.
Sun!
Agh!
Agh!
Sun!
Put your hand inside and feel the roof.
There's no headliner, but it's skinned in leather.
I see, very nice, yeah, yeah.
And then everything's been stretched.
The fenders are stretched.
So you got a wider tire in the back.
Slightly wider tire.
Now, you have this Plexiglas window here, but obviously there's no way to close the vent, is there?
No, no way.
I mean, this is just an aesthetic touch.
It's a little bit of weightsaving.
Every little bit adds up.
- And you're a style guy.
- I'm a style guy.
I'm all about the beard, as you know.
Whether it's freezing or 120 degrees...
This is essentially how I look.
This is exactly how you look, exactly.
I don't really change my look.
Let's go for a ride.
I like that shortthrow shifter.
Yeah, it's pretty precise.
Physically, it's the right size for a sports car.
Sports cars really shouldn't be much bigger than this.
On so many modern sports cars, the roof is so low, you lose all of this, you know...
Visual outlook, yeah, all that headroom.
Seating position's low, and it just sort of fits you like a glove.
And I like preairba g steering wheels.
I don't like a lot of buttons.
If I want to turn on the radio, I'll reach over.
Less is more, in this capacity.
Sounds good, feels good.
Why don't you step on it?
So what was your first car?
What was the first car you had when you came to California?
Well, wait for it.
Believe it or not, 1977 Toyota Corolla.
Wow.
Bought it for 200 bucks.
200 bucks?
$200, yeah.
And I took my California driver's license in that car.
Hilarious.
For a look at som e of his other car creations, let's go into Magnus's garage, where the handmade magi c really happens.
Wow.
There you go, James Bond style.
Magnus converted thi s warehouse in downtown L.A., which is no w where he works, lives, and store s his incredible collection of personalized Porsches.
Look at that right there.
Look at that guy.
This is a piece of memorabilia I would treasure to have.
That's one of my favorite pieces of memorabilia, right there.
Yeah, there you go.
Now, obviously, incredibly impressive collection.
But there's nothing like your first car.
What did you say it was again?
1977 Toyota Corolla 2TC was my first car.
Come on, let's take a look outside.
What you got out there?
Ho, look at that.
I thought you might want to...
Where did that just appear from?
This is the magic of television.
Relive the moment.
What you think?
It's great.
Mine was white, but this is, you know, the next best thing.
And it has the optional torn seat.
Yeah, I like that too.
This is awesome.
Try and find one of these.
You can find a zillion 911s.
This is pretty impressive, pretty impressive.
With the beard and everything,
I think this is more appropriate.
This could be a whole new look for me.
Ready to go for a ride?
I'm certainly ready to go for a ride.
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.
Now, with mor e than 43 million Corollas sold since 1966, it doesn't get any les s handmade than this thing.
This is like stepping back in time.
Doesn't drive bad, does it?
No, not at all.
I don't know if I want to go to Vegas in it, but around the block, grocery getter.
Yeah.
I like the precise steering.
It's like movie steering.
Yeah, exactly.
Definitely an emotional experience.
Yeah, yeah.
A little nostalgia.
I'm tearing up inside.
You never forget your first car.
No, it's like your first girlfriend.
I have no idea who my first girlfriend was.
Your don't remember your first girlfriend?
No, I don't.
I remember my first car.
I don't know who the hell she was, though.
So, Magnus, you seem pretty smitten by this thing.
Are the 911s out the window?
I think I'm done with those 911s.
Yeah.
I think I could be all about the Toyota Corolla.
You're a Corolla man now.
And listen, I'll take those cars off your hand.
Coming up.
I mean, this is a car you really bond with, because he built it yourself.
A drive with a legen d in the handmade car world.
Don't make excuses, and just do it.
And later...
I think my first tattoo, I was 9.
Who tattoos a 9yearold?
Why isn't that guy in jail?
The car I'm driving right now, a 1970 Monteverdi.
Now, you might not know this car, because it's handmade.
Now, there are a lot of reasons why you'd want to handmade car.
Maybe you want a certain level of quality.
Maybe there's a certain color that you have to have.
Or maybe you're just so mad at Enzo Ferrari, you say,
"I'm gonna go build my own car."
That's what Monteverdi did.
Monteverdi was a Swiss gentleman who had a sort of volcanic temperament, as a lot of these guys tended to.
He had a fight with Ferrari, and he said,
"I'ma gonna go build my own car."
That is not a Swiss accent, by the way.
That's more Italian.
The Monteverdi wa s what we called a hybrid, but not like a modern hybrid.
That meant you had an America n engine and drive train, but with classi c European styling and Borrani wire wheel s and an Italian body.
Right now I'm on my way to meet a man named Peter Giacobbi.
Now, Peter is well known in car circles as a designer and a stylist, and he's built his own car.
This is what you call handmade.
Whoa, look at that.
That is great.
Welcome to Scuderia Giacobbi, Senor Leno.
- What a car!
- Why, thank you.
I can remember that from the 1970 Torino Auto Show, the same show as when we first showed this car.
Yes, wow, boy, that's beautiful, isn't it?
Meet Peter Giacobbi, a worldrenowned enginee r in the handmade car world.
He's known primarily for designing and building g his own Ferrari, and not just any Ferrari, a Ferrari Testarossa.
But more on that later.
Back in the late 1960s,
Peter teamed up with legendar y car designer Tom Tjaarda to handbuild thi s revolutionary sports car.
The Sinthesis is spelled incorrectly on purpose because it's half Italian and half American.
The idea was, Italian design and American engineering.
It has a Lancia Flavia flat watercooled 4.
Okay.
As far as I know, it's the first car in the world with a flat watercooled 4 midengine.
And it is midengine, that's right, okay.
Because you'd think the engine would be here.
Yes.
Part of the design was so you couldn't tell where the engine was.
I mean, it still looks contemporary.
That's what I like about this era.
It sort of timeless design, and is just pure design.
This help me get the job with DeLorean.
Back in the 1970s, John DeLorean hired Peter to be his company's chief engineer to help build their iconic car.
Peter helped usher in a new er a of automotive design known as the wedge car, when concept s like the Lotus Esprit, the Lancia Stratos Zero, and the Lamborghini Countach signaled that the futur e had arrived.
Now, this is something else you built.
This is a real labor of love.
Now, I would say this car meets all the legal definitions of handmade, because this is just, every part of this vehicle is handmade.
Now, a Testarossa toda y is worth millions of dollars, but if you ask Peter, his handmade versio n is absolutely priceless, because he made it himself.
Just by chance, he found thi s allaluminum Testarossa body in a warehouse in Italy.
It never quite made I t to the factory.
It was just hanging ther e for the last 50 years up in the rafter s of the warehouse.
Peter knew it wa s his chance of a lifetime to make his dream Ferrar I come to life.
It's all Ferrari parts, and it looks very simila r to the original.
I mean, this is a car you really bond with, because you built it yourself.
Sadly, he got into an acciden t not too long ago and almost totaled the car.
What happened?
Somebody run into you, some idiot?
Yeah, it was just a normal traffic accident.
Well, it's nothing that can't be fixed, right?
No, it'll just take a little time.
In the meantime, we're gonna take this marriage of Italian desig n and American engineering for a ride around town.
This is the first time anybody else has ever driven it.
Is that right?
Well, thank you, that's quite an honor.
Safe to say this is the first car you built, correct?
That is correct.
So tell me what it was like that very first time starting and driving a car of your own design?
Is a like giving birth to a kid?
I just couldn't believe it was happening.
You know, it's a dream come true when you do it.
And, you know, there were a lot of things that weren't exactly right, but slowly but surely, you got them right.
It's hard to believe this car is almost 50 years old, because it doesn't feel 50 years old.
I mean it, it handles like a modern car.
Well, it has all the design principles that any modern car should have, or a racecar, really.
Right, and people have no idea what it is, do they?
No.
Well, my favorite are people who go,
"Yeah, my cousin has one of those."
Do you ever get that?
Yeah, "I haven't seen one of these in a long time."
Yeah.
Anything you would tell young people who want to become car designers or engineers like yourself?
Go for it.
Go for it.
Don't make excuses, and just do it.
Yeah.
Over the decades, there hav e been many different kit cars that range from the sublim e to the ridiculous.
And this one, well, this is kind of near the end of the range, if you kno w what I'm talking about.
The car I'm driving right now is a Bradley GT.
And this car meets the definition of handmade, assuming you had two left hands.
These were popular back in the '70s.
It's really just a kit car, but you build it yourself.
Back in the '70s, you could buy a secondhand Volkswagen for a couple of hundred dollars.
You took off the body, and Bradley would sell you this "GT" body.
And in the ad, they looked spectacular.
They had the gullwing door s and kind of a cool shape.
But then, when you saw it in person, it's like someone left the fiberglass mold too close the radiator and it got hot and the whole just melted, you know?
You look like a circus bear when you're driving it.
And your head is higher than the roof of the car, so it's almost like your head is a periscope.
And, boy, does this baby go.
Watch when I step on it.
I'm stepping on it!
Get me out of this thing!
You know handmade, bespoke automobiles aren't just for rich people.
I want to introduce you to a young man named Aaron Valencia.
And what he does is, he takes kids that have kind of lost their way.
Some are troubled youth.
Some are homeless.
Some have even had drug and alcohol problems.
And he teaches them a skill.
He teaches them to work with their hands.
You know, this is something that was prevalent when I was a kid, these afterschool programs.
And we just don't have enough of them anymore.
And, well, you'll meet him.
Come on inside.
Aaron?
Hey, how you doing, Jay?
Hey, Jay Leno, how you doing, my friend?
Thank you so much for coming through.
This is kind of a cool setup you got here.
Looks like everybody's working.
Yeah, everybody's busy.
Aaron Valencia is the founde r of Lost Angels, a charity he starte d a few years back that takes underprivileged kid s in Southern California and gives them the skills t o build their own cars by hand.
Let's go ahead and leave that alone for now.
Work on the spark plugs.
Every year, the car they bull d is raffled off to raise mone y for his afterschool programs.
It's just a fantastic idea that's both practica I and philanthropic.
What do we have here?
This our 1936 Ford fivewindow coupe.
This was our 2016 charity buil d giveaway project.
Very cool.
Yeah, tickets were 20 bucks, and some guy won this car.
Very nice.
Hi, guys.
Hi.
This is our motor department.
This is our little 350 engine.
Everybody looks so serious.
Yeah, motor work is serious business.
It is serious business.
Now, were you guys motorheads before you started this?
- You always been a car girl?
- Yeah.
So we're about ready for the carburetor, guys.
You just grab it out of the box, we can start putting the carburetor on and get ready.
We'll still keep pushing.
Keep up the good work, you guys.
See you in a little bit.
What do we got over here?
So this is our welding station.
All the kids, everybody learns how to do weld.
What are you doing?
Making a patch panel for the truck.
Very cool.
How long you been welding?
- For a while now.
- Yeah?
About to get certified.
You're gonna be certified soon?
- Yes, sir.
- That's fantastic.
That's really good.
- How old are you, Robert?
- 13.
13, all right, there you go.
I don't think I was welding at 13.
I wish I was.
I wasn't even saying, "You want fries with that?"
when I was 13, so, cool.
And I saw some cool rides outside.
What do we got out there?
We've got all of our previous giveaways.
This was our 1931 Ford Roadster.
Very nice.
- Oldschool?
- Yeah.
This was our 2014 giveaway project.
Steelbody car?
- Yeah.
- Wow.
All original.
That must have been tough, to give this one away.
- '51 Caddy?
- Yes, sir.
Very nice.
It's been chopped, hasn't it?
It's got a 2 1/2 inch chop, couple little custom touches.
But a Camaro front suspension, airbags in the rear.
Just a nice cruiser.
And this was another giveaway car?
This was last year's giveaway, 2016.
- Cool, cool.
- Yeah.
- Can we take it for a ride?
- Let's go.
So what's your background?
Were you always into cars as a kid?
No, I didn't grow up around cars.
I didn't know anything about it.
And I was actually getting some old tattoos covered up from a guy named Baby Ray in Hollywood.
And he had an old '54 Chevy, chop top, airbags.
Took me right around Hollywood.
And I couldn't sleep for a month.
I wanted to know everything about these sleds and custom cars.
And it just sent me in a whole different direction.
Now, how old were you when you had old tattoos?
I started getting tattoos when I was real young.
How young?
I think my first tattoo, I was 9.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Who tattoos a 9yearold?
Why isn't that guy in jail?
Me and my older brother tattooed ourselves.
Okay.
Because my mom had tattoos on her ankle, so we thought we couldn't get in trouble if we got tattoos on her ankles.
Yeah, it didn't go over very well.
We got whooped for that one.
So were you what we used to call a juvenile delinquent?
Yes, sir.
Yeah, in and out.
In and out of jail, running around, homeless, you know, addicted to drugs and alcohol, and all of that good stuff.
I got into rehab in 1999 and lived there for a year out in the Valley, and honestly never looked back to that life, and just been pushing, working, trying to do something positive.
I mean, it's a great success story, because so many people stumble, and, man, they just, for whatever reason, just can't get back up again, you know?
Yeah, a lot of these kids are going through the same struggles, no real direction, no dad showing them how to use a screwdriver, a lot of that stuff.
So we kind of come in like a big brother.
But I try to inspire them and see something else that they might not have thought was in their grasp, another life that's attainable.
Right, exactly, exactly.
It takes passionate guy s like Aaron to keep the handmad e tradition alive...
Come on, man.
And more program s like Lost Angels.
Hey, I want to say this guy's a real inspiration, and you kids are a real inspiration.
I'd like to donate $5,000 of my money to you.
No, come on, man, for real?
Thank you.
Seriously, guys, a round of applause for this guy right here.
- No, no, he's the one.
- No, thank you.
He's the one who really cares about you guys.
Hey, for real?
Hey, for real?
What?
The traditio n of building a car by hand takes a lot of skil I and ingenuity.
This is what people did before Netflix.
They actually made stuff.
But the most important thin g is the artistry.
The heart is happiest when the head and the hand work together.
I agree with you.
Having a creative spark that drives you to design a ca r no one has ever seen before...
My favorite is people go,
"Yeah, my cousin has one of those."
Or probably never see again.
Stuff like this is only old once.
Because a handmade car, no matter what it looks like...
Our job is to protect the car from being damaged.
It's alway s a rare thing of beauty.
Whoa!
Look at that.
I'm tearing up inside.
- Very good!
- Whoohoo!
These are among the coolest cars ever created.
_
D'oh!
George, I'm sorry to see you up here.
Well, yes, but I died for a worthy cause.
As we speak, my body is about to be dissected by a budding young scientist.
Let's observe the dedication to learning of this ten-year-old scholar by the name of Bart Simpson.
♪ Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab, die ♪
♪ Stab, stab, die, die, death, kill. ♪
Well, his passion is undeniable.
Yes, very... very impressive.
By examining my specimen's pyloric sphincter valve,
I deduced that she had an affinity for fruit flies.
By examining my specimen's natty dreads,
I was able to deduce that he was a jammin' Rasta-frogian.
My body, my little green body.
Okay, but surely his portrayal of Rastafarianism will be culturally sensitive.
Pass the Dutchie.
We be smokin' slabba slabba with the Babylon.
Ribbit, ribbit, mon.
Come now, George.
At least this Scottish groundskeeper will give your remains a respectful burial.
Into the crapper you go, useless froggy garbage.
Are you going to put a good spin on that, too?
Hmm?
Are you?
!
Well, are you?
Well, uh... ribbit?
I can't put these grades on the refrigerator.
I can't even put them on the garage refrigerator.
It's not my fault.
- I blame "so-key-ity."
- What?
!
You know, so-key-ity.
That's what everyone blames for everything.
You mean "society"?
- Yeah, that's the guy.
- Honey,
I know you're a bright boy, but if you don't try harder in school, you could end up not a success.
Oh, that.
Don't worry, Mom.
As long as I can stand on a corner and spin a sign reading "new condos,"
I'll be just fine.
All that pacing isn't gonna fix the boy.
Just get him some pills.
Two pinks and a blue, and it's off to the races.
Everything we've tried with Bart has failed.
What if there's nothing we can do?
Mm, "nothing we can do" is a whole lot better than "it'll take all we've got."
I wonder if anyone talks about parenting online.
Look at this one!
They're skiing.
Skiing means happy.
Hmm, an expert with a new book to promote.
Oh, I wonder if she'd be willing to speak to a group for a fee.
Getting your child established on the path to success isn't easy.
I was driving my daughter from her falconry tournament to lute class when she turned to me asked which is Mandarin for, "How do you do it?"
She and I are learning Mandarin.
The answer?
Positive reinforcement.
In a recent study, this mouse was denied food whenever he failed to find his way through a maze.
The mouse ended up dying...
of low self-esteem.
I had a nightmare where that happened to Bart, but I never told you about it.
I love it when you don't tell me things.
This mouse was given food whether he got through the maze or not.
And this fall, he'll be in a lab at Harvard.
Low self-esteem can cripple your child's chances of success.
praise.
Praise they can hold in their hands.
Certificates, ribbons and, yes, even trophies.
Trophies.
So that's the easy answer.
If Ralphie's shelf says he's a winner, then he'll be one!
And Moe yells a third thing to feel part of the group!
Yes!
Trophies-- that's what Bart needs.
This is how we save him.
Give Bart a trophy?
What for?
Most boogers wiped on a bedroom wall?
They're giving trophies for that now?
I weep for this country.
Bart's future is at stake.
Besides, I'm tired of Springfield missing out on every parenting trend, like the time-out and the diaper.
I never got a trophy when I was a kid, and I turned out just fine.
He's my son, and he's getting a trophy for nothing.
You hear me?
For nothing!
Huh.
Huh?
Good morning.
How's my special little winner?
How'd you get that thing in my bed without waking me up?
Because you're a champion sleeper.
It's the craziest thing.
She will not give up on that kid.
Trophies can boost self-esteem.
If you actually win them, like I did.
But what's the point of just handing out unearned statues?
And statuettes.
Well, it's just a waste of gullible parents' money.
Wasteof gullible parents' money.
Gullible parents' money.
Money.
Money.
Hmm.
Step right up!
Every kid's a winner!
The more you spend, the more you love!
Mm-hmm.
I thought you agreed that trophies should be earned.
money.
Remember, folks.
Nothing but a genuine Trophyland trophy says to your kids that... ♪ You're the best around ♪
♪ Nothing's gonna ever keep you down ♪
♪ You're the best around ♪
♪ Nothing's gonna ever keep you down ♪
♪ You're the best around ♪
♪ Nothing's gonna ever keep you down ♪
♪ You're the best around ♪
♪ Nothing's gonna ♪
♪ Ever keep you down ♪
♪ You're the best around ♪
♪ Nothing's gonna ever keep you down ♪
♪ You're the best. ♪
These stupid, loving parents will buy trophies for any accomplishment.
Not wetting the bed, using your inside voice, even "go watch TV in the other room."
I still think these things are good for their self-esteem.
Not to mention the self-esteem that comes from wad riffling.
Look, I even put the boy to work.
Well, then he should get a trophy for that.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
We have a saying in the participation trophy business.
"Don't get high-- self-esteem-- on your own supply-- of self-esteem."
I don't care.
I'm giving him this.
What?
Why did it break?
The parts are of the highest quality.
They come from the China of China:
India.
Boy, did you glue this trophy together with bubblegum?
Eh, sticky is sticky.
I'm taking my break.
See?
Giving him trophies did nothing.
You've showered him with praise, and he's just as lazy as ever.
Shh!
What if he heard you say that?
Hey, if Bart is as bad at eavesdropping as he is at everything else, we've got nothing to worry about.
I say we keep talking loudly.
But what about his confidence?
Face it.
Our son is a screw-up.
He was born a screw-up, and no matter how hard he tries-- which he never will--
Bart will always be a screw-up.
And have you ever heard that sound he makes when he's sad?
Pathetic.
Queen's bishop Lomotil takes king's Ativan.
Oh, looks like I'll be having a panic attack on the toilet tonight.
Look at that whimpering little crybaby.
Wah!
Wah!
Abe, that's your grandson.
Come visit me!
I'm so lonely!
Wah!
Wah!
What's got you down, kiddo?
My dad says I'm terrible at everything.
Oh, he's just repeating what he heard as a boy from me.
Oh, I was an awful father, just like my old man.
Your dad didn't believe in you, either?
It wasn't his fault.
He was just focused on his career as a professional child-beater.
Men would come from five towns over to study my father's technique.
But no matter how many strangles he patented, his father never approved.
Even if only a little bit of that really happened,
I'll never escape being a loser.
That's loser talk!
You're a great kid, and I'm gonna prove it to you.
Boy, this here's a real trophy.
Our family's most prized possession:
a Baumont Chrono-master Elite.
It's been a Simpson heirloom ever since it was stolen off a dead body at Gettysburg.
In 1982.
Whoa!
Wait.
Is this just another gold shiny thing to trick me into feeling special when I'm not?
You are special!
You're like my prostate-- a spiky little troublemaker who plays by his own rules.
You don't take hooey from Louis.
Never have, never will.
I feel something.
It's like a sunburn on the inside.
It's called "pride."
Every tick will remind you you've got a grandpa who believes in you.
The same way I believe the retirement home has been taken over by robots.
I am not a robot.
I just have light-up sneakers.
Why is my trophy the smallest?
You all lost-- to me!
Lisa, are you suggesting we engage in excellence bias?
She's loser-shaming me.
Why do you always have to make trouble, ya wee harpy?
How am I supposed to stay silent when parents are just blindly chasing the latest trend?
Ugh, parents.
Those lazy lunch-packers.
They just want to be told what to do.
And there's no shortage of experts who want to tell 'em.
No shortage of experts.
Experts.
Experts.
Experts.
LISA;
Another parenting expert, eh?
Clearly, this is a community in the grip of an addiction to trophies.
Now, parents,
I warn you, too much praise creates millennials-- a generation of soft, entitled narcissists, who drop out of college to become deejays.
That only pays well at the very highest levels.
Instead of showering your kids with gifts, you should prod them to greatness with GRIT.
Get up.
Retry.
I don't care if you're...
Tired.
He's got a word made of other words.
He must know what he's talking about.
Oh, it is an end to praise.
Praise Vishnu.
Remember, GRIT also stands for:
Get Rid of Idiotic Trophies.
Another word word!
He did it again!
Why does the word "of" sometimes count in the acronym and sometimes not?
Shut up, Mel!
Your kids live in Nebraska with your mom.
No more trophies!
No more trophies!
Uh-oh.
You are scum, sir!
Burn in hell!
Kill him with GRIT!
Hi, Homer.
How's the trophy business?
Nobody wants them anymore, thanks to GRIT.
Stupid parenting method I can't exploit for money.
Actually kinda makes sense.
Hate it so much.
I know that.
That's my dad's old pocket watch.
How did you get it?
Oh, Grampa said I earned it.
I guess someone in this family's proud of me.
Oh, you didn't want it, did you?
Yeah, right.
That watch means nothing to me.
Really?
Then how do you explain that case you made?
I built it to always remind me of what not to want.
What about your self-published novel?
Well, the character of John Homer is only partly based on me.
Well, if I didn't know better, I'd say you were obsessed with getting Grampa's watch.
Ooh, thanks for the analysis, Dr. Freud.
Next you'll be telling me that this whole trophy business, and in fact, all my get-rich-quick schemes over the years, are born of a desperate need for approval from a father who couldn't show love.
Likely because of his traumatic relationship with his own father, and his before him, and so on.
But, unfortunately, Dr. Freud, that couldn't be further from the truth, Doctor.
If you say so.
Now I'm gonna take this out and see what life is like with real love and encouragement ticking in my pocket.
Stupid watch.
Doesn't even have a fob.
Bart, where's the fob?
Bart, you look like a fool!

Okay, Milhouse, I'll drop a rock, you watch it come down.
That should be where Grampa's watch landed.
Ow!
Did you see where the rock landed?
In my eye!
Oh.
That watch was the only thing that made me not terrible.
I can't lose it.
I'll drop another rock a few feet to the left.
My other eye!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Not a single one has missed me!
What are you doing?
That expert at the school said trophies are bad for kids.
It's all part of GRIT.
No, no.
My trophies were earned.
Even the soccer one?
I went to most of the practices.
Yeah, but what happens when another parenting expert comes along with a whole new theory on self-esteem?
Another expert?
Who are they?
What are they saying?
Aw.
Okay, the watch is gone.
I guess I can live with being a useless, worthless nothing as long as no one finds out.
Sweetie, your grampa's on the phone.
Hello.
Great news, kiddo.
Remember That magazine is putting out their annual family heirlooms issue.
They want us for the cover.
You, me and the pocket watch.
Um...
It's a great story.
Passing a beloved heirloom from grandfather to grandson.
A gift that restored a child's faith in himself.
Uh, Grampa, there's something I have to tell you.
Hold on one second.
I'm just finishing up a mandatory pre-article heart exam.
Doc says as long as I don't suffer any major disappointments, I'll be fine.
Now, what did you want to tell me?
Uh, helmets ruined football.
Exactly!
If you want to protect your head, grow your hair long.
Anyway, I'll see you tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.
And you won't be late because you've got that watch.
Stupid parenting experts.
Why don't they write a book called Stop Buying These Books?
Everybody'd buy that.
Even if I was listening to what you said, it doesn't matter; nothing matters.
My trophy business has failed and Bart has the thing I wanted most:
Grampa's watch.
What watch?
The one you get for being a success.
Well, then I should have it.
Uh, that never really came up.
All that's left to do now is bring these to the needy.
Best I can do is charge you ten dollars to throw them in my Dumpster.
How about I give you a trophy that says "Best Pawn Shop"?
Not unless I earned it.
Dad's watch!
Hey, dirtbag shopkeep.
How did this come to you?
Mm.
Some kid brought it in.
Said he was mad at his friend for dropping so many rocks in his eye.
That dude's seen a lot of living.
Yours for 20 bucks.
That's an insult.
You're talking about a self-worth-boosting antique that's been in my family for generations.
Twenty-two?
You'll take it all and you'll like it.
Yes.
I have it.
Some said it would never happen.
Most were unaware of the situation.
But I finally have my father's watch!
Oh, Bart, look what Daddy's got now.
Grampa was the only person who believed in me.
But when he finds out I lost the watch, even he'll give up.
Stay strong, Homer.
Don't go soft on him now.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime face-rubbing-in.
Mm.
Come on, foot.
Kick, damn you!
Son, I found something that belongs to you.
Grampa's watch!
No.
I can't take it.
I didn't earn it, so I don't deserve it.
You were right.
I am a screwup.
But, boy, who screwed you up?
You.
It was you.
And those who came before.
It's stuck in your hand fat.
Oh.
You got to wedge something in there to break the vacuum.
Okay.
Smile, my little watch watcher.
That was a nice thing you did.
Which parenting guide told you to do it?
Well, baby, sometimes you just got to trust your gut.

*THE SIMPSONS Season 28 Episode 18 "A Father's Watch"
D'oh!
George, I'm sorry to see you up here.
Well, yes, but I died for a worthy cause.
As we speak, my body is about to be dissected by a budding young scientist.
Let's observe the dedication to learning of this ten-year-old scholar by the name of Bart Simpson.
♪ Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab, die ♪
♪ Stab, stab, die, die, death, kill. ♪
Well, his passion is undeniable.
Yes, very...
very impressive.
By examining my specimen's pyloric sphincter valve,
I deduced that she had an affinity for fruit flies.
By examining my specimen's natty dreads,
I was able to deduce that he was a jammin' Rasta-frogian.
My body, my little green body.
Okay, but surely his portrayal of Rastafarianism will be culturally sensitive.
Pass the Dutchie.
We be smokin' slabba slabba with the Babylon.
Ribbit, ribbit, mon.
Come now, George.
At least this Scottish groundskeeper will give your remains a respectful burial.
Into the crapper you go, useless froggy garbage.
Are you going to put a good spin on that, too?
Hmm?
Are you?
!
Well, are you?
Well, uh... ribbit?
I can't put these grades on the refrigerator.
I can't even put them on the garage refrigerator.
It's not my fault.
- I blame "So-key-ity."
- What?
!
You know, So-key-ity.
That's what everyone blames for everything.
You mean "society"?
Yeah, that's the guy.
Honey,
I know you're a bright boy, but if you don't try harder in school, you could end up... not a success.
Oh, that.
Don't worry, Mom.
As long as I can stand on a corner and spin a sign reading "new condos,"
I'll be just fine.
All that pacing isn't gonna fix the boy.
Just get him some pills.
Two pinks and a blue, and it's off to the races.
Everything we've tried with Bart has failed.
What if there's nothing we can do?
Mm, "nothing we can do" is a whole lot better than "it'll take all we've got."
I wonder if anyone talks about parenting online.
Look at this one!
They're skiing.
Skiing means happy.
Hmm, an expert with a new book to promote.
Oh, I wonder if she'd be willing to speak to a group for a fee.
Getting your child established on the path to success isn't easy.
I was driving my daughter from her falconry tournament to lute class when she turned to me asked... which is Mandarin for, "How do you do it?"
She and I are learning Mandarin.
The answer?
Positive reinforcement.
In a recent study, this mouse was denied food whenever he failed to find his way through a maze.
The mouse ended up dying...
of low self-esteem.
I had a nightmare where that happened to Bart, but I never told you about it.
I love it when you don't tell me things.
This mouse was given food whether he got through the maze or not.
And this fall, he'll be in a lab at Harvard.
Low self-esteem can cripple your child's chances of success.
The cure: praise.
Praise they can hold in their hands.
Certificates, ribbons and, yes, even trophies.
Trophies.
So that's the easy answer.
If Ralphie's shelf says he's a winner, then he'll be one!
And Moe yells a third thing to feel part of the group!
Yes!
Trophies...
that's what Bart needs.
This is how we save him.
Give Bart a trophy?
What for?
Most boogers wiped on a bedroom wall?
They're giving trophies for that now?
I weep for this country.
Bart's future is at stake.
Besides, I'm tired of Springfield missing out on every parenting trend, like the time-out and the diaper.
I never got a trophy when I was a kid, and I turned out just... fine.
He's my son, and he's getting a trophy for nothing.
You hear me?
For nothing!
Huh.
Huh?
Good morning.
How's my special little winner?
How'd you get that thing in my bed without waking me up?
Because you're a champion sleeper.
It's the craziest thing.
She will not give up on that kid.
Trophies can boost self-esteem.
If you actually win them, like I did.
But what's the point of just handing out unearned statues?
And statuettes.
Well, it's just a waste of gullible parents' money.
Waste of gullible parents' money.
Gullible parents' money.
Money.
Money.
Hmm.
Step right up!
Every kid's a winner!
The more you spend, the more you love!
Mm-hmm.
I thought you agreed that trophies should be earned.
I'm earning nature's trophy: money.
Remember, folks.
Nothing but a genuine Trophyland trophy says to your kids that... ♪ You're the best around ♪
♪ Nothing's gonna ever keep you down ♪
♪ You're the best around ♪
♪ Nothing's gonna ever keep you down ♪
♪ You're the best around ♪
♪ Nothing's gonna ever keep you down ♪
♪ You're the best around ♪
♪ Nothing's gonna ♪
♪ Ever keep you down ♪
♪ You're the best around ♪
♪ Nothing's gonna ever keep you down ♪
♪ You're the best. ♪
These stupid, loving parents will buy trophies for any accomplishment.
Not wetting the bed, using your inside voice, even "go watch TV in the other room."
I still think these things are good for their self-esteem.
Not to mention the self-esteem that comes from wad riffling.
Look, I even put the boy to work.
Well, then he should get a trophy for that.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
We have a saying in the participation trophy business.
"Don't get high...
self-esteem... on your own supply...
of self-esteem."
I don't care.
I'm giving him this.
What?
Why did it break?
The parts are of the highest quality.
They come from the China of China:
India.
Boy, did you glue this trophy together with bubblegum?
Eh, sticky is sticky.
I'm taking my break.
See?
Giving him trophies did nothing.
You've showered him with praise, and he's just as lazy as ever.
Shh!
What if he heard you say that?
Hey, if Bart is as bad at eavesdropping as he is at everything else, we've got nothing to worry about.
I say we keep talking loudly.
But what about his confidence?
Face it.
Our son is a screw-up.
He was born a screw-up, and no matter how hard he tries... which he never will...
Bart will always be a screw-up.
And have you ever heard that sound he makes when he's sad?
Pathetic.
Queen's bishop Lomotil takes king's Ativan.
Oh, looks like I'll be having a panic attack on the toilet tonight.
Look at that whimpering little crybaby.
Wah!
Wah!
Abe, that's your grandson.
Come visit me!
I'm so lonely!
Wah!
Wah!
What's got you down, kiddo?
My dad says I'm terrible at everything.
Oh, he's just repeating what he heard as a boy from me.
Oh, I was an awful father, just like my old man.
Your dad didn't believe in you, either?
It wasn't his fault.
He was just focused on his career as a professional child-beater.
Men would come from five towns over to study my father's technique.
But no matter how many strangles he patented, his father never approved.
Even if only a little bit of that really happened,
I'll never escape being a loser.
That's loser talk!
You're a great kid, and I'm gonna prove it to you.
Boy, this here's a real trophy.
Our family's most prized possession:
a Baumont Chrono-master Elite.
It's been a Simpson heirloom ever since it was stolen off a dead body at Gettysburg.
In 1982.
Whoa!
Wait.
Is this just another gold shiny thing to trick me into feeling special when I'm not?
You are special!
You're like my prostate... a spiky little troublemaker who plays by his own rules.
You don't take hooey from Louis.
Never have, never will.
I feel something.
It's like a sunburn on the inside.
It's called "pride."
Every tick will remind you you've got a grandpa who believes in you.
The same way I believe the retirement home has been taken over by robots.
I am not a robot.
I just have light-up sneakers.

He's my son, and he's getting a trophy for nothing.
You hear me?
For nothing!
Huh.
Huh?
(screams)
Good morning.
How's my special little winner?
How'd you get that thing in my bed without waking me up?
Because you're a champion sleeper.
It's the craziest thing.
She will not give up on that kid.
Trophies can boost self-esteem.
If you actually win them, like I did.
But what's the point of just handing out unearned statues?
And statuettes.
Well, it's just a waste of gullible parents' money.
(echoing):
Waste of gullible parents' money.
Gullible parents' money.
Money.
Money.
(bell dings) Hmm.
Step right up!
Every kid's a winner!
The more you spend, the more you love!
Mm-hmm.
I thought you agreed that trophies should be earned.
I'm earning nature's trophy:
Money.
(wind whistles softly)
Remember, folks.
Nothing but a genuine Trophyland trophy says to your kids that...
HOMER: * You're the best around
* Nothing's gonna ever keep you down *
* You're the best around
* Nothing's gonna ever keep you down *
* You're the best around
* Nothing's gonna ever keep you down *
* You're the best around * Nothing's gonna
* Ever keep you down
* You're the best around
* Nothing's gonna ever keep you down *
* You're the best.
(chuckles) These stupid, loving parents will buy trophies for any accomplishment.
Not wetting the bed, using your inside voice, even "go watch TV in the other room."
I still think these things are good for their self-esteem.
Not to mention the self-esteem that comes from wad riffling.
(wind whistles softly)
Look, I even put the boy to work.
Well, then he should get a trophy for that.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
We have a saying in the participation trophy business.
"Don't get high... self-esteem...
On your own supply...
Of self-esteem."
I don't care.
I'm giving him this.
What?
Why did it break?
The parts are of the highest quality.
They come from the China of China:
India.
Boy, did you glue this trophy together with bubblegum?
Eh, sticky is sticky.
I'm taking my break.
HOMER:
See?
Giving him trophies did nothing.
You've showered him with praise, and he's just as lazy as ever.
Shh!
What if he heard you say that?
Hey, if Bart is as bad at eavesdropping as he is at everything else, we've got nothing to worry about.
I say we keep talking loudly.
But what about his confidence?
Face it.
Our son is a screw-up.
He was born a screw-up, and no matter how hard he tries...
Which he never will...
Bart will always be a screw-up.
(groans)
And have you ever heard that sound he makes when he's sad?
Pathetic.
(sighs)
Queen's bishop Lomotil takes king's Ativan.
Oh, looks like I'll be having a panic attack on the toilet tonight.
(scoffs) Look at that whimpering little crybaby.
(mocking):
Wah!
Wah!
Abe, that's your grandson.
Come visit me!
I'm so lonely!
(crying):
Wah!
Wah!
What's got you down, kiddo?
My dad says I'm terrible at everything.
Oh, he's just repeating what he heard as a boy from me.
Oh, I was an awful father, just like my old man.
Your dad didn't believe in you, either?
It wasn't his fault.
He was just focused on his career as a professional child-beater.
Men would come from five towns over to study my father's technique.
But no matter how many strangles he patented, his father never approved.
(choking loudly)
Even if only a little bit of that really happened,
I'll never escape being a loser.
That's loser talk!
You're a great kid, and I'm gonna prove it to you.
Boy, this here's a real trophy.
Our family's most prized possession:
A Baumont Chrono-master Elite.
It's been a Simpson heirloom ever since it was stolen off a dead body at Gettysburg.
In 1982.
Whoa!
Wait.
Is this just another gold shiny thing to trick me into feeling special when I'm not?
You are special!
You're like my prostate...
A spiky little troublemaker who plays by his own rules.
You don't take hooey from Louis.
Never have, never will.
(shudders)
I feel something.
It's like a sunburn on the inside.
It's called "pride."
Every tick will remind you you've got a grandpa who believes in you.
The same way I believe the retirement home has been taken over by robots.
(Eastern European accent):
I am not a robot.
I just have light-up sneakers.

(Ralph humming)
Why is my trophy the smallest?
You all lost... to me!
(confused murmurs)
Lisa, are you suggesting we engage in excellence bias?
(crying):
She's loser-shaming me.
(growls)
(students gasp)
Why do you always have to make trouble, ya wee harpy?
How am I supposed to stay silent when parents are just blindly chasing the latest trend?
Ugh, parents.
Those lazy lunch-packers.
They just want to be told what to do.
And there's no shortage of experts who want to tell 'em.
WILLIE (echoing):
No shortage of experts.
Experts.
Experts.
Experts.
(bell dings)
LISA;
Another parenting expert, eh?
Clearly, this is a community in the grip of an addiction to trophies.
Now, parents,
I warn you, too much praise creates millennials...
A generation of soft, entitled narcissists, who drop out of college to become deejays.
That only pays well at the very highest levels.
Instead of showering your kids with gifts, you should prod them to greatness with GRIT.
Get up.
Retry.
I don't care if you're...
Tired.
He's got a word made of other words.
(chuckles) He must know what he's talking about.
Oh, it is an end to praise.
Praise Vishnu.
(crowd exclaims, murmurs)
Remember, GRIT also stands for:
Get Rid of Idiotic Trophies.
Another word word!
He did it again!
Why does the word "of" sometimes count in the acronym and sometimes not?
Shut up, Mel!
Your kids live in Nebraska with your mom.
CROWD (chanting):
No more trophies!
No more trophies!
Uh-oh.
You are scum, sir!
(crowd booing) Burn in hell!
Kill him with GRIT!
Hi, Homer.
How's the trophy business?
Nobody wants them anymore, thanks to GRIT.
Stupid parenting method I can't exploit for money.
Actually kinda makes sense.
Hate it so much.
(Homer gasps)
I know that.
That's my dad's old pocket watch.
How did you get it?
Oh, Grampa said I earned it.
I guess someone in this family's proud of me.
Oh, you didn't want it, did you?
(scoffs) Yeah, right.
That watch means nothing to me.
Really?
Then how do you explain that case you made?
I built it to always remind me of what not to want.
What about your self-published novel?
Well, the character of John Homer is only partly based on me.
Well, if I didn't know better, I'd say you were obsessed with getting Grampa's watch.
Ooh, thanks for the analysis, Dr. Freud.
Next you'll be telling me that this whole trophy business, and in fact, all my get-rich-quick schemes over the years, are born of a desperate need for approval from a father who couldn't show love.
Likely because of his traumatic relationship with his own father, and his before him, and so on.
But, unfortunately, Dr. Freud, that couldn't be further from the truth, Doctor.
If you say so.
Now I'm gonna take this out and see what life is like with real love and encouragement ticking in my pocket.
Stupid watch.
Doesn't even have a fob.
Bart, where's the fob?
Bart, you look like a fool!
(groaning slowly)
* You're the best around
* Nothing's gonna ever keep you down *
* You're the best around
* Nothing's gonna ever keep you down *
* You're the best around
* Nothing's gonna ever keep you down *
* Down
* Fight till the end 'cause your life will depend *
* On the strength that you have inside you *
* Ah, got to be proud, staring... *
No!
HOMER: * You're the worst around
* Everything's gonna bring you down. *
Okay, Milhouse, I'll drop a rock, you watch it come down.
That should be where Grampa's watch landed.
(thud) MILHOUSE:
Ow!
Did you see where the rock landed?
In my eye!
Oh.
That watch was the only thing that made me not terrible.
I can't lose it.
I'll drop another rock a few feet to the left.
My other eye!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Not a single one has missed me!
What are you doing?
That expert at the school said trophies are bad for kids.
It's all part of GRIT.
No, no.
My trophies were earned.
Even the soccer one?
I went to most of the practices.
Yeah, but what happens when another parenting expert comes along with a whole new theory on self-esteem?
Another expert?
Who are they?
What are they saying?
Aw.
Okay, the watch is gone.
I guess I can live with being a useless, worthless nothing as long as no one finds out.
Sweetie, your grampa's on the phone.
Hello.
Great news, kiddo.
Remember That magazine is putting out their annual family heirlooms issue.
They want us for the cover.
You, me and the pocket watch.
Um...
It's a great story.
Passing a beloved heirloom from grandfather to grandson.
A gift that restored a child's faith in himself.
Uh, Grampa, there's something I have to tell you.
Hold on one second.
I'm just finishing up a mandatory pre-article heart exam.
Doc says as long as I don't suffer any major disappointments, I'll be fine.
Now, what did you want to tell me?
Uh, helmets ruined football.
Exactly!
If you want to protect your head, grow your hair long.
Anyway, I'll see you tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.
And you won't be late because you've got that watch.
(groans)
Stupid parenting experts.
Why don't they write a book called Stop Buying These Books?
Everybody'd buy that.
Even if I was listening to what you said, it doesn't matter;
Nothing matters.
My trophy business has failed and Bart has the thing I wanted most:
Grampa's watch.
What watch?
The one you get for being a success.
Well, then I should have it.
Uh, that never really came up.
All that's left to do now is bring these to the needy.
Best I can do is charge you ten dollars to throw them in my Dumpster.
How about I give you a trophy that says "Best Pawn Shop"?
Not unless I earned it.
(gasps)
Dad's watch!
Hey, dirtbag shopkeep.
How did this come to you?
Mm.
Some kid brought it in.
Said he was mad at his friend for dropping so many rocks in his eye.
That dude's seen a lot of living.
Yours for 20 bucks.
That's an insult.
You're talking about a self-worth-boosting antique that's been in my family for generations.
Twenty-two?
You'll take it all and you'll like it.
(maniacal laugh)
Yes.
I have it.
Some said it would never happen.
Most were unaware of the situation.
But I finally have my father's watch!
(maniacal laugh)
(singsongy):
Oh, Bart, look what Daddy's got now.
(Bart crying)
Grampa was the only person who believed in me.
But when he finds out I lost the watch, even he'll give up.
(sobbing)
Stay strong, Homer.
Don't go soft on him now.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime face-rubbing-in.
Mm.
Come on, foot.
Kick, damn you!
(grunts)
(sighs) Son, I found something that belongs to you.
(gasps) Grampa's watch!
No.
I can't take it.
I didn't earn it, so I don't deserve it.
You were right.
I am a screwup.
But, boy, who screwed you up?
(gasps) You.
It was you.
And those who came before.
(choking loudly)
It's stuck in your hand fat.
Oh.
You got to wedge something in there to break the vacuum.
(grunting)
Okay.
Smile, my little watch watcher.
(camera clicking)
That was a nice thing you did.
Which parenting guide told you to do it?
Well, baby, sometimes you just got to trust your gut.
(watch shatters)
(choking)
Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH.
It's NBA draft day, and the world waits to see who will be the first pick.
The consensus choice is Cody Harris from LSU, but there's an exciting dark horse this year.
It's a player from Springfield by the name of Ralph Wiggum.
Uh-oh.
There's no tape on this three-foot-six second-grader, but he does lead the nation in trophies.
You can't argue with trophies.
Boom!
Kid's a winner.

George, I'm sorry to see you up here.
Well, yes, but I died for a worthy cause.
As we speak, my body is about to be dissected by a budding young scientist.
Let's observe the dedication to learning of this ten-year-old scholar by the name of Bart Simpson.
♪ Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab, die ♪
♪ Stab, stab, die, die, death, kill. ♪
Well, his passion is undeniable.
Yes, very... very impressive.
By examining my specimen's pyloric sphincter valve,
I deduced that she had an affinity for fruit flies.
By examining my specimen's natty dreads,
I was able to deduce that he was a jammin' Rasta-frogian.
My body, my little green body.
Okay, but surely his portrayal of Rastafarianism will be culturally sensitive.
Pass the Dutchie.
We be smokin' slabba slabba with the Babylon.
Ribbit, ribbit, mon.
(panting loudly)
Come now, George.
At least this Scottish groundskeeper will give your remains a respectful burial.
WILLIE:
Into the crapper you go, useless froggy garbage.
(toilet flushing)
Are you going to put a good spin on that, too?
Hmm?
Are you?
!
Well, are you?
Well, uh... ribbit?
MARGE:
I can't put these grades on the refrigerator.
I can't even put them on the garage refrigerator.
It's not my fault.
- I blame "so-key-ity."
- What?
!
You know, so-key-ity.
That's what everyone blames for everything.
You mean "society"?
- Yeah, that's the guy.
- Honey,
I know you're a bright boy, but if you don't try harder in school, you could end up not a success.
Oh, that.
Don't worry, Mom.
As long as I can stand on a corner and spin a sign reading "new condos,"
I'll be just fine.
(groaning)
(Marge groaning)
(Marge groaning)
All that pacing isn't gonna fix the boy.
Just get him some pills.
Two pinks and a blue, and it's off to the races.
Everything we've tried with Bart has failed.
What if there's nothing we can do?
Mm, "nothing we can do" is a whole lot better than "it'll take all we've got."
I wonder if anyone talks about parenting online.
Look at this one!
HOMER:
They're skiing.
Skiing means happy.
Hmm, an expert with a new book to promote.
Oh, I wonder if she'd be willing to speak to a group for a fee.
Getting your child established on the path to success isn't easy.
I was driving my daughter from her falconry tournament to lute class when she turned to me asked... (speaks Mandarin) ...which is Mandarin for, "How do you do it?"
She and I are learning Mandarin.
The answer?
(speaks Mandarin)
Positive reinforcement.
(inquisitive chatter)
In a recent study, this mouse was denied food whenever he failed to find his way through a maze.
The mouse ended up dying...
of low self-esteem.
(shocked and excited chatter)
I had a nightmare where that happened to Bart, but I never told you about it.
I love it when you don't tell me things.
This mouse was given food whether he got through the maze or not.
And this fall, he'll be in a lab at Harvard.
(excited gasps and chatter)
Low self-esteem can cripple your child's chances of success.
The cure: praise.
(excited chatter)
Praise they can hold in their hands.
Certificates, ribbons and, yes, even trophies.
(crowd gasps)
(gasps) Trophies.
So that's the easy answer.
If Ralphie's shelf says he's a winner, then he'll be one!
And Moe yells a third thing to feel part of the group!
Yes!
Trophies-- that's what Bart needs.
This is how we save him.
(scoffs) Give Bart a trophy?
What for?
Most boogers wiped on a bedroom wall?
They're giving trophies for that now?
I weep for this country.
Bart's future is at stake.
Besides, I'm tired of Springfield missing out on every parenting trend, like the time-out and the diaper.
I never got a trophy when I was a kid, and I turned out just... (gulping)
(slowly): ...fine.
He's my son, and he's getting a trophy for nothing.
You hear me?
For nothing!
Huh.
Huh?
(screams)
Good morning.
How's my special little winner?
How'd you get that thing in my bed without waking me up?
Because you're a champion sleeper.

The one you get for being a success.
Well, then I should have it.
Uh, that never really came up.
All that's left to do now is bring these to the needy.
Best I can do is charge you ten dollars to throw them in my Dumpster.
How about I give you a trophy that says "Best Pawn Shop"?
Not unless I earned it.
(gasps)
Dad's watch!
Hey, dirtbag shopkeep.
How did this come to you?
Mm.
Some kid brought it in.
Said he was mad at his friend for dropping so many rocks in his eye.
That dude's seen a lot of living.
Yours for 20 bucks.
That's an insult.
You're talking about a self-worth-boosting antique that's been in my family for generations.
Twenty-two?
You'll take it all and you'll like it.
(maniacal laugh)
Yes.
I have it.
Some said it would never happen.
Most were unaware of the situation.
But I finally have my father's watch!
(maniacal laugh)
(singsongy):
Oh, Bart, look what Daddy's got now.
(Bart crying)
Grampa was the only person who believed in me.
But when he finds out I lost the watch, even he'll give up.
(sobbing)
Stay strong, Homer.
Don't go soft on him now.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime face-rubbing-in.
Mm.
Come on, foot.
Kick, damn you!
(grunts)
(sighs) Son, I found something that belongs to you.
(gasps) Grampa's watch!
No.
I can't take it.
I didn't earn it, so I don't deserve it.
You were right.
I am a screwup.
But, boy, who screwed you up?
(gasps) You.
It was you.
And those who came before.
(choking loudly)
It's stuck in your hand fat.
Oh.
You got to wedge something in there to break the vacuum.
(grunting)
Okay.
Smile, my little watch watcher.
(camera clicking)
That was a nice thing you did.
Which parenting guide told you to do it?
Well, baby, sometimes you just got to trust your gut.

*THE SIMPSONS Season 28 Episode 18 "A Father's Watch"
(school bell ringing)
(Barney belches)
(tires screeching)
D'oh!
(tires screeching)
(grunts)
(trumpets)
(croaking)
George, I'm sorry to see you up here.
Well, yes, but I died for a worthy cause.
As we speak, my body is about to be dissected by a budding young scientist.
Let's observe the dedication to learning of this ten-year-old scholar by the name of Bart Simpson.
♪ Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab, die ♪
♪ Stab, stab, die, die, death, kill. ♪
Well, his passion is undeniable.
Yes, very...
very impressive.
By examining my specimen's pyloric sphincter valve,
I deduced that she had an affinity for fruit flies.
By examining my specimen's natty dreads,
I was able to deduce that he was a jammin' Rasta-frogian.
My body, my little green body.
Okay, but surely his portrayal of Rastafarianism will be culturally sensitive.
Pass the Dutchie.
We be smokin' slabba slabba with the Babylon.
Ribbit, ribbit, mon.
(panting loudly)
Come now, George.
At least this Scottish groundskeeper will give your remains a respectful burial.
WILLIE:
Into the crapper you go, useless froggy garbage.
(toilet flushing)
Are you going to put a good spin on that, too?
Hmm?
Are you?
!
Well, are you?
Well, uh... ribbit?
MARGE:
I can't put these grades on the refrigerator.
I can't even put them on the garage refrigerator.
It's not my fault.
- I blame "So-key-ity."
- What?
!
You know, So-key-ity.
That's what everyone blames for everything.
You mean "society"?
Yeah, that's the guy.
Honey,
I know you're a bright boy, but if you don't try harder in school, you could end up... not a success.
Oh, that.
Don't worry, Mom.
As long as I can stand on a corner and spin a sign reading "new condos,"
I'll be just fine.
(groaning)
(Marge groaning)
(Marge groaning)
All that pacing isn't gonna fix the boy.
Just get him some pills.
Two pinks and a blue, and it's off to the races.
Everything we've tried with Bart has failed.
What if there's nothing we can do?
Mm, "nothing we can do" is a whole lot better than "it'll take all we've got."
I wonder if anyone talks about parenting online.
Look at this one!
HOMER:
They're skiing.
Skiing means happy.
Hmm, an expert with a new book to promote.
Oh, I wonder if she'd be willing to speak to a group for a fee.
Getting your child established on the path to success isn't easy.
I was driving my daughter from her falconry tournament to lute class when she turned to me asked... (speaks Mandarin) which is Mandarin for, "How do you do it?"
She and I are learning Mandarin.
The answer?
(speaks Mandarin)
Positive reinforcement.
(inquisitive chatter)
In a recent study, this mouse was denied food whenever he failed to find his way through a maze.
The mouse ended up dying...
of low self-esteem.
(shocked and excited chatter)
I had a nightmare where that happened to Bart, but I never told you about it.
I love it when you don't tell me things.
This mouse was given food whether he got through the maze or not.
And this fall, he'll be in a lab at Harvard.
(excited gasps and chatter)
Low self-esteem can cripple your child's chances of success.
The cure: praise.
(excited chatter)
Praise they can hold in their hands.
Certificates, ribbons and, yes, even trophies.
(crowd gasps)
(gasps) Trophies.
So that's the easy answer.
If Ralphie's shelf says he's a winner, then he'll be one!
And Moe yells a third thing to feel part of the group!
Yes!
Trophies...
that's what Bart needs.
This is how we save him.
(scoffs) Give Bart a trophy?
What for?
Most boogers wiped on a bedroom wall?
They're giving trophies for that now?
I weep for this country.
Bart's future is at stake.
Besides, I'm tired of Springfield missing out on every parenting trend, like the time-out and the diaper.
I never got a trophy when I was a kid, and I turned out just... (gulping)
(slowly):
fine.
He's my son, and he's getting a trophy for nothing.
You hear me?
For nothing!
Huh.
Huh?
(screams)
Good morning.
How's my special little winner?
How'd you get that thing in my bed without waking me up?
Because you're a champion sleeper.
It's the craziest thing.
She will not give up on that kid.
Trophies can boost self-esteem.
If you actually win them, like I did.
But what's the point of just handing out unearned statues?
And statuettes.
Well, it's just a waste of gullible parents' money.
(echoing):
Waste of gullible parents' money.
Gullible parents' money.
Money.
Money.
(bell dings) Hmm.
Step right up!
Every kid's a winner!
The more you spend, the more you love!
Mm-hmm.
I thought you agreed that trophies should be earned.
I'm earning nature's trophy: money.
Remember, folks.
Nothing but a genuine Trophyland trophy says to your kids that...
HOMER:
♪ You're the best around ♪
♪ Nothing's gonna ever keep you down ♪
♪ You're the best around ♪
♪ Nothing's gonna ever keep you down ♪
♪ You're the best around ♪
♪ Nothing's gonna ever keep you down ♪
♪ You're the best around ♪
♪ Nothing's gonna ♪
♪ Ever keep you down ♪
♪ You're the best around ♪
♪ Nothing's gonna ever keep you down ♪
♪ You're the best. ♪
(chuckles) These stupid, loving parents will buy trophies for any accomplishment.
Not wetting the bed, using your inside voice, even "go watch TV in the other room."
I still think these things are good for their self-esteem.
Not to mention the self-esteem that comes from wad riffling.
(wind whistles softly)
Look, I even put the boy to work.
Well, then he should get a trophy for that.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
We have a saying in the participation trophy business.
"Don't get high...
self-esteem... on your own supply...
of self-esteem."
I don't care.
I'm giving him this.
What?
Why did it break?
The parts are of the highest quality.
They come from the China of China:
India.
Boy, did you glue this trophy together with bubblegum?
Eh, sticky is sticky.
I'm taking my break.
HOMER:
See?
Giving him trophies did nothing.
You've showered him with praise, and he's just as lazy as ever.
Shh!
What if he heard you say that?
Hey, if Bart is as bad at eavesdropping as he is at everything else, we've got nothing to worry about.
I say we keep talking loudly.
But what about his confidence?
Face it.
Our son is a screw-up.
He was born a screw-up, and no matter how hard he tries... which he never will...
Bart will always be a screw-up.
(groans)
And have you ever heard that sound he makes when he's sad?
Pathetic.
(sighs)
Queen's bishop Lomotil takes king's Ativan.
Oh, looks like I'll be having a panic attack on the toilet tonight.
(scoffs) Look at that whimpering little crybaby.
(mocking):
Wah!
Wah!
Abe, that's your grandson.
Come visit me!
I'm so lonely!
(crying):
Wah!
Wah!
What's got you down, kiddo?
My dad says I'm terrible at everything.
Oh, he's just repeating what he heard as a boy from me.
Oh, I was an awful father, just like my old man.
Your dad didn't believe in you, either?
It wasn't his fault.
He was just focused on his career as a professional child-beater.
Men would come from five towns over to study my father's technique.
But no matter how many strangles he patented, his father never approved.
(choking loudly)
Even if only a little bit of that really happened,
I'll never escape being a loser.
That's loser talk!
You're a great kid, and I'm gonna prove it to you.
Boy, this here's a real trophy.
Our family's most prized possession:
a Baumont Chrono-master Elite.
It's been a Simpson heirloom ever since it was stolen off a dead body at Gettysburg.
In 1982.
Whoa!
Wait.
Is this just another gold shiny thing to trick me into feeling special when I'm not?
You are special!
You're like my prostate... a spiky little troublemaker who plays by his own rules.
You don't take hooey from Louis.
Never have, never will.
(shudders)
I feel something.
It's like a sunburn on the inside.
It's called "pride."
Every tick will remind you you've got a grandpa who believes in you.
The same way I believe the retirement home has been taken over by robots.
(Eastern European accent):
I am not a robot.
I just have light-up sneakers.

(Ralph humming)
Why is my trophy the smallest?
You all lost... to me!
(confused murmurs)
Lisa, are you suggesting we engage in excellence bias?
(crying):
She's loser-shaming me.
(growls)
(students gasp)
Why do you always have to make trouble, ya wee harpy?
How am I supposed to stay silent when parents are just blindly chasing the latest trend?
Ugh, parents.
Those lazy lunch-packers.
They just want to be told what to do.
And there's no shortage of experts who want to tell 'em.
WILLIE (echoing):
No shortage of experts.
Experts.
Experts.
Experts.
(bell dings)
LISA;
Another parenting expert, eh?
Clearly, this is a community in the grip of an addiction to trophies.
Now, parents,
I warn you, too much praise creates millennials... a generation of soft, entitled narcissists, who drop out of college to become deejays.
That only pays well at the very highest levels.
Instead of showering your kids with gifts, you should prod them to greatness with GRIT.
Get up.
Retry.
I don't care if you're...
Tired.
He's got a word made of other words.
(chuckles) He must know what he's talking about.
Oh, it is an end to praise.
Praise Vishnu.
(crowd exclaims, murmurs)
Remember, GRIT also stands for:
Get Rid of Idiotic Trophies.
Another word word!
He did it again!
Why does the word "of" sometimes count in the acronym and sometimes not?
Shut up, Mel!
Your kids live in Nebraska with your mom.
CROWD (chanting):
No more trophies!
No more trophies!
Uh-oh.
You are scum, sir!
(crowd booing) Burn in hell!
Kill him with GRIT!
Hi, Homer.
How's the trophy business?
Nobody wants them anymore, thanks to GRIT.
Stupid parenting method I can't exploit for money.
Actually kinda makes sense.
Hate it so much.
(Homer gasps)
I know that.
That's my dad's old pocket watch.
How did you get it?
Oh, Grampa said I earned it.
I guess someone in this family's proud of me.
Oh, you didn't want it, did you?
(scoffs) Yeah, right.
That watch means nothing to me.
Really?
Then how do you explain that case you made?
I built it to always remind me of what not to want.
What about your self-published novel?
Well, the character of John Homer is only partly based on me.
Well, if I didn't know better, I'd say you were obsessed with getting Grampa's watch.
Ooh, thanks for the analysis, Dr. Freud.
Next you'll be telling me that this whole trophy business, and in fact, all my get-rich-quick schemes over the years, are born of a desperate need for approval from a father who couldn't show love.
Likely because of his traumatic relationship with his own father, and his before him, and so on.
But, unfortunately, Dr. Freud, that couldn't be further from the truth, Doctor.
If you say so.
Now I'm gonna take this out and see what life is like with real love and encouragement ticking in my pocket.
Stupid watch.
Doesn't even have a fob.
Bart, where's the fob?
Bart, you look like a fool!

Okay, Milhouse, I'll drop a rock, you watch it come down.
That should be where Grampa's watch landed.
(thud) MILHOUSE:
Ow!
Did you see where the rock landed?
In my eye!
Oh.
That watch was the only thing that made me not terrible.
I can't lose it.
I'll drop another rock a few feet to the left.
My other eye!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Not a single one has missed me!
What are you doing?
That expert at the school said trophies are bad for kids.
It's all part of GRIT.
No, no.
My trophies were earned.
Even the soccer one?
I went to most of the practices.
Yeah, but what happens when another parenting expert comes along with a whole new theory on self-esteem?
Another expert?
Who are they?
What are they saying?
Aw.
Okay, the watch is gone.
I guess I can live with being a useless, worthless nothing as long as no one finds out.
Sweetie, your grampa's on the phone.
Hello.
Great news, kiddo.
Remember That magazine is putting out their annual family heirlooms issue.
They want us for the cover.
You, me and the pocket watch.
Um...
It's a great story.
Passing a beloved heirloom from grandfather to grandson.
A gift that restored a child's faith in himself.
Uh, Grampa, there's something I have to tell you.
Hold on one second.
I'm just finishing up a mandatory pre-article heart exam.
Doc says as long as I don't suffer any major disappointments, I'll be fine.
Now, what did you want to tell me?
Uh, helmets ruined football.
Exactly!
If you want to protect your head, grow your hair long.
Anyway, I'll see you tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.
And you won't be late because you've got that watch.
(groans)
Stupid parenting experts.
Why don't they write a book called Stop Buying These Books?
Everybody'd buy that.
Even if I was listening to what you said, it doesn't matter;
nothing matters.
My trophy business has failed and Bart has the thing I wanted most:
Grampa's watch.
What watch?
The one you get for being a success.
Well, then I should have it.
Uh, that never really came up.
All that's left to do now is bring these to the needy.

It's NBA draft day, and the world waits to see who will be the first pick.
The consensus choice is Cody Harris from LSU, but there's an exciting dark horse this year.
It's a player from Springfield by the name of Ralph Wiggum.
Uh-oh.
There's no tape on this three-foot-six second-grader, but he does lead the nation in trophies.
You can't argue with trophies.
Boom!

Hello.
I'm sorry, I'm not in the mood.
To say "hello"?
I know your "hello's," honey, and that one was pouring me a glass of wine.
Well, it's been a few days and I guess I've just gotten used to the frequency, intensity and sheer insanity of your undead libido.
It hasn't been that crazy.
Sweetheart, we had sex in the bathroom at Target 'cause their logo turned you on.
It's obviously designed to look like a clitoris.
[sighs] I'm just feeling a little low energy.
Maybe I need to eat people with more iron in their diet.
It's okay.
We don't have to break a baby changing table every day.
How about I give you a foot massage?
No strings attached.
Uh...
- I have to bake brownies.
- Now?
It's 1:00 a.m.
We have to check in on Lisa tomorrow so people don't get suspicious.
And nothing says "We didn't kill your husband"
like a fresh plate of brownies.
- [door opens]
- Can I at least lick the spoon?
Give me something.
[instrumental theme music playing]
So Dan is still officially considered missing, but I may have to face the fact that he's never coming back.
- That's terrible.
- We are so sorry.
- Can I have a brownie?
- [Lisa] Of course.
Makes it a little easier knowing Dan was a crooked cop with a hundred grand stashed away while I'm running around with a $40 Michael Kors knock-off.
- Fuck you, that's a fake?
- That's why I can't wear it in the rain.
- Sounds like everyone's moving on nicely.
- Kebab time.
- Oh, hello.
I didn't know we had visitors.
- Oh, it's you.
Here.
How wonderful.
Joel, Sheila, you remember Anne, Dan's partner?
She has been so helpful to me and Eric these past couple days.
- I think it's what Dan would want.
- Such a rock.
- Wow.
- Uh-huh.
You guys want some shish kebabs?
No, thank you, we're not kebab people.
And we just came by to check on Lisa.
And now having done that, we will return to our home to watch television.
Did you tell them about that guy Loki?
That guy Loki?
We thought Dan had killed this drug dealer, Loki.
We found his apartment trashed, blood everywhere.
But it turns out, the guy's not dead.
Mmm.
Mmm!
Mmm!
- Nothing beats a juicy, fresh tomato.
- Anne grows tomatoes in her garden.
I thought they would be too dry this year.
Tomatoes.
What can't they do?
Vote?
Drive?
I don't know.
But, Loki?
Oh, yeah, he was holed up at the Starlight Motel.
Said this couple was trying to bite him.
He must have gotten into some bad drugs because he also vomited everywhere.
[Lisa] So Dan's not a double murderer.
Just a single murderer, who had $100,000 and told me we couldn't afford a housekeeper once a month.
Exactly how much vomit are we talking about here, Anne?
So much vomit.
We all thought he died.
But next day, he was gone.
This is a weird question, but did you happen to find something that looked like a small red ball?
No.
[both sighing]
Just this medium red ball.
Oh, my God.
- I'd call that small, Esther.
- Maybe.
I have little hands.
- Still.
- Did he leave anything else?
Notebook.
I will not guess its size.
That's medium.
[shudders]
- Look.
- "Must kill"?
Oh, God.
We're nice and we've already killed three people.
Can you imagine what an undead person who started out as a murderer is going to do?
- And it's all our fault.
- We are such assholes.
We have to stop him.
I think we bought too much stuff.
We've never killed a dead person before.
I don't know how to shop for that.
You could start by staying out of the cosmetics aisle.
I needed a brush.
Just once I'd like to come home from a store with only the stuff on our list.
Oh, I don't remember a men's manicure kit being on our list.
Now I don't have to borrow yours.
Look, the whole system broke down after you bought the brush.
I just embraced the chaos.
["Breakin' Outta Hell" by Airbourne playing]
Tight.
Does this hat make me look like The Edge?
No.
Wait, yes.
What do you want to hear?
- Well, I'm wearing it.
- You look awesome.
Do you think we should get a gun?
Statistically, if we have a gun, we're 2.7 times more likely to hurt ourselves than Loki.
As is our right.
I think between the icepick and your hammer-knife thing and your beautiful nails, we're gonna get the job done.
Get what job done?
The same job we do every day:
selling a house.
It's in a bad neighborhood.
The bigger question is, why aren't you in school?
'Cause I'm selling a house in a bad neighborhood.
See how lame that excuse sounds?
We said we'd be honest with each other, okay?
I did not have a class last period.
Your turn.
Sweetie, we are not going to lie to you anymore.
But being honest does not mean that we are going to involve you in something where I may or may not look like The Edge.
Do you have any thoughts on this?
Yeah.
Take it off.
And take me with you.
You're clearly about to do the coolest thing
- that anyone in this family's ever done.
- You're not going.
And we did that water jet pack thing together and that was pretty cool.
And you got to do it twice and I only got to go once, even though it was my idea.
This sucks.
And that jet pack thing was not your idea.
That mortgage broker gave you his Groupon because he was too fat to fly.
Are we wrong?
We've made mistakes as parents but we've never taken our kid to a murder.
I think we should hold firm on that.

It's like I chucked up everything that was holding me back and woke up with this new energy and...
Focus?
That's exactly what I felt.
Do you sleep?
- Barely.
- Me neither.
Do you feel pain?
Never.
I carried a beehive out of our front yard.
I stared at the sun for an hour.
I ate a bottle to drive some drunks out of a park.
[Loki chuckles]
- You did?
When was this?
- Thursday.
I can't believe we were gonna stab you in the brain.
We have so much in common.
[chuckles] I have a question.
In your notebook it says you "must kill" tonight at 8:00?
Who are you planning on killing, Loki?
- Everyone.
- Jesus.
With my music.
I was actualizing what I wanted to happen in my performance.
And it worked.
A couple from Chatsworth bought a CD.
That's wonderful.
I...
I want one.
Oh.
Loki:
So Alive.
I love it.
It's ironic, but the irony is for such a specific audience.
$19, seems steep.
And there's only seven songs and one's a reprise, so six.
Isn't it wonderful how being undead frees us to be who we want to be?
Yes!
Music was always my passion.
But I had no self-esteem, so instead I embraced violence, like a drop of dew embraces a blade of grass.
- Hmm.
- Hang on a second.
[phone recorder beeps]
"Like a drop of dew embraces a blade of grass."
That's good.
Really?
You like that?
I think the imagery feels a little familiar.
I think it's beautiful.
"Blade of grass." Blade?
Violence?
It's the twist on the familiar that makes it so profound.
So we disagree.
So who are you planning on eating, Loki?
'Cause you are killing people, right?
- It's not all just singin' and dancin'.
- I made a deal with my old gang.
They let me go, and if they need to get rid of a body they leave it in my van in the Magic Mountain parking lot.
By the way, that's, like, the third sketchiest thing happening in that parking lot.
Hey, you guys should join me for a meal sometime.
- [chuckles]
- Actually, Joel doesn't eat people.
He's not one of us.
Oh.
That's cool.
You think?
'Cause it feels like you're being judgmental.
Honey, do you think you could pay our tab so we could leave?
Also, uh, put something in Loki's tip jar for the CD.
- Please, that would be an insult.
- Done.
Thank you, honey, so much.
[gasps] My fucking toe fell off.
- What?
- The little one, it just dropped off.
Has anything like that happened to you?
- No.
That must be awful.
- I haven't told Joel yet.
He's not gonna be able to handle me deteriorating.
- Maybe I can help you.
- Really?
We're the only two like us.
We have to look out for each other.
And learn from each other.
Thank you.
And may I share something with you?
If you miss eating pizza, eat a man who just ate pizza.
Smart.
[rattling]
Mr. Magnet!
Open up.
It's Abby.
Uh, the underage redhead you wanted to bone.
He might not remember your name.
The padlock's off the door.
[Eric] Oh, my God.
Whoa.
Damn.
Is that heroin?
Judging by the smile on his face, I'm guessing it's not insulin.
- Check his pulse.
- You check his pulse.
- He liked you better.
- [tersely] Yes, he did!
He's cold.
- [sighs]
- Should we call the police?
Here's my perspective on that.
We hired a guy who does illegal stuff to fix a bike we're not legally allowed to ride with money I stole from a corrupt cop whose body is in your parents' freezer.
So, no.
I get that.
Okay.
Let's grab my dad's bike and get out of here.
Where is it?
I think it's everywhere.
He took our money and chopped it up for parts?
Wow.
What a valuable learning experience.
Shall we go?
When my parents see my dad's bike is missing they're gonna freak out.
- Huh.
- What?
I'm just thinking, my mom eats people, and this is a person.
Those are both true statements, but I don't like the way you're connecting them.
They're gonna be mad about the bike, anyway.
If we keep him, my mom gets a few meals out of it and I get to show them I can handle their world.
Plus, something tells me Travis would enjoy a woman eating him.
[cell phone vibrating]
Oh, hi.
How are you?
- I'm fine.
What's that?
- Just a text.
- Is it Loki?
- I can't tell you that.
That would be a violation of my Fourth Amendment right to privacy.
That's interesting.
You haven't cited that amendment before.
Well, I'm citing it now because, well, I take the Fifth on that.
It's just hard to see you connecting with someone when you and I haven't exactly been burning up the bed sheets, we literally did last week when our candle play got out of hand.
So can I please see the text to put my mind at ease?
- Are you saying you don't trust me?
- Of course I trust you.
You know what, I'mma go downstairs, make a sandwich, and... watch the game.
[grunting]
[grunts] He's too big.
Plus, he won't bend, he's got rigor mortis.
Damn it.
You try to do something nice for your family.
Okay.
Weird idea?
If we break his elbows and kneecaps, we can bend his limbs the wrong way and maybe Tetris the whole thing in.
Wow.
Okay.
Sure, I took karate as a kid.
Yeah, grab his leg.
Okay.
Okay.
Here we go.
Ready?
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna snap this dead guy's leg.
You don't have to do this, Abby.
If he's still in one piece, we can put him back.
- But once we break him, we own him.
- My parents kill people.
My mom puts them in blenders and eats them.
I can do this.
- On three.
Ready?
- [strained grunt]
One... two...
- Can I look?
- Not yet.
- No peeking.
- Okay.
Now.
Wow.
A box full of feet.
I only needed the one toe but you got me a literal foot locker.
We can match the perfect color and size, and I know a doctor who can clip off the toe and sew it on you.
All he'll want is some cocaine and a handwritten thank you note.
Well, that's great, but where did you get all these?
From small, bad men who were no longer using them.
Well, if they were just going to waste...
Mmm...
Sheila.
Your skin is so soft and cold.
What are you doing?
Sheila, as far as we know, we're the only people like us in the world.
- We should be together.
- What?
I'm married.
I've only met you twice and both times I was trying to kill you.
So our relationship starts from a place of passion.
No, this is crazy.
I love my husband.
[scoffs]
It's just... really disappointing.
Even dead men and women can't be friends.
Fuck.
- I will never give up, my evening rose.
- [van door shuts]
- [phone recorder beeps] - "I will never give up, my evening rose."
Also... murder Joel.
[both panting]
I'll wipe off my fingerprints.
[Abby] I'm such an idiot.
I lost your money,
I let some creep chop my dad's bike up into a million pieces.
My parents are right.
I'm not ready for anything.
Seriously?
Abby, you are the most awesome, capable person I've ever met.
You tear-gassed a drug dealer.
You gave me the confidence to stand up to my stepdad.
You saved your parents from a murder charge with just a flashlight like you're freakin' MacGyver.
Was that too honest?
Was it just weird?
Do you know who MacGyver is?
Yes.
And you're always weird.
[nervous chuckle]
All right, so was the needle in his right arm, or his left?
I don't remember, uh, but I think it was in his left.
- [softly] Okay.
- Careful.
All right, here we go.
You ready?
One, two... and I'll just put it right here, that's good.
What's that?
[alarm chirps]
["Breakin' Outta Hell" by Airbourne playing]
When'd you learn how to drive a motorcycle?
Now.
Oh.
[engine revving]
- [Abby] Whoo-hoo!
- [Eric] Motherfuckers!
[soft, romantic music playing]
Joel?
Joel?
Whassup, Santa Clarita?
March 27, 2000: that sign stood in front of our first listing.
- Everyone said we'd never sell it.
- The two-bedroom colonial.
- With the unpermitted garage.
- We closed at asking.
- [clinking] - [chuckles]
Afterward, to mark the occasion,
I made you the only meal I knew how to cook.
Spaghetti and meatballs.
Ohh.
- This is so sweet.
I wish I could eat it.
- You can.
It's made from 100 percent free-range Dan.
- Really?
- The noodles are striated biceps.
The meatballs are from...
Honestly, I don't know where they're from.
It was a horrible mess.
Somewhere in the chest cavity.
- I can't believe you did all this.
- It wasn't easy.
I puked twice.
Also, I think we're gonna have to throw out the pasta maker.
I left it to soak, but it's not looking good.
Did you try vinegar and baking soda?
That's how I got Gary out of my shoes.
[softly] Oh.
I shouldn't have made such a big deal about Loki.
It just freaked me out you two having so much in common.
But then I realized we've spent half our lives together.
No one will ever have more in common with you than I do.
That's wonderful.
And you're right, Loki is no threat to you.
Sheila!
What are you doing?
I told you I'm not interested.
And what's with the door, man?
- You totally fucked up our door.
- I have the answer to your toe problem.
- You have a toe problem?
- I was going to tell you...
Her toe fell off.
She knew you wouldn't be able to handle it.
- Your toe fell off?
Oh, my God!
- See?
- Shut up.
- You shut up.
No, you, and I'm really pissed about the door.
- Guys!
- Sheila, come away with me, and your toe problem won't be a problem, because I will accept you no matter how much you deteriorate.
You and I are the same.
We should be together.
Okay, look, clearly neither one of us wants to fight.
And I don't blame us.
I mean, look how big we are... [yelps] and how strong.
Sorry, Joel, you seem like a nice man, but for Sheila to be free... she has to stop clinging to her past.
- [straining] - [Sheila grunts]
- Whassup!
- [gasps] Come on!
Let's go, go.
We have to kill him.
It's our only way out.
- I know.
So why did we come upstairs?
- To get our weapons.
You mean the ones we weren't going to use so I put them back in the kitchen and the garage?
- Yes, those!
- Don't you get upset with me.
You're the one who bought me that Japanese tidying-up book.
I just wanted your shoes out of the hallway.
[Loki] Sheila!
- Quick, barricade the door.
- Okay.
Why didn't you want me to know about your toe?
That why we weren't having sex?
- You didn't want me to see it?
- Yes.
- Honey, I can handle it.
- I don't know if I can handle it.
Okay?
What if this keeps happening to me?
What if I'm breaking apart?
What if I lose control and you have to kill me?
What if we're too young to get married?
What if we can't sell a house?
What if this baby changing table can't support our weight?
We'll figure it out, honey.
We always have.
- [thump] - [gasps]
- Or we'll just die right here.
- At least we'll die together.
- Huh.
- Sheila!
This is the right thing.
In time you'll see it.
[exhales]
I take back everything I said about that brush.
I got the body in the car.
Are you sure you can't eat him?
- It seems like such a waste.
- The undead can't eat the undead.
They're too... dead.
Come here.
I want to see your toe.
I don't think so.
Maybe you never have to see it.
Maybe I just can have sex with my socks on.
Or... heels.
Bet you'd like that, wouldn't you?
I would.
But eventually I'd want to take them off of you.
Okay, get ready to have whatever the opposite of a boner is.
Is that it?
That's nothing.
So far.
But what if it's just the beginning?
Honey, we're gonna be okay.
We're gonna find a cure.
I've left messages for that guy with the Serbian book.
- But he didn't call you back.
- We will find him, I promise you.
In the meantime, you and I are gonna get through this togeth...
The fuck is that?
- What?
- Wow.
Uh-oh.

Woman:
Is green tea all right for you, Hillary?
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
Um, so, when I finally got to New York and I knew that I wanted to support myself on my own so I could write, well, I thought that was gonna mean, you know, serving cheesecake in Junior's or temping in the Bronx.
And it turned out it meant part-time sex work in an oddly clinical townhouse in midtown.
And you know something?
That was the happiest I've ever been.
But I don't understand because you came to New York because you wanted to write, so I don't really get, like, how, like, servicing other people would give you what you wanted.
Yes, but that's the mistake we all make, isn't it?
Believing that being a writer means being, you know, totally and utterly uninterrupted.
It means silence.
It means, you know, a room of one's own.
No, no, no.
See, that's bullshit.
Bullshit.
That's what we perceive a male writer to have.
- You know?
- ( cat yowls )
And that can lead to, ugh, horrible solipsism and disconnection from humanity.
I'm not naming names.
Never naming names.
Martin fucking Amis,
Woody Allen, Saul Bellow.
If you give the men the space that they say they need, then their work suffers, they suffer.
I guess that surprises me because I've always thought that I was working towards this moment when everything else would fall away and I would just be, like, you know, alone and able to just indulge my thoughts.
No, but that's bullshit.
I mean, can you even picture that?
Can you picture that?
I am not a mother, and there's a reason for that.
Because childlessness is the natural state of the female author, okay?
Write that down.
Get used to it, you know?
And, you know, I hate it when everyone says,
"Having a baby makes you part of the world."
I really resent that.
I don't need one of those to be able to look around.
You know?
I don't... it's like having a truck driven through your vagina, isn't it?
Totally.
So, then I'll just put it out there... is being a writer and being a woman at the same time, is it as hard as it seems or...?
Harder.

I'm not scared.
As long as I can keep my mother alive, I'm not scared.
You mean tell me mission does not scare you?
What scares me is losing the woman who raised me.
What scares me is the cancer taking over her whole body and, finally, her head... robbing her of oxygen and of the will to live.
What scares me is this world.
- No, I'm not scared.
- Woman:
Cut!
- Jesus fucking...
- Cut, please, now!
Take break, Jadviga.
What?
- Still, I feel there's no emotions from you, this feeling of big nothing, which, for me, is not okay.
I still don't understand why he's talking so much right now.
He is fucking scared.
And... and he's been so private about his mother's illness up until now.
So, what is it about now that makes him all of a sudden wanna go on and on and on...
- These are lines to explain!
- Yes, I know.
I know.
I just think I could do a better job if I don't say the lines.
So, which lines would you say, hmm?
No lines.
No lines?
With no lines, no story!
Just... ( blows raspberry )
I...
I want lines sometimes, Director Olatta.
Other times, I don't.
It just depends.
Adam, you're very talented, but I cannot keep with the debating you!
It gets me so frustrate!
I'm also very frustrate, okay?
!
I think we both want the same thing.
We wanna make the best movie we possibly can
- in the shortest amount of time.
- ( speaking foreign language )
- I'm saying we're limited, unfortunately.
- ( speaking foreign language )
Yesterday, I'm completely here and... this is so fucking rude to talk about someone and...
- Fuck this!
- ( argument continues )
Uh, good-bye.
It was nice meeting you.
- What?
- Best of luck with your son's graduation.
I'm fucking leaving!
- "Wh-what?
What?" - ( door closes )
This thing is itchy as fuck!
( moans ) Oh, you're so hot.
- I wanna come.
- Fuck me.
Yes, please come.
And then I'll come with your cum in my body.
- Okay, great.
- ( moans )
- I want a countdown.
- Yeah.
Five, four, three, two...
- ( grunts )
- You came early.
Hold on.
Almost there.
( moaning )
( sighs )
I wanna die inside the mouth of a lion with you.
And that way, we can be together forever, even in the moment of our own death.
Your death and my death, right?
Hello?
Huh?
Yeah.
What?
- I would literally die for someone to say that to me.
That's, like, fucking poetry.
It's, like, Shakespeare.
Yeah, no, it is poetry.
It's beautiful and flattering.
- Good.
- Yeah.
But couldn't we just, like, um... just get dinner sometimes?
- Yeah.
- I feel like I haven't seen you in weeks.
You're always at rehearsal or booty body camp, whatever it is.
Ray, it's not my fault if I wanna get strong for myself.
Yeah, no, I know.
And that's great.
That's good.
And you are strong.
It's just...
( sighs )
I don't know.
Look, I wanna be in the lion's mouth with you.
- That sounds nice.
- Good.
It sounds cozy and warm and exciting and dangerous.
But I also, I don't know... don't you just wanna, like, get dumplings and throw down a few beers and just catch up?
See what you've been up to and stuff?
Yeah, obviously that would be great.
That's, like, if you asked me like, "What's your ideal plan?"
That's my ideal plan.
Well, let's do it.
Let's do it tonight.
Oh, no, I can't tonight.
I have a thing.
And don't ask.
It's far too long and boring a story to explain what it is.
But, actually, that reminds me, it's gonna be a total nightmare getting uptown.
Do you think if I Uber, it will be made worth it if I'm able to meditate and catch up on emails in the car?
Or should I try to meditate on the train?
I mean, last time I tried to meditate on the train, some dude was manspreading next to me.
And it's just...
it's harder, but maybe that's a better challenge to my ability to remain mindful.
- It's just such a much steadier...
- Huh?
Should I Uber?
What?
Uber.
Yeah.
You can take an Uber.

Well, will you tickle my back?
No.
You know how they're shutting the N/R down at DeKalb?
Reminds me of this time back when I was assistant to the transportation commissioner when... and they don't tell you this... they shut the B down, or let's just say they pretended to shut the B down,
leaving it running only for the mayor and his homosexual friends.
- Sorry.
- I think you can imagine who I might be talking about.
But if you can't, picture this... a train full of homosexuals, me...
I don't judge... riding in secret.
Wow, that's a crazy story.
- Here you go.
- Oh, you can't imagine what I saw.
But my job was just to be quiet...

and, Desi, it is my personal opinion that we really need to get back to work.
More specifically, you need to get back to work.
And I think it would be good for your health.
Oh, for my health?
Okay.
So, I should just bail on my recovery?
- Do you think that's a good idea?
- No.
Hey, nice doing business with you.
It's been great.
I mean, I don't wanna play the blame game, but you're my worst enabler.
What you just did right there...
and I don't wanna insult you... but that was fucked up what you just did right there.
- Okay.
- All right.
It's not an insult.
Nobody's blaming you.
Desi just feels as if maybe you have helped to support,
- even encourage his relapse.
- Yeah.
Again, I'm not quite sure how that isn't blaming me, but we can discuss... you and I can discuss that later.
But I think that the idea, Desi, that I have, in some way, caused you to develop an addiction to something is absurd.
- No, that's... no, it's not...
- Oh, my God!
- It's not absurd.
- Oh, am I... you're hearing what I'm hearing, right?
- Because...
- It's okay, it's okay.
We're going to let Desi finish, and when he's done, you can then let us know how you feel.
I promise you I'll give you tons of time.
Okay, you finish now, and then I'll have my time to talk.
I've been thinking...
( clears throat )
I've been thinking...
( sighs )
- Can I have some water?
- Yeah, have some water.
- Take your time.
- Mm.
( inhales, exhales )
Jesus.
Good.
Good.
As I was saying... ( sniffs )
I've had a lot of time to think about this.
And I take full responsibility for where I'm at.
That said,
Marne, you were there with me the whole time, right next to me.
You were my partner, but you never saw me.
You just saw this dick... or this voice, you know, or this guitar, or this record contract.
You had this idea about me, but you never actually saw me as a human.
- Me, Desi.
- Raneed:
Mm.
And I fucking loved you.
It wasn't like your friends, like little Hannah and the gang, saying Marnie doesn't, you know, care about the environment, or Marnie's poetry is repetitive, or rolling their eyes and dismissing you,
saying, "Oh, that's just so Marnie, you know?"
I fucking loved...
I loved when things were Marnie.
- Mm.
- You know?
And I was all in.
I just couldn't handle me.
And you made that worse.
You did, because when I was struggling, you know, you just shut down.
I mean, you just fucking walked away.
You gave up.
I shut down?
I gave up?
Do you have any idea how hard this has been for me?
I have bruises all over my body from the two-hour massages that I need to deal with the stress of your addiction.
Are you...
are you serious?
Yeah.
- Did you hear what she said, man?
- Yeah.
Because you just made my whole drug treatment about you.
You did.
You really did, Marnie.
And it's clear that your narcissism is detrimental to Desi's recovery.
Desi:
Can I just say one more thing?
Clean up your side of the street, Marnie Marie.
Keep your side of the street clean, Marnie Marie.

- ( chuckles )

- ( growling )
- You are an artist!
I'm someone who knows how to psychologically support an artist.
You can't just make a movie, Jessa.
You need funds and sandwiches
- and people who care what you have...
- ( snores )
I mean, honestly, you're so boring.
We can get that stuff.
We'll sort that out.
Money literally grows on trees.
I mean, really, let's look this up.
"Making a movie."
There's a lot.
God damn, that was stressful.
Right in the middle of a busy workday like that, just thwack, down he goes.
Yeah, wow.
Jose said his head smacked the ground really hard.
I feel bad.
He was trying to tell me this long, elaborate story about Ed Koch, some secret gay train, but I was working, you know?
You can't... you can't listen to everyone at the same time or your fucking head will explode, you know?
Maybe it's about picking who to listen to.
What's that supposed to mean?
How long were you on the community board?
Three months?
Then you quietly retreated back to dating girls with six packs and pretending death wasn't real.
I'm worried about you, Ray.
You're smart.
You've always been smart, but your priorities are... cuckoo bananas.
And what, you're some fucking golden example?
You hate your wife.
You hate your job.
The only thing that gives you a glimmer of joy on this planet is recycling soda cans.
- It's free money!
- You know what, Herm?
You're starting to really fucking piss me off.
You know that?
I work hard for you.
I work hard for this business, and you're gonna stand there and call me a waste of space?
Hmm?
I don't need you to judge me for not letting Bobby gnash his dentures in my fucking face.
And who made you God, by the way?
I don't think I'm God, Ray.
Good, because there is no God.
That's a very arrogant position, Ray.
Congratulations.
I've been with you through all these phases... the music, the failed sitcom script, the communism, community board, and now you're just coasting.
And I'm probably responsible.
All right, you know what, Hermie?
It's been a brutal fucking day.
I'm not getting into this with you right now.
So sensitive, so testy.
Come on, Ray-Ray.
I'm not calling you a waste of space.
I'm calling you a waste of potential.
I'm going home, wherever the fuck that is.
- ( phone ringing ) - ( music playing on TV )
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi.
I got my Tracy on, and you're right, it's amazing.
All these tiny muscles I didn't know I had.
Yeah, it's a really great program.
I'll get those tapes back from you just as soon as my knee's healed.
Mom, I have blood in my pee again.
Again?
Let me see.
Mm, sorry.
Ooh.
Okay, okay.
You have to go to the ER.
I don't wanna go to the ER, Mom.
I'm on deadline.
I can't.
All right, Hannah, just go.
Fine.
No one's making movies about actual human people anymore.
And that's where we come in.
You know, it has to be raw and honest, real.
Yeah, and the only shit that's real is shit that actually happened.
Yes.
Yes!
We have to mine our lives for the truth.
You know, like, even if it fucking hurts, even if it's too painful for us to even comprehend.
Yes.
Adam, like us.
Like us with Hannah.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Yes.
Yes!
- We can't.
- What do you mean we can't?
It's perfect.
It's perfect.
It's about relationships, it... it's about loyalty and deceit, and it's raw, it's powerfully true, Adam.
And it might even be cathartic for us.
You know, help us to move on from this mess and be free.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yes!
I'm, like, so sweaty right now.
- This might be it.
- Yes.
It explains everything about human nature.
How even with the best of intentions we can't help but hurt each other.
- Yes!
- It's like a metaphor for war and... and corporations and religious strife.
- All that shit!
Yes!
- Yes, yes!
- ( squeals )
- Oh, Jesus!
Adam!
Oh, my God.
We might be a pair of goddamn geniuses.
( moaning )
- Wait.
- What?
We have to shoot it on film.
Yep.
Okay.
Like, fine.
( chuckles )
- In black and white.
- ( mutters )
- Too much?
- Yeah.
Yeah, too much.
( moans )
I'm slipping.
- ( chatter ) - ( phone rings )
Oh, fuck.
Oh, shit.
I'm not sure if you remember me.
Uh, I remember you.
- How you doing?
- Good.
Good, yeah.
Yeah, I mean, I'm in private practice now.
Just pick up a few shifts a week here to help...
The uninsured.
It's very noble.
But I do want you to know I tried to sign up for Obamacare and the website fucked me over, so...
Well, I'll get right on that.
Um, I have a UTI.
I get them all the time, so I need, like, Cipro, Pyridium, codeine if you're feeling, you know, fun and fancy. ( chuckles )
Yes, your urine tested positive for infection.
In the future,
I'd come see us a few days earlier when the symptoms start.
Yeah, it's just sometimes hard to tell if it's, like, just the baseline level of weirdness of my urethra or an actual issue, so it's like what's being alive and what's an infection?
- These are my questions.
- ( both chuckling )
I'm not sure if you...
if you pee after intercourse, but that can also help in preventing them.
And, plus, you're pregnant.
Do you know that?
I do now.
( sighs )
You know what?
The hug kind of feels like the wrong thing, so I'm gonna...
Do you know who the father is?
Yeah, he's a waterski instructor who I'm not likely to see again, so...
He's thrilled.
( chuckles )
Listen, um... the abortion is an out-of-pocket expense, but if you need help, I can bring you.
I can have a friend handle it, somebody I trust.
What makes you think I want an abortion?
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.
Thanks for your help.
I'll just use my expired antibiotics.
( sighs )
Ray:
How dare Hermie accuse me of wasting my potential?
Huh?
The audacity.
What has he done with his life?
He's got 20 years of wasted potential on me. 25!
Okay, well, maybe that's why he's being so hard on you, because, you know, he doesn't want you to end up like him.
Yeah, because I won't end up like him, ever.
Okay.
- Okay!
- Okay.
Fuck, I'm gonna totally end up like him.
- Well, I mean...
- And even if I did end up like him, is that so wrong, is that so bad?
He's got a wife, he's got a business, he's got the wisdom of a thousand fortune cookies.
I mean, I don't know.
Maybe that's... maybe I'd be totally fine if I ended up like him.
Well, maybe he wants you to have a life that's better than fine.
Yeah.
Fuck, you're right.
That's exactly what he wants.
He wants me to be a better version of himself.
- I'm gonna go apologize to him right now.
- Okay, good.
And you know what?
Yeah, maybe it is time I make some changes.
Maybe it is time I do something fucking real.
- Uh-huh.
- You know, something people will remember.
- You know?
- W-wait, like kill yourself?
What?
I'm sorry, it just really sounded like you were gearing up to that.
I'm not gonna kill myself, Shosh.
- Okay, good.
- Good.
- Do you wanna kill yourself?
- No, don't.
No.
- We'll talk about this later.
- Great.
- Shoshanna:
Or not.
- ( door closes )
That got real fast.
( door closes )
- Hi.
- Hey.
We're here to discuss a creative project with you.
Well, uh, it's...
it's a film.
- Yeah.
- It's a film about the complex dynamic that the three of us have been fostering for years now if you really think about it.
And I know it's really, really painful, so you don't have to make the decision now whether you wanna sign a release or not.
No, no, no.
No, we're so not there yet.
- We're way far down.
- We, um... no.
We just want you to think about how rich this is, cinematically.
You know?
And to think about the story that we could tell.
And we just would really hope that you will grant us permission to share what has transpired with the world and sort of elegantly unfold this...
This little package, really.
It's...
I mean, eh.
You guys should do whatever you want.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What about the party?
Ugh, it was total bullshit.
It was just, like, a bunch of old gays being like, "Oh, I'm so busy during the week.
I can only do uppers on the weekends."
Oh, well, good for you, Anthony.
- Did you go to the ER?
- Uh-huh.
Yeah?
You get some drugs, little Eponine?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Did they give you something for the pain?
Mm-mm.
Those unfeeling bastards.
Come, come.
Put your little head on my lap.
Come, come.
There you go.
Come here, little girl.
( sniffs )
I'm sorry I'm using my pizza hand.
Just adding more grease to this situation.
( music playing )
( doorbell chimes )
Hermie?
You there?
I'm opening up, you deaf bastard.
Coming in.
Hermie?
Hermie?
Hermie?
Hermie?
Hey.
Hermie?
Hey, wake up.
I gotta talk to you.
Hey.
Hermie.
Hey.
Hermie.
Hey, Hermie.
Hey!
Wake up, you motherfucker!
Wake up!
Hey!

Hey!
Hermie!

Woman:
Is green tea all right for you, Hillary?
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
Um, so, when I finally got to New York and I knew that I wanted to support myself on my own so I could write, well, I thought that was gonna mean, you know, serving cheesecake in Junior's or temping in the Bronx.
And it turned out it meant part-time sex work in an oddly clinical townhouse in midtown.
And you know something?
That was the happiest I've ever been.
But I don't understand because you came to New York because you wanted to write, so I don't really get, like, how, like, servicing other people would give you what you wanted.
Yes, but that's the mistake we all make, isn't it?
Believing that being a writer means being, you know, totally and utterly uninterrupted.
It means silence.
It means, you know, a room of one's own.
No, no, no.
See, that's bullshit.
Bullshit.
That's what we perceive a male writer to have.
You know?
And that can lead to, ugh, horrible solipsism and disconnection from humanity.
I'm not naming names.
Never naming names.
Martin fucking Amis,
Woody Allen, Saul Bellow.
If you give the men the space that they say they need, then their work suffers, they suffer.
I guess that surprises me because I've always thought that I was working towards this moment when everything else would fall away and I would just be, like, you know, alone and able to just indulge my thoughts.
No, but that's bullshit.
I mean, can you even picture that?
Can you picture that?
I am not a mother, and there's a reason for that.
Because childlessness is the natural state of the female author, okay?
Write that down.
Get used to it, you know?
And, you know, I hate it when everyone says,
"Having a baby makes you part of the world."
I really resent that.
I don't need one of those to be able to look around.
You know?
I don't... it's like having a truck driven through your vagina, isn't it?
Totally.
So, then I'll just put it out there... is being a writer and being a woman at the same time, is it as hard as it seems or...?
Harder.

I'm not scared.
As long as I can keep my mother alive, I'm not scared.
You mean tell me mission does not scare you?
What scares me is losing the woman who raised me.
What scares me is the cancer taking over her whole body and, finally, her head... robbing her of oxygen and of the will to live.
What scares me is this world.
- No, I'm not scared.
- Woman:
Cut!
- Jesus fucking...
- Cut, please, now!
Take break, Jadviga.
What?
- Still, I feel there's no emotions from you, this feeling of big nothing, which, for me, is not okay.
I still don't understand why he's talking so much right now.
He is fucking scared.
And... and he's been so private about his mother's illness up until now.
So, what is it about now that makes him all of a sudden wanna go on and on and on...
- These are lines to explain!
- Yes, I know.
I know.
I just think I could do a better job if I don't say the lines.
So, which lines would you say, hmm?
No lines.
No lines?
- With no lines, no story!
- Just...
I...
I want lines sometimes, Director Olatta.
Other times, I don't.
It just depends.
Adam, you're very talented, but I cannot keep with the debating you!
It gets me so frustrate!
I'm also very frustrate, okay?
!
I think we both want the same thing.
We wanna make the best movie we possibly can in the shortest amount of time.
I'm saying we're limited, unfortunately.
Yesterday, I'm completely here and... this is so fucking rude to talk about someone and...
- Fuck this!
- ( argument continues )
Uh, good-bye.
It was nice meeting you.
- What?
- Best of luck with your son's graduation.
I'm fucking leaving!
"Wh-what?
What?"
This thing is itchy as fuck!
Oh, you're so hot.
- I wanna come.
- Fuck me.
Yes, please come.
And then I'll come with your cum in my body.
Okay, great.
- I want a countdown.
- Yeah.
Five, four, three, two...
You came early.
Hold on.
Almost there.
I wanna die inside the mouth of a lion with you.
And that way, we can be together forever, even in the moment of our own death.
Your death and my death, right?
Hello?
Huh?
Yeah.
What?
- I would literally die for someone to say that to me.
That's, like, fucking poetry.
It's, like, Shakespeare.
Yeah, no, it is poetry.
It's beautiful and flattering.
- Good.
- Yeah.
But couldn't we just, like, um... just get dinner sometimes?
- Yeah.
- I feel like I haven't seen you in weeks.
You're always at rehearsal or booty body camp, whatever it is.
Ray, it's not my fault if I wanna get strong for myself.
Yeah, no, I know.
And that's great.
That's good.
And you are strong.
It's just...
I don't know.
Look, I wanna be in the lion's mouth with you.
- That sounds nice.
- Good.
It sounds cozy and warm and exciting and dangerous.
But I also, I don't know... don't you just wanna, like, get dumplings and throw down a few beers and just catch up?
See what you've been up to and stuff?
Yeah, obviously that would be great.
That's, like, if you asked me like, "What's your ideal plan?"
That's my ideal plan.
Well, let's do it.
Let's do it tonight.
Oh, no, I can't tonight.
I have a thing.
And don't ask.
It's far too long and boring a story to explain what it is.
But, actually, that reminds me, it's gonna be a total nightmare getting uptown.
Do you think if I Uber, it will be made worth it if I'm able to meditate and catch up on emails in the car?
Or should I try to meditate on the train?
I mean, last time I tried to meditate on the train, some dude was manspreading next to me.
And it's just...
it's harder, but maybe that's a better challenge to my ability to remain mindful.
- It's just such a much steadier...
- Huh?
Should I Uber?
What?
Uber.
Yeah.
You can take an Uber.
Hot rod in my urethra.
Pipe cleaner.
It feels like a pipe cleaner's in there.
Ow.
Ugh!
"Law Order:
UTI." Gong-gong!
It's not funny.
It feels so bad, okay?
And I didn't even get this one from sex.
I just walked around in wet underwear for a couple of days.
You're gross.
Hannah, can you text that one interesting lesbian you know and see if she can get me into the "New York Mag" party tonight?
I don't know, Elijah.
My bladder's on fire.
I don't know if I feel like abusing my media contacts for you right now.
Jaden Pinkett Smith is starting a greeting card line.
Please!
You're gonna look cool for even knowing about it.
Can I at least have some pain killers?
Oh, I wish you had asked me, like, two hours ago.
Clean out.
Well, will you tickle my back?
No.
You know how they're shutting the N/R down at DeKalb?
Reminds me of this time back when I was assistant to the transportation commissioner when... and they don't tell you this... they shut the B down, or let's just say they pretended to shut the B down,
leaving it running only for the mayor and his homosexual friends.
- Sorry.
- I think you can imagine who I might be talking about.
But if you can't, picture this... a train full of homosexuals, me...
I don't judge... riding in secret.
Wow, that's a crazy story.
- Here you go.
- Oh, you can't imagine what I saw.
But my job was just to be quiet...
Sure, yeah, just to be quiet.
Here you go.
It was really nice seeing you, Bobby.
Thanks for coming in.
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
- Have a good one.
- Yeah.
Uh, hey, is that scone raisin or Craisin?
I don't know, man.
I don't know.
- Man:
Hey.
Hey, Bobby?
- Oh, Jesus.
Ray:
Bobby!
Woman:
Guys, someone call 911!
Bobby?
Bobby?
and, Desi, it is my personal opinion that we really need to get back to work.
More specifically, you need to get back to work.
And I think it would be good for your health.
Oh, for my health?
Okay.
So, I should just bail on my recovery?
- Do you think that's a good idea?
- No.
Hey, nice doing business with you.
It's been great.
I mean, I don't wanna play the blame game, but you're my worst enabler.
What you just did right there...
and I don't wanna insult you... but that was fucked up what you just did right there.
- Okay.
- All right.
It's not an insult.
Nobody's blaming you.
Desi just feels as if maybe you have helped to support,
- even encourage his relapse.
- Yeah.
Again, I'm not quite sure how that isn't blaming me, but we can discuss... you and I can discuss that later.
But I think that the idea, Desi, that I have, in some way, caused you to develop an addiction to something is absurd.
- No, that's... no, it's not...
- Oh, my God!
- It's not absurd.
- Oh, am I... you're hearing what I'm hearing, right?
- Because...
- It's okay, it's okay.
We're going to let Desi finish, and when he's done, you can then let us know how you feel.
I promise you I'll give you tons of time.
Okay, you finish now, and then I'll have my time to talk.
I've been thinking...
I've been thinking...
- Can I have some water?
- Yeah, have some water.
- Take your time.
- Mm.
Jesus.
Good.
Good.
As I was saying...
I've had a lot of time to think about this.
And I take full responsibility for where I'm at.
That said,
Marne, you were there with me the whole time, right next to me.
You were my partner, but you never saw me.
You just saw this dick... or this voice, you know, or this guitar, or this record contract.
You had this idea about me, but you never actually saw me as a human.
- Me, Desi.
- Raneed:
Mm.
And I fucking loved you.
It wasn't like your friends, like little Hannah and the gang, saying Marnie doesn't, you know, care about the environment, or Marnie's poetry is repetitive, or rolling their eyes and dismissing you,
saying, "Oh, that's just so Marnie, you know?"
I fucking loved...
I loved when things were Marnie.
- Mm.
- You know?
And I was all in.
I just couldn't handle me.
And you made that worse.
You did, because when I was struggling, you know, you just shut down.
I mean, you just fucking walked away.
You gave up.
I shut down?
I gave up?
Do you have any idea how hard this has been for me?
I have bruises all over my body from the two-hour massages that I need to deal with the stress of your addiction.
Are you...
are you serious?
Yeah.
- Did you hear what she said, man?
- Yeah.
Because you just made my whole drug treatment about you.
You did.
You really did, Marnie.
And it's clear that your narcissism is detrimental to Desi's recovery.
Desi:
Can I just say one more thing?
Clean up your side of the street, Marnie Marie.
Keep your side of the street clean, Marnie Marie.

Common traits exhibited by children who go on to be diagnosed as sociopaths
- include displaying a lack of empathy...
- Yep.
- harming animals...
- Guilty.
- setting fires...
- Yeah.
- and petty vandalism.
- Oh, my God.
I did so much of this stuff.
Adam...
I think I may have been a child sociopath.
I mean, I've completely outgrown it, but I'm a miracle.
I think I may have to write a term paper on me.
I just quit the fucking movie.
Fuck!
The fuck did I do?
I'm sure it's fine.
Can't you just go back and apologize?
These Eastern Europeans are used to all this coming and going.
I can't fucking do this anymore.
Wait around like some tool to be someone else's fucking tool!
This shit's just so fucked!
I'm just gonna tell my agent to take me out of the game because I'm so fucking pissed!
Yeah, I know, darling.
I know.
Do you get to keep those jeans, though?
I-I'm sorry?
You don't know.
You can do your job without a whole crew of assholes in your face.
You just have one fucking psycho to analyze.
Like you?
Ha!
Adam, this is why I'm saying you need to make your own movie.
You are an artist!
I'm someone who knows how to psychologically support an artist.
You can't just make a movie, Jessa.
You need funds and sandwiches and people who care what you have...
I mean, honestly, you're so boring.
We can get that stuff.
We'll sort that out.
Money literally grows on trees.
I mean, really, let's look this up.
"Making a movie."
There's a lot.
God damn, that was stressful.
Right in the middle of a busy workday like that, just thwack, down he goes.
Yeah, wow.
Jose said his head smacked the ground really hard.
I feel bad.
He was trying to tell me this long, elaborate story about Ed Koch, some secret gay train, but I was working, you know?
You can't... you can't listen to everyone at the same time or your fucking head will explode, you know?
Maybe it's about picking who to listen to.
What's that supposed to mean?
How long were you on the community board?
Three months?
Then you quietly retreated back to dating girls with six packs and pretending death wasn't real.
I'm worried about you, Ray.
You're smart.
You've always been smart, but your priorities are... cuckoo bananas.
And what, you're some fucking golden example?
You hate your wife.
You hate your job.
The only thing that gives you a glimmer of joy on this planet is recycling soda cans.
- It's free money!
- You know what, Herm?
You're starting to really fucking piss me off.
You know that?

I don't wanna go to the ER, Mom.

I can't.
All right, Hannah, just go.
Fine.
No one's making movies about actual human people anymore.
And that's where we come in.
You know, it has to be raw and honest, real.
Yeah, and the only shit that's real is shit that actually happened.
Yes.
Yes!
We have to mine our lives for the truth.
You know, like, even if it fucking hurts, even if it's too painful for us to even comprehend.
Yes.
Adam, like us.
Like us with Hannah.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Yes.
Yes!
- We can't.
- What do you mean we can't?
It's perfect.
It's perfect.
It's about relationships, it... it's about loyalty and deceit, and it's raw, it's powerfully true, Adam.
And it might even be cathartic for us.
You know, help us to move on from this mess and be free.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yes!
I'm, like, so sweaty right now.
- This might be it.
- Yes.
It explains everything about human nature.
How even with the best of intentions we can't help but hurt each other.
- Yes!
- It's like a metaphor for war and... and corporations and religious strife.
- All that shit!
Yes!
- Yes, yes!
Oh, Jesus!
Adam!
Oh, my God.
We might be a pair of goddamn geniuses.
- Wait.
- What?
We have to shoot it on film.
Yep.
Okay.
Like, fine.
In black and white.
- Too much?
- Yeah.
Yeah, too much.
I'm slipping.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, shit.
I'm not sure if you remember me.
Uh, I remember you.

Yeah, it's just sometimes hard to tell if it's, like, just the baseline level of weirdness of my urethra or an actual issue, so it's like what's being alive and what's an infection?
These are my questions.
I'm not sure if you...
if you pee after intercourse, but that can also help in preventing them.
And, plus, you're pregnant.
Do you know that?
I do now.
You know what?
The hug kind of feels like the wrong thing, so I'm gonna...
Do you know who the father is?
Yeah, he's a waterski instructor who I'm not likely to see again, so...
He's thrilled.
Listen, um... the abortion is an out-of-pocket expense, but if you need help, I can bring you.
I can have a friend handle it, somebody I trust.
What makes you think I want an abortion?
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.
Thanks for your help.
I'll just use my expired antibiotics.
Ray:
How dare Hermie accuse me of wasting my potential?
Huh?
The audacity.
What has he done with his life?
He's got 20 years of wasted potential on me. 25!
Okay, well, maybe that's why he's being so hard on you, because, you know, he doesn't want you to end up like him.
Yeah, because I won't end up like him, ever.
Okay.
- Okay!
- Okay.
Fuck, I'm gonna totally end up like him.
- Well, I mean...
- And even if I did end up like him, is that so wrong, is that so bad?
He's got a wife, he's got a business, he's got the wisdom of a thousand fortune cookies.
I mean, I don't know.
Maybe that's... maybe I'd be totally fine if I ended up like him.
Well, maybe he wants you to have a life that's better than fine.
Yeah.
Fuck, you're right.
That's exactly what he wants.
He wants me to be a better version of himself.
- I'm gonna go apologize to him right now.
- Okay, good.
And you know what?
Yeah, maybe it is time I make some changes.
Maybe it is time I do something fucking real.
- Uh-huh.
- You know, something people will remember.
- You know?
- W-wait, like kill yourself?
What?
I'm sorry, it just really sounded like you were gearing up to that.
I'm not gonna kill myself, Shosh.
- Okay, good.
- Good.
- Do you wanna kill yourself?
- No, don't.
No.
- We'll talk about this later.
- Great.
Shoshanna:
Or not.
That got real fast.
- Hi.
- Hey.
We're here to discuss a creative project with you.
Well, uh, it's...
it's a film.
- Yeah.
- It's a film about the complex dynamic that the three of us have been fostering for years now if you really think about it.
And I know it's really, really painful, so you don't have to make the decision now whether you wanna sign a release or not.
No, no, no.
No, we're so not there yet.
- We're way far down.
- We, um... no.
We just want you to think about how rich this is, cinematically.
You know?
And to think about the story that we could tell.
And we just would really hope that you will grant us permission to share what has transpired with the world and sort of elegantly unfold this...
This little package, really.
It's...
I mean, eh.
You guys should do whatever you want.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What about the party?
Ugh, it was total bullshit.
It was just, like, a bunch of old gays being like, "Oh, I'm so busy during the week.
I can only do uppers on the weekends."
Oh, well, good for you, Anthony.
- Did you go to the ER?
- Uh-huh.
Yeah?
You get some drugs, little Eponine?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Did they give you something for the pain?
Mm-mm.
Those unfeeling bastards.
Come, come.
Put your little head on my lap.
Come, come.
There you go.
Come here, little girl.
I'm sorry I'm using my pizza hand.
Just adding more grease to this situation.
Hermie?
You there?
I'm opening up, you deaf bastard.
Coming in.
Hermie?
Hermie?
Hermie?
Hermie?
Hey.
Hermie?
Hey, wake up.
I gotta talk to you.
Hey.
Hermie.
Hey.
Hermie.
Hey, Hermie.
Hey!
Wake up, you motherfucker!
Wake up!
Hey!
Hermie!
Hey!
Hermie!

Comanches?
It would appear so.
I daresay the Texas Rangers will enjoy a bit of sport today.
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
Hyah!
Go with Escute!
Go!
It's a hell of a time to be singing.
It's his death song.
They all compose one for such a time as this.
_
Pete.
There's something terrible about to happen, and I need you to help me stop it.
Okay, tell me.
We appreciate you making the trip down here, Mr. Bates.
Yeah, well, last time your daddy sent for me on short notice, it was the day you was born.
So I figured it had to be important.
Look out!
Texas Rangers are here!
Eli!
You old son of a buck.
You don't look a day over 60.
That's very kind of you to say.
Whiskey is a great preservative.
You know, the first person to ever at shoot me was a Texas Ranger, probably your grandpa, Bigfoot Wallace himself.
You know...
I don't think so.
Old Bigfoot... he never fired a gun, he didn't kill something.
Sit down, take the weight off.
My boy Pete was tipped off about a stash of tools out there where the Old Indio Ferry used to run.
Pete?
There was a whole load of mallets and picks and iron bars, where the Del Rio line runs along the river.
We figure they mean to derail the train.
Son of a bitch.
How many was killed when they derailed that train from Brownsville?
Couple dozen.
Passenger line runs twice a week.
Next one's tomorrow.
Pete, where you gettin' all this crackerjack information?
Reliable source.
How reliable?
I saw it all myself, Hiram.
Well...
I reckon we ought to gather us up a posse.
Do you really think this is a good idea?
Stopping innocent people gettin' killed by the sediciosos?
I think it's fairly necessary, to say the least.
I'm talkin' about you.
This is a job for the sheriff or the Army.
Well, this is how we're doin' it.
The other night...
You scared me.
You shouldn't have followed me.
It was none of your business.
All right.
I'm sorry I scared you.
Stay home.
Please.
They can do this without you.
You think I want this?
I don't have a choice.
Why not?
I'm his son.
You ladies ready?
!
Let's kill some bandits!
- Missed your first shootout?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Still, I'll be saving your ass.
That's only 'cause he's got the Lewis gun.
Hey.
Hold up there, Charles.
Where do you think you're going?
I'm going with y'all.
I know what's going on.
You got a posse.
Giddyap!
You ain't going nowhere.
Come on, Dad.
No, get back in that house.
Yes, sir.
I ask you, what has the Mexican improved?
- Nothing.
- What lies south of our blood-slaked border but a mass of indigents whose only avocations are popery and violence?
Show me the Mexicans' contribution to civilization.
What is the Mexicans' cotton gin?
Where might I find the Mexicans' lightbulb?
Who is the Mexicans' Socrates?
Abandon hope, fellow travelers, for now we trespass upon the unimproved acreage of Señor García, who sits in his manse, hoarding his gold like some toothless old dragon.
Niles, shut your damn mouth.
That goes for everybody!
Zip it up!
I'd like to live out the week.
_
_
_
_
_
Your people are not welcome here.
- Go on!
- It's a free country.
- I said go!
- Ignacio!
Ven acá!
You people are murderers!
_
Pedro, I'm so sorry.
My son didn't mean to stare.
And we are very sorry for what youe going through.
You're not sorry!
You killed him!
iCállate la boca!
No, we are sorry, Mrs. McCullough.
Forgive my child.
This is a difficult time for us all.
Mama, you're hurtin' my arm!
Jeannie, come on.
We're going home.
Jeannie.
Charles!
Oh, shit.
Get those guns down.
It's my boy.
What the hell is wrong with you?
- Daddy, it's okay.
- It's okay?
I nearly put a bullet through your heart.
You think that's okay?
Huh?
You think that's okay?
Get down.
What the hell are you thinking?
Huh?
Huh?
You're gonna get back on that horse and you're gonna ride home.
It's too late for him to ride home alone.
- You're kidding me.
- We're on García land now.
Half the García vaqueros are in with the sediciosos.
It's safer for him here than to get bushwhacked riding home in the dark.
Go water your horse.
We gotta get that boy's head on straight.
Even when you were half his age, you knew better than to walk into a goddamned ambush.
Well, it ain't an accident I'm teaching him different.
Well, there you have it.
Everything you need to derail a train.
These are the only shallows for a couple of miles.
They'll cross in the morning before the train comes through.
We'll dig in up along the ridge there, make camp about a half a mile back.
We'll catch 'em in the water.
The fires of Hell ought to dry 'em off nicely.
Enough jawing.
Let's get to work.
Come on.
_
_
It's broken.
_
_
You sure you don't want some help?
_
_
_
What?
Is it your back?
- Yah!
- Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
Shh, shh.
_
_
_
_
_
You're a good horse.
You didn't deserve this.
Just lay still, and it'll be over, okay?
Shh.
Think about all those girls you got back there waiting on you.
There'll be a line of 'em waiting to nurse you back to health.
What is it?
_
Okay, don't stop.
You gotta stay awake, Escute.
_
That's a good idea.
Keep singing.
You gotta stay awake, Escute.
_
Keep singing.
Keep singing.
- Boys have been working fast.
- They're the best men in Texas.
You get Sullivan and Neptune to put one more foxhole up there.
I think we should build through up there.
Hey, one more.
That's it.
I'm worried about Charles.
Oh, relax, Son.
We got pickets posted in every position.
Pizaña shows up early, we'll be ready for 'em.
It ain't exactly Pizaña I'm worried about.
Who was it told you about the attack?
Cesar?
No.
Hmm.
You back with that García girl again?
What?
We're here because of something she told you.
Ain't that a fact?
No, it is not.
Anyhow, all that ended a long time ago.
Pete.
She has got nothing to do with any of it.
You just put that out of your mind.
Everything all right at home?
It's fine.
I feel some responsibility.
- Do you now?
- Mm, hell, yeah.
If you hadn't married Sally, you would have ended up with Maria.
I know that.
Things would have turned out a whole lot different.
Well, they didn't.
You wanted me to marry Sally, so I did.
You could have said no.
What's behind all this, Daddy?
What are you gettin' at?
It's such a surprise I care what happens to you?
I do.
My mother taught me how to sew and to cook.
Maybe you can mend Sullivan's panties while you're at it.
Sullivan sews his own panties.
You know I do.
When I get done massacring this jacket,
I'll take a nickel a sock.
Oh, me.
You ain't sitting' here.
Nonsense, Louis.
Neptune here is a comrade in arms.
A brother in blood.
You take a load off, Neptune, please.
Thank you kindly, Mr. Gilbert.
Pass that bottle on, Louis.
Manners, Louis.
Niles and them was sharing battle stories.
You know, Neptune fought with the Army down in the Philippines.
A real-life Buffalo Soldier?
Yes, sir.
Ninth Cavalry.
How many Moros you kill?
Six I know about.
Whoo!
Such derring-do.
Runs in the blood, I guess.
Tell me about your people, Neptune.
Back in Africa.
Are they savage as reported?
Don't know the first thing about Africa.
Oh.
What about your people, Mr. Gilbert?
They savage as reported?
The Gilberts?
We're, indeed, fightin' stock.
First to defend against Northern aggression when Sumter lit up.
And how'd they fare after the war?
Oh.
Yankees took everything.
Sharecroppin' is a fixed game, as rigged and treacherous as any roulette wheel.
Hell you say.
My people were sharecroppers, too, after they was finished being slaves, of course.
Mm-hmm.
Curious world, ain't it?
Sherman burns everything, and your family and mine come out equal in poverty.
'Course, that changed the day the Colonel came along and started paying my daddy a decent wage.
I daresay it elevated our station.
Oh!
I like you, Neptune.
Oh!
You and me...
We stand on the same footing.
We're the working poor.
We can't all of us be high-born.
The McCulloughs fought for every last thing they got.
Oh, Lord, don't mishear me.
We all revere the McCulloughs.
Just a name to live up to.
Good for you, Charles.
Good for you, coming to defend what's yours.
I ain't done nothing yet.
And that makes you pure potential, son.
Unlit dynamite.
Charles.
Let's go.
Time to feed the ponies.
Stay away from Niles Gilbert.
Why?
He seems harmless enough.
He's far from harmless.
He's only here 'cause he likes the idea of shooting Mexicans.
Hell, I like the idea of shooting Mexicans.
It hurts me when you talk like that.
You understand?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good.
The stuff your granddaddy and I did still keeps me up at night.
Well, if the people you did it to deserved it, who cares?
You're gonna keep your head down tomorrow.
- No, Da...
- Listen to me, Charles.
I want you to stay behind at camp.
You've got too much family buried out here already.
Charles?
Charles?
Have either of you seen your brother?
He was supposed to feed the animals.
I'll feed 'em.
I can't read with this racket.
Well, I don't like playing it any more than you like listening to it.
Listening to it's way worse.
Be kind, Jonas.
All that practice will pay off when she finally masters the instrument.
I ain't mastering squat.
Jeannie!
That's enough for your lessons.
Go find a book to read.
Okay, Mama.
Honey?
Do I have to?
Relaxes me.
All right, what do you want to hear?
Something gentle.
Mama?
Hmm?
Why do the Garcías think we killed Cesar?
Well, when bad things happen, it's human nature to look for someone to blame.
We need to be like Jesus and turn the other cheek.
But why do they pick on us?
We must have done something.
Don't talk stupid, Jonas.
Maybe granddaddy did something to them we don't know about.
The Colonel spends all his time working to make a good life for us.
You say one word against him, I'll bust your nose open.
Bug!
Don't talk to your brother that way.
I just don't like to see him upset you, Mama.
Escute!
_
Escute!
Shit.
_
Yeah.
Can't sleep.
Thank you.
For what?
Escute died.
But you tried to help him.
He could have died alone or been desecrated.
If they had scalped him, he couldn't enter the next world.
Now... now he's in a better place.
You did yourself a great honor today.
Tomorrow, when we bury Escute,
I want you to push him from his horse.
Smoke with me.
Shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh!
Shh.
_
Shh.
Shh.
Shh, shh.
_
- I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out!
- Okay.
Hey!
Go, go!
Don't let 'em cross that river!
- Keep 'em on the other side!
- You got it!
Jack!
No!
What, you expect them not to shoot back?
Get in it, Louis!
I'm out, I'm out!
Two behind the horse!
Right over there, two behind the horse!
Too low!
Give 'em hell, Neptune!
Yeah!
Attaboy, boys!
Yee-haw!
Goddamn!
Sullivan, you son of a gun, you!
I saw...
Sullivan!
Sullivan!
Come on, Sullivan!
You can't go down!
Come on, Sullivan!
Come on, get up, get up.
Come on.
Oh, my head hurts.
Sullivan, your head's so hard, the goddamned bullet bounced clean off.
It sure don't feel like it, Neptune.
Yeah, just about scalped you, but you ain't dead.
Well, who's the son of a bitch that shot me?
Greaser girl.
Pete got her.
Thanks, kid.
Owe you one.
It's all right, Son.
You had to.
You see that one's holster?
Give it here.
- But you rob a man, Louis.
- A shame to let it go to waste.
Whoo, look at that!
I know it's rough, Son, but you did the right thing.
Charles, turn that señorita's head this way.
Come on, come on.
Come over here.
Do you really think that what the world needs is more people like us?
It's a war, Son.
That's all it is.
It's just a war.
It's a war we're helping to start.
Makes my head hurt is what it does.
How's that head there, Sully?
Oh, I tell you what.
thank God for a thick skull.
It's thick, all right.
Only I have to wake up to your ugly face.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
I'm fine.
What happened out there?
Maybe ease up.
I am on your side.
My, my.
Comanches?
It would appear so.
I daresay the Texas rangers will enjoy a bit of sport today.

Good for you, coming to defend what's yours.
I ain't done nothing yet.
And that makes you pure potential, son.
Unlit dynamite.
Charles.
Let's go.
Time to feed the ponies.
Stay away from niles Gilbert.
Why?
He seems harmless enough.
He's far from harmless.
He's only here 'cause he likes the idea of shooting Mexicans.
Hell, I like the idea of shooting Mexicans.
It hurts me when you talk like that.
You understand?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good.
The stuff your granddaddy and I did still keeps me up at night.
Well, if the people you did it to deserved it, who cares?
You're gonna keep your head down tomorrow.
No, da...
listen to me, Charles.
I want you to stay behind at camp.
You've got too much family buried out here already.
Charles?
Charles?
Have either of you seen your brother?
He was supposed to feed the animals.
I'll feed 'em.
I can't read with this racket.
Well, I don't like playing it any more than you like listening to it.
Listening to it's way worse.
Be kind, Jonas.
All that practice will pay off when she finally masters the instrument.
I ain't mastering squat.
Jeannie!
That's enough for your lessons.
Go find a book to read.
Okay, mama.
Honey?
Do I have to?
Relaxes me.
All right, what do you want to hear?
Something gentle.
Mama?
Why do the garcías think we killed Cesar?
Well, when bad things happen, it's human nature to look for someone to blame.
We need to be like Jesus and turn the other cheek.
But why do they pick on us?
We must have done something.
Don't talk stupid, Jonas.
Maybe granddaddy did something to them we don't know about.
The colonel spends all his time working to make a good life for us.
You say one word against him, I'll bust your nose open.
Bug!
Don't talk to your brother that way.
I just don't like to see him upset you, mama.
Escute!
Escute!
Shit.
Yeah.
Can't sleep.
Thank you.
For what?
Escute died.
But you tried to help him.
He could have died alone or been desecrated.
If they had scalped him, he couldn't enter the next world.
Now...
Now he's in a better place.
You did yourself a great honor today.
Tomorrow, when we bury escute,
I want you to push him from his horse.
Smoke with me.
Shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh!
Shh.
Shh, shh.
Shh.
Shh, shh.
I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out!
Okay.
Hey!
Go, go!
Don't let 'em cross that river!
Keep 'em on the other side!
You got it!
Aah!
No!
What, you expect them not to shoot back?
Get in it, Louis!
I'm out, I'm out!
Two behind the horse!
Right over there, two behind the horse!
Too low!
Give 'em hell, Neptune!
Yeah!
Attaboy, boys!
Yee-haw!
Goddamn!
Sullivan, you son of a gun, you!
Aah!
Sullivan!
Sullivan!
Come on, Sullivan!
You can't go down!
Come on, Sullivan!
Come on, get up, get up.
Come on.
My head hurts.
Sullivan, your head's so hard, the goddamned bullet bounced clean off.
It sure don't feel like it, Neptune.
Yeah, just about scalped you, but you ain't dead.
Well, who's the son of a bitch that shot me?
Greaser girl.
Pete got her.
Thanks, kid.
Owe you one.
It's all right, son.
You had to.
You see that one's holster?
Give it here.
A shame to let it go to waste.
Whoo, look at that!
I know it's rough, son, but you did the right thing.
Charles, turn that señorita's head this way.
Come on, come on.
Come over here.
Do you really think that what the world needs is more people like us?
It's a war, son.
That's all it is.
It's just a war.
It's a war we're helping to start.
Makes my head hurt is what it does.
How's that head there, Sully?
I tell you what.
I thank god for a thick skull.
It's thick, all right.
Only I have to wake up to your ugly face.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
What happened out there?
Maybe ease up.
I am on your side.
My, my.
Comanches?
It would appear so.
I daresay the Texas rangers will enjoy a bit of sport today.
Hyah!
Go with escute!
Go!
It's a hell of a time to be singing.
It's his death song.
They all compose one for such a time as this.
Maria:
Pete.
There's something terrible about to happen, and I need you to help me stop it.
Okay, tell me.
We appreciate you making the trip down here, Mr. bates.
Yeah, well, last time your daddy sent for me on short notice, was the day you was born.
So I figured it had to be important.
Look out!
Texas rangers are here!
Eli!
You old son of a buck.
You don't look a day over 60.
That's very kind of you to say.
Whiskey is a great preservative.
You know, the first person to ever at shoot me was a Texas ranger, probably your grandpa, bigfoot Wallace himself.
You know...
I don't think so.
Old bigfoot -- he never fired a gun, he didn't kill something.
Sit down, take the weight off.
My boy Pete was tipped off about a stash of tools out there where the old indio ferry used to run.
Pete?
There was a whole load of mallets and picks and iron bars, where the del rio line runs along the river.
We figure they mean to derail the train.
Son of a bitch.
How many was killed when they derailed that train from brownsville?
Couple dozen.
Passenger line runs twice a week.
Next one's tomorrow.
Pete, where you gettin' all this crackerjack information?
Reliable source.
How reliable?
I saw it all myself, hiram.
Well...
I reckon we ought to gather us up a posse.
Do you really think this is a good idea?
Stopping innocent people gettin' killed by the sediciosos?
It's fairly necessary, to say the least.
I'm talkin' about you.
This is a job for the sheriff or the army.
Well, this is how we're doin' it.
The other night...
You scared me.
You shouldn't have followed me.
It was none of your business.
All right.
I'm sorry I scared you.
Stay home.
Please.
They can do this without you.
You think I want this?
I don't have a choice.
Why not?
I'm his son.
You ladies ready?
!
Let's kill some bandits!
Man:
Missed your first shootout?
Man:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Still, I'll be saving your ass.
That's only 'cause he's got the Lewis gun.
Hey.
Hold up there, Charles.
Where do you think you're going?
I'm going with y'all.
I know what's going on.
You got a posse.
Giddyap!
You ain't going nowhere.
Come on, dad.
No, get back in that house.
Yes, sir.
Niles:
I ask you, what has the Mexican improved?
Man:
Nothing.
What lies south of our blood-slaked border but a mass of indigents whose only avocations are popery and violence?
Show me the Mexicans' contribution to civilization.
What is the Mexicans' cotton gin?
Where might I find the Mexicans' lightbulb?
Who is the Mexicans' socrates?
Abandon hope, fellow travelers, for now we trespass upon the unimproved acreage of señor garcía, who sits in his manse, hoarding his gold like some toothless old dragon.
Niles, shut your damn mouth.
That goes for everybody!
Zip it up!
I'd like to live out the week.
Your people are not welcome here.
Go on!
It's a free country.
I said go!
Pedro:
Ignacio!
Ven acá!
You people are murderers!
Pedro, I'm so sorry.
My son didn't mean to stare.
And we are very sorry for what you're going through.
You're not sorry!
You killed him!
Icállatelaboca!
No, we are sorry, Mrs. McCullough.
Forgive my child.
This is a difficult time for us all.
Mama, you're hurtin' my arm!
Jeannie, come on.
We're going home.
Jeannie.
Charles!
Oh, shit.
Get those guns down.
It's my boy.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Daddy, it's okay.
It's okay?
I nearly put a bullet through your heart.
You think that's okay?
Huh?
You think that's okay?
Get down.
What the hell are you thinking?
Huh?
Huh?
You're gonna get back on that horse and you're gonna ride home.
It's too late for him to ride home alone.
You're kidding me.
We're on garcía land now.
Half the garcía vaqueros are in with the sediciosos.
It's safer for him here than to get bushwhacked riding home in the dark.
Go water your horse.
We gotta get that boy's head on straight.
Even when you were half his age, you knew better than to walk into a goddamned ambush.
Well, it ain't an accident I'm teaching him different.
Eli:
Well, there you have it.
Everything you need to derail a train.
These are the only shallows for a couple of miles.
They'll cross in the morning before the train comes through.
We'll dig in up along the Ridge there, make camp about a half a mile back.
Hiram:
We'll catch 'em in the water.
The fires of hell ought to dry 'em off nicely.
Enough jawing.
Let's get to work.
Come on.
It's broken.
You sure you don't want some help?
What?
Is it your back?
Man:
Yah!
Young Eli:
Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
Shh, shh.
You're a good horse.
You didn't deserve this.
Just lay still, and it'll be over, okay?
Shh.

Think about all those girls you got back there waiting on you.
There'll be a line of 'em waiting to nurse you back to health.
What is it?
Okay, don't stop.
You gotta stay awake, escute.
That's a good idea.
Keep singing.
You gotta stay awake, escute.
Keep singing.
Keep singing.
Man:
Boys have been working fast.
Eli:
They're the best men in Texas.
You get Sullivan and Neptune to put one more foxhole up there.
I think we should build through up there.
Man:
Hey, one more.
That's it.
I'm worried about Charles.
Oh, relax, son.
We got pickets posted in every position.
Pizaña shows up early, we'll be ready for 'em.
It ain't exactly pizaña I'm worried about.
Who was it told you about the attack?
Cesar?
No.
Hmm.
You back with that garcía girl again?
What?
We're here because of something she told you.
Ain't that a fact?
No, it is not.
Anyhow, all that ended a long time ago.
Pete.
She has got nothing to do with any of it.
You just put that out of your mind.
Everything all right at home?
It's fine.
I feel some responsibility.
Do you now?
Mm, hell, yeah.
If you hadn't married Sally, you would have ended up with Maria.
I know that.
Things would have turned out a whole lot different.
Well, they didn't.
You wanted me to marry Sally, so I did.
You could have said no.
What's behind all this, daddy?
What are you gettin' at?
It's such a surprise i care what happens to you?
I do.
My mother taught me how to sew and to cook.
Maybe you can mend Sullivan's panties while you're at it.
Niles:
Sullivan sews his own panties.
You know I do.
When I get done massacring this jacket,
I'll take a nickel a sock.
You ain't sitting' here.
Nonsense, Louis.
Neptune here is a comrade in arms.
A brother in blood.
You take a load off, Neptune, please.
Thank you kindly, Mr. Gilbert.
Pass that bottle on, Louis.
Manners, Louis.
Niles and them was sharing battle stories.
You know, Neptune fought with the army down in the Philippines.
A real-life buffalo soldier?
Yes, sir.
Ninth cavalry.
How many moros you kill?
Six I know about.
Whoo!
Such derring-do.
Runs in the blood, I guess.
Tell me about your people, Neptune.
Back in Africa.
Are they savage as reported?
Don't know the first thing about Africa.
Oh.
What about your people, Mr. Gilbert?
They savage as reported?
The Gilberts?
We're, indeed, fightin' stock.
First to defend against northern aggression when sumter lit up.
And how'd they fare after the war?
Oh.
Yankees took everything.
Sharecroppin' is a fixed game, as rigged and treacherous as any roulette wheel.
Hell you say.
My people were sharecroppers, too, after they was finished being slaves, of course.
Mm-hmm.
Curious world, ain't it?
Sherman burns everything, and your family and mine come out equal in poverty.
'Course, that changed the day the colonel came along and started paying my daddy a decent wage.
I daresay it elevated our station.
Oh!
I like you, Neptune.
Oh!
You and me...
We stand on the same footing.
We're the working poor.
We can't all of us be high-born.
The mcculloughs fought for every last thing they got.
Oh, lord, don't mishear me.
We all revere the mcculloughs.
Just a name to live up to.
Good for you, Charles.
Good for you, coming to defend what's yours.
I ain't done nothing yet.
And that makes you pure potential, son.
Unlit dynamite.
Pete:

It's thick, all right.
Sullivan:
Only I have to wake up to your ugly face.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
What happened out there?
Maybe ease up.
I am on your side.
Previously on Riverdale...
The story is about a town, once wholesome and innocent, now forever changed by the mysterious murder of Jason Blossom...
This is our insurance.
In case everything goes to hell.
Stash it.
Keep it safe.
I talked it over with Mrs. Cooper.
She's a part of this?
She's gonna keep FP busy while we search his trailer to find anything that links FP to Jason.
Or, more importantly, FP to my dad.
We went to your dad's trailer...
- Why would you guys do that?
- We were wrong.
We didn't find anything.
- You went behind my back, Archie?
- Jug...
My dad just told Mayor McCoy
- about your dad.
- What about my dad?
He was just arrested.
For the murder of Jason Blossom.
Someone planted the gun...
Jason's murder weapon, in a closet in FP's trailer.
It wasn't there when we searched for it.
He's being framed, Betty.
Well, maybe you didn't see it.
We're not talking about the Vogue closet here, Bee...
Well, maybe you looked in the wrong one.
It's a trailer with literally one closet.
There was no lockbox.
No gun.
Whatever Sheriff Keller is saying he found, it wasn't there.
Look, we need to tell Jughead his dad's innocent.
Where is Jughead?
I don't know.
I tried calling him.
I left him messages.
He's not answering his phone.
In the meantime...
- Should we talk to Sheriff Keller?
- No.
Not until we tell our parents.
That we broke into FP's trailer?
My dad will know what to do.
You did what?
We had to make sure FP wasn't involved in Jason's murder.
And now we know the truth.
He was.
What?
Mom, no.
We just told you.
- The gun was planted.
- By whoever killed Jason.
Couldn't you have just missed it?
Yeah, excuse me if I trust the detection skills of an officer of the law over three amateur sleuths.
Mom, you're the one who asked Veronica to break in!
- Excuse me?
- What!
- Alice?
- Actually...
I approached Mrs. Cooper.
I had to know if FP was involved, and if he was connected to my dad.
A gun was found.
FP is the killer.
Case closed.
We're leaving.
There was no gun!
Son, this isn't petty theft or a bar fight we're talking about, Archie.
This is murder.
Okay, fine.
Then we'll go to the sheriff without you.
Archie, you entered FP's residence illegally.
So whatever you did or did not find there would be inadmissible in a court of law.
I don't care what happens to me.
I do care.
FP may have ruined Jughead's life,
I'm not gonna let him ruin yours.
_
Hi, Mom.
Hey, guess what?
I got a bus ticket to Toledo.
Yeah.
I thought I'd come see you and Jellybean for a while.
I could crash on the couch.
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.
No.
I...
No, I understand.
Look, I...
Forget I said anything, okay?
All right.
Bye.
I changed my mind about Toledo.
Can you just put me on whatever the next bus out of town is?
I don't even care where it's going.
Citrusville, Florida.
Leaves tomorrow morning at 6:00.
Great.
Lobby closes in fifteen minutes, reopens at 5:30.
Mom?
What are you looking for?
- Our passports.
- Why?
Because Lord knows what FP is going to say, now that he's behind bars.
So, you do think Daddy hired him to kill Jason?
Honey, I don't know.
But, regardless of that, we are known associates of the man who killed Jason Blossom.
Your father may have had something to do with that.
Maybe not.
But either way, we need to be ready.
Ready to do what?
Run away?
Like we ran away from New York?
- We're gonna look guilty.
- Baby, we are guilty!
I'm guilty.
I bribed the Mayor to get the drive-in land, forged your signature, paid off the Serpents.
If that comes out, just...
Pack a bag, okay?
Just in case.
Come on.
From what he said in the hall, it seems like he wants to get to his mom in Ohio.
- Anything?
- No.
Maybe his phone died.
Or maybe, the only friends he has just completely betrayed him.
- Is that him?
- No, it's Veronica.
Hey.
You okay?
Not really.
My mom's spiraling, and I'm on the verge.
I just wanted to talk.
Where are you?
I'm with Betty.
We're looking for Jughead.
Wait.
You and Betty went on a manhunt without me?
I'll come meet you.
We're at the bus station, but it's shut down for the night.
What's the one place in town that's open 24 hours?
Hint, we were just there.
- Told you.
- Jug.
Jug, we're so sorry...
About everything.
Juggy, we screwed up.
We all did.
Breaking into your dad's trailer was wrong, but at least some good came out of it.
Pretty sure my dad was just arrested for murder.
That gun wasn't there when we searched his trailer.
Someone put it there after we left.
What are you talking about?
The gun we found in your trailer matched the bullet that killed Jason Blossom.
So, did you know him well, or did you just do it for kicks?
Last summer, a redhead kid comes up to me at the bar, the Whyte Wyrm.
Said he was planning to run away with his pregnant girlfriend.
- Polly Cooper.
- So I would learn.
He asked me to set him up with a getaway car and some cash.
We made a deal.
In exchange for some wheels, and a tidy sum, he would make a delivery for me.
- Drugs?
- Mmm.
I got him a station wagon, stashed some weed in the back.
Then...
I put two and two together.
Realized he was Cliff Blossom's son.
I thought...
Kid like that has everything.
Why in the hell does he need a guy like me?
Then he told me his plan.
On July 4th, his sister was going to row him across Sweetwater River, tip the boat, and say he drowned.
Once he made it across the river,
I grabbed him before he reached his getaway car, which he'd stashed I don't know where.
And then, I took him to the Wyrm...
Held him in the basement.
I kept him tied up and worked out my plan.
Which was?
Get word to Cliff Blossom that his son was alive, and being held for ransom.
Set up a drop-off point for payment to get him back.
Before I sent word to Blossom, the kid got loose.
Tried to escape.
And that's when you shot him and stuffed him in the freezer.
Once things quieted down, and your guys were done dragging Sweetwater River for his body, that's when I dumped it.
The only place we'd already looked.
You break into my house and steal my files?
Yeah, I did.
I even followed my son and Betty Cooper to Jason's getaway car, and torched it.
You must've thought you're real smart.
Now, I wanna hear you say it.
Did you kill Jason Blossom?
Excuse me, sir.
We need to see Sheriff Keller.
There's been a huge mistake.
Sheriff, we need to talk to you about FP Jones.
- What about him?
- He's innocent.
He's being framed.
Then why did he just confess?
Polly, the most incredible thing has happened.
He killed Jason, not...
I went to the station.
I looked our son's killer in the eye.
Finally, we'll have peace.
Jason will have peace.
And we...
We can all start over.
All of us.
The police report said FP worked alone.
No mention of your dad, Ronnie.
That's good news, right?
I can't stop thinking that...
Maybe my dad hired another Serpent to plant that gun.
It's surreal, isn't it?
How's Jughead doing?
Not good.
He's not coming in today.
He's at the station.
- Being grilled by your dad.
- Who's just doing his job.
I mean, of course he's gonna ask Jughead questions.
Okay, well, he's wasting his time, Kev.
Because FP didn't kill Jason.
- Betty, he confessed.
- Or he was coerced.
Or he's protecting someone, maybe a Serpent.
My mom saw him and Joaquin together...
Don't!
Do not drag my boyfriend into this.
What're you...
- Oh, no.
- What?
What happened to him not coming in today?
I'm sorry, Cheryl.
Enough!
Mr. Jones, you need to come with me.
Right now.
He was apologizing.
He didn't do anything wrong!
- Cheryl?
- I barely touched him.
It's not his fault, Cheryl.
Even if his dad did do it, it's...
Everybody keeps coming up to me, and hugging me, and telling me that I must be so relieved that my brother's killer has finally been caught.
That this nightmare is over.
Then why doesn't it feel that way?
What happened in there?
My second interrogation of the day.
Don't know who's more of a dick,
Keller or Weatherbee.
Don't listen to them.
Everyone else is wrong.
Your dad's innocent, and we just need to prove it, Jug.
Who killed him, then, Betty?
Tell me.
If it wasn't my dad, who killed Jason Blossom?
He said he did it, and you know what?
I've been waiting my whole life for that man to do the right thing, and I'm done.
- You should be, too.
- Jug.
Yes, I...
I appreciate it.
That was Weatherbee.
He's concerned for Jug's personal safety.
After what happened with Cheryl, he's worried about the other students' reaction to it.
Thinks Jughead should finish the semester from home.
Jughead's getting kicked out because Cheryl pummeled him.
How is that fair?
It's not.
Well, can we call, I don't know, the school board?
Son, FP may spend decades in prison, potentially the rest of his life.
We gotta think of a long-term solution.
We are the long-term solution.
That's not how it works, okay?
I'm not his legal guardian.
Oh, good thing mom's a lawyer.
Archie, my priority is keeping you safe.
Keep me safe from who?
Jughead?
Are you kidding me, Dad?
No, from whatever trouble seems to follow the Jones' around, wherever they go, whatever they do.
Hell, maybe you should go to Chicago and live with your mom.
It's not even something I was considering, Dad.
But you know what?
Maybe I should.
Hey, if it'll keep you out of trouble, I'm all for it.
Hey, Jug.
I'm gonna sleep in the garage tonight.
Okay?
Jug...
Did you hear that?
Mom, what are you doing with that?
Get behind me.
Be ready to dial 911.
Don't move.
Hands where I can see them.
Don't shoot, Alice.
- Dad!
- Hal!
These are Sheriff Keller's files about the Blossom murder investigation.
How did you get these, Dad?
I broke into his house the night of the last drive-in, and I took them.
Well, that's impossible.
FP Jones already confessed to that.
Well, I have no idea why he would do that, because it was me.
That's why I'm here.
To destroy any evidence that could lead back to me.
Wait, that doesn't make any sense.
Why would FP fess up to something he didn't even do?
Yeah, I'm not thinking about FP right now.
I'd like to know why your father is stealing and destroying evidence in a murder investigation.
Look, I was worried that the investigation would get back to Polly, somehow.
To us.
And somehow Sheriff Keller would figure out the connection between our family and the Blossoms.
And he would think that there was some kind of motive.
Wait, you mean about Great-Grandpappy Cooper being murdered by a Blossom?
Betty...
Your great-grandfather wasn't just murdered by a Blossom.
He was a Blossom.
After the murder, our family severed ties with the Blossoms and their name, and we took a new one. "Cooper."
I'm...
A Blossom?
Polly is a Blossom, which makes her and Jason relatives by blood.
- Which is why you wanted to...
- Yeah.
Alice, that's why.
Oh, my God, Hal.
If you're willing to send our daughter away to keep her away from Jason...
How far would the Blossoms go to keep them apart?
We need to get Polly out of that house.
Don't bother calling the cops.
We're not staying.
Polly!
What the hell is going on here, Alice?
It's the middle of the night.
Oh, sorry to disrupt the witching hour at Thornhill.
Polly, honey, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Betty, what's going on?
We're here to bring you home, Pol.
She's not leaving us.
She chose to live here, remember?
With a mentally stable family.
Oh, I know all about your family, Penelope.
- And the incest.
- What?
What incest?
Hal's grandfather wasn't just your grandpappy's murder victim.
They were brothers, which made him a Blossom.
Just like Hal.
- Yeah, so what?
- "So what?"
So, everything, starting with FP's confession, has a few gaping holes in it.
He's being used by someone with a crazy motive, for example, hiding incest.
You were disgusted that Jason and Polly were dating because they were related.
Nothing could be more purely Blossom than those babies.
Okay, what is wrong with you people?
Will you just spare us the middle-class morality.
It's not like they were brother and sister.
They were, what, third cousins.
You think I killed my son?
That's it.
Polly, we are out of here.
Enough of this Doctor Moreau experimentation in breeding and eugenics.
It's over!
Betty, let's go.
You've made a grave error, little girl.
No, I don't think so.
And I'm not gonna stop until I prove it.
Juggy.
Jug.
Wake up, we gotta go to Pop's.
Archie asked me to look into your father's case.
I went down to the station, and passed myself off as his attorney to try to get as much information as I could.
How's it looking, Mom?
Well, unfortunately, between FP's list of priors, the anonymous tip, and the possession of the murder weapon...
Don't forget that pesky confession.
Things look pretty bad.
I was with him all night, and he never once budged from his story.
Well, if nothing else, at least he's an honest murderer.
- Jug...
- Right?
Oh, also, who is Joaquin DeSantos?
Joaquin?
As in Kevin's boyfriend?
He was FP's one phone call.
Jughead, my advice to you is, go and see your father.
Tell him everything you wanna say.
Once he's arraigned, things tend to move pretty quickly, and there won't be anything left to do.
So, this might be your last chance.
When Archie told me about his little plan to help you, get you on your feet, and working with Fred,
deep down, I knew it was a mistake.
Should have listened to your gut.
You really had me.
Cleaning the trailer.
Convincing me that you had quit drinking.
I was so happy, for the first time in so long.
You paid attention to me.
Let's be honest.
The only reason you even read my manuscript about Jason's murder, was to make sure I wasn't onto you.
And you didn't want to take me to Toledo to get the family back together.
You wanted to get away.
You wanted to run away.
I did what I had to do!
What I always do!
Are you even sorry?
Sorry I got caught.
We done?
Look at me, Jughead!
Never come back here!
Understand?
Got it.
He called Joaquin?
Why not Jughead?
Or your dad?
Or a lawyer?
- It's weird.
- What does Betty think?
She thinks it's weird.
Joaquin might know if FP was hired to kill Jason, if it was my father...
I need to see this through to the end.
We know FP used his call from jail to get in touch with you.
What did he say?
It was basically just a warning.
Said to lay low.
No one uses their one call to say "lay low."
Joaquin, do you know something?
I'm not talking to you as your boyfriend,
I'm talking to you as the sheriff's son.
Did FP kill Jason?
Yeah.
- I mean, I...
I assume.
- Oh, my God.
Did you see him pull the trigger?
No, no.
God, no...
Then why do you think he did it?
On July 11th, I got a phone call in the middle of the night from FP.
Said he needed help with some clean-up job at the Whyte Wyrm.
What job?
The basement of the Whyte Wyrm is off limits to everyone, but that's where I met FP, and that's where I saw...
He'd been shot.
I never asked FP if he did it.
I just...
I mean, I was terrified.
I...
I just assumed.
We stashed the body in the freezer, cleaned up the mess, got rid of any evidence...
You are a criminal.
Joaquin, FP has done jobs for my dad, Hiram Lodge, in the past.
Do you think killing Jason was one of them?
There was one time I overheard a conversation between FP and Mustang...
- Who's Mustang?
- He's another Serpent.
The only other guy who knew about the clean-up.
The guy you got into a fight with at the Wyrm.
I heard him tell FP something about some rich guy.
I don't know who.
- Where is Mustang?
- No, no, no, no.
You do not want to go see him.
Yes, I do.
And you're going to take us.
Or...
Or I'm going to tell my dad about your little clean-up job.
I'm so glad that you're home, Pol.
And that you're safe.
And that the babies are okay and healthy.
But God, everything else...
Is the worst.
Betty, I saw my dad.
You were right.
He's hiding something.
Not that much money in local crime and villainy, huh?
This is him, here.
Mustang?
You here?
Oh, my God.
- I can't...
I can't be here.
- Let's go.
Call my dad.
- Son...
- I'm okay.
We both are.
What were you doing here in the first place?
We knew Mustang was a Serpent.
We just wanted to talk to him, to see if he knew anything about FP.
Veronica, this has to stop.
- Why are you doing this?
- Mom.
What do you think happened in there?
Likely an overdose.
We're waiting to see a time of death, but it wouldn't surprise me at all if he was somehow involved in Jason's murder, and was feeling the heat.
And how'd you know he even lived here?
Sheriff...
Found it under his bed.
Hermione Lodge?
Mind explaining to me why your initials are on this bag?
Not Hermione Lodge, Sheriff.
- Hiram Lodge.
My dad.
- Veronica!
Mom...
He was doing business with the Serpents.
And that's all we're saying until there's an attorney present.
This is exactly what I didn't want to happen.
If you stay on this path, you will end up dead.
Just like Jason Blossom.
You gotta believe me.
Okay?
When I tell you I'm trying to protect you.
That is my job.
It's the only one that counts.
- Do you got that?
- Yes.
Mom!
Mom...
Mom!
It's okay.
It's okay.
You gotta tell your friends to stop before they get hurt.
You really don't know them at all, do you?
Just like I don't know you.
- Joaquin?
- Yeah?
I'm gonna miss you, Preppy...
Look, I didn't want to say this in front of your friends, but there's something else.
My dad's been lying to me his whole life, but he's never been any good at it.
I saw it in his eyes.
- He didn't do it.
- So, why lie?
Who is he protecting?
Mommy, that last morning, before Jay-Jay and I went to the river...
Why were he and Daddy arguing?
We've been over this.
Your father dedicated himself to grooming Jason to take over the family business,
- but in the end...
- He couldn't stomach it.
When, really, I should have been nurturing you.
Because Jason never had the stomach for any of it.
But you...
You're a Blossom.
I remember.
He told me.
But why?
What couldn't he handle?
So many questions, Cheryl...
Okay, who can we rule out?
My dad.
We know why he was acting so shady.
- Hermione.
- Yeah.
Veronica says she's guilty of plenty, but not murder.
Plus, she has an alibi.
She was in New York.
So, that just leaves Hiram Lodge...
And Clifford and Penelope Blossom...
I think something happened, Mommy.
Whatever do you mean?
If Daddy wasn't mad at Jason about Polly, it must have been about the business.
I don't know if he heard something he shouldn't have, or he saw something he didn't like...
You don't know what you're saying...
What was Jay-Jay running away from?
The business?
Daddy?
You?
Ow!
You think your father killed your brother?
You think I did?
You think we murdered him and threw him in the river, because Jason knew some deep, dark, horrible secret about our business?
You want answers, Cheryl?
Are you ready?
There it is!
There's the sticky, dark, dirty truth.
Maple syrup!
Drown in it, why don't you?
Well, what do we have here?
You two just can't leave well enough alone, can you?
Mom, we know what you're going to say.
The police found another dead body.
Okay, maybe not that.
A Southside Serpent and Sheriff Clueless is convinced that he was working with your father.
He allegedly committed suicide by overdose, and there was a bag of money on-site that links him to Hiram Lodge.
Everything is tied up into a nice little bow.
Too tidy, if you ask me.
Kevin?
Oh, okay.
We'll meet you there.
Whatever it is we're looking for,
Joaquin didn't know if it would help your dad, or make things worse.
Um, guess we're going to find out.
And why did he wait so long to tell us?
FP called him from jail.
Told him to forget about their plan, some contingency plan.
He said it was too dangerous.
Deja vu.
Hey, right here.
This is meant to help FP?
I don't know.
Looks like more incriminating evidence to me.
Yeah, this just confirms that my dad torched Jason's getaway car.
And that his confession was true.
Why would FP say Jason's varsity jacket is dangerous?
What could that mean?
I can ask my father.
He would know, considering we found concrete proof that he hired the Serpents to kill Jason.
Which probably means that your dad pulled the trigger, Jughead.
I'm sorry.
No.
No!
No, I'm not giving up yet.
Put this on.
- What?
- Put it on.
Betty, this is weird.
There's a hole in the pocket.
Okay, now we're just grasping at straws...
Okay, no.
I don't know about you guys, but whenever I have a hole in my jacket pocket,
I always lose my chapstick in the lining.
Or my Montblanc?
Hold on.
What the hell?
Nancy Drew strikes again.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Betty...
Betty, who are you calling?
You have to get out of that house.
Listen to me...
I understand.
Thank you.
Cheryl, what is it?
You did a bad thing, Daddy.
And now everyone knows.
Sheriff.
Your office told me that I would find you here.
You need to see this.
Both of you.
That night,
Sheriff Keller and Mayor McCoy saw what we watched in Archie's garage.
Jason, tied to a chair, in the basement of a bar, on the Southside of Riverdale, while a Serpent, Mustang, taunted him.
Then, the unthinkable.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Later, we would learn why my father confessed.
Because Clifford Blossom visited him on the night of his arrest, with a threat, that I, Jughead Jones, would suffer the same fate as Jason Blossom, if my father didn't confess.
My dad was protecting me from a monster, and the nightmare was far from over.
Charged with tampering with evidence, obstruction of justice, mishandling a body, perjury, and that's just off the top of my head.
He's not getting out any time soon.
I'm sorry, Mom, that I ever thought that Dad...
Shh, mija.
Everyone makes mistakes.
I have good news.
Very good news.
Your father's coming home.
And our families, far from repaired...
I'm sorry, Mom, but my friends need me.
You should come for the summer, maybe?
That'd be great.
- You be careful.
- I will.
You better.
I love you, Archie.
I love you too, Mom.
And though one question had been answered that night, that it was Clifford Blossom who killed Jason, a new mystery loomed over Riverdale.
Why had he done it?
It was a question only Clifford himself would be able to answer.
Previously on Riverdale...
The story is about a town, once wholesome and innocent, now forever changed by the mysterious murder of Jason Blossom...
This is our insurance.
In case everything goes to hell.
Stash it.
Keep it safe.
I talked it over with Mrs. Cooper.
She's a part of this?
She's gonna keep FP busy while we search his trailer to find anything that links FP to Jason.
Or, more importantly, FP to my dad.
We went to your dad's trailer...
- Why would you guys do that?
- We were wrong.
We didn't find anything.
- You went behind my back, Archie?
- Jug...
My dad just told Mayor McCoy
- about your dad.
- What about my dad?
Hewasjustarrested.
For the murder of Jason Blossom.
Someone planted the gun...
Jason's murder weapon, in a closet in FP's trailer.
It wasn't there when we searched for it.
He's being framed, Betty.
Well, maybe you didn't see it.
We're not talking about the Vogue closet here, Bee...
Well, maybe you looked in the wrong one.
It's a trailer with literally one closet.
There was no lockbox.
No gun.
Whatever Sheriff Keller is saying he found, it wasn't there.
Look, we need to tell Jughead his dad's innocent.
Where is Jughead?
I don't know.
I tried calling him.
I left him messages.
He's not answering his phone.
In the meantime...
- Should we talk to Sheriff Keller?
- No.
Not until we tell our parents.
That we broke into FP's trailer?
My dad will know what to do.
You did what?
We had to make sure FP wasn't involved in Jason's murder.
And now we know the truth.
He was.
What?
Mom, no.
We just told you.
- The gun was planted.
- By whoever killed Jason.
Couldn't you have just missed it?
Yeah, excuse me if I trust the detection skills of an officer of the law over three amateur sleuths.
Mom, you're the one who asked Veronica to break in!
- Excuse me?
- What!
- Alice?
- Actually...
I approached Mrs. Cooper.
I had to know if FP was involved, and if he was connected to my dad.
A gun was found.
FP is the killer.
Case closed.
We're leaving.
There was no gun!
Son, this isn't petty theft or a bar fight we're talking about, Archie.
This is murder.
Okay, fine.
Then we'll go to the sheriff without you.
Archie, you entered FP's residence illegally.
So whatever you did or did not find there would be inadmissible in a court of law.
I don't care what happens to me.
I do care.
FP may have ruined Jughead's life,
I'm not gonna let him ruin yours.
Hi, Mom.
Hey, guess what?
I got a bus ticket to Toledo.
Yeah.
I thought I'd come see you and Jellybean for a while.
I could crash on the couch.
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.
No.
I...
No, I understand.
Look, I...
Forget I said anything, okay?
All right.
Bye.
I changed my mind about Toledo.
Can you just put me on whatever the next bus out of town is?
I don't even care where it's going.
Citrusville, Florida.
Leaves tomorrow morning at 6:00.
Great.
Lobby closes in fifteen minutes, reopens at 5:30.
Mom?
What are you looking for?
- Our passports.
- Why?
Because Lord knows what FP is going to say, now that he's behind bars.
So, you do think Daddy hired him to kill Jason?
Honey, I don't know.
But, regardless of that, we are known associates of the man who killed Jason Blossom.
Your father may have had something to do with that.
Maybe not.
But either way, we need to be ready.
Ready to do what?
Run away?
Like we ran away from New York?
- We're gonna look guilty.
- Baby, we are guilty!
I'm guilty.
I bribed the Mayor to get the drive-in land, forged your signature, paid off the Serpents.
If that comes out, just...
Pack a bag, okay?
Just in case.
Come on.
From what he said in the hall, it seems like he wants to get to his mom in Ohio.
- Anything?
- No.
Maybe his phone died.
Or maybe, the only friends he has just completely betrayed him.
- Is that him?
- No, it's Veronica.
Hey.
You okay?
Not really.
My mom's spiraling, and I'm on the verge.
I just wanted to talk.
Where are you?
I'm with Betty.
We're looking for Jughead.
Wait.
You and Betty went on a manhunt without me?
I'll come meet you.
We're at the bus station, but it's shut down for the night.
What's the one place in town that's open 24 hours?
Hint, we were just there.
- Told you.
- Jug.
Jug, we're so sorry...
About everything.
Juggy, we screwed up.
We all did.
Breaking into your dad's trailer was wrong, but at least some good came out of it.
Pretty sure my dad was just arrested for murder.
That gun wasn't there when we searched his trailer.
Someone put it there after we left.
What are you talking about?
The gun we found in your trailer matched the bullet that killed Jason Blossom.
So, did you know him well, or did you just do it for kicks?
Last summer, a redhead kid comes up to me at the bar, the Whyte Wyrm.
Said he was planning to run away with his pregnant girlfriend.
- Polly Cooper.
- So I would learn.
He asked me to set him up with a getaway car and some cash.
We made a deal.
In exchange for some wheels, and a tidy sum, he would make a delivery for me.
- Drugs?
- Mmm.
Igothimastationwagon , stashed some weed in the back.
Then...
I put two and two together.
Realized he was Cliff Blossom's son.
I thought...
Kid like that has everything.
Why in the hell does he need a guy like me?
Then he told me his plan.
On July 4th, his sister was going to row him across Sweetwater River, tip the boat, and say he drowned.
Once he made it across the river,
I grabbed him before he reached his getaway car, which he'd stashed I don't know where.
And then, I took him to the Wyrm...
Held him in the basement.
I kept him tied up and worked out my plan.
Which was?
Get word to Cliff Blossom that his son was alive, and being held for ransom.
Set up a drop-off point for payment to get him back.
Before I sent word to Blossom, the kid got loose.
Tried to escape.
And that's when you shot him and stuffed him in the freezer.
Once things quieted down, and your guys were done dragging Sweetwater River for his body, that's when I dumped it.
The only place we'd already looked.
You break into my house and steal my files?
Yeah, I did.
I even followed my son and Betty Cooper to Jason's getaway car, and torched it.
You must've thought you're real smart.
Now, I wanna hear you say it.
Did you kill Jason Blossom?
Excuse me, sir.
We need to see Sheriff Keller.
There's been a huge mistake.
Sheriff, we need to talk to you about FP Jones.
- What about him?
- He's innocent.
He's being framed.
Then why did he just confess?
Polly, the most incredible thing has happened.
He killed Jason, not...
I went to the station.
I looked our son's killer in the eye.
Finally, we'll have peace.
Jason will have peace.
And we...
We can all start over.
All of us.
The police report said FP worked alone.
No mention of your dad, Ronnie.
That's good news, right?
I can't stop thinking that...
Maybe my dad hired another Serpent to plant that gun.
It's surreal, isn't it?
How's Jughead doing?
Not good.
He's not coming in today.
He's at the station.
- Being grilled by your dad.
- Who's just doing his job.
I mean, of course he's gonna ask Jughead questions.
Okay, well, he's wasting his time, Kev.
Because FP didn't kill Jason.
- Betty, he confessed.
- Or he was coerced.
Or he's protecting someone, maybe a Serpent.
My mom saw him and Joaquin together...
Don't!
Do not drag my boyfriend into this.
What're you...
- Oh, no.
- What?
What happened to him not coming in today?
I'm sorry, Cheryl.
Enough!
Mr. Jones, you need to come with me.
Right now.
He was apologizing.
He didn't do anything wrong!
- Cheryl?
- I barely touched him.
It's not his fault, Cheryl.
Even if his dad did do it, it's...
Everybody keeps coming up to me, and hugging me, and telling me that I must be so relieved that my brother's killer has finally been caught.
That this nightmare is over.
Then why doesn't it feel that way?
What happened in there?
My second interrogation of the day.
Don't know who's more of a dick,
Keller or Weatherbee.
Don't listen to them.
Everyone else is wrong.
Your dad's innocent, and we just need to prove it, Jug.
Who killed him, then, Betty?
Tell me.
If it wasn't my dad, who killed Jason Blossom?
He said he did it, and you know what?
I've been waiting my whole life for that man to do the right thing, and I'm done.
- You should be, too.
- Jug.
Yes, I...
I appreciate it.
That was Weatherbee.
He's concerned for Jug's personal safety.
After what happened with Cheryl, he's worried about the other students' reaction to it.
Thinks Jughead should finish the semester from home.
Jughead's getting kicked out because Cheryl pummeled him.
How is that fair?
- It's not.
-Well, can we call, I don't know, the school board?
Son, FP may spend decades in prison, potentially the rest of his life.
We gotta think of a long-term solution.
We are the long-term solution.
That's not how it works, okay?
I'm not his legal guardian.
Oh, good thing mom's a lawyer.
Archie, my priority is keeping you safe.
Keep me safe from who?
Jughead?
Are you kidding me, Dad?
No, from whatever trouble seems to follow the Jones' around, wherever they go, whatever they do.
Hell, maybe you should go to Chicago and live with your mom.
It's not even something I was considering, Dad.
But you know what?
Maybe I should.
Hey, if it'll keep you out of trouble, I'm all for it.
Hey, Jug.
I'm gonna sleep in the garage tonight.
Okay?
Jug...
Did you hear that?
Mom, what are you doing with that?
Get behind me.
Be ready to dial 911.
Don't move.
Hands where I can see them.
Don't shoot, Alice.
- Dad!
- Hal!
These are Sheriff Keller's files about the Blossom murder investigation.
How did you get these, Dad?
Ibrokeintohis house the night of the last drive-in, and I took them.
Well, that's impossible.
FP Jones already confessed to that.
Well, I have no idea why he would do that, because it was me.
That's why I'm here.
To destroy any evidence that could lead back to me.
Wait, that doesn't make any sense.
Why would FP fess up to something he didn't even do?
Yeah, I'm not thinking about FP right now.
I'd like to know why your father is stealing and destroying evidence in a murder investigation.
Look, I was worried that the investigation would get back to Polly, somehow.
To us.
And somehow Sheriff Keller would figure out the connection between our family and the Blossoms.
And he would think that there was some kind of motive.
Wait, you mean about Great-Grandpappy Cooper being murdered by a Blossom?
Betty...
Your great-grandfather wasn't just murdered by a Blossom.
He was a Blossom.
After the murder, our family severed ties with the Blossoms and their name, and we took a new one.
"Cooper."
I'm...
A Blossom?
Polly is a Blossom, which makes her and Jason relatives by blood.
- Which is why you wanted to...
- Yeah.
Alice, that's why.
Oh, my God, Hal.
If you're willing to send our daughter away to keep her away from Jason...
How far would the Blossoms go to keep them apart?
We need to get Polly out of that house.
Don't bother calling the cops.
We're not staying.
Polly!
What the hell is going on here, Alice?
It's the middle of the night.
Oh, sorry to disrupt the witching hour at Thornhill.
Polly, honey, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Betty, what's going on?
We're here to bring you home, Pol.
She's not leaving us.
She chose to live here, remember?
With a mentally stable family.
Oh, I know all about your family, Penelope.
- And the incest.
- What?
What incest?
Hal's grandfather wasn't just your grandpappy's murder victim.
They were brothers, which made him a Blossom.
Just like Hal.
- Yeah, so what?
- "So what?"
So, everything, starting with FP's confession, has a few gaping holes in it.
He's being used by someone with a crazy motive, for example, hiding incest.
You were disgusted that Jason and Polly were dating because they were related.
Nothing could be more purely Blossom than those babies.
Okay, what is wrong with you people?
Will you just spare us the middle-class morality.
It's not like they were brother and sister.
They were, what, third cousins.
You think I killed my son?
That's it.
Polly, we are out of here.
Enough of this Doctor Moreau experimentation in breeding and eugenics.
It's over!
Betty, let's go.
You've made a grave error, little girl.
No, I don't think so.
And I'm not gonna stop until I prove it.
Juggy.
Jug.
Wake up, we gotta go to Pop's.
Archie asked me to look into your father's case.
I went down to the station, and passed myself off as his attorney to try to get as much information as I could.
How's it looking, Mom?
Well, unfortunately, between FP's list of priors, the anonymous tip, and the possession of the murder weapon...
Don't forget that pesky confession.
Things look pretty bad.
I was with him all night, and he never once budged from his story.
Well, if nothing else, at least he's an honest murderer.
- Jug...
- Right?
Oh, also, who is Joaquin DeSantos?
Joaquin?
As in Kevin's boyfriend?
He was FP's one phone call.
Jughead, my advice to you is, go and see your father.
Tell him everything you wanna say.
Once he's arraigned, things tend to move pretty quickly, and there won't be anything left to do.
So, this might be your last chance.
When Archie told me about his little plan to help you, get you on your feet, and working with Fred, deep down, I knew it was a mistake.
Should have listened to your gut.
You really had me.
Cleaning the trailer.
Convincing me that you had quit drinking.
I was so happy, for the first time in so long.
You paid attention to me.
Let's be honest.
The only reason you even read my manuscript about Jason's murder, was to make sure I wasn't onto you.
And you didn't want to take me to Toledo to get the family back together.
You wanted to get away.
You wanted to run away.
I did what I had to do!
What I always do!
Are you even sorry?
Sorry I got caught.
We done?
Look at me, Jughead!
Never come back here!
Understand?
Got it.
He called Joaquin?
Why not Jughead?
Or your dad?
Or a lawyer?
- It's weird.
- What does Betty think?
She thinks it's weird.
Joaquin might know if FP was hired to kill Jason, if it was my father...
I need to see this through to the end.
We know FP used his call from jail to get in touch with you.
What did he say?
It was basically just a warning.
Said to lay low.
No one uses their one call to say "lay low."
Joaquin, do you know something?
I'm not talking to you as your boyfriend,
I'm talking to you as the sheriff's son.
Did FP kill Jason?
Yeah.
- I mean, I...
I assume.
- Oh, my God.
Did you see him pull the trigger?
No, no.
God, no...
Then why do you think he did it?
On July 11th, I got a phone call in the middle of the night from FP.
Said he needed help with some clean-up job at the Whyte Wyrm.
What job?
The basement of the Whyte Wyrm is off limits to everyone, but that's where I met FP, and that's where I saw...
He'd been shot.
I never asked FP if he did it.
I just...
I mean, I was terrified.
I...
I just assumed.
We stashed the body in the freezer, cleaned up the mess, got rid of any evidence...
You are a criminal.
Joaquin, FP has done jobs for my dad, Hiram Lodge, in the past.
Do you think killing Jason was one of them?
There was one time I overheard a conversation between FP and Mustang...
- Who's Mustang?
- He's another Serpent.
The only other guy who knew about the clean-up.
The guy you got into a fight with at the Wyrm.
I heard him tell FP something about some rich guy.
I don't know who.
- Where is Mustang?
- No, no, no, no.
You do not want to go see him.
Yes, I do.
And you're going to take us.
Or...
Or I'm going to tell my dad about your little clean-up job.
I'm so glad that you're home, Pol.
And that you're safe.
And that the babies are okay and healthy.
But God, everything else...
Is the worst.
Betty, I saw my dad.
You were right.
He's hiding something.
Not that much money in local crime and villainy, huh?
This is him, here.
Mustang?
You here?
Oh, my God.
- I can't...
I can't be here.
- Let's go.
Call my dad.
- Son...
- I'm okay.
We both are.
What were you doing here in the first place?
We knew Mustang was a Serpent.
We just wanted to talk to him, to see if he knew anything about FP.
Veronica, this has to stop.
- Why are you doing this?
- Mom.
What do you think happened in there?
Likely an overdose.
We're waiting to see a time of death, but it wouldn't surprise me at all if he was somehow involved in Jason's murder, and was feeling the heat.
And how'd you know he even lived here?
Sheriff...
Found it under his bed.
Hermione Lodge?
Mind explaining to me why your initials are on this bag?
Not Hermione Lodge, Sheriff.
- Hiram Lodge.
My dad.
- Veronica!
Mom...
He was doing business with the Serpents.
And that's all we're saying until there's an attorney present.
This is exactly what I didn't want to happen.
If you stay on this path, you will end up dead.
Just like Jason Blossom.
You gotta believe me.
Okay?
When I tell you I'm trying to protect you.
That is my job.
It's the only one that counts.
- Do you got that?
- Yes.
Mom!
Mom...
Mom!
It's okay.
It's okay.
You gotta tell your friends to stop before they get hurt.
You really don't know them at all, do you?
Just like I don't know you.
- Joaquin?
- Yeah?
I'm gonna miss you, Preppy...
Look, I didn't want to say this in front of your friends, but there's something else.
My dad's been lying to me his whole life, but he's never been any good at it.
I saw it in his eyes.
- He didn't do it.
- So, why lie?
Who is he protecting?
Mommy, that last morning, before Jay-Jay and I went to the river...
Why were he and Daddy arguing?
We've been over this.
Your father dedicated himself to grooming Jason to take over the family business,
- but in the end...
- He couldn't stomach it.
When, really, I should have been nurturing you.
Because Jason never had the stomach for any of it.
But you...
You're a Blossom.
I remember.
He told me.
But why?
What couldn't he handle?
So many questions, Cheryl...
Okay, who can we rule out?
My dad.
We know why he was acting so shady.
- Hermione.
- Yeah.
Veronica says she's guilty of plenty, but not murder.
Plus, she has an alibi.
She was in New York.
So, that just leaves Hiram Lodge...
And Clifford and Penelope Blossom...
I think something happened, Mommy.
Whatever do you mean?
If Daddy wasn't mad at Jason about Polly, it must have been about the business.
I don't know if he heard something he shouldn't have, or he saw something he didn't like...
You don't know what you're saying...
What was Jay-Jay running away from?
The business?
Daddy?
You?
Ow!
You think your father killed your brother?
You think I did?
You think we murdered him and threw him in the river, because Jason knew some deep, dark, horrible secret about our business?
You want answers, Cheryl?
Are you ready?
There it is!
There's the sticky, dark, dirty truth.
Maple syrup!
Drown in it, why don't you?
Well, what do we have here?
You two just can't leave well enough alone, can you?
Mom, we know what you're going to say.
The police found another dead body.
Okay, maybe not that.
A Southside Serpent and Sheriff Clueless is convinced that he was working with your father.
He allegedly committed suicide by overdose, and there was a bag of money on-site that links him to Hiram Lodge.
Everything is tied up into a nice little bow.
Too tidy, if you ask me.
Kevin?
Oh, okay.
We'll meet you there.
Whatever it is we're looking for,
Joaquin didn't know if it would help your dad, or make things worse.
Um, guess we're going to find out.
And why did he wait so long to tell us?
FP called him from jail.
Told him to forget about their plan, some contingency plan.
He said it was too dangerous.
Deja vu.
Hey, right here.
This is meant to help FP?
I don't know.
Looks like more incriminating evidence to me.
Yeah, this just confirms that my dad torched Jason's getaway car.
And that his confession was true.
Why would FP say Jason's varsity jacket is dangerous?
What could that mean?
I can ask my father.
He would know, considering we found concrete proof that he hired the Serpents to kill Jason.
Which probably means that your dad pulled the trigger, Jughead.
I'm sorry.
No.
No!
No, I'm not giving up yet.
Put this on.
- What?
- Put it on.
Betty, this is weird.
There's a hole in the pocket.
Okay, now we're just grasping at straws...
Okay, no.
I don't know about you guys, but whenever I have a hole in my jacket pocket,
I always lose my chapstick in the lining.
Or my Montblanc?
Hold on.
What the hell?
Nancy Drew strikes again.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Betty...
Betty, who are you calling?
You have to get out of that house.
Listen to me...
I understand.
Thank you.
Cheryl, what is it?
You did a bad thing, Daddy.
And now everyone knows.
Sheriff.
Your office told me that I would find you here.
You need to see this.
Both of you.
Thatnight,
Sheriff Keller and Mayor McCoy saw what we watched in Archie's garage.
Jason, tied to a chair, in the basement of a bar, on the Southside of Riverdale, while a Serpent, Mustang, taunted him.
Then, the unthinkable.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Later, we would learn why my father confessed.
Because Clifford Blossom visited him on the night of his arrest, with a threat, that I, Jughead Jones, would suffer the same fate as Jason Blossom, if my father didn't confess.
My dad was protecting me from a monster, and the nightmare was far from over.
...charged with tampering with evidence, obstruction of justice, mishandling a body, perjury, and that's just off the top of my head.
He's not getting out any time soon.
I'm sorry, Mom, that I ever thought that Dad...
Shh, mija.
Everyone makes mistakes.
I have good news.
Very good news.
Your father's coming home.
And our families, far from repaired...
I'm sorry, Mom, but my friends need me.
You should come for the summer, maybe?
That'd be great.
- You be careful.
- I will.
You better.
I love you, Archie.
I love you too, Mom.
Andthoughonequestion had been answered that night, that it was Clifford Blossom who killed Jason, a new mystery loomed over Riverdale.
Why had he done it?
It was a question only Clifford himself would be able to answer.
Previously on Riverdale...
The story is about a town, once wholesome and innocent, now forever changed by the mysterious murder of Jason Blossom...
This is our insurance.
In case everything goes to hell.
Stash it.
Keep it safe.
I talked it over with Mrs. Cooper.
And...
She's a part of this?
She's gonna keep FP busy while we search his trailer to find anything that links FP to Jason.
Or, more importantly, FP to my dad.
We went to your dad's trailer...
- Why would you guys do that?
- We were wrong.
We didn't find anything.
- You went behind my back, Archie?
- Jug...
My dad just told Mayor McCoy about your dad.
What about my dad?
He was just arrested.
For the murder of Jason Blossom.
_
Someone planted the gun...
Jason's murder weapon, in a closet in FP's trailer.
It wasn't there when we searched for it.
He's being framed, Betty.
Well, maybe you didn't see it.
We're not talking about the Vogue closet here, Bee...
Well, maybe you looked in the wrong one.
It's a trailer with literally one closet.
There was no lockbox.
No gun.
Whatever Sheriff Keller is saying he found, it wasn't there.
Look, we need to tell Jughead his dad's innocent.
Where is Jughead?
I don't know.
I tried calling him.
I left him messages.
He's not answering his phone.
In the meantime...
- What?
Should we talk to Sheriff Keller?
- No.
Not until we tell our parents.
That we broke into FP's trailer?
My dad will know what to do.
You did what?
We had to make sure FP wasn't involved in Jason's murder.
And now we know the truth.
He was.
What?
Mom, no.
We just told you.
- The gun was planted.
- By whoever killed Jason.
Couldn't you have just missed it?
Yeah, excuse me if I trust the detection skills of an officer of the law over three amateur sleuths.
Mom, you're the one who asked Veronica to break in!
- Excuse me?
- What!
- Alice?
- Actually...
I approached Mrs. Cooper.
I had to know if FP was involved, and if he was connected to my dad.
A gun was found.
FP is the killer.
Case closed.
We're leaving.
There was no gun!
Son, this isn't petty theft or a bar fight we're talking about, Archie.
This is murder.
Okay, fine.
Then we'll go to the sheriff without you.
Archie, you entered FP's residence illegally.
So whatever you did or did not find there would be inadmissible in a court of law.
I don't care what happens to me.
I do care.
FP may have ruined Jughead's life,
I'm not gonna let him ruin yours.
MESSAGE TO ARCHIE ANDREWS
ARCH...
ARCH, I'M WORRIED ABOUT JUGHEAD.
ME TOO.
LET'S GO FIND HIM.
Hi, Mom.
Hey, guess what?
I got a bus ticket to Toledo.
Yeah.
I thought I'd come see you and Jellybean for a while.
I could crash on the couch.
Yeah.
No.
I...
No, I understand.
Look, I...
Forget I said anything, okay?
All right.
Bye.
I changed my mind about Toledo.
Can you just put me on whatever the next bus out of town is?
I don't even care where it's going.
Citrusville, Florida.
Leaves tomorrow morning at 6:00.
Great.
Lobby closes in fifteen minutes, reopens at 5:30.
Mom?
What are you looking for?
- Our passports.
- Why?
Because Lord knows what FP is going to say, now that he's behind bars.
So, you do think Daddy hired him to kill Jason?
Honey, I don't know.
But, regardless of that, we are known associates of the man who killed Jason Blossom.
Now... your father may have had something to do with that.
Maybe not.
But either way, we need to be ready.
Ready to do what?
Run away?
Like we ran away from New York?
- We're gonna look guilty.
- Baby, we are guilty!
I'm guilty.
I bribed the Mayor to get the drive-in land, forged your signature, paid off the Serpents.
If that comes out, just...
Pack a bag, okay?
Just in case.
Come on.
From what he said in the hall, it seems like he wants to get to his mom in Ohio.
- Anything?
- No.
Maybe his phone died.
Or maybe, the only friends he has just completely betrayed him.
- Is that him?
- No, it's Veronica.
Hey.
You okay?
Not really.
My mom's spiraling, and I'm on the verge.
I just wanted to talk.
Where are you?
I'm with Betty.
We're looking for Jughead.
Wait.
You and Betty went on a manhunt without me?
I'll come meet you.
We're at the bus station, but it's shut down for the night.
What's the one place in town that's open 24 hours?
Hint, we were just there.
- Told you.
- Jug.
Jug, we're so sorry...
About everything.
Juggy, we screwed up.
We all did.
Breaking into your dad's trailer was wrong, but at least some good came out of it.
Pretty sure my dad was just arrested for murder.
That gun wasn't there when we searched his trailer.
Someone put it there after we left.
What are you talking about?
The gun we found in your trailer matched the bullet that killed Jason Blossom.
So, did you know him well, or did you just do it for kicks?
Last summer, a redhead kid comes up to me at the bar, the Whyte Wyrm.
_
Said he was planning to run away with his pregnant girlfriend.
- Polly Cooper.
- So I would learn.
He asked me to set him up with a getaway car and some cash.
We made a deal.
In exchange for some wheels, and a tidy sum, he would make a delivery for me.
Drugs?
I got him a station wagon, stashed some weed in the back.
Then...
I put two and two together.
Realized he was Cliff Blossom's son.
I thought...
Kid like that has everything.
Why in the hell does he need a guy like me?
Then he told me his plan.
On July 4th, his sister was going to row him across Sweetwater River, tip the boat, and say he drowned.
Once he made it across the river,
I grabbed him... before he reaches his getaway car which he'd stashed I don't know where.
And then, I took him to the Wyrm...
Held him in the basement.
I kept him tied up and worked out my plan.
Which was?
Get word to Cliff Blossom that his son was alive, and being held for ransom.
Set up a drop-off point for payment to get him back.
Before I sent word to Blossom, the kid got loose.
Tried to escape.
And that's when you shot him and stuffed him in the freezer.
Once things quieted down, and your guys were done dragging Sweetwater River for his body,
that's when I dumped it.
The only place we'd already looked.
You break into my house and steal my files?
Yeah, I did.
I even followed my son and Betty Cooper to Jason's getaway car, and torched it.
You must've thought you're real smart.
Now, I wanna hear you say it.
Did you kill Jason Blossom?
Excuse me, sir.
We need to see Sheriff Keller.
There's been a huge mistake.
Sheriff, we need to talk to you about FP Jones.
- What about him?
- He's innocent.
He's being framed.
Then why did he just confess?
JUSTICE FOR JASON
Polly, the most incredible thing has happened.
LOCAL GANG MEMBER CONFESSES TO THE MURDER OF JASON BLOSSOM FOLLOWING ARREST
He killed Jason, not...
I went to the station.
I looked our son's killer in the eye.
Finally, we'll have peace.
Jason will have peace.
And we...
We can all start over.
All of us.
The police report said FP worked alone.
No mention of your dad, Ronnie.
That's good news, right?
I can't stop thinking that...
Maybe my dad hired another Serpent to plant that gun.
It's surreal, isn't it?
How's Jughead doing?
Not good.
He's not coming in today.
He's at the station.
- Being grilled by your dad.
- Who's just doing his job.
I mean, of course he's gonna ask Jughead questions.
Okay, well, he's wasting his time, Kev.
Because FP didn't kill Jason.
- Betty, he confessed.
- Or he was coerced.
Or he's protecting someone, maybe a Serpent.
My mom saw him and Joaquin together...
Don't!
Do not drag my boyfriend into this.
...What're you...
- Oh, no.
- What?
What happened to him not coming in today?
I'm sorry, Cheryl.
Enough!
Mr. Jones, you need to come with me.
Right now.
He was apologizing.
- He didn't do anything wrong!
- Right now.
- Cheryl?
- I barely touched him.
It's not his fault, Cheryl.
Even if his dad did do it, it's...
Everybody keeps coming up to me, and hugging me, and telling me that I must be so relieved that my brother's killer has finally been caught.
That this nightmare is over.
Then why doesn't it feel that way?
What happened in there?
My second interrogation of the day.
Don't know who's more of a dick,
Keller or Weatherbee.
Don't listen to them.
Everyone else is wrong.
Your dad's innocent, and we just need to prove it, Jug.
Who killed him, then, Betty?
Tell me.
If it wasn't my dad, who killed Jason Blossom?
He said he did it, and you know what?
I've been waiting my whole life for that man to do the right thing, and I'm done.
- You should be, too.
- Jug.
Yes, I...
I appreciate it.
That was Weatherbee.
He's concerned for Jug's personal safety.
After what happened with Cheryl, he's worried about the other students' reaction to it.
Thinks Jughead should finish the semester from home.
Jughead's getting kicked out because Cheryl pummeled him.
How is that fair?
It's not.
Well, can we call, I don't know, the school board?
Son, FP may spend decades in prison, potentially the rest of his life.
We gotta think of a long-term solution.
We are the long-term solution.
That's not how it works, okay?
I'm not his legal guardian.
Oh, good thing mom's a lawyer.
Archie, my priority is keeping you safe.
Keep me safe from who?
Jughead?
Are you kidding me, Dad?
No, from whatever trouble seems to follow the Jones' around, wherever they go, whatever they do.
Hell, maybe you should go to Chicago and live with your mom.
It's not even something I was considering, Dad.
But you know what?
Maybe I should.
Hey, if it'll keep you out of trouble, I'm all for it.
Hey, Jug.
I'm gonna sleep in the garage tonight.
Okay?
Jug...
Did you hear that?
Mom, what are you doing with that?
Get behind me.
Be ready to dial 911.
Don't move.
Hands where I can see them.
Don't shoot, Alice.
- Dad!
- Hal!
These are Sheriff Keller's files about the Blossom murder investigation.
How did you get these, Dad?
I broke into his house the night of the last drive-in, and I took them.
Well, that's impossible.
FP Jones already confessed to that.
Well, I have no idea why he would do that, because it was me.
That's why I'm here.
To destroy any evidence that could lead back to me.
Wait, that doesn't make any sense.
Why would FP fess up to something he didn't even do?
Yeah, I'm not thinking about FP right now.
I'd like to know why your father is stealing and destroying evidence in a murder investigation.
Look, I was worried that the investigation would get back to Polly, somehow.
To us.
And somehow Sheriff Keller would figure out the connection between our family and the Blossoms.
And he would think that there was some kind of motive.
Wait, you mean about Great-Grandpappy Cooper being murdered by a Blossom?
Betty...
Your great-grandfather wasn't just murdered by a Blossom.
He was a Blossom.
After the murder, our family severed ties with the Blossoms and their name, and we took a new one. "Cooper."
I'm...
A Blossom?
Polly is a Blossom, which makes her and Jason relatives by blood.
- Which is why you wanted to...
- Yeah.
Alice, that's why.
Oh, my God, Hal.
If you're willing to send our daughter away to keep her away from Jason...
How far would the Blossoms go to keep them apart?
We need to get Polly out of that house.
Don't bother calling the cops.
We're not staying.
Polly!
What the hell is going on here, Alice?
It's the middle of the night.
Oh, sorry to disrupt the witching hour at Thornhill.
Polly, honey, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Betty, what's going on?
We're here to bring you home, Pol.
She's not leaving us.
She chose to live here, remember?
With a mentally stable family.
Oh, I know all about your family, Penelope.
- And the incest.
- What?
What incest?
Hal's grandfather wasn't just your grandpappy's murder victim.
They were brothers, which made him a Blossom.
Just like Hal.
- Yeah, so what?
- "So what?"
So, everything, starting with FP's confession, has a few gaping holes in it.
He's being used by someone with a crazy motive, for example, hiding incest.
You were disgusted that Jason and Polly were dating because they were related.
Nothing could be more purely Blossom than those babies.
Okay, what is wrong with you people?
Will you just spare us the middle-class morality.
It's not like they were brother and sister.
They were, what, third cousins.
You think I killed my son?
That's it.
Polly, we are out of here.
Enough of this Doctor Moreau experimentation in breeding and eugenics.
It's over!
Betty, let's go.
You've made a grave error, little girl.
No, I don't think so.
And I'm not gonna stop until I prove it.
Juggy.
Jug.
Wake up, we gotta go to Pop's.
Archie asked me to look into your father's case.
I went down to the station, and passed myself off as his attorney to try to get as much information as I could.
How's it looking, Mom?
Well, unfortunately, between FP's list of priors, the anonymous tip, and the possession of the murder weapon...
Don't forget that pesky confession.
Things look pretty bad.
I was with him all night, and he never once budged from his story.
Well, if nothing else, at least he's an honest murderer.
- Jug...
- Right?
Oh, also, who is Joaquin DeSantos?
Joaquin?
As in Kevin's boyfriend?
He was FP's one phone call.
Jughead, my advice to you is, go and see your father.
Tell him everything you wanna say.
Once he's arraigned, things tend to move pretty quickly, and there won't be anything left to do.
So, this might be your last chance.
When Archie told me about his little plan to help you, get you on your feet, and working with Fred,
deep down, I knew it was a mistake.
Should have listened to your gut.
You really had me.
Cleaning the trailer.
Convincing me that you had quit drinking.
I was so happy, for the first time in so long.
You paid attention to me.
Let's be honest.
The only reason you even read my manuscript about Jason's murder, was to make sure I wasn't onto you.
And you didn't want to take me to Toledo to get the family back together.
You wanted to get away.
You wanted to run away.
I did what I had to do!
What I always do!
Are you even sorry?
Sorry I got caught.
We done?
Look at me, Jughead!
Never come back here!
Understand?
Got it.
He called Joaquin?
Why not Jughead?
Or your dad?
Or a lawyer?
- It's weird.
- What does Betty think?
She thinks it's weird.
Joaquin might know if FP was hired to kill Jason, if it was my father...
I need to see this through to the end.
We know FP used his call from jail to get in touch with you.
What did he say?
It was basically just a warning.
Said to lay low.
No one uses their one call to say "lay low."
Joaquin, do you know something?
I'm not talking to you as your boyfriend,
I'm talking to you as the sheriff's son.
Did FP kill Jason?
Yeah.
- I mean, I...
I assume.
- Oh, my God.
Did you see him pull the trigger?
No, no.
God, no...
Then why do you think he did it?
On July 11th, I got a phone call in the middle of the night from FP.
Said he needed help with some clean-up job at the Whyte Wyrm.
What job?
The basement of the Whyte Wyrm is off limits to everyone, but that's where I met FP, and that's where I saw...
He'd been shot.
I never asked FP if he did it.
I just...
I mean, I was terrified.
I...
I just assumed.
We stashed the body in the freezer, cleaned up the mess, got rid of any evidence...
You are a criminal.
Joaquin, FP has done jobs for my dad, Hiram Lodge, in the past.
Do you think killing Jason was one of them?
There was one time I overheard a conversation between FP and Mustang...
- Who's Mustang?
- He's another Serpent.
The only other guy who knew about the clean-up.
The guy you got into a fight with at the Wyrm.
I heard him tell FP something about some rich guy.
I don't know who.
- Where is Mustang?
- No, no, no, no.
You do not want to go see him.
Yes, I do.
And you're going to take us.
Or...
Or I'm going to tell my dad about your little clean-up job.
I'm so glad that you're home, Pol.
And that you're safe.
And that the babies are okay and healthy.
But God, everything else...
Is the worst.
Betty, I saw my dad.
You were right.
He's hiding something.
Not that much money in local crime and villainy, huh?
This is him, here.
Mustang?
You here?
Oh, my God.
- I can't...
I can't be here.
- Let's go.
Call my dad.
SHERIFF LINE
- Son...
- I'm okay.
We both are.
What were you doing here in the first place?
We knew Mustang was a Serpent.
We just wanted to talk to him, to see if he knew anything about FP.
Veronica, this has to stop.
- Why are you doing this?
- Mom.
What do you think happened in there?
Likely an overdose.
We're waiting to see a time of death, but it wouldn't surprise me at all if he was somehow involved in Jason's murder, and was feeling the heat.
And how'd you know he even lived here?
Sheriff...
Found it under his bed.
Hermione Lodge?
Mind explaining to me why your initials are on this bag?
Not Hermione Lodge, Sheriff.
- Hiram Lodge.
My dad.
- Veronica!
Mom...
He was doing business with the Serpents.
And that's all we're saying until there's an attorney present.
This is exactly what I didn't want to happen.
If you stay on this path, you will end up dead.
Just like Jason Blossom.
You gotta believe me.
Okay?
When I tell you I'm trying to protect you.
That is my job.
It's the only one that counts.
- Do you got that?
- Yes.
Mom!
Mom...
Mom!
It's okay.
It's okay.
You gotta tell your friends to stop before they get hurt.
You really don't know them at all, do you?
Just like I don't know you.
- Joaquin?
- Yeah?
I'm gonna miss you, Preppy...
Look, I didn't want to say this in front of your friends, but there's something else.
My dad's been lying to me his whole life, but he's never been any good at it.
I saw it in his eyes.
- He didn't do it.
- So, why lie?
Who is he protecting?
Mommy, that last morning, before Jay-Jay and I went to the river...
Why were he and Daddy arguing?
We've been over this.
Your father dedicated himself to grooming Jason to take over the family business,
- but in the end...
- He couldn't stomach it.
When, really, I should have been nurturing you.
Because Jason never had the stomach for any of it.
But you...
You're a Blossom.
I remember.
He told me.
But why?
What couldn't he handle?
So many questions, Cheryl...
Okay, who can we rule out?
My dad.
We know why he was acting so shady.
- Hermione.
- Yeah.
Veronica says she's guilty of plenty, but not murder.
Plus, she has an alibi.
She was in New York.
So, that just leaves Hiram Lodge...
And Clifford and Penelope Blossom...
I think something happened, Mommy.
Whatever do you mean?
If Daddy wasn't mad at Jason about Polly, it must have been about the business.
I don't know if he heard something he shouldn't have, or he saw something he didn't like...
You don't know what you're saying...
What was Jay-Jay running away from?
The business?
Daddy?
You?
You think your father killed your brother?
You think I did?
You think we murdered him and threw him in the river, because Jason knew some deep, dark, horrible secret about our business?
You want answers, Cheryl?
Are you ready?
There it is!
There's the sticky, dark, dirty truth.
Maple syrup!
Drown in it, why don't you?
Well, what do we have here?
You two just can't leave well enough alone, can you?
Mom, we know what you're going to say.
The police found another dead body.
Okay, maybe not that.
A Southside Serpent and Sheriff Clueless is convinced that he was working with your father.
He allegedly committed suicide by overdose, and there was a bag of money on-site that links him to Hiram Lodge.
Everything is tied up into a nice little bow.
Too tidy, if you ask me.
Kevin?
Oh, okay.
We'll meet you there.
Whatever it is we're looking for,
Joaquin didn't know if it would help your dad, or make things worse.
Guess we're going to find out.
And why did he wait so long to tell us?
FP called him from jail.
Told him to forget about their plan, some contingency plan.
He said it was too dangerous.
Deja vu.
_
Hey, right here.
This is meant to help FP?
I don't know.
Looks like more incriminating evidence to me.
Yeah, this just confirms that my dad torched Jason's getaway car.
And that his confession was true.
Why would FP say Jason's varsity jacket is dangerous?
What could that mean?
I can ask my father.
He would know, considering we found concrete proof that he hired the Serpents to kill Jason.
Which probably means that your dad pulled the trigger, Jughead.
I'm sorry.
No.
No!
No, I'm not giving up yet.
Put this on.
- What?
- Put it on.
Betty, this is weird.
There's a hole in the pocket.
Okay, now we're just grasping at straws...
Okay, no.
I don't know about you guys, but whenever I have a hole in my jacket pocket,
I always lose my chapstick in the lining.
Or my Montblanc?
Hold on.
What the hell?
Nancy Drew strikes again.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Betty...
Betty, who are you calling?
You have to get out of that house.
Listen to me...
I understand.
Thank you.
Cheryl, what is it?
You did a bad thing, Daddy.
And now everyone knows.
_
Sheriff.
Your office told me that I would find you here.
You need to see this.
Both of you.
That night,
Sheriff Keller and Mayor McCoy saw what we watched in Archie's garage.
Jason, tied to a chair, in the basement of a bar, on the Southside of Riverdale, while a Serpent, Mustang, taunted him.
Then, the unthinkable.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Later, we would learn why my father confessed.
Because Clifford Blossom visited him on the night of his arrest, with a threat, that I, Jughead Jones, would suffer the same fate as Jason Blossom, if my father didn't confess.
My dad was protecting me from a monster, and the nightmare was far from over.
He's gonna be charged with tampering with evidence, obstruction of justice, mishandling a body, perjury, and that's just off the top of my head.
He's not getting out any time soon.
I'm sorry, Mom, that I ever thought that Dad...
Mija.
Everyone makes mistakes.
I have good news.
Very good news.
Your father's coming home.
And our families, far from repaired...
I'm sorry, Mom, but my friends need me.
You should come for the summer, maybe?
That'd be great.
- You be careful.
- I will.
You better.
I love you, Archie.
I love you too, Mom.
And though one question had been answered that night, that it was Clifford Blossom who killed Jason, a new mystery loomed over Riverdale.
Why had he done it?
It was a question only Clifford himself would be able to answer.
Something wicked this way comes.
THE SEASON FINALE
NEW SECRETS
NEW MYSTERIES
ARCHIE:
Previously on Riverdale...
The story is about a town, once wholesome and innocent, now forever changed by the mysterious murder of Jason Blossom...
FP:
This is our insurance.
In case everything goes to hell.
Stash it.
Keep it safe.
I talked it over with Mrs. Cooper.
She's a part of this?
She's gonna keep FP busy while we search his trailer to find anything that links FP to Jason.
Or, more importantly, FP to my dad.
We went to your dad's trailer...
- Why would you guys do that?
- We were wrong.
We didn't find anything.
- You went behind my back, Archie?
- Jug...
My dad just told Mayor McCoy
- about your dad.
- What about my dad?
KEVIN:
He was just arrested.
For the murder of Jason Blossom.
Someone planted the gun...
Jason's murder weapon, in a closet in FP's trailer.
It wasn't there when we searched for it.
He's being framed, Betty.
Well, maybe you didn't see it.
We're not talking about the Vogue closet here, Bee...
Well, maybe you looked in the wrong one.
It's a trailer with literally one closet.
There was no lockbox.
No gun.
Whatever Sheriff Keller is saying he found, it wasn't there.
Look, we need to tell Jughead his dad's innocent.
Where is Jughead?
I don't know.
I tried calling him.
I left him messages.
He's not answering his phone.
In the meantime...
- Should we talk to Sheriff Keller?
- ARCHIE:
No.
Not until we tell our parents.
That we broke into FP's trailer?
My dad will know what to do.
You did what?
We had to make sure FP wasn't involved in Jason's murder.
And now we know the truth.
He was.
What?
Mom, no.
We just told you.
- The gun was planted.
- By whoever killed Jason.
Couldn't you have just missed it?
Yeah, excuse me if I trust the detection skills of an officer of the law over three amateur sleuths.
Mom, you're the one who asked Veronica to break in!
- Excuse me?
- What!
- Alice?
- VERONICA:
Actually...
I approached Mrs. Cooper.
I had to know if FP was involved, and if he was connected to my dad.
A gun was found.
FP is the killer.
Case closed.
We're leaving.
There was no gun!
Son, this isn't petty theft or a bar fight we're talking about, Archie.
This is murder.
Okay, fine.
Then we'll go to the sheriff without you.
Archie, you entered FP's residence illegally.
So whatever you did or did not find there would be inadmissible in a court of law.
I don't care what happens to me.
I do care.
FP may have ruined Jughead's life,
I'm not gonna let him ruin yours.
[CELL PHONE CHIMES]
[CELL PHONE CHIMES]
_
Hi, Mom.
Hey, guess what?
I got a bus ticket to Toledo.
Yeah.
I thought I'd come see you and Jellybean for a while.
I could crash on the couch.
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.
No.
I...
No, I understand.
Look, I...
Forget I said anything, okay?
All right.
Bye.
[SOBS]
I changed my mind about Toledo.
Can you just put me on whatever the next bus out of town is?
I don't even care where it's going.
Citrusville, Florida.
Leaves tomorrow morning at 6:00.
Great.
Lobby closes in fifteen minutes, reopens at 5:30.
VERONICA:
Mom?
What are you looking for?
- Our passports.
- Why?
Because Lord knows what FP is going to say, now that he's behind bars.
So, you do think Daddy hired him to kill Jason?
Honey, I don't know.
But, regardless of that, we are known associates of the man who killed Jason Blossom.
Your father may have had something to do with that.
Maybe not.
But either way, we need to be ready.
Ready to do what?
Run away?
Like we ran away from New York?
- We're gonna look guilty.
- Baby, we are guilty!
I'm guilty.
I bribed the Mayor to get the drive-in land, forged your signature, paid off the Serpents.
If that comes out, just...
Pack a bag, okay?
Just in case.
Come on.
From what he said in the hall, it seems like he wants to get to his mom in Ohio.
- Anything?
- No.
Maybe his phone died.
Or maybe, the only friends he has just completely betrayed him.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
- Is that him?
- No, it's Veronica.
Hey.
You okay?
Not really.
My mom's spiraling, and I'm on the verge.
I just wanted to talk.
Where are you?
I'm with Betty.
We're looking for Jughead.
Wait.
You and Betty went on a manhunt without me?
I'll come meet you.
ARCHIE:
We're at the bus station, but it's shut down for the night.
What's the one place in town that's open 24 hours?
Hint, we were just there.
[DOOR BELL CHIMES]
- VERONICA:
Told you.
- ARCHIE:
Jug.
Jug, we're so sorry...
About everything.
Juggy, we screwed up.
We all did.
Breaking into your dad's trailer was wrong, but at least some good came out of it.
Pretty sure my dad was just arrested for murder.
That gun wasn't there when we searched his trailer.
Someone put it there after we left.
What are you talking about?
The gun we found in your trailer matched the bullet that killed Jason Blossom.
So, did you know him well, or did you just do it for kicks?
Last summer, a redhead kid comes up to me at the bar, the Whyte Wyrm.
Said he was planning to run away with his pregnant girlfriend.
- Polly Cooper.
- So I would learn.
He asked me to set him up with a getaway car and some cash.
We made a deal.
In exchange for some wheels, and a tidy sum, he would make a delivery for me.
- SHERIFF KELLER:
Drugs?
- FP:
Mmm.
FP:
I got him a station wagon, stashed some weed in the back.
Then...
I put two and two together.
Realized he was Cliff Blossom's son.
I thought...
Kid like that has everything.
Why in the hell does he need a guy like me?
Then he told me his plan.
On July 4th, his sister was going to row him across Sweetwater River, tip the boat, and say he drowned.
Once he made it across the river,
I grabbed him before he reached his getaway car, which he'd stashed I don't know where.
And then, I took him to the Wyrm...
Held him in the basement.
I kept him tied up and worked out my plan.
Which was?
Get word to Cliff Blossom that his son was alive, and being held for ransom.
Set up a drop-off point for payment to get him back.
Before I sent word to Blossom, the kid got loose.
Tried to escape.
And that's when you shot him and stuffed him in the freezer.
Once things quieted down, and your guys were done dragging Sweetwater River for his body, that's when I dumped it.
The only place we'd already looked.
You break into my house and steal my files?
Yeah, I did.
I even followed my son and Betty Cooper to Jason's getaway car, and torched it.
SHERIFF KELLER:
You must've thought you're real smart.
Now, I wanna hear you say it.
Did you kill Jason Blossom?
[SNIFFS]
ARCHIE:
Excuse me, sir.
We need to see Sheriff Keller.
There's been a huge mistake.
Sheriff, we need to talk to you about FP Jones.
- What about him?
- He's innocent.
He's being framed.
Then why did he just confess?
Polly, the most incredible thing has happened.
POLLY:
He killed Jason, not...
I went to the station.
I looked our son's killer in the eye.
Finally, we'll have peace.
Jason will have peace.
And we...
We can all start over.
All of us.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
The police report said FP worked alone.
No mention of your dad, Ronnie.
That's good news, right?
VERONICA:
I can't stop thinking that...
Maybe my dad hired another Serpent to plant that gun.
It's surreal, isn't it?
How's Jughead doing?
Not good.
He's not coming in today.
He's at the station.
- Being grilled by your dad.
- Who's just doing his job.
I mean, of course he's gonna ask Jughead questions.
Okay, well, he's wasting his time, Kev.
Because FP didn't kill Jason.
- Betty, he confessed.
- Or he was coerced.
Or he's protecting someone, maybe a Serpent.
My mom saw him and Joaquin together...
Don't!
Do not drag my boyfriend into this.
- [HUFFS]
- What're you...
- Oh, no.
- What?
What happened to him not coming in today?
[SNIFFLES]
I'm sorry, Cheryl.
[SOBBING]
- WEATHERBEE:
Enough!
- [CRYING]
Mr. Jones, you need to come with me.
Right now.
He was apologizing.
He didn't do anything wrong!
[SOBBING]
- Cheryl?
- I barely touched him.
[CHERYL SNIFFLES]
It's not his fault, Cheryl.
Even if his dad did do it, it's...
CHERYL:
Everybody keeps coming up to me, and hugging me, and telling me that I must be so relieved that my brother's killer has finally been caught.
That this nightmare is over.
Then why doesn't it feel that way?
What happened in there?
My second interrogation of the day.
Don't know who's more of a dick,
Keller or Weatherbee.
Don't listen to them.
Everyone else is wrong.
Your dad's innocent, and we just need to prove it, Jug.
Who killed him, then, Betty?
Tell me.
If it wasn't my dad, who killed Jason Blossom?
He said he did it, and you know what?
I've been waiting my whole life for that man to do the right thing, and I'm done.
- You should be, too.
- Jug.
Yes, I...
I appreciate it.
That was Weatherbee.
He's concerned for Jug's personal safety.
After what happened with Cheryl, he's worried about the other students' reaction to it.
Thinks Jughead should finish the semester from home.
Jughead's getting kicked out because Cheryl pummeled him.
How is that fair?
It's not.
Well, can we call, I don't know, the school board?
Son, FP may spend decades in prison, potentially the rest of his life.
We gotta think of a long-term solution.
We are the long-term solution.
That's not how it works, okay?
I'm not his legal guardian.
Oh, good thing mom's a lawyer.
Archie, my priority is keeping you safe.
Keep me safe from who?
Jughead?
Are you kidding me, Dad?
[SCOFFS]
No, from whatever trouble seems to follow the Jones' around, wherever they go, whatever they do.
Hell, maybe you should go to Chicago and live with your mom.
It's not even something I was considering, Dad.
But you know what?
Maybe I should.
Hey, if it'll keep you out of trouble, I'm all for it.
Hey, Jug.
I'm gonna sleep in the garage tonight.
Okay?
Jug...
[DOOR CLOSES]
[MUFFLED THUMPING]
[DISTANT BANGING]
[BOTH GASP]
- Did you hear that?
- [SHUSHING]
Mom, what are you doing with that?
[WHISPERING] Get behind me.
Be ready to dial 911.
[PAPERS RUSTLING]
Don't move.
Hands where I can see them.
Don't shoot, Alice.
- Dad!
- Hal!
These are Sheriff Keller's files about the Blossom murder investigation.
How did you get these, Dad?
HAL:
I broke into his house the night of the last drive-in, and I took them.
Well, that's impossible.
FP Jones already confessed to that.
Well, I have no idea why he would do that, because it was me.
That's why I'm here.
To destroy any evidence that could lead back to me.
Wait, that doesn't make any sense.
Why would FP fess up to something he didn't even do?
Yeah, I'm not thinking about FP right now.
I'd like to know why your father is stealing and destroying evidence in a murder investigation.
Look, I was worried that the investigation would get back to Polly, somehow.
To us.
And somehow Sheriff Keller would figure out the connection between our family and the Blossoms.
And he would think that there was some kind of motive.
Wait, you mean about Great-Grandpappy Cooper being murdered by a Blossom?
Betty...
Your great-grandfather wasn't just murdered by a Blossom.
He was a Blossom.
After the murder, our family severed ties with the Blossoms and their name, and we took a new one. "Cooper."
BETTY:
I'm...
A Blossom?
Polly is a Blossom, which makes her and Jason relatives by blood.
- Which is why you wanted to...
- Yeah.
Alice, that's why.
Oh, my God, Hal.
If you're willing to send our daughter away to keep her away from Jason...
How far would the Blossoms go to keep them apart?
We need to get Polly out of that house.
Don't bother calling the cops.
We're not staying.
Polly!
What the hell is going on here, Alice?
It's the middle of the night.
Oh, sorry to disrupt the witching hour at Thornhill.
Polly, honey, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Betty, what's going on?
We're here to bring you home, Pol.
She's not leaving us.
She chose to live here, remember?
With a mentally stable family.
Oh, I know all about your family, Penelope.
- And the incest.
- What?
What incest?
Hal's grandfather wasn't just your grandpappy's murder victim.
They were brothers, which made him a Blossom.
Just like Hal.
- Yeah, so what?
- "So what?"
So, everything, starting with FP's confession, has a few gaping holes in it.
He's being used by someone with a crazy motive, for example, hiding incest.
You were disgusted that Jason and Polly were dating because they were related.
Nothing could be more purely Blossom than those babies.
Okay, what is wrong with you people?
Will you just spare us the middle-class morality.
It's not like they were brother and sister.
They were, what, third cousins.
You think I killed my son?
That's it.
Polly, we are out of here.
Enough of this Doctor Moreau experimentation in breeding and eugenics.
It's over!
HAL:
Betty, let's go.
You've made a grave error, little girl.
No, I don't think so.
And I'm not gonna stop until I prove it.
ARCHIE:
Juggy.
Jug.
Wake up, we gotta go to Pop's.
MARY:
Archie asked me to look into your father's case.
I went down to the station, and passed myself off as his attorney to try to get as much information as I could.
How's it looking, Mom?
Well, unfortunately, between FP's list of priors, the anonymous tip, and the possession of the murder weapon...
Don't forget that pesky confession.
Things look pretty bad.
I was with him all night, and he never once budged from his story.
[SIGHS]
Well, if nothing else, at least he's an honest murderer.
- Jug...
- Right?
Oh, also, who is Joaquin DeSantos?
Joaquin?
As in Kevin's boyfriend?
He was FP's one phone call.
Jughead, my advice to you is, go and see your father.
Tell him everything you wanna say.
Once he's arraigned, things tend to move pretty quickly, and there won't be anything left to do.
So, this might be your last chance.
When Archie told me about his little plan to help you, get you on your feet, and working with Fred,
deep down, I knew it was a mistake.
Should have listened to your gut.
You really had me.
[EXHALES]
Cleaning the trailer.
Convincing me that you had quit drinking.
I was so happy, for the first time in so long.
You paid attention to me.
Let's be honest.
The only reason you even read my manuscript about Jason's murder, was to make sure I wasn't onto you.
And you didn't want to take me to Toledo to get the family back together.
You wanted to get away.
You wanted to run away.
I did what I had to do!
What I always do!
Are you even sorry?
Sorry I got caught.
We done?
[HUFFS]
Look at me, Jughead!
Never come back here!
Understand?
Got it.
[DOOR SLAMS SHUT]
He called Joaquin?
Why not Jughead?
Or your dad?
Or a lawyer?
- It's weird.
- What does Betty think?
She thinks it's weird.
Joaquin might know if FP was hired to kill Jason, if it was my father...
I need to see this through to the end.
ARCHIE:
We know FP used his call from jail to get in touch with you.
What did he say?
It was basically just a warning.
Said to lay low.
No one uses their one call to say "lay low."
Joaquin, do you know something?
I'm not talking to you as your boyfriend,
I'm talking to you as the sheriff's son.
Did FP kill Jason?
Yeah.
- I mean, I...
I assume.
- Oh, my God.
Did you see him pull the trigger?
No, no.
God, no...
Then why do you think he did it?
On July 11th, I got a phone call in the middle of the night from FP.
Said he needed help with some clean-up job at the Whyte Wyrm.
What job?
The basement of the Whyte Wyrm is off limits to everyone, but that's where I met FP, and that's where I saw...
He'd been shot.
I never asked FP if he did it.
I just...
I mean, I was terrified.
I...
I just assumed.
We stashed the body in the freezer, cleaned up the mess, got rid of any evidence...
You are a criminal.
Joaquin, FP has done jobs for my dad, Hiram Lodge, in the past.
Do you think killing Jason was one of them?
There was one time I overheard a conversation between FP and Mustang...
- Who's Mustang?
- He's another Serpent.
The only other guy who knew about the clean-up.
The guy you got into a fight with at the Wyrm.
I heard him tell FP something about some rich guy.
I don't know who.
- Where is Mustang?
- No, no, no, no.
You do not want to go see him.
Yes, I do.
And you're going to take us.
Or...
Or I'm going to tell my dad about your little clean-up job.
BETTY:
I'm so glad that you're home, Pol.
And that you're safe.
And that the babies are okay and healthy.
[SIGHS] But God, everything else...
Is the worst.
[PHONE RINGING]
Betty, I saw my dad.
You were right.
He's hiding something.
Not that much money in local crime and villainy, huh?
This is him, here.
[BANGS AT DOOR]
Mustang?
You here?
Oh, my God.
- I can't...
I can't be here.
- Let's go.
Call my dad.
- Son...
- I'm okay.
We both are.
What were you doing here in the first place?
We knew Mustang was a Serpent.
We just wanted to talk to him, to see if he knew anything about FP.
Veronica, this has to stop.
- Why are you doing this?
- Mom.
What do you think happened in there?
Likely an overdose.
We're waiting to see a time of death, but it wouldn't surprise me at all if he was somehow involved in Jason's murder, and was feeling the heat.
And how'd you know he even lived here?
Sheriff...
Found it under his bed.
SHERIFF KELLER:
Hermione Lodge?
Mind explaining to me why your initials are on this bag?
Not Hermione Lodge, Sheriff.
- Hiram Lodge.
My dad.
- Veronica!
Mom...
He was doing business with the Serpents.
And that's all we're saying until there's an attorney present.
This is exactly what I didn't want to happen.
If you stay on this path, you will end up dead.
Just like Jason Blossom.
You gotta believe me.
Okay?
When I tell you I'm trying to protect you.
That is my job.
It's the only one that counts.
- Do you got that?
- Yes.
[ENGINE STARTS]
Mom!
Mom...
Mom!
[SOBBING]
It's okay.
It's okay.
You gotta tell your friends to stop before they get hurt.
You really don't know them at all, do you?
Just like I don't know you.
- Joaquin?
- Yeah?
I'm gonna miss you, Preppy...
Look, I didn't want to say this in front of your friends, but there's something else.
My dad's been lying to me his whole life, but he's never been any good at it.
I saw it in his eyes.
- He didn't do it.
- So, why lie?
Who is he protecting?
Mommy, that last morning, before Jay-Jay and I went to the river...
Why were he and Daddy arguing?
We've been over this.
Your father dedicated himself to grooming Jason to take over the family business,
- but in the end...
- He couldn't stomach it.
When, really, I should have been nurturing you.
Because Jason never had the stomach for any of it.
But you...
You're a Blossom.
I remember.
He told me.
But why?
What couldn't he handle?
So many questions, Cheryl...
Okay, who can we rule out?
My dad.
We know why he was acting so shady.
- Hermione.
- JUGHEAD:
Yeah.
BETTY:
Veronica says she's guilty of plenty, but not murder.
Plus, she has an alibi.
She was in New York.
JUGHEAD:
So, that just leaves Hiram Lodge...
BETTY:
And Clifford and Penelope Blossom...
I think something happened, Mommy.
Whatever do you mean?
If Daddy wasn't mad at Jason about Polly, it must have been about the business.
I don't know if he heard something he shouldn't have, or he saw something he didn't like...
You don't know what you're saying...
What was Jay-Jay running away from?
The business?
Daddy?
You?
Ow!
PENELOPE:
You think your father killed your brother?
You think I did?
You think we murdered him and threw him in the river, because Jason knew some deep, dark, horrible secret about our business?
You want answers, Cheryl?
Are you ready?
There it is!
There's the sticky, dark, dirty truth.
Maple syrup!
Drown in it, why don't you?
Well, what do we have here?
You two just can't leave well enough alone, can you?
Mom, we know what you're going to say.
The police found another dead body.
Okay, maybe not that.
A Southside Serpent and Sheriff Clueless is convinced that he was working with your father.
He allegedly committed suicide by overdose, and there was a bag of money on-site that links him to Hiram Lodge.
Everything is tied up into a nice little bow.
Too tidy, if you ask me.
[PHONE CHIMING]
Kevin?
Oh, okay.
We'll meet you there.
Whatever it is we're looking for,
Joaquin didn't know if it would help your dad, or make things worse.
Um, guess we're going to find out.
And why did he wait so long to tell us?
FP called him from jail.
Told him to forget about their plan, some contingency plan.
He said it was too dangerous.
Deja vu.
Hey, right here.
[SIGHS]
This is meant to help FP?
I don't know.
Looks like more incriminating evidence to me.
Yeah, this just confirms that my dad torched Jason's getaway car.
And that his confession was true.
Why would FP say Jason's varsity jacket is dangerous?
What could that mean?
I can ask my father.
He would know, considering we found concrete proof that he hired the Serpents to kill Jason.
Which probably means that your dad pulled the trigger, Jughead.
I'm sorry.
No.
No!
No, I'm not giving up yet.
[SIGHS]
Put this on.
- What?
- Put it on.
Betty, this is weird.
There's a hole in the pocket.
Okay, now we're just grasping at straws...
Okay, no.
I don't know about you guys, but whenever I have a hole in my jacket pocket,
I always lose my chapstick in the lining.
VERONICA:
Or my Montblanc?
Hold on.
What the hell?
[SCOFFS]
Nancy Drew strikes again.
[CLICKS MOUSEPAD]
Oh, my God.
[GASPING]
[CRYING] Oh, my God.
- [SOBBING]
- JUGHEAD:
Betty...
Betty, who are you calling?
[SOBBING]
You have to get out of that house.
Listen to me...
I understand.
Thank you.
Cheryl, what is it?
You did a bad thing, Daddy.
And now everyone knows.
Sheriff.
Your office told me that I would find you here.
You need to see this.
Both of you.
JUGHEAD:
That night,
Sheriff Keller and Mayor McCoy saw what we watched in Archie's garage.
Jason, tied to a chair, in the basement of a bar, on the Southside of Riverdale, while a Serpent, Mustang, taunted him.
Then, the unthinkable.
Oh, my God.
[ALL GASP]
[CRYING] Oh, my God.
[SOBBING]
Later, we would learn why my father confessed.
Because Clifford Blossom visited him on the night of his arrest, with a threat, that I, Jughead Jones, would suffer the same fate as Jason Blossom, if my father didn't confess.
My dad was protecting me from a monster, and the nightmare was far from over.
Charged with tampering with evidence, obstruction of justice, mishandling a body, perjury, and that's just off the top of my head.
He's not getting out any time soon.
[INAUDIBLE]
I'm sorry, Mom, that I ever thought that Dad...
Shh, mija.
Everyone makes mistakes.
I have good news.
Very good news.
Your father's coming home.
JUGHEAD:
And our families, far from repaired...
I'm sorry, Mom, but my friends need me.
You should come for the summer, maybe?
That'd be great.
- You be careful.
- I will.
You better.
I love you, Archie.
I love you too, Mom.
JUGHEAD:
And though one question had been answered that night, that it was Clifford Blossom who killed Jason, a new mystery loomed over Riverdale.
Why had he done it?
It was a question only Clifford himself would be able to answer.

Ofigenski convincing arguments?
Crowded at the height of the low fence.

Calmed down?
Now let's think Che do.
A doctor should be.

And I would have thought of myself.
It can not be a doctor.
Will be picked up by the military.
You do not understand?
Well, how would it ...?
He saved me.
I told him to be.
Hold.
Visible fractures seems to be no.
Blood is needed, I lost a lot.
- Our?
- Well yes.
He is breathing our air.
Anatomy And he is the same.
Hence blood can be identical.
However, there is a chance it would be like... to ruin.
But do not pour, just die.
You're fast, huh?
Daddy's friend from the CDB.
He treated me when they arrived.
Igor Semenovich, hello.
This is Julia.
Do you remember you told me to dial if I have a headache will be again.

Yes Yes.

Average.
Like this.
Well, in theory it should work.
Well.
His second positive blood group.
Well, this is according to our classification.
But when you consider that it refers to the humanoid type...
Come on, I have two.
Lie down.
Ah...
Sit down.
Yes, sit down.
So...
So I need.
In parallel vein to insert the needle.
Then find a vein at an angle of 45Âş.

One two Three.
No.
Stop, stop, stop...

No heat, no radiation, no heat.
Absolute symmetry.

Weapons?
- Do not know yet.
- Oh well.
(Knocking on glass)
Judging by the movement of water masses and air fronts.
Ship attracts water.
Like a magnet.
Are they us starve to take that?
According to our version, the water needed for the regeneration of the object.
External damage to the ship resulting in the fall, already eliminated about 30%.
Fragment of equipment turned out to be at our disposal,
It has the same properties.
But the purpose is not able to determine.
- Weapons?
- Or, ship the item.
In the CPT people already gather.
In the online information catapulted that we hide the scale of the loss of water.
As if the boat does not start swinging.
Well, then you decide.
Connect your mayoralty, television.
And let each hour provide monitoring.
For our part we already solve.
By PPC drove water trucks.
The perimeter of the area of â€'â€'organized distribution of water.
And your this element or fragment thereof.

And faced with the ugly creatures.
At the first opportunity, attack me.

Eat, eat, then jumped?

Well... something always will be.
Probably...
Because the military situation.
And it's not a request.
You are required.
(Artem)

Why are you standing here with a gun?
People have to protect something?
It's hard to say what?
(Sounds doorbell)
Hi.
Do not worry, we will not last long.
We were looking for.
Change is necessary.
Do not worry.

You mark my word!
Everyone!
I'm not a politician.
Therefore, I will say in a simple way.
I do not like what's going on.
And it's not who does not like.
We just do not do anything.
And what are our options?
We can blame somewhere, we can endure it all.
And we can stand up and say: "This is our land."
"This is our land!" That's all I wanted to say.
Listen, it does not... it's not...
(Julia)

They're in it in the closet.

It is almost the same as yours, but there is no death for a long time.
Often, you're on a first date, to his home dragging the girls?
You first.

On Chertanovo fall, it does not touch?
We do not want you to have noticed.
The ship hit the meteor shower.
Masking out of order.

If anyone tries to get on the ship,

You Th crazy or what?
!
You're going to shoot?
!
You fool!
Do you realize what's going on?
!
Julia.
Forgive me.
I really want to help.
Just I was once lost.
I'm afraid.
In short, Dad.
I'll do everything.
- Julia!
- Get away from me!
I would like to die.
What is the difference a minute earlier or a minute later.
Dad.
Just trust me, okay?
Car keys.
Fast!
Come on!
The keys!
Behind me.
- Tactical group to me!
- There is!
Run!
(Zoom)
- Get out!
They Che, already gathered to blow up?
- No.
Sol waits.
He will wait until the end.
Comrade Colonel.
Let the question?
- Yes.
- Indeed we shoot?
- Order which it was?
- Ready-to-use.
- So get ready.
- There is.
- Neither of the application.
- There is.
Must have time.
(shot)
Heck!
Love you!
(On the radio)
- Set aside.
No jerks.
Observed.
(Shots)
Julia!
Lower your weapons!
What are you doing with it?
(Screams) What do you do with it?
!
(Mechanical voice)
- Water carries out the regeneration of tissues.
With whom am I saying?
!
I
- Sol.
Small ship study.
With me you can talk.
She is...
She will live?
Not for long. 70 or 80 Earth years.
- And he?
- Hekon had to exist forever.
But he gave his life to her.
This is not an accurate translation.
Why did he do it?
From my point of view, a chain of random events.
With an extremely low probability.
You call it fate.
Is he one came?
Where are the others?
Others do not know where he went.
Your planet is forbidden for public visit.
- Why?
- Extremely aggressive social environment.
Although close to the ideal climatic conditions.
Four billion of violent deaths.
Over the past 5000 years.
During the same period, about 15,000 major military conflicts.
Prior to the complete depletion of resources and extinction of mankind is not more than 600 years.
And you as I look, all plan to live forever, right?
We plan to observe.
Contact with undeveloped civilizations, only accelerates their destruction.
Hekon wanted to gather information and prove that you are ready to meet.
The result of the mission was negative.
So what?
No further attempts will not be?
There is a factor that can make the change forecast.
What?
That's her.
Her decision not amenable to analysis.
I do not understand why she saved Hekona.
And why Hekon decided that she must live for him.
This is not an accurate translation.
I will now review the results of the mission.
On this depends our common future.
I have to pass the rest of what is understood Hekon.
I understand...
What?
Maybe there's something more important than immortality.
This is an accurate translation.

- On TV for a long time will tell about the heroic victory over the aliens.
And while scientists will puzzle over water engines.
People buy buckwheat.
In preparation for the next invasion.
No one will see the point.
After all, the truth is that a stranger, from the distant cosmos, he believed in us.
More than we ourselves.
People say they can not live as before.
I... just can not!

When I was a kid.
My mother and I loved to sit and watch like that in the night sky.
To dream that we are not alone.
What stars are the eyes of the angels.
Who looked after us.
But when my mother was ill, none of them helped.
Then I realized that no one was there.
Silence.
Emptiness.
And cold.
All right, let's go. (Dog barks)
Quiet.
Charl, what are you looking at?
No there is nothing.
Let's go to!
(Teacher)
- At all times, meteor showers frightened people.
Understand that for the guests visited the earth's atmosphere.
It was possible relatively recently.
And earlier cosmic stones, strongly associated with "God's punishment".
Well, how are you?
Well, Che did not you tell that?
I also get yourself out, some of Albert...
And you will not say anything.
- Nothing to tell.
- Like nothing else?
How have you there, Th, where, how, la-la-la-la.
No.
Well, if I have a Romeo appeared.
I probably would have run away from home at all.
Well yes.
Only Tema sure Romeo, this is such a car make.
Do you understand?
(Teacher)
- Already we are with you will witness unique, astronomical phenomena.
Mironov...
Good morning.
How did you sleep then?
- Che immediately Mironov something?
- Nothing!
Do not sleep!
Who can tell me, where was the last meteor rain so hard.
The risk of getting at once...
5 in the quarter.
In China.
- 76th.
Yul...
And there you have a scientific debate, huh?
The scientific debate, yes.
Well?
Google says China. 1976.
Properly Google says.
The most terrible event in human history.
It occurs when it is faced with something...
Unknown.
Frightening.
Because of the meteor shower, it began one of the bloodiest, the Crusades.
As a result of that...
What Mironov?
!
(Students laugh)
I am not sleeping.
Speaking...
Google.
All Crusaders, about 300,000 people have died in the desert.
Yes.
Yes...
- The brain!
- The brain!
And this despite the fact that the meteor rain, scale,
It does not go to any comparison with today.
And here we have it... not that ...?
You're a fool?
(I hear the roar in the sky)
There is no hope.
The debris burn up in the upper atmosphere.
Do not be afraid.
(School bell sounds)
In the evening, everyone is watching meteor shower.
I could hear?
- Yes-a -!
- Well done.
By the way.
- What's this?

Will not leave the house.
No, we're all going to the parking lot, but today meteorites.
And from there, everything's cool sight.
No.
Absolutely no?
Maybe there will be some good arguments?
Ofigenski convincing arguments?
Crowded at the height of the low fence.
A high percentage of drunk in the crowd.
In my opinion a sufficient argument.
Dad, well, I'm not alone.
I was waiting at the bottom of Tema.
- Artem?
- Yes.
Especially not!
(the phone rings)
Class!
Well, not that I'll hurry, just...
The next time the stars will fall in 50 years, I guess.

Zadolbali have their orders.
Though it would be sent somewhere.
On a business trip.

So he left already.

So I do not see a problem.
Ready to rescue the princess from the tower.
From the west came the dense layers of the object.

From 500 to 900 kilometers per hour and goes.
Strategic partners have requested?
Yes sir.

You never know what's inside this thing.
Maybe there is a nuclear reactor, and we will have a second Chernobyl!
Why did you choose to contact?
It was a collective decision?
No.
I volunteered, and the Ministry of Defence has kindly agreed.
Hello Hello?
You hear me?
Have you already driven jammers?
You can stop wherever there is a connection?
No.
I live really.
Mikhail Petrovich.
Can you hear us?
Unfortunately, the connection was broken.
I remind you that about an hour ago.
In the capital Chertanovo, it was an emergency.
In homes fell unidentified object.
The number of victims of this tragedy, yet to be established.
At this moment, the representatives of the Atlantic Alliance, negotiate with Moscow.
Counting also get access to the site of the object falling.
Experts fear the witnesses to confirm the words of that everything that happens, it may be something like an alien invasion.
And yet, from around the world, comes about bringing in full combat readiness of the armed forces.
Meanwhile, the streets adjacent to the place cordoned off by falling object.
Representatives of the Defense Ministry, have so far refrained from comment.
But local residents reported that the contract to a strange ball tactical groups.

Words?
Not sure, but I understood.
What language do you speak to them?

What do you mean - "to avoid victims"?
This is a threat?

With an alien civilization.
And wait!
We have no idea what morality the aliens.
What do they think about life, about death.
Understand whether the pain of loss.
If they do not understand why I have to explain to them.
Why should we, some contacts to establish?
Why can not we just kick them out of here, huh?
Because this is a unique opportunity for all of humanity.
The chance to die?

I really need you.
Ofiget...
It's just a plague!
And I told humanoid type.
Even in our water system found.
And throughout the galaxy a trillion planets.
The probability of living 99 and 9.
All simply attached to, that suits them...
Calmed down?
Now let's think Che do.
A doctor should be.
True?
And I would have thought of myself.
It can not be a doctor.
Will be picked up by the military.
You do not understand?
Well, how would it ...?
He saved me.
I told him to be.
Hold.
Visible fractures seems to be no.
Blood is needed, I lost a lot.
- Our?
- Well yes.
He is breathing our air.
Anatomy And he is the same.
Hence blood can be identical.
However, there is a chance it would be like... to ruin.
But do not pour, just die.
You're fast, huh?
Daddy's friend from the CDB.
He treated me when they arrived.
Igor Semenovich, hello.
This is Julia.
Do you remember you told me to dial if I have a headache will be again.
Yes.
It can be right now?
Skipping to order a machine to us?
Thank you.
Sfotkatsya him, I'll kill you, you understand?
Hey, wait, where are you?
Zdrastye.
B gyemotologiyu.
Igor Semenovich said, just take in the VIP.
Without registration.
We were there.
Here, here, here.
Stay.
And if you noticed?
I'll tell you, it was you all came up and forcibly dragged me here.
After serving for me?
And I give you a kiss.
Wait a minute, well...
It's as if treason it turns out?
All.
Come on.
At times, two, three.

The door is closed, the light is cut down.
Yes Yes.
- Finger.
- What?
Average.
Like this.
Well, in theory it should work.
Well.
His second positive blood group.
Well, this is according to our classification.
But when you consider that it refers to the humanoid type...
Come on, I have two.
Lie down.
Ah...
Sit down.
Yes, sit down.
So...
So I need.
In parallel vein to insert the needle.
Then find a vein at an angle of 45Âş.
- 45Âş.

One two Three.
No.
Stop, stop, stop...
Are you kidding?
Come on...

You go, you need to sleep.
Do not worry you.
I'll sit with him.
Everything will be okay.
No photos and status only.
Type "I treat a stranger." I got it?
- Yes, what are you doing, I - the grave.
- Tomb no Wi fi and 4G.
Chick, cigarette butts.
(I screamed in terror)
No heat, no radiation, no heat.
Absolute symmetry.
Some spherical horse in a vacuum.
Weapons?
- Do not know yet.
- Oh well.
(Knocking on glass)
Judging by the movement of water masses and air fronts.
Ship attracts water.
Like a magnet.
Are they us starve to take that?
According to our version, the water needed for the regeneration of the object.
External damage to the ship resulting in the fall, already eliminated about 30%.
Fragment of equipment turned out to be at our disposal,
It has the same properties.
But the purpose is not able to determine.
- Weapons?
- Or, ship the item.
In the CPT people already gather.
In the online information catapulted that we hide the scale of the loss of water.
As if the boat does not start swinging.
Well, then you decide.
Connect your mayoralty, television.
And let each hour provide monitoring.
For our part we already solve.
By PPC drove water trucks.
The perimeter of the area of â€'â€'organized distribution of water.
And your this element or fragment thereof.
What do you think to do?
- I propose to return.
- To return.
Them?
!
We do not know their intentions.
And now, our main task, minimize the possibility of an open...
Lebedev!
I think you recommend as a good tylovikov.
And not as a specialist in extraterrestrial cultures.
- Let go?
- Where?
!
In the rear.
So.
I ask, please, no offense, Colonel.
We are not here on a first date.
In the general case.
The offer is good, but nothing will not give.
Maybe they know everything about us, and we have nothing about them.
So, this is your element...
The only thing that we have.
What are you doing around here, Russell?
- Yes, it's there it's...
- What?
Fresher.
Pancake.
How to communicate with him to build something, eh?
Theoretically, there is a universal sign language.
Fuck!
Do not be afraid.
To get!

We can blame somewhere, we can endure it all.
And we can stand up and say: "This is our land."

Listen, it does not... it's not...

- Neither of the application.
- There is.
Must have time.
(shot)
Heck!
Love you!
(On the radio)
- Set aside.
No jerks.
Observed.
(Shots)
Julia!
Lower your weapons!
What are you doing with it?
(Screams) What do you do with it?
!
(Mechanical voice)
- Water carries out the regeneration of tissues.
With whom am I saying?
!
I
- Sol.
Small ship study.
With me you can talk.
She is...
She will live?
Not for long. 70 or 80 Earth years.
- And he?
- Hekon had to exist forever.
But he gave his life to her.
This is not an accurate translation.
Why did he do it?
From my point of view, a chain of random events.
With an extremely low probability.
You call it fate.
Is he one came?
Where are the others?
Others do not know where he went.
Your planet is forbidden for public visit.
- Why?
- Extremely aggressive social environment.
Although close to the ideal climatic conditions.
Four billion of violent deaths.
Over the past 5000 years.
During the same period, about 15,000 major military conflicts.
Prior to the complete depletion of resources and extinction of mankind is not more than 600 years.
And you as I look, all plan to live forever, right?
We plan to observe.
Contact with undeveloped civilizations, only accelerates their destruction.
Hekon wanted to gather information and prove that you are ready to meet.
The result of the mission was negative.
So what?
No further attempts will not be?
There is a factor that can make the change forecast.
What?
That's her.
Her decision not amenable to analysis.
I do not understand why she saved Hekona.
And why Hekon decided that she must live for him.
This is not an accurate translation.
I will now review the results of the mission.
On this depends our common future.
I have to pass the rest of what is understood Hekon.
I understand...
What?
Maybe there's something more important than immortality.
This is an accurate translation.

- On TV for a long time will tell about the heroic victory over the aliens.
And while scientists will puzzle over water engines.
People buy buckwheat.
In preparation for the next invasion.
No one will see the point.
After all, the truth is that a stranger, from the distant cosmos, he believed in us.
More than we ourselves.
People say they can not live as before.
I... just can not!
When I was a kid.
My mother and I loved to sit and watch like that in the night sky.
To dream that we are not alone.
What stars are the eyes of the angels.
Who looked after us.
But when my mother was ill, none of them helped.
Then I realized that no one was there.
Silence.
Emptiness.
And cold.
All right, let's go.
Quiet.
Charl, what are you looking at?
No there is nothing.
Let's go to!
Subtitles:

At all times, meteor showers frightened people.

I also get yourself out, some of Albert...
And you will not say anything.

Well yes.
Only Tema sure Romeo, this is such a car make.

Already we are with you will witness unique, astronomical phenomena.
Mironov...
Good morning.
How did you sleep then?
- Che immediately Mironov something?

Who can tell me, where was the last meteor rain so hard.
The risk of getting at once...

Yul...
And there you have a scientific debate, huh?
The scientific debate, yes.
Well?
Google says China. 1976.
Properly Google says.
The most terrible event in human history.
It occurs when it is faced with something...
Unknown.
Frightening.
Because of the meteor shower, it began one of the bloodiest, the Crusades.
As a result of that...
What Mironov?
!
I am not sleeping.
Speaking...
Google.
All Crusaders, about 300,000 people have died in the desert.
Yes.
Yes...
- The brain!
- The brain!
And this despite the fact that the meteor rain, scale,
It does not go to any comparison with today.
And here we have it... not that ...?
You're a fool?
There is no hope.
The debris burn up in the upper atmosphere.
Do not be afraid.
In the evening, everyone is watching meteor shower.
I could hear?
- Yes-a -!

By the way.

And from there, everything's cool sight.
No.
Absolutely no?
Maybe there will be some good arguments?
Ofigenski convincing arguments?
Crowded at the height of the low fence.
A high percentage of drunk in the crowd.
In my opinion a sufficient argument.
Dad, well, I'm not alone.
I was waiting at the bottom of Tema.
- Artem?
- Yes.
Especially not!
Class!
Well, not that I'll hurry, just...
The next time the stars will fall in 50 years, I guess.

Michael Poleskinu.
Who plans to personally inspect the scene.
Mikhail Petrovich, where you are and that still going on?
Right now, I move to the crash site.
We do not have any reasons for any claim, that we are dealing with a kind of object of extraterrestrial origin.

Hello Hello?
You hear me?
Have you already driven jammers?
You can stop wherever there is a connection?

Unfortunately, the connection was broken.
I remind you that about an hour ago.

In homes fell unidentified object.
The number of victims of this tragedy, yet to be established.
At this moment, the representatives of the Atlantic Alliance, negotiate with Moscow.
Counting also get access to the site of the object falling.
Experts fear the witnesses to confirm the words of that everything that happens, it may be something like an alien invasion.
And yet, from around the world, comes about bringing in full combat readiness of the armed forces.
Meanwhile, the streets adjacent to the place cordoned off by falling object.
Representatives of the Defense Ministry, have so far refrained from comment.
But local residents reported that the contract to a strange ball tactical groups.

You do not understand?
Well, how would it ...?
He saved me.
I told him to be.
Hold.
Visible fractures seems to be no.
Blood is needed, I lost a lot.
- Our?
- Well yes.
He is breathing our air.
Anatomy And he is the same.
Hence blood can be identical.
However, there is a chance it would be like... to ruin.
But do not pour, just die.
You're fast, huh?
Daddy's friend from the CDB.
He treated me when they arrived.
Igor Semenovich, hello.
This is Julia.

The door is closed, the light is cut down.
Yes Yes.
- Finger.
- What?
Average.
Like this.
Well, in theory it should work.
Well.
His second positive blood group.
Well, this is according to our classification.
But when you consider that it refers to the humanoid type...
Come on, I have two.
Lie down.
Ah...
Sit down.
Yes, sit down.
So...
So I need.
In parallel vein to insert the needle.
Then find a vein at an angle of 45Âş.
- 45Âş.

One two Three.
No.
Stop, stop, stop...
Are you kidding?
Come on...

Everything will be okay.
No photos and status only.
Type "I treat a stranger." I got it?

- Tomb no Wi fi and 4G.
Chick, cigarette butts.
No heat, no radiation, no heat.
Absolute symmetry.
Some spherical horse in a vacuum.
Weapons?
- Do not know yet.
- Oh well.
Judging by the movement of water masses and air fronts.
Ship attracts water.
Like a magnet.
Are they us starve to take that?
According to our version, the water needed for the regeneration of the object.
External damage to the ship resulting in the fall, already eliminated about 30%.
Fragment of equipment turned out to be at our disposal,
It has the same properties.
But the purpose is not able to determine.
- Weapons?
- Or, ship the item.
In the CPT people already gather.
In the online information catapulted that we hide the scale of the loss of water.
As if the boat does not start swinging.
Well, then you decide.
Connect your mayoralty, television.
And let each hour provide monitoring.
For our part we already solve.
By PPC drove water trucks.
The perimeter of the area of â€'â€'organized distribution of water.
And your this element or fragment thereof.

And now, our main task, minimize the possibility of an open...
Lebedev!
I think you recommend as a good tylovikov.
And not as a specialist in extraterrestrial cultures.
- Let go?
- Where?
!
In the rear.
So.
I ask, please, no offense, Colonel.
We are not here on a first date.
In the general case.
The offer is good, but nothing will not give.
Maybe they know everything about us, and we have nothing about them.
So, this is your element...
The only thing that we have.
What are you doing around here, Russell?
- Yes, it's there it's...
- What?
Fresher.

I need to go back.
Find Shilka.
Get dressed.
A word of thanks, he already learned?
Thank you, it is a form of gratitude.

Actually, yes.
In the event of declaration of martial law, all government functions transferred to the bodies of military administration.
However, while the perimeter of the commandant, Valentin Lebedev, refrains from commenting.

Something like that.
Come on, will bring you to your perimeter.

It took the men with guns.
I have seen.
Without "Shilka" this, that, the ship is not allowed?
The house is far away. 47 light-years.
It is necessary to make the transition to compress time.
Without Shilka Sol not survive the transition.
So you take away his "Shilka" and dump once, right?
Want to help?
I can help.
Different things.
The same shoot.
Evaporated.
Let's go to.
I do not know, our camera will be able to pass it.
But the naked eye can see the color change.
About half an hour ago, we noticed that the object has acquired a red hue.
While we were not able to obtain comments from the Joint Information Center.
But though I doubt that even the experts can tell about this phenomenon, something definite.
For young people.
This approach.
Far from going?
I'm Julia Lebedeva.
Daughter.
Report, please, father, that I should talk to him.
And it does not take a tube.

You always had to spit on me.
Even when my mother died.
Not given to say goodbye to her.
He lied that she gets better.
I just really wanted it to happen not on your eyes.
And I thought you did not ask what I want?
Maybe I wanted to spend the last months of her life, by her side.
Close to the only person who understood me.
And not diskach camp.
I'll never forgive you.

Or do you eat it... photosynthesis?
Let's go to.
Well.
Something like this.

Hi Hi.
It's Charley.
This creature, it suffers, it hurts.
Yes I know.
She has years to fig.
Dad says it's time to put to sleep.
Causes the ...?
Kill.
But I can not.
Charl family member.
We have it even with my mother bought.
And now it is not.
You like to think of my mother, so you make a creature to suffer?
No, on the contrary.
- Well...
I do not.
- What for?
And you where I'm looking, but with feelings napryazhenka?
The sense of touch and sight is the same as you.
I'm not talking about those feelings.
Thanks.
Loneliness.
Hatred.
Love.
Love and hate need to overcome the fear of death.
When there is no death, no need to love, not to hate.
Ofiget.
I do this in my status I'll write, okay?
Yulechka, and you do not want me to present to the young man?
And... of course.
Hariton, ŃŤto Luba.
Lyuba, ŃŤto Hariton.
Yeah, a rare name.
Years to fig.
It's time to put to sleep?
I'm sorry, what?
Quietly, quietly.

He just from Peter, you know?
And once it was a cultural capital.
Yes.
You Che done to her?

If he's around, you can live forever.
Charl.
Charl, come here.
Healthy eyes.
My dogs...
Wait.
What are you...
Immortal?
I. Michael, tell us about the first contact.
What exactly happened there.
Tragedy.
The tragedy of the world scale.
We hoped to find a reasonable, sane beings.
With whom it would be to engage in dialogue.
Share technology.
And faced with the ugly creatures.
At the first opportunity, attack me.
- Do not get stuck.
- What is it?
A dangerous thing.
30 minutes and he'll go look wet aliens.
Mmm!
It's delicious, thank you!
To your health.
What for?
Joke.
But this is not funny.
Eat, eat, then jumped?
A?
With dad already met?
- Well yes.
- So how is it?
He was scared.
For his daughter, for his house.
I understand it.
Do not worry, Lube.
I marry him I'm not.
Therefore, a blessing to the wrong address.
Well, nothing.
And here is the Pope.
On his armored train.
Julia!
- Where's she?
- Do yourself.
Valentine, she's a boy.
I do not think that...
Get away.
How well without you there was something, huh?
Why are you doing it?
- What?
- Inhale.
It hurts.
Do not you of FIG?
We have a tradition.
Whenever any superior race, trying to destroy humanity, we all begin to smoke, hoof to quickly discard.
Do you understand?
We do not want to destroy you.
You are your own harm.
I urgently need an interpreter to space.
Do you like it here?
No I do not like.
- And where is like?
- Over there, where the slide.
Just can not go there now.
Why, do you think?
Well...
There's also this thing.
Hard?
Let us help you.
Of course.
In five liters is not dragged.
That take less.
And the soup is cooked, it is necessary to go back.
It is not hard?
Of course hard.
Cool that.
Previously, there generally no one steamed.
Now all just talk about us.
These...
Journalists complete.
And throw the ball.
Thank you.
So you want to always be, huh?
Well... something always will be.
Probably...
Because the military situation.
And it's not a request.
You are required.
Well, it's a simple question.
Why are you standing here with a gun?
People have to protect something?
It's hard to say what?
Hi.
Do not worry, we will not last long.
We were looking for.
Change is necessary.
Do not worry.
Will kill you all one by one.
You mark my word!
Everyone!
I'm not a politician.
Therefore, I will say in a simple way.
I do not like what's going on.
And it's not who does not like.
We just do not do anything.
And what are our options?
We can blame somewhere, we can endure it all.
And we can stand up and say: "This is our land."
"This is our land!" That's all I wanted to say.
Listen, it does not... it's not...
Rags-then where are you?
They're in it in the closet.
Capture.
Turn away.
But...
I too... turn away?
- You?
- Yeah.
Try.
It is generally Dad.
Speaking...
Well, he's just come in half an hour.
Can you somewhere, I do not know...
hang out in the subway?
There's just more crowded, as it were, and safer.
No, I do not think, I do not expel, just...
I have a better idea.
Â™" Why so much pain?
Max?
Well, how do you?
An unusual, interesting, electric pulse.
Clear.
Over here no one would look for.
Concert during martial law.
When that will be more?
- Otorvëmsya?
- Otorvëmsya?
Che are you standing?
Undress.
Wow, Tema.
Look, it's yes.
But...
There's nerves.
You understand.
No, no, no, no.
Brake.
Infa is.
You're doing fine!
Almost like a man.
I am the man.
We are a branch of one tree.
- I do not hear you.
- Give me your hand, I'll show you.
Hand?
In short, count!
Who saw right now!
Where are we?
It is my house.
It is almost the same as yours, but there is no death for a long time.
Often, you're on a first date, to his home dragging the girls?
You first.
We are not allowed to come into contact.
On Chertanovo fall, it does not touch?
We do not want you to have noticed.
The ship hit the meteor shower.
Masking out of order.
- And then we have shot down.
- Yes.
If anyone tries to get on the ship,
Saul will destroy him.
We can not allow our technology to hit you.
And what, you're there all ready to die for this?
It's...
It's protocol.
Well this is your refund "Shilka".
What's next?
We'll just fly.
Forever?
People.
Curfew.
We need to roll up.
But I want you to know.
Many of you lost loved ones.
Many of you are eager for revenge...
It's here.
Not hate.
Now this is particularly important.
Well.
All?
It's unhealthy.
Do you remember?
And I wanted to understand.
Like this.
When the smoke?
When you die.
And you are not the FIG?
All.
Go.

Can meet?
- Tëm, I can not.
- Ahh...
Or rather not so I do not want.
Listen.
You are a good guy.
I just...
Yes Yes.
I drop dead, I know.
But apparently not enough... drop dead.
But... is not Che.
Do not worry.
Everything is fine.

Not a fool.
You like it?

They are not as we thought.
They are better than us, Tëm!

All right.
To her.

Let's go to.
We Roos in a garden walk.
All my life together.
We were once sent to the camp.
We were 10 years old.
Minor really.
And there is a stormy river, open.
All were afraid to jump.
Well, I decided to show off in front of girls.

Suffered immediately, it reduces legs, cold.
And Rus, behind me jumped.
He swim Those guys do not know how, but still jumped.

They ordered.

Little time.
I can still stop.
We need to let us go.

- Useless.
That's an order.
Said guard, they will be protected.
Bad luck to you.
It was necessary to Finland fall.
Silently sitting.
Forgive me.
It was not to be.
You should not have come flying.
Sorry?
I have something to say not clear?
We end the conversation.
Yes, okay, good.

Against you would use force!
Come on!
Serried ranks!
Closer!
Right flank!

Five steps forward!
Hands take away.
Comrade Colonel.
The body of experts sent.
There's one more thing it was.
With them.
You've done Che, Yul?
I'm done?
Maybe you've done?
Minutes of the protective space defense.
Missile Defense.
Paranoid!
That you shot them down!
Who are you?
If you get close, it ends today.
Sol will blow the ship.
- We all will die.
And they and we, you know?
Why do you believe him, but I do not?
Because he's with me even talking!
He is not a man!
We do not know who it is!
I am human?
Can you hear me?
Why are you all talking about what to do?
Why do not you even try to understand me?
- I'm trying to understand you.
- Then give us a chance.
I know what to do.
We know.
- Lebedev.
- Valentin.
How it all seriously?
It means so.
Listen to me.
You are there on the spot.
Act as he sees fit.
Under my responsibility!
Half an hour you have.
And what will happen in half an hour?
Half an hour will be morning.
Hopefully.
Always ready for use.
You Th crazy or what?
!
You're going to shoot?
!
You fool!
Do you realize what's going on?
!
Julia.
Forgive me.
I really want to help.
Just I was once lost.
I'm afraid.
In short, Dad.
I'll do everything.
- Julia!
- Get away from me!
I would like to die.
What is the difference a minute earlier or a minute later.
Dad.
Just trust me, okay?
Car keys.
Fast!
Come on!
The keys!
Behind me.
- Tactical group to me!
- There is!
Run!
Get out!
They Che, already gathered to blow up?
- No.
Sol waits.
He will wait until the end.
Comrade Colonel.
Let the question?
- Yes.
- Indeed we shoot?
- Order which it was?
- Ready-to-use.
- So get ready.
- There is.
- Neither of the application.
- There is.
Must have time.
Heck!
Love you!
Set aside.
No jerks.
Observed.
Julia!
Lower your weapons!
What are you doing with it?
What do you do with it?
!
Water carries out the regeneration of tissues.
With whom am I saying?
!
I
- Sol.
Small ship study.
With me you can talk.
She is...
She will live?
Not for long. 70 or 80 Earth years.
- And he?
- Hekon had to exist forever.
But he gave his life to her.
This is not an accurate translation.
Why did he do it?
From my point of view, a chain of random events.
With an extremely low probability.
You call it fate.
Is he one came?
Where are the others?
Others do not know where he went.
Your planet is forbidden for public visit.
- Why?
- Extremely aggressive social environment.
Although close to the ideal climatic conditions.
Four billion of violent deaths.
Over the past 5000 years.
During the same period, about 15,000 major military conflicts.
Prior to the complete depletion of resources and extinction of mankind is not more than 600 years.
And you as I look, all plan to live forever, right?
We plan to observe.
Contact with undeveloped civilizations, only accelerates their destruction.
Hekon wanted to gather information and prove that you are ready to meet.
The result of the mission was negative.
So what?
No further attempts will not be?
There is a factor that can make the change forecast.
What?
That's her.
Her decision not amenable to analysis.
I do not understand why she saved Hekona.
And why Hekon decided that she must live for him.
This is not an accurate translation.
I will now review the results of the mission.
On this depends our common future.
I have to pass the rest of what is understood Hekon.
I understand...
What?
Maybe there's something more important than immortality.
This is an accurate translation.
Â™" We're all looking for the dream, we go home.
Â™" dive deep.
Â™" In a circle of strangers again fall to take off.
Â™" expunged letters and wish to forgive.
Â™" weather-beaten lips, we lose ourselves.
Â™" Turning comfort tired bored.
Â™" As people in the photo, I'm tired of being alone.
Â™" Do not melted butter, but I embrace you.
Â™" I'm back, I'm happy â™" Throw open the windows wide open.
Â™" Wake me up by the wind.
Â™" Let the city noise.
Â™" Our meetings are so rare.
Â™" Throw open the windows wide open.
Â™" Wake me up by the wind.
Â™" Let the city noise.
Â™" Our meetings are so rare.
On TV for a long time will tell about the heroic victory over the aliens.
And while scientists will puzzle over water engines.
People buy buckwheat.
In preparation for the next invasion.
No one will see the point.
After all, the truth is that a stranger, from the distant cosmos, he believed in us.
More than we ourselves.
People say they can not live as before.
I... just can not!

- When I was a kid.
My mother and I loved to sit and watch like that in the night sky.
To dream that we are not alone.

When there is no death, no need to love, not to hate.

The tragedy of the world scale.
We hoped to find a reasonable, sane beings.
With whom it would be to engage in dialogue.
Share technology.
And faced with the ugly creatures.
At the first opportunity, attack me.
- Do not get stuck.
- What is it?
- A dangerous thing.
30 minutes and he'll go look wet aliens.
- Mmm!
It's delicious, thank you!
- To your health.
- What for?
- Joke.
But this is not funny.
- Eat, eat, then jumped?
A?
With dad already met?
- Well yes.
- So how is it?
- He was scared.
For his daughter, for his house.
I understand it.
- Do not worry, Lube.
I marry him I'm not.
Therefore, a blessing to the wrong address.
- Well, nothing.
And here is the Pope.
On his armored train.
- Julia!
Where's she?
- Do yourself.
Valentine, she's a boy.
I do not think that...
- Get away.
- How well without you there was something, huh?
- Why are you doing it?
- What?
- Inhale.
It hurts.
- Do not you of FIG?
We have a tradition.
Whenever any superior race, trying to destroy humanity, we all begin to smoke, hoof to quickly discard.
Do you understand?
- We do not want to destroy you.
You are your own harm.
- I urgently need an interpreter to space.
(Artem)
- Do you like it here?
- No I do not like.
- And where is like?
- Over there, where the slide.
Just can not go there now.
- Why, do you think?

There's also this thing.
(Artem)

In five liters is not dragged.
That take less.
And the soup is cooked, it is necessary to go back.
It is not hard?
Of course hard.

Previously, there generally no one steamed.
Now all just talk about us.
These ...
Journalists complete.
- And throw the ball.
Thank you.
(Artem)
- So you want to always be, huh?
- Well ... something always will be.
Probably...
- Because the military situation.
And it's not a request.
You are required.
(Artem)
- Well, it's a simple question.
Why are you standing here with a gun?
People have to protect something?
It's hard to say what?
(Sounds doorbell)
- Hi.
Do not worry, we will not last long.
We were looking for.
Change is necessary.
- Do not worry.
(Video) - will kill you all one by one.
You mark my word!
Everyone!
- I'm not a politician.
Therefore, I will say in a simple way.
I do not like what's going on.
And it's not who does not like.
We just do not do anything.
And what are our options?
We can blame somewhere, we can endure it all.
And we can stand up and say: "This is our land."
"This is our land!" That's all I wanted to say.
- Listen, it does not ... it's not ...
(Julia)
- Rags-then where are you?
- They're in it in the closet.
- Capture.
Turn away.
- But ...
I too ... turn away?
- You?
- Yeah.
- Try.

Speaking ...
Well, he's just come in half an hour.
Can you somewhere, I do not know ... hang out in the subway?
There's just more crowded, as it were, and safer.
No, I do not think, I do not expel, just ...
- I have a better idea.
(Max Korzh sings "Endorphin") â" Why so much pain?
Max?
- Well, how do you?

Concert during martial law.
When that will be more?
Otorvëmsya?

Look, it's yes.
But...
There's nerves.
You understand.
No, no, no, no.
Brake.
Infa is.
- You're doing fine!
Almost like a man.
- I am the man.
We are a branch of one tree.
- I do not hear you.
- Give me your hand, I'll show you.
- Hand?
- In short, count!
Who saw right now!
- Where are we?
- It is my house.
It is almost the same as yours, but there is no death for a long time.
- Often, you're on a first date, to his home dragging the girls?
- You first.
We are not allowed to come into contact.
- On Chertanovo fall, it does not touch?
- We do not want you to have noticed.
The ship hit the meteor shower.
Masking out of order.
- And then we have shot down.
- Yes.
If anyone tries to get on the ship,
Saul will destroy him.
We can not allow our technology to hit you.
- And what, you're there all ready to die for this?
- It's ...
It's protocol.
- Well this is your refund "Shilka".
What's next?
- We'll just fly.
- Forever?
- People.
Curfew.
We need to roll up.
But I want you to know.
Many of you lost loved ones.
Many of you are eager for revenge ...
- It's here.
(Max Korzh) - not hate.
Now this is particularly important.
- Well.
All?
It's unhealthy.
Do you remember?
And I wanted to understand.
Like this.

- When you die.
And you are not the FIG?
- All.
Go.
(the phone rings)
- Yes?
(Artem)

Can meet?
- Tëm, I can not.

Listen.
You are a good guy.
I just...
- Yes Yes.

But apparently not enough ... drop dead.
But ... is not Che.
Do not worry.

All my life together.
We were once sent to the camp.
We were 10 years old.

Minutes of the protective space defense.
Missile Defense.
Paranoid!
That you shot them down!
- Who are you?
- If you get close, it ends today.
Sol will blow the ship.
- We all will die.
And they and we, you know?
- Why do you believe him, but I do not?
- Because he's with me even talking!
- He is not a man!
We do not know who it is!
- I am human?
Can you hear me?
Why are you all talking about what to do?
Why do not you even try to understand me?
- I'm trying to understand you.
- Then give us a chance.
I know what to do.
We know.

How it all seriously?
It means so.

Forgive me.
I really want to help.
Just I was once lost.
I'm afraid.
- In short, Dad.
I'll do everything.

I would like to die.
What is the difference a minute earlier or a minute later.
Dad.
Just trust me, okay?
Car keys.

(Shots)
- Julia!
Lower your weapons!
What are you doing with it?
(Screams)
- What do you do with it ?
!
(Mechanical voice)
- Water carries out the regeneration of tissues.
- With whom am I saying ?
!
- I
- Sol.
Small ship study.
With me you can talk.
- She is...
She will live?
- Not for long. 70 or 80 Earth years.
- And he?
- Hekon had to exist forever.
But he gave his life to her.
This is not an accurate translation.
- Why did he do it?
- From my point of view, a chain of random events.
With an extremely low probability.
You call it fate.
- Is he one came?
Where are the others?
- Others do not know where he went.
Your planet is forbidden for public visit.
- Why?
- Extremely aggressive social environment.
Although close to the ideal climatic conditions.
Four billion of violent deaths.
Over the past 5000 years.
During the same period, about 15,000 major military conflicts.
Prior to the complete depletion of resources and extinction of mankind is not more than 600 years.
- And you as I look, all plan to live forever, right?
- We plan to observe.
Contact with undeveloped civilizations, only accelerates their destruction.
Hekon wanted to gather information and prove that you are ready to meet.
The result of the mission was negative.
- So what?
No further attempts will not be?
- There is a factor that can make the change forecast.
- What?
- That's her.
Her decision not amenable to analysis.
I do not understand why she saved Hekona.
And why Hekon decided that she must live for him.

Can you listen to me?
Why are you telling everyone what to do?
Why do not you even try to understand me?
"I'm trying to understand you." "Then give us a chance."
I know what to do.
We know.
- Lebedev.
- Valentine.
How serious is everything there?
So it is.
Listen to me.
You there on a place.
Do it like this, As you see fit.
Under my responsibility!
You have half an hour.
- And what will happen in half an hour?
"In half an hour there will be morning."
I hope so.
- Full readiness for use.
"Are you a psycho, or what?" You're going to shoot ?
!
"You fool!"
Do you even understand, what's happening?
!
Julia.
Forgive me.
I really want to help.
I just lost once.
I'm afraid.
- In short, Dad.
I'll do everything.
- Julia!
- Get away from me!
Still die.
What's the difference, A minute earlier or a minute later.
Dad.
Just trust me, okay?
Car keys.
Fast!
- Come on!
"The keys!"
- Behind me.
- Tactical group to me!
- There is!
- Run!
(Signal)
- Go away!
They're already going to blow up already?
- No.
Sol is waiting.
He will wait until the end.
"Comrade Colonel." Resolve the question?
- Yes.
"Are we really going to shoot?"
"What was the order?"
- Readiness for use.
"Here, get ready."
- There is.
"Not of any use."
- There is.
"I must make it."
(shot)
- Heck!
Love you!
(By radio)
- To leave.
Nobody jerks.
We observe.
(Shots)
- Julia!
Drop the weapon!
What are you doing with it?
(Shouts) "What are you doing with her ?
!"
(Mechanical voice)
- Water regenerates tissues.
- Who am I talking to ?
!
"I'm Saul." Small research ship.
You can talk to me.
- She is...
Will she live?
- Not for long.
70 or 80 Earth years.
- And he?
"Hacon should have existed forever."
But he gave his life to her.
This is not an accurate translation.
"Why did he do it?"
- From my point of view, This is a chain of random events.
With an extremely low probability.
You call it destiny.
"Did he come alone?" Where are the others?
- The rest do not know, Where he went.
Your planet is forbidden For an open visit.
- Why?
- Extremely aggressive social environment.
Despite being close to perfect Climatic conditions.
For the last 5000 years.
Over the same period, About 15,000 major military conflicts.
Until the exhaustion of resources And the extinction of mankind is no more than 600 years.
- And you, as I look, Plan to live forever, all right?
- We plan to observe.
Contact with undeveloped civilizations, Only accelerates their destruction.
Hacon wanted to gather information And prove that you are ready to meet.
Mission Outcome Was negative.
- So what?
Will there be no further attempts?
- There is a factor that can To change the forecast.
"What kind?"
- That's her.
Its solution does not lend itself to
I do not understand, Why she saved Hacon.
And why did Hacon decide, That she must live in his stead.
This is not an accurate translation.
Now I have to reconsider Results of the mission.
Our common future depends on this.
I must pass on to the others, That Hacon understood.
"I understand ...
What?"
- Perhaps there is, Something more important than immortality.
This is the exact translation.
(The song "L'One
- Return" sounds) ?
We are all looking for a dream, we leave the house.
?
Diving into the depths.
?
In the circle of strangers Again to fall, to fly off.
?
Delete letters, wish and forgive.
?
To weather our lips, we lose ourselves.
?
Turning comfort, tired of being bored.
1,323 02:01:06,329 -- 02:01:11,996 ?
According to the people in the photo, I'm tired of being alone.
?
You have not melted butter, but I will embrace you.
?
I'm back, I'm happy
?
Open the windows wide.
?
Wake me up with the wind.
?
Let this city roar.
?
Our meetings are so rare.
?
Open the windows wide.
?
Wake me up with the wind.
?
Let this city roar.
?
Our meetings are so rare.
(Julia)
- On TV for a long time to speak, About the heroic victory over the newcomers.
And while the scientists will rack their brains, Over water engines.
The people buy buckwheat.
Preparing for the next invasion.
No one will see the main thing.
The truth is, That one stranger,
From a distant cosmos, he believed in us.
More than ourselves.
People says, That they can not live as before.
I ...
I really can not!
I've been meaning to talk with you.
It's terrifying, isn't it?
The president and I have a simple request.
Tell us what you see.
If anything in your environment strikes you as a bit odd, a bit off, pick up the phone.
Whether it's a package or a person that seems out of place, we'd love you to let us know.
Because there's a lot of noise out there these days.
A noisy press that's choosing to dwell on the past instead of what's happening right now.
My husband and I want to protect you.
In two weeks' time, you will be heading to the ballot box to decide what kind of country you want to live in.
It's a profound choice.
But no matter who wins this election, we're going to need to work together, watch out for each other, and, yes, watch each other, to keep us all safe and sound.
Tell us what you see.
My name is Claire Underwood, and I approve this message.
Should we do one more?
Did the Democrats show?
They didn't disappoint.
Almost every member, sir.
- Almost.
- I have a list of those who did.
My fellow congressmen, I do not need the Washington Herald to tell me that a scoundrel lives in the White House.
I can see the Democrats are here.
They're eager to debate.
I say to the gentlemen on the other side of the aisle...
- thank you.
- Go.
Should we investigate the president for crimes committed while he was vice president?
I say, yes.
Let's debate.
Let's debate this miscreant all day and all night.
Madam Speaker.
Parliamentary inquiry.
The gentleman from Georgia may state the nature of his parliamentary inquiry.
Do the rules of the House not require the president be formally invited in order to attend?
Madam Speaker, if I may...
The Speaker recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.
The president is wearing his congressional pin today and is thereby welcome to any and all proceedings.
Madam Speaker!
Madam Speaker!
Rules of the House state that former members are not allowed on the floor when they have interest in the matter under debate.
Madam Speaker, the president has no interest or opinion on the matter being debated today.
The House suspend.
The House will suspend.
Madam Speaker, I still do have the floor, and I find it hard to believe the president wouldn't have an opinion on the matter being discussed.
If the good gentleman from Florida would yield a portion of his time,
I assure him it will satisfy his query.
I yield three minutes to the leader.
And I yield my time to the former congressman from South Carolina and the President of the United States.
Point of order!
Parliamentary inquiry!
Parliamentary inquiry!
Parliamentary inquiry!
Mr. President.
This is beyond the norm.
I don't care.
I don't care.
And I also do not care about your investigative committees.
No, that is not what I care about today.
The House will cease.
That is not what I care about today.
I am on my way to the funeral of an American patriot.
A good man, a husband... a father... who was beheaded on American soil.
And this chamber chooses to debate me?
- The House will suspend.
- I asked to speak to a full session of this chamber and my requests were denied.
- Madam Speaker!
- Mr. President, you must yield the floor.
I will not yield, Madam Speaker.
Because I cannot wait.
One of the murderers...
One of the murderers who killed Mr. Jim Miller... is still out there.
At large.
How much more proof do you people need?
I demand that every member of this House take a stand.
Like FDR before, and Wilson before him.
I demand that this Congress declare a formal declaration of war against ICO, both here and abroad.
Motion to adjourn.
- Second!
- The House will adjourn.
- The president will cease.
- I will not cease!
I will never cease.
I demand that this Congress declare a state of war has existed and does exist between ICO and the United States of America.
And I demand that every member of this House stay in this chamber for as long as it takes, until you bring my request to a vote.
Or you will all go down in history as cowards!
Cowards!
The sergeant at arms will remove the president.
Madam Speaker, I repeat.
I demand a vote.
I will not yield.
I will not yield.
I will not yield.
Alleged terrorist Zachary Hawthorne was killed by the FBI, but Joshua Masterson is still at large.
While the Miller family mourns, the hunt for the missing terrorist continues and tensions are running high.
The president may be asking for war, but it seems war's already been declared on him.
My fans.
FBI is looking into a multiple shooting in Chattanooga.
- Reports have it gang related.
- No.
A private plane went down in West Virginia.
Mechanical failure.
A series of homes were set on fire in Georgia, most likely arson.
Uh... convenience store in North Carolina exploded at about 4:00 in the morning.
- Where's the store?
- Uh, suburb outside of Raleigh.
The cause is still under investigation.
- I'll make an appearance.
- Yes, ma'am.
Just put it on the schedule so the media has time to mobilize.
Yes, ma'am.
I take it the president has declared war on Joshua Masterson.
He never should've kicked me off that call.
But this morning isn't about politics.
That's right.
We need to show some compassion for the living.
And respect for the dead.
The family's agreed to a moment.
No press, no speeches, but we should be able to pull something.
- Mr. President.
- Governor.
Do they not realize what we've done for them already?
I pointed that out, sir, but... the daughter's medicated and very fragile at the moment.
All right.
Mrs. Miller.
- I'm so very sorry.
- Thank you.
And I promise you,
I will not stop until everyone responsible for this terrible tragedy is brought to justice.
And I swear to you, as God is my witness... no one will ever harm you or your family ever again.
The nation mourns with you and your daughter, Mrs. Miller.
- Thank you.
If you don't mind...
- Of course.
Mr. President.
I'll be right along.
It's a busy day for you today, sir.
It's a sad, sad day.
It's a shame things didn't turn out differently.
Yes.
Well, some things are bigger than the two of us, Will.
I don't want him here!
Calm down, Melissa.
Please.
It's his fault.
He's dead.
- Daddy's dead.
He killed him.
- Please.
Give me a minute.
- Did you take your medicine?
- Yes.
Okay?
Yes.
Yes!
You do.
You think about what you would say on a day like today.
If a day like today were to happen.
But you let it pass... because you know you have so much more left ahead of you.
So much to do together.
You think...
You think 40 minutes...
If we were late 40 minutes...
Or two, or one...
Or if we went somewhere else to eat...
But to dwell in the past, to live in what-ifs...
That wasn't my husband.
That wasn't us...
- Honey...
- Please.
Okay.
Come on.
I need to...
I wanted to say about my father...
He was so strong... so brave.
My father was taking us to...
My father...
- Come on, baby.
It's okay.
- My father...
You killed my father.
You're the reason he died.
Melissa...
It's all right, Melissa.
We understand.
I hope you die and she becomes president.
What did the girl say to you?
She said she hopes I die and that you become the president.
Mr. Macallan, this is Deputy Director Michaels from the NSA.
I'm literally in your office.
I believe we had a meeting.
There's been raids as far up as New York and down to the panhandle.
As of now,
Green's focusing in on the border between Virginia and North Carolina.
Seth has a statement ready for this afternoon.
No.
The best statement is no statement.
Besides, I want Claire to be the voice on this until we're ready.
Yes, sir.
- Quite a crowd out there.
- Well, we better bring Birch in first.
Yes, sir.
Congressman Birch.
Bob.
Well, that was a little bit of history this morning, wasn't it?
- It certainly was.
- I couldn't see it any other way.
No disagreement from here.
Well, you know how the Republicans are.
Anything but a decision.
They mistake complaint for leadership.
Well, instead of a committee to investigate you, you got one to discuss your declaration.
All the way to election day.
Even if there's only a handful of Republicans with the grit and spit to put up a fight, we can control the conversation.
Get them talking about anything but that goddamn article.
All right.
Now, who from our side
- do we need to massage?
- Womack.
The declaration caught him off guard.
Had to keep him out of it.
It's his constituents that actually fight the damn thing.
Well, let's call in the honorable gentleman from Missouri.
- Oh, he's a bourbon man, isn't he?
- Yes, he is.
- A stunt.
Yes, I'm calling it a stunt.
- Charlie, if I may...
Tom, please, what are you implying?
This request for a declaration of war is yet another distraction.
And I've never been prouder of the president than I am today.
I'm not denying what happened to the Millers.
It was a tragedy.
No, but you are.
Because denying it is the tragedy.
This is a pattern.
Your husband's administration, Mrs. Underwood,
- continues to operate in the shadows.
- Tom...
I understand you believe in the importance of your article.
And I agreed to come here today and talk with you about it.
But we're fighting to keep this country safe.
Mrs. Underwood, the White House has yet to release one piece of information about the attempted capture of those domestic terrorists.
ICO terrorists, yes.
Reports from a few hours ago are saying North Carolina or Virginia.
But that's all we have.
Well, we are circling in, we're getting closer.
I will tell you, our intelligence community, they are the real heroes.
Charlie, if we could get back to my point, my sources confirmed...
Tom.
Heather Dunbar, no friend of mine or my husband's, looked into these charges, and cleared the president.
Cleared?
Please.
The White House has not had a single press briefing since the Herald ran my article.
You keep saying the White House isn't speaking about this.
I am sitting right here talking to you.
Not Remy Danton or Jackie Sharp.
Or Lucas Goodwin, either.
- What?
- Excuse me.
Lucas Goodwin, meaning?
I'm saying, me.
I'm here.
And I don't know how many more times we have to go over this.
You know, a Tom Hammerschmidt article used to be the first thing I would look for when I opened the Washington Herald.
The Underwoods are no longer campaigning.
They can call it what they want.
Well, if you think about the last few days, what's in the air...
It might not be such a bad idea for us to take it one handshake at a time.
Or call it for what it is.
"Home and abroad."
The president is essentially asking for permission
- to fight a war on our soil.
- We can't push back too hard.
We can't afford to look soft on terror.
We can't look the other way, either.
You of all people know where this kind of talk leads.
...ICO and the United States of America.
Make sure the committee dealing with the declaration of war never gets to a vote.
We're not against war, we're against his.
And I want you to reach out to the Speaker and find out who she's putting on that committee.
We need to get back to the president's crimes.
That's the story.
It's the only story.
Anything else?
I have my script.
I will not yield!
I will not...
Harry...
I want to know what he says and when he says it.
Our general isn't used to taking orders.
Will, one more thing.
- What?
- Your wife.
Okay, I know we opened up this campaign on Pollyhop, but it might be time to close it down... or at least be more careful.
Well, what did they find out?
The home of the mother of the terrorist, you know, the one they're looking for, was vandalized last night.
Garage set on fire.
Broken windows.
And, uh, Hannah... well... she posted.
She was defending the mother online.
- When?
- This afternoon.
The timing is not good on this.
- I can show you.
- Not now.
Thank you.
Governor Conway and I are honored to be here with the Miller family and their closest friends.
I know the VFW was a big part of Jim's life here in Knoxville.
With the help of Homeland and our hotline, we think that Masterson has crossed into the southwest corner of Virginia.
Scott or Washington.
- And?
- And...
Assistant Director Green?
We're relying on aerial support, sightings and local law enforcement.
But we're fairly confident we can have him pinned down in the next 24 hours.
The president wants us to be absolutely sure.
We can't have him getting away again.
Careers are at stake.
Everyone around this table is fully aware of the gravity of the situation.
Good.
The president will be happy to hear that.
Okay.
What kind of kiss do you want?
- Eskimo.
- In... and out.
I'll be right back.
- You're angry.
- I am.
I was asked a question and I answered.
That's the least of it.
Okay, well, I don't want to talk about it right now.
Are you trying to lose this election?
Are you?
Oh, Will, stop it.
This woman that you're defending...
Her son just cut someone's head off.
And he's still out there somewhere.
- Do you understand what this looks like?
- Stop it.
Do you want to know why our son can't sleep?
He's eight years old, and he can't sleep.
Because he's having nightmares.
Because he thinks there's a big black dog running around the hotel.
- Dog?
- Yes.
He closes his eyes, and he can hear it growling.
He's scared, Will.
I said what I said because that woman is a victim.
We all are.
And it has to stop.
I want you to win.
Get yourself a drink.
I'll be right back.
That's the mother.
And this is Hannah's response.
She's not a criminal and should not be punished for the sins of her son.
We all, I know, reject the rhetoric and actions of these damaged, troubled young men.
What I mean is, this is a time for reflection, not aggression...
So she's not condoning it, but it is sympathetic.
Plays into the idea that Joshua and Zachary were just a pair of troubled kids looking for a cause, no different than some school shooter.
The post has been shared over 100,000 times.
I want to talk with her.
- Hannah?
- The mother.
We've been very careful about where you appear.
- LeAnn, will you excuse us for a moment?
- Of course.
We need to dial up the terror.
And the mother can help us with that.
But that also means we have to locate Masterson.
Soon.
Tom is waiting for me.
Well, you go on.
Francis...
I shouldn't have cried at the funeral.
- No, it played beautifully.
- Not for me.
Come with me.
Come on.
Just tell him you'll be late.
- Mr. President.
- It's all right, Officer.
Ma'am.
May I have your scope?
Scope on your gun.
I promise I'll give it back.
Thank you.
Come here.
Now, if you just hold the scope a little a ways from your face... and look down, straight down, across the lawn... right to the gate.
- You see them?
- Hmm.
Those people want a voice.
Some for, some against.
And they're looking back across the lawn, toward this house and these windows... and they're thinking,
"I wonder what the president and the First Lady are doing tonight.
And will they be able to protect us?"
I should have been there.
Where?
When you got shot.
I wish I was there.
Maybe I could've... protected you.
You see, all those people want... is someone to keep them from what they're afraid to know.
And what are the president and First Lady doing tonight, Francis?
Well, I believe Thomas is waiting for you.
Thank you, sir.
I'll see you in the morning.
Do you have a smoke?
Thank you.
♪ I know what my people are thinking tonight ♪
♪ As home through the shadows they wander ♪
♪ Everyone smiling in secret delight ♪
♪ As they stare at the castle and ponder ♪
♪ And whenever the wind blows this way ♪
♪ You can almost hear everyone say ♪
♪ I wonder what the king Is doing tonight ♪
I've been looking for you.
I got hungry.
So I went down to the main kitchen.
That's a lovely group of people you have down there.
If there's anything you need, it can be brought up.
I didn't know what I needed until I was eating it.
I heard the president's declaration.
Very compelling.
What did you really think?
It was almost like the real thing.
The NSA has good people.
Very good.
- Too good.
- Not as good as you.
Good enough to find my algorithms.
That doesn't mean they knew what we were using them for.
No, no.
One second, they send me home, and then the next, they tell me, "Come back!"
- They'll been watching me.
This is a trap.
- Or the only way out.
God damn it.
- You want out?
- Don't you?
LeAnn... we have done some illegal things here.
There are other campaigns.
- If you can get into the NSA...
- That's not possible.
Into their system, you can fix this.
- You're not listening to me.
- I am.
I know the Underwoods.
The only way that we are gonna survive this... is if they win.
You can help them win.
I know you can.
I got on the paper right around the time you left.
Did you start in Style?
Metro desk.
But then I did this piece, a street fashion, kids on the street thing.
I'm surprised you asked for me.
Some people are being moved around and off the team.
The Masterson story.
"War, what is it good for?"
Were you ever interested in investigative journalism?
If you ask me, if it's not investigating, it's not journalism.
Word around here is you can get anybody to talk to you.
After 8:00, with a drink in their hands... yeah.
She's the one they say you called a... you know.
I'm sorry.
I'm a little nervous.
You're sort of a legend and...
articles on the president?
It'd be an honor to work with you in any capacity.
To be part of this.
Did you find him?
Did you?
It'll only be another moment.
Because I've done all I can.
Everything you told me to.
You know that.
They know that, don't they?
Mrs. Underwood.
I was hoping to speak to Ms. Masterson.
Just the two of us.
Is there a problem?
It is a bit extreme.
Expanding the no-fly list to this extent.
The restrictions on visas alone is unprecedented.
How do we justify?
The White House counsel's been all through that.
It's there in black and white.
We're virtually closing down our borders
- without any hard evidence to back it up.
- It's coming.
A lot of innocent people are trying to get into this country.
They could be hurt by this.
A change in policy this big, I want it done right.
I want you to let the world know that if they want to continue coming to this country for our hospitals, our colleges, our golf courses and God knows what else... they're going to have to deliver more than my head on the end of a burning stick.
Now look, Cathy, I know you have well-earned relationships out there.
Long-standing.
I'm not holding back, Francis.
I have reached out.
Then I need you to reach further.
I want actionable intelligence.
I want to know where ICO is, or at the very least, that everyone's out there looking.
Are we clear?
We're clear.
Thank you, Cathy.
I know you won't let me down.
He's dead.
- Is that why you're here?
- We're still looking for him...
Because if he's dead, I want to see him.
To touch him.
I'm trying to help...
- Ms. Masterson, please.
- But he hasn't contacted me.
- I wish he would.
- I understand.
Calm down.
He's not a monster like they all say.
- I lost him somewhere.
- But he's not...
But still, monsters do exist, don't they?
I want my lawyer.
What for?
I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that.
I don't know why I say anything anymore.
I wanted to see you... to ask you a simple question.
Didn't you know what was going on in your home?
- Excuse me?
- You knew... even before he went to Pakistan.
- I mean, you raised him.
- No.
No.
He had some problems.
He got lost.
- But no, nothing like this.
- But you saw what he did, didn't you?
- No.
- Would you like to see it?
We can show it to you, if you like.
No.
Please don't.
What he did to that family, to that man...
What sort of person would do such a thing?
He's my son.
Oh, God.
I know.
It's awful, isn't it?
Thank you.
When you leave today, there will be some reporters, some cameramen out there.
But you don't need to say very much.
You just need to ask Josh to turn himself in.
There are so many hardworking mothers and fathers out there.
This could've happened to any of them.
We are close to capturing your son, Ms. Masterson, and I will do my best to have you see him.
I want to go.
No one's keeping you.
But who did she put in?
Who did the Speaker put on the committee?
Mostly lifers, with secure seats.
We're two weeks out.
It's hard to say no to war.
You and I have some things in common.
- We both dislike the president.
- No.
I'm still a Democrat.
Who leans to the right.
Alex, you do actually lean a little to the right.
Look, he's the commander in chief.
He's got all the authority he needs to fight them where they are.
Well, there's one here.
Out there, right now, as we speak.
Well, I'm a big fan of American law enforcement.
They'll find him soon enough.
We can't just let Francis Underwood turn us into a nation that's always looking over their shoulder.
If you can get yourself onto that committee,
I got a feeling the Chair will give you all the time you need.
My driver will take you back to your car.
But, Congressman... this is your chance.
And I think you know it.
Thank you so much for coming out here.
Thank you so much for coming out.
Great to see you.
Thanks for coming out.
Just go away!
You have no idea what is happening in your own homes.
Have you any idea where he is, Mrs. Masterson?
Josh, please... please, please turn yourself in.
This has all got to stop.
No, no.
this after ten years with Treasury, he was waiting for it.
Yeah...
Mrs. Underwood!
Mrs. Underwood!
Does the administration believe that the explosion was connected
- with Joshua Masterson somehow?
- We're not sure yet.
Uh, there is strong evidence to suggest.
The owner of the establishment was foreign-born.
Any connection to ICO overseas?
I think our Deputy Director Clark here is better equipped to answer that.
We're looking into it.
In the meantime, we've set up a hotline.
- If anyone in the community has any...
- And if the Republican candidate and the rest of his party refuse to acknowledge the seriousness of the threat made here at home... know that we will.
The FBI is currently gathering a list of words and images.
If they appear on your children's or your coworkers' devices, please...
War whore!
- Move!
- Car!
It was just paint.
She's all right.
And what else?
Spit it out, Doug.
It won't taste so bad.
Sir, I know you disagree with me on this.
But Director Green and his team have a location for the takedown and they're ready to act.
And they're positive it's the right location?
- Adamant.
- When?
Hours.
We can coordinate out of the Situation Room.
Oh, no.
I'm gonna meet him in person.
Sir, I strongly advise against that.
Duly noted, but I'll be on-site.
Yes, sir.
It's amazing how ready people are to be afraid.
History would prove them right.
You're lucky this is coming off with water.
Could've been worse.
Some found its way behind your ear.
- Should I be afraid?
- Don't be smart.
I should, shouldn't I?
I stole something from you.
What?
What it is, doesn't matter.
I just wanted something that was yours.
Well, put it back.
Waterfalls.
The NSA marked their zero-day exploits as waterfalls.
What can they get us into?
We can backdoor into some very popular social media.
I can insert anything your imagination can think of into those sites.
Underwoods or otherwise.
...reports coming in from a variety of sources stating that local police enforcement and FBI agents are currently on the ground.
We're receiving reports that there's a great deal of police activity on the Virginia border.
We cannot confirm at this time, but we believe this is connected to the manhunt for domestic terrorist Joshua Masterson.
The capture of Joshua Masterson may be close at hand.
The FBI is still not commenting, but if you look at this aerial view, you can see heavily-armed men making their way through this wooded area.
Sir, he's not here.
All we have are some loose domestic connections.
A perverse idolization of ICO overseas.
He refuses to confirm any wide-ranging homegrown network.
Our interrogators are confident the asset is no longer valuable.
And risk to reward no longer tenable.
Sir, we have reached a breaking point.
Did you think I didn't already have him?
That I would have left him out there somewhere?
And I thought you knew me.
Josh.
Joshua.
Do you want to live?
Tell us what we want.
Tell us what we want to hear.
You're no martyr, are you?
Look at you.
No, you're not a martyr.
No one will remember what you've done, either here on Earth or in your heaven.
So why did you pick the Millers?
Why?
What did you see?
Was it the girl?
Did you see her first?
What did you see?
Or did she see you first?
Yeah, that's it, isn't it?
She saw you.
She looked right through you, didn't she?
I don't need to see this person anymore.
- Get rid of the asset.
- Sir.
He's an animal, but he's still an American citizen.
We are at war.
And he is an enemy combatant.
And he lost whatever rights he might have had as an American when he cut that poor man's head off.
So don't give me your pride or your position.
Because none of this would have happened if you'd done what you were told in the first place.
I'll take care of it.
Yes, you will, and you will do so willingly.
And I want you to get some good, usable footage... of his killing.
And then destroy everything else.
We will be releasing footage of Joshua Masterson's killing.
The administration and the intelligence community were hoping to take him alive.
But I would like to commend
Assistant Director of Counterterrorism, Nathan Green.
And of course all of the work that Secretary Durant has done behind the scenes on all of this.
The information the investigation has gathered so far points to Joshua Masterson and Zachary Hawthorne having strong connections to ICO abroad and ICO's growing network domestically.
And so I would like to say this to ICO directly.
You will not infect the mind of one more of our young people, because I will not stop until I find you.
And I say that for the grieving Miller family, whom I hope will find some sleep tonight.
I also urge Congress to accelerate the process and vote on my request for a declaration of war.
- Mr. President?
- I will not be answering questions.
Seth will take it from here.
It's hard to see, but I think that was the killshot.
Now, please remember, these reports are unconfirmed and we're waiting on a statement from the White House.
- What we can report is a great deal...
- Why are you watching this?
This wooded area.
And shots being fired, both by and...
Hello?
Hello.
This is Francis Underwood.
It's him.
The committee is looking for Remy Danton and Jackie Sharp.
What do either of them have to do with ICO or the war?
The talk up on the Hill is they're going to invite you and the rest of your staff to testify.
They're gonna use the Declaration of War to investigate.
That's right.
They're gonna use the committee Frank asked for to investigate him.
- Fuck.
- That's right, Doug.
"Fuck."
It's difficult to underst...
Well, perhaps if you could just calm down for a moment.
Please stop it.
I thought this news would bring you some relief.
The president called Mrs. Miller.
I promised you and your daughter that I would...
Leave her alone.
Well, perhaps we should speak when you're feeling a little more up to it.
I don't want to hear you.
Or from you.
- What you did to my family...
- What?
Leave us out of it.
And do not use my husband's name.
Listen, Mrs....
She hung up.
Let's go for a walk.
Mr. President!
Tell them what they need to know.
Mr. President!
Hello.
Mr. President.
Thank you, thank you.
Hello.
You have nothing to be afraid of.
You have nothing to be afraid of.
You have nothing to be afraid of.
I've been meaning to talk with you.
It's terrifying, isn't it?
The president and I have a simple request.
Tell us what you see.
If anything in your environment strikes you as a bit odd, a bit off, pick up the phone.
Whether it's a package or a person that seems out of place, we'd love you to let us know.
Because there's a lot of noise out there these days.
A noisy press that's choosing to dwell on the past instead of what's happening right now.
My husband and I want to protect you.
In two weeks' time, you will be heading to the ballot box to decide what kind of country you want to live in.
It's a profound choice.
But no matter who wins this election, we're going to need to work together, watch out for each other, and, yes, watch each other, to keep us all safe and sound.
Tell us what you see.
My name is Claire Underwood, and I approve this message.
[indistinct chatter]
Should we do one more?
[Frank] Did the Democrats show?
[Doug] They didn't disappoint.
Almost every member, sir.
- [Frank] Almost.
- I have a list of those who did.
My fellow congressmen, I do not need the Washington Herald to tell me that a scoundrel lives in the White House.
I can see the Democrats are here.
They're eager to debate.
I say to the gentlemen on the other side of the aisle...
- thank you.
- [Frank] Go.
[congressman 1] Should we investigate the president for crimes committed while he was vice president?
- [Congress murmuring]
- I say, yes.
Let's debate.
Let's debate this miscreant all day and all night.
[indistinct chatter] [congressman 2] Madam Speaker.
Parliamentary inquiry.
[McCarthy] The gentleman from Georgia may state the nature of his parliamentary inquiry.
[congressman 2] Do the rules of the House not require the president be formally invited in order to attend?
[congressman 3] Madam Speaker, if I may...
The Speaker recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.
The president is wearing his congressional pin today and is thereby welcome to any and all proceedings.
[congressman 2] Madam Speaker!
Madam Speaker!
- [clamoring] - [gavel banging]
Rules of the House state that former members are not allowed on the floor when they have interest in the matter under debate.
Madam Speaker, the president has no interest or opinion on the matter being debated today.
- [clamoring] - [gavel banging]
[McCarthy] The House suspend.
The House will suspend.
Madam Speaker, I still do have the floor, and I find it hard to believe the president wouldn't have an opinion on the matter being discussed.
If the good gentleman from Florida would yield a portion of his time,
- I assure him it will satisfy his query.
- [clamoring]
I yield three minutes to the leader.
And I yield my time to the former congressman from South Carolina and the President of the United States.
- [cheering and applauding] - [gavel banging]
Point of order!
Parliamentary inquiry!
Parliamentary inquiry!
- Parliamentary inquiry!
- [gavel banging]
Mr. President.
This is beyond the norm.
I don't care.
I don't care.
And I also do not care about your investigative committees.
- [clamoring]
- No, that is not what I care about today.
- [gavel banging] - [McCarthy] The House will cease.
That is not what I care about today.
I am on my way to the funeral of an American patriot.
[congressman 4 groaning]
A good man, a husband... a father... who was beheaded on American soil.
And this chamber chooses to debate me?
[cheering]
- [McCarthy] The House will suspend.
- I asked to speak to a full session of this chamber and my requests were denied.
- Madam Speaker!
- Mr. President, you must yield the floor.
- I will not yield, Madam Speaker.
- [all cheering]
- Because I cannot wait.
- [applauding] [gavel banging]
One of the murderers...
One of the murderers who killed Mr. Jim Miller... is still out there.
At large.
How much more proof do you people need?
[cheering]
I demand that every member of this House take a stand.
Like FDR before, and Wilson before him.
I demand that this Congress declare a formal declaration of war against ICO, both here and abroad.
[congressman 1] Motion to adjourn.
- [congressman 2] Second!
- The House will adjourn.
- The president will cease.
- [Frank] I will not cease!
I will never cease.
I demand that this Congress declare a state of war has existed and does exist between ICO and the United States of America.
And I demand that every member of this House stay in this chamber for as long as it takes, until you bring my request to a vote.
Or you will all go down in history as cowards!
Cowards!
The sergeant at arms will remove the president.
Madam Speaker, I repeat.
I demand a vote.
I will not yield.
I will not yield.
- I will not yield.
- [gavel bangs]
[theme music playing]
Alleged terrorist Zachary Hawthorne was killed by the FBI, but Joshua Masterson is still at large.
While the Miller family mourns, the hunt for the missing terrorist continues and tensions are running high.
The president may be asking for war, but it seems war's already been declared on him.
[chanting in Arabic]
My fans.
FBI is looking into a multiple shooting in Chattanooga.
- Reports have it gang related.
- No.
A private plane went down in West Virginia.
Mechanical failure.
A series of homes were set on fire in Georgia, most likely arson.
Uh... convenience store in North Carolina exploded at about 4:00 in the morning.
- Where's the store?
- Uh, suburb outside of Raleigh.
The cause is still under investigation.
- I'll make an appearance.
- Yes, ma'am.
Just put it on the schedule so the media has time to mobilize.
Yes, ma'am.
I take it the president has declared war on Joshua Masterson.
He never should've kicked me off that call.
But this morning isn't about politics.
[sighs] That's right.
We need to show some compassion for the living.
[Conway] And respect for the dead.
[Doug] The family's agreed to a moment.
No press, no speeches, but we should be able to pull something.
- Mr. President.
- Governor.
Do they not realize what we've done for them already?
I pointed that out, sir, but... the daughter's medicated and very fragile at the moment.
All right.
[Frank] Mrs. Miller.
- I'm so very sorry.
- Thank you.
And I promise you,
I will not stop until everyone responsible for this terrible tragedy is brought to justice.
And I swear to you, as God is my witness... no one will ever harm you or your family ever again.
The nation mourns with you and your daughter, Mrs. Miller.
- Thank you.
If you don't mind...
- Of course.
[Conway] Mr. President.
I'll be right along.
It's a busy day for you today, sir.
It's a sad, sad day.
It's a shame things didn't turn out differently.
Yes.
Well, some things are bigger than the two of us, Will.
[Melissa] I don't want him here!
Calm down, Melissa.
Please.
It's his fault.
He's dead.
- Daddy's dead.
He killed him.
- Please.
- [knocking on door]
- Give me a minute.
- Did you take your medicine?
- Yes.
Okay?
Yes.
Yes!
You do.
You think about what you would say on a day like today.
If a day like today were to happen.
[sniffles] But you let it pass... because you know you have so much more left ahead of you.
[inhales sharply]
So much to do together.
[sniffles] You think...
You think 40 minutes... [sniffles]
- If we were late 40 minutes...
- [Claire crying]
Or two, or one...
Or if we went somewhere else to eat... [inhales deeply] [exhales deeply]
But to dwell in the past, to live in what-ifs...
That wasn't my husband.
That wasn't us...
- Honey...
- Please.
Okay.
Come on.
[sniffles]
I need to... [exhales]
I wanted to say about my father... [sighs]
He was so strong... so brave.
My father was taking us to...
My father...
- Come on, baby.
It's okay.
- My father...
You killed my father.
You're the reason he died.
[gasps] Melissa... [sniffles]
- It's all right, Melissa.
We understand.
- [shutters click] [whispers] I hope you die and she becomes president.
What did the girl say to you?
She said she hopes I die and that you become the president.
Mr. Macallan, this is Deputy Director Michaels from the NSA.
I'm literally in your office.
I believe we had a meeting.
[Doug] There's been raids as far up as New York and down to the panhandle.
As of now,
Green's focusing in on the border between Virginia and North Carolina.
Seth has a statement ready for this afternoon.
No.
The best statement is no statement.
Besides, I want Claire to be the voice on this until we're ready.
Yes, sir.
- Quite a crowd out there.
- Well, we better bring Birch in first.
Yes, sir.
- [door opens]
- Congressman Birch.
Bob.
Well, that was a little bit of history this morning, wasn't it?
- It certainly was.
- I couldn't see it any other way.
No disagreement from here.
Well, you know how the Republicans are.
Anything but a decision.
They mistake complaint for leadership.
Well, instead of a committee to investigate you, you got one to discuss your declaration.
All the way to election day.
Even if there's only a handful of Republicans with the grit and spit to put up a fight, we can control the conversation.
Get them talking about anything but that goddamn article.
All right.
Now, who from our side
- do we need to massage?
- Womack.
The declaration caught him off guard.
Had to keep him out of it.
It's his constituents that actually fight the damn thing.
Well, let's call in the honorable gentleman from Missouri.
- Oh, he's a bourbon man, isn't he?
- [Doug] Yes, he is.
- A stunt.
Yes, I'm calling it a stunt.
- [Claire] Charlie, if I may...
Tom, please, what are you implying?
This request for a declaration of war is yet another distraction.
And I've never been prouder of the president than I am today.
I'm not denying what happened to the Millers.
It was a tragedy.
[Claire] No, but you are.
Because denying it is the tragedy.
[inhales] This is a pattern.
Your husband's administration, Mrs. Underwood,
- continues to operate in the shadows.
- Tom...
I understand you believe in the importance of your article.
And I agreed to come here today and talk with you about it.
But we're fighting to keep this country safe.
Mrs. Underwood, the White House has yet to release one piece of information about the attempted capture of those domestic terrorists.
ICO terrorists, yes.
Reports from a few hours ago are saying North Carolina or Virginia.
But that's all we have.
Well, we are circling in, we're getting closer.
[stutters] I will tell you, our intelligence community, they are the real heroes.
Charlie, if we could get back to my point, my sources confirmed...
[Claire] Tom.
Heather Dunbar, no friend of mine or my husband's, looked into these charges, and cleared the president.
Cleared?
Please.
The White House has not had a single press briefing since the Herald ran my article.
You keep saying the White House isn't speaking about this.
I am sitting right here talking to you.
Not Remy Danton or Jackie Sharp.
Or Lucas Goodwin, either.
- [mouthing] What?
- [Rose] Excuse me.
Lucas Goodwin, meaning?
I'm saying, me.
I'm here.
And I don't know how many more times we have to go over this.
You know, a Tom Hammerschmidt article used to be the first thing I would look for when I opened the Washington Herald.
[Marshall] The Underwoods are no longer campaigning.
- [scoffs] - [Conway] They can call it what they want.
Well, if you think about the last few days, what's in the air...
It might not be such a bad idea for us to take it one handshake at a time.
Or call it for what it is.
"Home and abroad."
The president is essentially asking for permission
- to fight a war on our soil.
- We can't push back too hard.
We can't afford to look soft on terror.
[Brockhart] We can't look the other way, either.
You of all people know where this kind of talk leads.
[Frank on TV] ...
ICO and the United States of America.
Make sure the committee dealing with the declaration of war never gets to a vote.
We're not against war, we're against his.
And I want you to reach out to the Speaker and find out who she's putting on that committee.
We need to get back to the president's crimes.
That's the story.
It's the only story.
Anything else?
I have my script.
[Frank on TV] I will not yield!
I will not...
Harry...
I want to know what he says and when he says it.
Our general isn't used to taking orders.
Will, one more thing.
- What?
- Your wife.
Okay, I know we opened up this campaign on Pollyhop, but it might be time to close it down... or at least be more careful.
Well, what did they find out?
The home of the mother of the terrorist, you know, the one they're looking for, was vandalized last night.
Garage set on fire.
Broken windows.
And, uh, Hannah... well... she posted.
She was defending the mother online.
- When?
- This afternoon.
The timing is not good on this.
- I can show you.
- Not now.
[scattered applause]
[Brockhart] Thank you.
Governor Conway and I are honored to be here with the Miller family and their closest friends.
I know the VFW was a big part of Jim's life here in Knoxville.
With the help of Homeland and our hotline, we think that Masterson has crossed into the southwest corner of Virginia.
Scott or Washington.
- [Doug] And?
- And...
Assistant Director Green?
We're relying on aerial support, sightings and local law enforcement.
But we're fairly confident we can have him pinned down in the next 24 hours.
The president wants us to be absolutely sure.
We can't have him getting away again.
Careers are at stake.
Everyone around this table is fully aware of the gravity of the situation.
Good.
The president will be happy to hear that.
[Hannah softly] Okay.
What kind of kiss do you want?
- [Charlie whispers] Eskimo.
- In... and out.
I'll be right back.
- You're angry.
- I am.
[sighs] I was asked a question and I answered.
That's the least of it.
Okay, well, I don't want to talk about it right now.
Are you trying to lose this election?
Are you?
Oh, Will, stop it.
This woman that you're defending...
Her son just cut someone's head off.
And he's still out there somewhere.
- Do you understand what this looks like?
- Stop it.
Do you want to know why our son can't sleep?
He's eight years old, and he can't sleep.
Because he's having nightmares.
Because he thinks there's a big black dog running around the hotel.
- Dog?
- Yes.
He closes his eyes, and he can hear it growling.
He's scared, Will.
I said what I said because that woman is a victim.
We all are.
And it has to stop.
I want you to win.
Get yourself a drink.
I'll be right back.
[sighs]
[LeAnn] That's the mother.
And this is Hannah's response.
She's not a criminal and should not be punished for the sins of her son.
We all, I know, reject the rhetoric and actions of these damaged, troubled young men.
What I mean is, this is a time for reflection, not aggression...
So she's not condoning it, but it is sympathetic.
Plays into the idea that Joshua and Zachary were just a pair of troubled kids looking for a cause, no different than some school shooter.
The post has been shared over 100,000 times.
I want to talk with her.
- Hannah?
- The mother.
[inhales] We've been very careful about where you appear.
- LeAnn, will you excuse us for a moment?
- Of course.
[door opens]
- [door closes]
- We need to dial up the terror.
And the mother can help us with that.
But that also means we have to locate Masterson.
Soon.
Tom is waiting for me.
Well, you go on.
Francis...
I shouldn't have cried at the funeral.
- No, it played beautifully.
- Not for me.
Come with me.
Come on.
Just tell him you'll be late.
- Mr. President.
- It's all right, Officer.
Ma'am.
May I have your scope?
Scope on your gun.
I promise I'll give it back.
Thank you.
Come here.
Now, if you just hold the scope a little a ways from your face... and look down, straight down, across the lawn... right to the gate.
- You see them?
- Hmm.
[Frank] Those people want a voice.
Some for, some against.
And they're looking back across the lawn, toward this house and these windows... and they're thinking,
"I wonder what the president and the First Lady are doing tonight.
And will they be able to protect us?"
I should have been there.
Where?
When you got shot.
I wish I was there.
Maybe I could've... protected you.
You see, all those people want... is someone to keep them from what they're afraid to know.
And what are the president and First Lady doing tonight, Francis?
Well, I believe Thomas is waiting for you.
[officer] Thank you, sir.
[Frank] I'll see you in the morning.
[whispers] Do you have a smoke?
[Frank] Thank you.
[singing] ♪ I know what my people are thinking tonight ♪
♪ As home through the shadows they wander ♪
♪ Everyone smiling in secret delight ♪
♪ As they stare at the castle and ponder ♪
♪ And whenever the wind blows this way ♪
♪ You can almost hear everyone say ♪
♪ I wonder what the king Is doing tonight ♪
I've been looking for you.
I got hungry.
So I went down to the main kitchen.
That's a lovely group of people you have down there.
If there's anything you need, it can be brought up.
I didn't know what I needed until I was eating it.
I heard the president's declaration.
Very compelling.
What did you really think?
It was almost like the real thing.
[sighs] The NSA has good people.
Very good.
- Too good.
- Not as good as you.
Good enough to find my algorithms.
That doesn't mean they knew what we were using them for.
No, no.
One second, they send me home, and then the next, they tell me, "Come back!"
- They'll been watching me.
This is a trap.
- Or the only way out.
God damn it.
- You want out?
- Don't you?
LeAnn... we have done some illegal things here.
There are other campaigns.
- If you can get into the NSA...
- That's not possible.
Into their system, you can fix this.
- You're not listening to me.
- I am.
I know the Underwoods.
The only way that we are gonna survive this... is if they win.
- You can help them win.
- [sighs]
I know you can.
I got on the paper right around the time you left.
[Tom] Did you start in Style?
Metro desk.
But then I did this piece, a street fashion, kids on the street thing.
- I'm surprised you asked for me.
- [inhales deeply]
Some people are being moved around and off the team.
The Masterson story.
"War, what is it good for?"
[chuckles]
Were you ever interested in investigative journalism?
If you ask me, if it's not investigating, it's not journalism.
Word around here is you can get anybody to talk to you.
After 8:00, with a drink in their hands... yeah.
[inhales deeply]
She's the one they say you called a... you know.
I'm sorry.
I'm a little nervous.
[stutters] You're sort of a legend and... articles on the president?
It'd be an honor to work with you in any capacity.
To be part of this.
Did you find him?
Did you?
It'll only be another moment.
Because I've done all I can.
Everything you told me to.
You know that.
They know that, don't they?
Mrs. Underwood.
[Claire] I was hoping to speak to Ms. Masterson.
Just the two of us.
[whispers inaudibly]
Is there a problem?
It is a bit extreme.
Expanding the no-fly list to this extent.
The restrictions on visas alone is unprecedented.
How do we justify?
The White House counsel's been all through that.
It's there in black and white.
We're virtually closing down our borders
- without any hard evidence to back it up.
- It's coming.
A lot of innocent people are trying to get into this country.
They could be hurt by this.
A change in policy this big, I want it done right.
[inhales] I want you to let the world know that if they want to continue coming to this country for our hospitals, our colleges, our golf courses and God knows what else... they're going to have to deliver more than my head on the end of a burning stick.
Now look, Cathy, I know you have well-earned relationships out there.
Long-standing.
I'm not holding back, Francis.
I have reached out.
Then I need you to reach further.
I want actionable intelligence.
I want to know where ICO is, or at the very least, that everyone's out there looking.
Are we clear?
We're clear.
Thank you, Cathy.
I know you won't let me down.
He's dead.
- Is that why you're here?
- We're still looking for him...
Because if he's dead, I want to see him.
To touch him.
I'm trying to help...
- Ms. Masterson, please.
- But he hasn't contacted me.
- [stutters] I wish he would.
- I understand.
Calm down.
[sighs]
He's not a monster like they all say.
I lost him somewhere.
But he's not... [inhales]
But still, monsters do exist, don't they?
I want my lawyer.
What for?
I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that.
[chuckles nervously] I don't know why I say anything anymore.
I wanted to see you... to ask you a simple question.
Didn't you know what was going on in your home?
- Excuse me?
- You knew... even before he went to Pakistan.
- I mean, you raised him.
- No.
No.
He had some problems.
He got lost.
- But no, nothing like this.
- But you saw what he did, didn't you?
- No.
- Would you like to see it?
We can show it to you, if you like.
No.
Please don't.
[inhales deeply]
What he did to that family, to that man...
What sort of person would do such a thing?
[crying] He's my son.
[sniffling] [sobbing] Oh, God.
I know.
It's awful, isn't it?
[breathing shakily] Thank you.
When you leave today, there will be some reporters, some cameramen out there.
But you don't need to say very much.
You just need to ask Josh to turn himself in.
There are so many hardworking mothers and fathers out there.
This could've happened to any of them.
We are close to capturing your son, Ms. Masterson, and I will do my best to have you see him.
[breathing shakily]
I want to go.
No one's keeping you.
But who did she put in?
Who did the Speaker put on the committee?
Mostly lifers, with secure seats.
We're two weeks out.
It's hard to say no to war.
[breathes deeply]
You and I have some things in common.
- We both dislike the president.
- No.
I'm still a Democrat.
[chuckles] Who leans to the right.
Alex, you do actually lean a little to the right.
Look, he's the commander in chief.
He's got all the authority he needs to fight them where they are.
Well, there's one here.
Out there, right now, as we speak.
Well, I'm a big fan of American law enforcement.
They'll find him soon enough.
We can't just let Francis Underwood turn us into a nation that's always looking over their shoulder.
If you can get yourself onto that committee,
I got a feeling the Chair will give you all the time you need.
My driver will take you back to your car.
But, Congressman... this is your chance.
And I think you know it.
[crowd cheering]
Thank you so much for coming out here.
Thank you so much for coming out.
- Great to see you.
Thanks for coming out.
- [cheering]
[reporters clamoring]
[Roseanne] Just go away!
You have no idea what is happening in your own homes.
[reporter] Have you any idea where he is, Mrs. Masterson?
Josh, please... please, please turn yourself in.
- This has all got to stop.
No, no.
- [reporters clamoring]
- [keypad beeps] - [door unlocks]
[indistinct chatter]
[keypad beeps] [sighs]
[keypad beeps and buzzes]
- [buzzing] - [scoffs]
[indistinct chatter in distance]
this after ten years with Treasury, he was waiting for it.
[man sighs] Yeah... [sighs heavily]
[mouse clicks]
[exhales heavily]
[sighs]
[reporters clamoring]
- [all clamoring]
- Mrs. Underwood!
Mrs. Underwood!
Does the administration believe that the explosion was connected
- with Joshua Masterson somehow?
- We're not sure yet.
Uh, there is strong evidence to suggest.
The owner of the establishment was foreign-born.
Any connection to ICO overseas?
I think our Deputy Director Clark here is better equipped to answer that.
We're looking into it.
In the meantime, we've set up a hotline.
- If anyone in the community has any...
- And if the Republican candidate and the rest of his party refuse to acknowledge the seriousness of the threat made here at home... know that we will.
The FBI is currently gathering a list of words and images.
If they appear on your children's or your coworkers' devices, please...
- [man] War whore!
- [people gasp]
- [officer 1] Move!
- [officer 2] Car!
- [agents clamoring] - [camera shutters clicking] [breathing heavily]
[Doug] It was just paint.
She's all right.
And what else?
Spit it out, Doug.
It won't taste so bad.
Sir, I know you disagree with me on this.
But Director Green and his team have a location for the takedown and they're ready to act.
And they're positive it's the right location?
- Adamant.
- When?
Hours.
We can coordinate out of the Situation Room.
Oh, no.
I'm gonna meet him in person.
Sir, I strongly advise against that.
Duly noted, but I'll be on-site.
Yes, sir.
[door closes]
It's amazing how ready people are to be afraid.
History would prove them right.
[sirens blaring in distance]
You're lucky this is coming off with water.
Could've been worse.
Some found its way behind your ear.
- Should I be afraid?
- Don't be smart.
I should, shouldn't I?
I stole something from you.
What?
What it is, doesn't matter.
I just wanted something that was yours.
Well, put it back.
Waterfalls.
The NSA marked their zero-day exploits as waterfalls.
What can they get us into?
We can backdoor into some very popular social media.
I can insert anything your imagination can think of into those sites.
Underwoods or otherwise.
[reporter on laptop] ...reports coming in from a variety of sources stating that local police enforcement and FBI agents are currently on the ground.
We're receiving reports that there's a great deal of police activity on the Virginia border.
We cannot confirm at this time, but we believe this is connected to the manhunt for domestic terrorist Joshua Masterson.
The capture of Joshua Masterson may be close at hand.
The FBI is still not commenting, but if you look at this aerial view, you can see heavily-armed men making their way through this wooded area.
[indistinct radio chatter]
[FBI agent] Sir, he's not here.
All we have are some loose domestic connections.
A perverse idolization of ICO overseas.
He refuses to confirm any wide-ranging homegrown network.
Our interrogators are confident the asset is no longer valuable.
And risk to reward no longer tenable.
Sir, we have reached a breaking point.
Did you think I didn't already have him?
That I would have left him out there somewhere?
And I thought you knew me.
Josh.
Joshua.
Do you want to live?
Tell us what we want.
Tell us what we want to hear.
You're no martyr, are you?
[scoffs] Look at you.
No, you're not a martyr.
No one will remember what you've done, either here on Earth or in your heaven.
[sighs]
So why did you pick the Millers?
Why?
What did you see?
[softly] Was it the girl?
Did you see her first?
What did you see?
Or did she see you first?
Yeah, that's it, isn't it?
She saw you.
- She looked right through you, didn't she?
- [breathing heavily]
I don't need to see this person anymore.
- Get rid of the asset.
- [Green] Sir.
He's an animal, but he's still an American citizen.
[Frank] We are at war.
And he is an enemy combatant.
And he lost whatever rights he might have had as an American when he cut that poor man's head off.
So don't give me your pride or your position.
Because none of this would have happened if you'd done what you were told in the first place.
I'll take care of it.
Yes, you will, and you will do so willingly.
And I want you to get some good, usable footage... of his killing.
And then destroy everything else.
[Frank] We will be releasing footage of Joshua Masterson's killing.
The administration and the intelligence community were hoping to take him alive.
But I would like to commend
Assistant Director of Counterterrorism, Nathan Green.
And of course all of the work that Secretary Durant has done behind the scenes on all of this.
The information the investigation has gathered so far points to Joshua Masterson and Zachary Hawthorne having strong connections to ICO abroad and ICO's growing network domestically.
And so I would like to say this to ICO directly.
You will not infect the mind of one more of our young people, because I will not stop until I find you.
And I say that for the grieving Miller family, whom I hope will find some sleep tonight.
I also urge Congress to accelerate the process and vote on my request for a declaration of war.
- [reporters] Mr. President?
- I will not be answering questions.
Seth will take it from here.
- [reporters clamoring] - [Seth clears throat]
[phone ringing]
- [reporter speaking indistinctly on TV] - [gunshots on TV] [reporter] It's hard to see, but I think that was the killshot.
Now, please remember, these reports are unconfirmed and we're waiting on a statement from the White House.
- What we can report is a great deal...
- Why are you watching this?
This wooded area.
And shots being fired, both by and...
Hello?
[Frank] Hello.
This is Francis Underwood.
It's him.
The committee is looking for Remy Danton and Jackie Sharp.
What do either of them have to do with ICO or the war?
The talk up on the Hill is they're going to invite you and the rest of your staff to testify.
They're gonna use the Declaration of War to investigate.
That's right.
They're gonna use the committee Frank asked for to investigate him.
- Fuck.
- That's right, Doug.
"Fuck."
[Frank] It's difficult to underst...
Well, perhaps if you could just calm down for a moment.
[Caroline] Please stop it.
[Frank] I thought this news would bring you some relief.
The president called Mrs. Miller.
I promised you and your daughter that I would...
Leave her alone.
Well, perhaps we should speak when you're feeling a little more up to it.
I don't want to hear you.
Or from you.
- What you did to my family...
- What?
Leave us out of it.
And do not use my husband's name.
- Listen, Mrs....
- [dial tone]
She hung up.
[sighs]
Let's go for a walk.
- [all clamoring] - [man] Mr. President!
Tell them what they need to know.
[all clamoring]
[man] Mr. President!
[Frank] Hello.
[man] Mr. President.
Thank you, thank you.
[Frank] Hello.
You have nothing to be afraid of.
You have nothing to be afraid of.
You have nothing to be afraid of.
I've been meaning to talk with you.
It's terrifying, isn't it?
The president and I have a simple request.
Tell us what you see.
If anything in your environment strikes you as a bit odd, a bit off, pick up the phone.
Whether it's a package or a person that seems out of place, we'd love you to let us know.
Because there's a lot of noise out there these days.
A noisy press that's choosing to dwell on the past instead of what's happening right now.
My husband and I want to protect you.
In two weeks' time, you will be heading to the ballot box to decide what kind of country you want to live in.
It's a profound choice.
But no matter who wins this election, we're going to need to work together, watch out for each other, and, yes, watch each other, to keep us all safe and sound.
Tell us what you see.
My name is Claire Underwood, and I approve this message.
Should we do one more?
Did the Democrats show?
They didn't disappoint.
Almost every member, sir.
- Almost.
- I have a list of those who did.
My fellow congressmen, I do not need the Washington Herald to tell me that a scoundrel lives in the White House.
I can see the Democrats are here.
They're eager to debate.
I say to the gentlemen on the other side of the aisle...
- thank you.
- Go.
Should we investigate the president for crimes committed while he was vice president?
I say, yes.
Let's debate.
Let's debate this miscreant all day and all night.
Madam Speaker.
Parliamentary inquiry.
The gentleman from Georgia may state the nature of his parliamentary inquiry.
Do the rules of the House not require the president be formally invited in order to attend?
Madam Speaker, if I may...
The Speaker recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.
The president is wearing his congressional pin today and is thereby welcome to any and all proceedings.
Madam Speaker!
Madam Speaker!
Rules of the House state that former members are not allowed on the floor when they have interest in the matter under debate.
Madam Speaker, the president has no interest or opinion on the matter being debated today.
The House suspend.
The House will suspend.
Madam Speaker, I still do have the floor, and I find it hard to believe the president wouldn't have an opinion on the matter being discussed.
If the good gentleman from Florida would yield a portion of his time,
I assure him it will satisfy his query.
I yield three minutes to the leader.
And I yield my time to the former congressman from South Carolina and the President of the United States.
Point of order!
Parliamentary inquiry!
Parliamentary inquiry!
Parliamentary inquiry!
Mr. President.
This is beyond the norm.
I don't care.
I don't care.
And I also do not care about your investigative committees.
No, that is not what I care about today.
The House will cease.
That is not what I care about today.
I am on my way to the funeral of an American patriot.
A good man, a husband... a father...
who was beheaded on American soil.
And this chamber chooses to debate me?
- The House will suspend.
- I asked to speak to a full session of this chamber and my requests were denied.
-Madam Speaker!
-Mr.
President, you must yield the floor.
I will not yield, Madam Speaker.
Because I cannot wait.
One of the murderers...
One of the murderers who killed Mr. Jim Miller... is still out there.
At large.
How much more proof do you people need?
I demand that every member of this House take a stand.
Like FDR before, and Wilson before him.
I demand that this Congress declare a formal declaration of war against ICO, both here and abroad.
Motion to adjourn.
- Second!
- The House will adjourn.
- The president will cease.
- I will not cease!
I will never cease.
I demand that this Congress declare a state of war has existed and does exist between ICO and the United States of America.
And I demand that every member of this House stay in this chamber for as long as it takes, until you bring my request to a vote.
Or you will all go down in history as cowards!
Cowards!
The sergeant at arms will remove the president.
Madam Speaker, I repeat.
I demand a vote.
I will not yield.
I will not yield.
I will not yield.
Alleged terrorist Zachary Hawthorne was killed by the FBI, but Joshua Masterson is still at large.
While the Miller family mourns, the hunt for the missing terrorist continues and tensions are running high.
The president may be asking for war, but it seems war's already been declared on him.
My fans.
FBI is looking into a multiple shooting in Chattanooga.
-Reports have it gang related.
-No.
A private plane went down in West Virginia.
Mechanical failure.
A series of homes were set on fire in Georgia, most likely arson.
Uh... convenience store in North Carolina exploded at about 4:00 in the morning.
-Where's the store?
-Uh, suburb outside of Raleigh.
The cause is still under investigation.
-I'll make an appearance.
-Yes, ma'am.
Just put it on the schedule so the media has time to mobilize.
Yes, ma'am.
I take it the president has declared war on Joshua Masterson.
He never should've kicked me off that call.
But this morning isn't about politics.
That's right.
We need to show some compassion for the living.
And respect for the dead.
The family's agreed to a moment.
No press, no speeches, but we should be able to pull something.
-Mr.
President.
-Governor.
Do they not realize what we've done for them already?
I pointed that out, sir, but... the daughter's medicated and very fragile at the moment.
All right.
Mrs. Miller.
-I'm so very sorry.
-Thank you.
And I promise you,
I will not stop until everyone responsible for this terrible tragedy is brought to justice.
And I swear to you, as God is my witness... no one will ever harm you or your family ever again.
The nation mourns with you and your daughter, Mrs. Miller.
-Thank you.
If you don't mind...
-Of course.
Mr. President.
I'll be right along.
It's a busy day for you today, sir.
It's a sad, sad day.
It's a shame things didn't turn out differently.
Yes.
Well, some things are bigger than the two of us, Will.
I don't want him here!
Calm down, Melissa.
Please.
It's his fault.
He's dead.
-Daddy's dead.
He killed him.
-Please.
Give me a minute.
-Did you take your medicine?
-Yes.
Okay?
Yes.
Yes!
You do.
You think about what you would say on a day like today.
If a day like today were to happen.
But you let it pass... because you know you have so much more left ahead of you.
So much to do together.
You think...
You think 40 minutes...
If we were late 40 minutes...
Or two, or one...
Or if we went somewhere else to eat...
But to dwell in the past, to live in what-ifs...
That wasn't my husband.
That wasn't us...
-Honey...
-Please.
Okay.
Come on.
I need to...
I wanted to say about my father...
He was so strong... so brave.
My father was taking us to...
My father...
-Come on, baby.
It's okay.
-My father...
You killed my father.
You're the reason he died.
Melissa...
It's all right, Melissa.
We understand.
I hope you die and she becomes president.
What did the girl say to you?
She said she hopes I die and that you become the president.
Mr. Macallan, this is Deputy Director Michaels from the NSA.
I'm literally in your office.
I believe we had a meeting.
There's been raids as far up as New York and down to the panhandle.
As of now,
Green's focusing in on the border between Virginia and North Carolina.
Seth has a statement ready for this afternoon.
No.
The best statement is no statement.
Besides, I want Claire to be the voice on this until we're ready.
Yes, sir.
-Quite a crowd out there.
-Well, we better bring Birch in first.
Yes, sir.
Congressman Birch.
Bob.
Well, that was a little bit of history this morning, wasn't it?
-It certainly was.
-I couldn't see it any other way.
No disagreement from here.
Well, you know how the Republicans are.
Anything but a decision.
They mistake complaint for leadership.
Well, instead of a committee to investigate you, you got one to discuss your declaration.
All the way to election day.
Even if there's only a handful of Republicans with the grit and spit to put up a fight, we can control the conversation.
Get them talking about anything but that goddamn article.
All right.
Now, who from our side
-do we need to massage?
-Womack.
The declaration caught him off guard.
Had to keep him out of it.
It's his constituents that actually fight the damn thing.
Well, let's call in the honorable gentleman from Missouri.
- Oh, he's a bourbon man, isn't he?
- Yes, he is.
- A stunt.
Yes, I'm calling it a stunt.
- Charlie, if I may...
Tom, please, what are you implying?
This request for a declaration of war is yet another distraction.
And I've never been prouder of the president than I am today.
I'm not denying what happened to the Millers.
It was a tragedy.
No, but you are.
Because denying it is the tragedy.
This is a pattern.
Your husband's administration, Mrs. Underwood,
-continues to operate in the shadows.
-Tom...
I understand you believe in the importance of your article.
And I agreed to come here today and talk with you about it.
But we're fighting to keep this country safe.
Mrs. Underwood, the White House has yet to release one piece of information about the attempted capture of those domestic terrorists.
ICO terrorists, yes.
Reports from a few hours ago are saying North Carolina or Virginia.
But that's all we have.
Well, we are circling in, we're getting closer.
I will tell you, our intelligence community, they are the real heroes.
Charlie, if we could get back to my point, my sources confirmed--
Tom.
Heather Dunbar, no friend of mine or my husband's, looked into these charges, and cleared the president.
Cleared?
Please.
The White House has not had a single press briefing since the Herald ran my article.
You keep saying the White House isn't speaking about this.
I am sitting right here talking to you.
Not Remy Danton or Jackie Sharp.
Or Lucas Goodwin, either.
- What?
- Excuse me.
Lucas Goodwin, meaning?
I'm saying, me.
I'm here.
And I don't know how many more times we have to go over this.
You know, a Tom Hammerschmidt article used to be the first thing I would look for when I opened the Washington Herald.
The Underwoods are no longer campaigning.
They can call it what they want.
Well, if you think about the last few days, what's in the air...
It might not be such a bad idea for us to take it one handshake at a time.
Or call it for what it is.
"Home and abroad."
The president is essentially asking for permission
-to fight a war on our soil.
-We can't push back too hard.
We can't afford to look soft on terror.
We can't look the other way, either.
You of all people know where this kind of talk leads.
...ICO and the United States of America.
Make sure the committee dealing with the declaration of war never gets to a vote.
We're not against war, we're against his.
And I want you to reach out to the Speaker and find out who she's putting on that committee.
We need to get back to the president's crimes.
That's the story.
It's the only story.
Anything else?
I have my script.
I will not yield!
I will not...
Harry...
I want to know what he says and when he says it.
Our general isn't used to taking orders.
Will, one more thing.
-What?
-Your wife.
Okay, I know we opened up this campaign on Pollyhop, but it might be time to close it down...
or at least be more careful.
Well, what did they find out?
The home of the mother of the terrorist, you know, the one they're looking for, was vandalized last night.
Garage set on fire.
Broken windows.
And, uh, Hannah... well... she posted.
She was defending the mother online.
-When?
-This afternoon.
The timing is not good on this.
-I can show you.
-Not now.
Thank you.
Governor Conway and I are honored to be here with the Miller family and their closest friends.
I know the VFW was a big part of Jim's life here in Knoxville.
With the help of Homeland and our hotline, we think that Masterson has crossed into the southwest corner of Virginia.
Scott or Washington.
- And?
- And...
Assistant Director Green?
We're relying on aerial support, sightings and local law enforcement.
But we're fairly confident we can have him pinned down in the next 24 hours.
The president wants us to be absolutely sure.
We can't have him getting away again.
Careers are at stake.
Everyone around this table is fully aware of the gravity of the situation.
Good.
The president will be happy to hear that.
Okay.
What kind of kiss do you want?
- Eskimo.
- In... and out.
I'll be right back.
-You're angry.
-I am.
I was asked a question and I answered.
That's the least of it.
Okay, well, I don't want to talk about it right now.
Are you trying to lose this election?
Are you?
Oh, Will, stop it.
This woman that you're defending...
Her son just cut someone's head off.
And he's still out there somewhere.
-Do you understand what this looks like?
-Stop it.
Do you want to know why our son can't sleep?
He's eight years old, and he can't sleep.
Because he's having nightmares.
Because he thinks there's a big black dog running around the hotel.
-Dog?
-Yes.
He closes his eyes, and he can hear it growling.
He's scared, Will.
I said what I said because that woman is a victim.
We all are.
And it has to stop.
I want you to win.
Get yourself a drink.
I'll be right back.
That's the mother.
And this is Hannah's response.
She's not a criminal and should not be punished for the sins of her son.
We all, I know, reject the rhetoric and actions of these damaged, troubled young men.
What I mean is, this is a time for reflection, not aggression...
So she's not condoning it, but it is sympathetic.
Plays into the idea that Joshua and Zachary were just a pair of troubled kids looking for a cause, no different than some school shooter.
The post has been shared over 100,000 times.
I want to talk with her.
-Hannah?
-The mother.
We've been very careful about where you appear.
-LeAnn, will you excuse us for a moment?
-Of course.
We need to dial up the terror.
And the mother can help us with that.
But that also means we have to locate Masterson.
Soon.
Tom is waiting for me.
Well, you go on.
Francis...
I shouldn't have cried at the funeral.
-No, it played beautifully.
-Not for me.
Come with me.
Come on.
Just tell him you'll be late.
-Mr.
President.
-It's all right, Officer.
Ma'am.
May I have your scope?
Scope on your gun.
I promise I'll give it back.
Thank you.
Come here.
Now, if you just hold the scope a little a ways from your face... and look down, straight down, across the lawn... right to the gate.
-You see them?
-Hmm.
Those people want a voice.
Some for, some against.
And they're looking back across the lawn, toward this house and these windows... and they're thinking,
"I wonder what the president and the First Lady are doing tonight.
And will they be able to protect us?"
I should have been there.
Where?
When you got shot.
I wish I was there.
Maybe I could've... protected you.
You see, all those people want... is someone to keep them from what they're afraid to know.
And what are the president and First Lady doing tonight, Francis?
Well, I believe Thomas is waiting for you.
Thank you, sir.
I'll see you in the morning.
Do you have a smoke?
Thank you.
I've been looking for you.
I got hungry.
So I went down to the main kitchen.
That's a lovely group of people you have down there.
If there's anything you need, it can be brought up.
I didn't know what I needed until I was eating it.
I heard the president's declaration.
Very compelling.
What did you really think?
It was almost like the real thing.
The NSA has good people.
Very good.
-Too good.
-Not as good as you.
Good enough to find my algorithms.
That doesn't mean they knew what we were using them for.
No, no.
One second, they send me home, and then the next, they tell me, "Come back!"
-They'll been watching me.
This is a trap.
-Or the only way out.
God damn it.
-You want out?
-Don't you?
LeAnn... we have done some illegal things here.
There are other campaigns.
-If you can get into the NSA...
-That's not possible.
...into their system, you can fix this.
-You're not listening to me.
-I am.
I know the Underwoods.
The only way that we are gonna survive this... is if they win.
You can help them win.
I know you can.
I got on the paper right around the time you left.
Did you start in Style?
Metro desk.
But then I did this piece, a street fashion, kids on the street thing.
I'm surprised you asked for me.
Some people are being moved around and off the team.
The Masterson story.
"War, what is it good for?"
Were you ever interested in investigative journalism?
If you ask me, if it's not investigating, it's not journalism.
Word around here is you can get anybody to talk to you.
After 8:00, with a drink in their hands... yeah.
She's the one they say you called a... you know.
I'm sorry.
I'm a little nervous.
You're sort of a legend and...
articles on the president?
It'd be an honor to work with you in any capacity.
To be part of this.
Did you find him?
Did you?
It'll only be another moment.
Because I've done all I can.
Everything you told me to.
You know that.
They know that, don't they?
Mrs. Underwood.
I was hoping to speak to Ms. Masterson.
Just the two of us.
Is there a problem?
It is a bit extreme.
Expanding the no-fly list to this extent.
The restrictions on visas alone is unprecedented.
How do we justify?
The White House counsel's been all through that.
It's there in black and white.
We're virtually closing down our borders
-without any hard evidence to back it up.
-It's coming.
A lot of innocent people are trying to get into this country.
They could be hurt by this.
A change in policy this big, I want it done right.
I want you to let the world know that if they want to continue coming to this country for our hospitals, our colleges, our golf courses and God knows what else... they're going to have to deliver more than my head on the end of a burning stick.
Now look, Cathy, I know you have well-earned relationships out there.
Long-standing.
I'm not holding back, Francis.
I have reached out.
Then I need you to reach further.
I want actionable intelligence.
I want to know where ICO is, or at the very least, that everyone's out there looking.
Are we clear?
We're clear.
Thank you, Cathy.
I know you won't let me down.
He's dead.
-Is that why you're here?
-We're still looking for him--
Because if he's dead, I want to see him.
To touch him.
I'm trying to help...
-Ms.
Masterson, please.
-...but he hasn't contacted me.
- I wish he would.
- I understand.
Calm down.
He's not a monster like they all say.
- I lost him somewhere.
- But he's not...
But still, monsters do exist, don't they?
I want my lawyer.
What for?
I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that.
I don't know why I say anything anymore.
I wanted to see you...
to ask you a simple question.
Didn't you know what was going on in your home?
-Excuse me?
-You knew... even before he went to Pakistan.
-I mean, you raised him.
-No.
No.
He had some problems.
He got lost.
-But no, nothing like this.
-But you saw what he did, didn't you?
-No.
-Would you like to see it?
We can show it to you, if you like.
No.
Please don't.
What he did to that family, to that man...
What sort of person would do such a thing?
He's my son.
Oh, God.
I know.
It's awful, isn't it?
Thank you.
When you leave today, there will be some reporters, some cameramen out there.
But you don't need to say very much.
You just need to ask Josh to turn himself in.
There are so many hardworking mothers and fathers out there.
This could've happened to any of them.
We are close to capturing your son, Ms. Masterson, and I will do my best to have you see him.
I want to go.
No one's keeping you.
But who did she put in?
Who did the Speaker put on the committee?
Mostly lifers, with secure seats.
We're two weeks out.
It's hard to say no to war.
You and I have some things in common.
-We both dislike the president.
-No.
I'm still a Democrat.
Who leans to the right.
Alex, you do actually lean a little to the right.
Look, he's the commander in chief.
He's got all the authority he needs to fight them where they are.
Well, there's one here.
Out there, right now, as we speak.
Well, I'm a big fan of American law enforcement.
They'll find him soon enough.
We can't just let Francis Underwood turn us into a nation that's always looking over their shoulder.
If you can get yourself onto that committee,
I got a feeling the Chair will give you all the time you need.
My driver will take you back to your car.
But, Congressman... this is your chance.
And I think you know it.
Thank you so much for coming out here.
Thank you so much for coming out.
Great to see you.
Thanks for coming out.
Just go away!
You have no idea what is happening in your own homes.
Have you any idea where he is, Mrs. Masterson?
Josh, please... please, please turn yourself in.
This has all got to stop.
No, no.
...this after ten years with Treasury, he was waiting for it.
Yeah...
Mrs. Underwood!
Mrs. Underwood!
Does the administration believe that the explosion was connected
-with Joshua Masterson somehow?
-We're not sure yet.
Uh, there is strong evidence to suggest.
The owner of the establishment was foreign-born.
Any connection to ICO overseas?
I think our Deputy Director Clark here is better equipped to answer that.
We're looking into it.
In the meantime, we've set up a hotline.
-If anyone in the community has any--
-And if the Republican candidate and the rest of his party refuse to acknowledge the seriousness of the threat made here at home... know that we will.
The FBI is currently gathering a list of words and images.
If they appear on your children's or your coworkers' devices, please--
War whore!
- Move!
- Car!
It was just paint.
She's all right.
And what else?
Spit it out, Doug.
It won't taste so bad.
Sir, I know you disagree with me on this.
But Director Green and his team have a location for the takedown and they're ready to act.
And they're positive it's the right location?
-Adamant.
-When?
Hours.
We can coordinate out of the Situation Room.
Oh, no.
I'm gonna meet him in person.
Sir, I strongly advise against that.
Duly noted, but I'll be on-site.
Yes, sir.
It's amazing how ready people are to be afraid.
History would prove them right.
You're lucky this is coming off with water.
Could've been worse.
Some found its way behind your ear.
-Should I be afraid?
-Don't be smart.
I should, shouldn't I?
I stole something from you.
What?
What it is, doesn't matter.
I just wanted something that was yours.
Well, put it back.
Waterfalls.
The NSA marked their zero-day exploits as waterfalls.
What can they get us into?
We can backdoor into some very popular social media.
I can insert anything your imagination can think of into those sites.
Underwoods or otherwise.
...reports coming in from a variety of sources stating that local police enforcement and FBI agents are currently on the ground.
We're receiving reports that there's a great deal of police activity on the Virginia border.
We cannot confirm at this time, but we believe this is connected to the manhunt for domestic terrorist Joshua Masterson.
The capture of Joshua Masterson may be close at hand.
The FBI is still not commenting, but if you look at this aerial view, you can see heavily-armed men making their way through this wooded area.
Sir, he's not here.
All we have are some loose domestic connections.
A perverse idolization of ICO overseas.
He refuses to confirm any wide-ranging homegrown network.
Our interrogators are confident the asset is no longer valuable.
And risk to reward no longer tenable.
Sir, we have reached a breaking point.
Did you think I didn't already have him?
That I would have left him out there somewhere?
And I thought you knew me.
Josh.
Joshua.
Do you want to live?
Tell us what we want.
Tell us what we want to hear.
You're no martyr, are you?
Look at you.
No, you're not a martyr.
No one will remember what you've done, either here on Earth or in your heaven.
So why did you pick the Millers?
Why?
What did you see?
Was it the girl?
Did you see her first?
What did you see?
Or did she see you first?
Yeah, that's it, isn't it?
She saw you.
She looked right through you, didn't she?
I don't need to see this person anymore.
- Get rid of the asset.
- Sir.
He's an animal, but he's still an American citizen.
We are at war.
And he is an enemy combatant.
And he lost whatever rights he might have had as an American when he cut that poor man's head off.
So don't give me your pride or your position.
Because none of this would have happened if you'd done what you were told in the first place.
I'll take care of it.
Yes, you will, and you will do so willingly.
And I want you to get some good, usable footage... of his killing.
And then destroy everything else.
We will be releasing footage of Joshua Masterson's killing.
The administration and the intelligence community were hoping to take him alive.
But I would like to commend
Assistant Director of Counterterrorism, Nathan Green.
And of course all of the work that Secretary Durant has done behind the scenes on all of this.
The information the investigation has gathered so far points to Joshua Masterson and Zachary Hawthorne having strong connections to ICO abroad and ICO's growing network domestically.
And so I would like to say this to ICO directly.
You will not infect the mind of one more of our young people, because I will not stop until I find you.
And I say that for the grieving Miller family, whom I hope will find some sleep tonight.
I also urge Congress to accelerate the process and vote on my request for a declaration of war.
- Mr. President?
- I will not be answering questions.
Seth will take it from here.
It's hard to see, but I think that was the killshot.
Now, please remember, these reports are unconfirmed and we're waiting on a statement from the White House.
-What we can report is a great deal...
-Why are you watching this?
...this wooded area.
And shots being fired, both by and--
Hello?
Hello.
This is Francis Underwood.
It's him.
The committee is looking for Remy Danton and Jackie Sharp.
What do either of them have to do with ICO or the war?
The talk up on the Hill is they're going to invite you and the rest of your staff to testify.
They're gonna use the Declaration of War to investigate.
That's right.
They're gonna use the committee Frank asked for to investigate him.
-Fuck.
-That's right, Doug.
"Fuck."
It's difficult to underst--
Well, perhaps if you could just calm down for a moment.
Please stop it.
I thought this news would bring you some relief.
The president called Mrs. Miller.
I promised you and your daughter that I would--
Leave her alone.
Well, perhaps we should speak when you're feeling a little more up to it.
I don't want to hear you.
Or from you.
-What you did to my family...
-What?
Leave us out of it.
And do not use my husband's name.
Listen, Mrs.--
She hung up.
Let's go for a walk.
Mr. President!
Tell them what they need to know.
Mr. President!
Hello.
Mr. President.
Thank you, thank you.
Hello.
You have nothing to be afraid of.
You have nothing to be afraid of.
You have nothing to be afraid of.
I've been meaning to talk with you.
It's terrifying, isn't it?
The president and I have a simple request.
Tell us what you see.
If anything in your environment strikes you as a bit odd, a bit off, pick up the phone.
Whether it's a package or a person that seems out of place, we'd love you to let us know.
Because there's a lot of noise out there these days.
A noisy press that's choosing to dwell on the past instead of what's happening right now.
My husband and I want to protect you.
In two weeks' time, you will be heading to the ballot box to decide what kind of country you want to live in.
It's a profound choice.
But no matter who wins this election, we're going to need to work together, watch out for each other, and, yes, watch each other, to keep us all safe and sound.
Tell us what you see.
My name is Claire Underwood, and I approve this message.
[indistinct chatter]
Should we do one more?
[Frank] Did the Democrats show?
[Doug] They didn't disappoint.
Almost every member, sir.
-[Frank] Almost.
-I have a list of those who did.
My fellow congressmen, I do not need the Washington Herald to tell me that a scoundrel lives in the White House.
I can see the Democrats are here.
They're eager to debate.
I say to the gentlemen on the other side of the aisle...
-thank you.
-[Frank] Go.
[congressman 1] Should we investigate the president for crimes committed while he was vice president?
-[Congress murmuring]
-I say, yes.
Let's debate.
Let's debate this miscreant all day and all night.
[indistinct chatter] [congressman 2] Madam Speaker.
Parliamentary inquiry.
[McCarthy] The gentleman from Georgia may state the nature of his parliamentary inquiry.
[congressman 2] Do the rules of the House not require the president be formally invited in order to attend?
[congressman 3] Madam Speaker, if I may...
The Speaker recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.
The president is wearing his congressional pin today and is thereby welcome to any and all proceedings.
[congressman 2] Madam Speaker!
Madam Speaker!
-[clamoring] -[gavel banging]
Rules of the House state that former members are not allowed on the floor when they have interest in the matter under debate.
Madam Speaker, the president has no interest or opinion on the matter being debated today.
-[clamoring] -[gavel banging]
[McCarthy] The House suspend.
The House will suspend.
Madam Speaker, I still do have the floor, and I find it hard to believe the president wouldn't have an opinion on the matter being discussed.
If the good gentleman from Florida would yield a portion of his time,
-I assure him it will satisfy his query.
-[clamoring]
I yield three minutes to the leader.
And I yield my time to the former congressman from South Carolina and the President of the United States.
-[cheering and applauding] -[gavel banging]
Point of order!
Parliamentary inquiry!
Parliamentary inquiry!
-Parliamentary inquiry!
-[gavel banging]
Mr. President.
This is beyond the norm.
I don't care.
I don't care.
And I also do not care about your investigative committees.
-[clamoring]
-No, that is not what I care about today.
-[gavel banging] -[McCarthy] The House will cease.
That is not what I care about today.
I am on my way to the funeral of an American patriot.
[congressman 4 groaning]
A good man, a husband... a father...
who was beheaded on American soil.
And this chamber chooses to debate me?
[cheering]
-[McCarthy] The House will suspend.
-I asked to speak to a full session of this chamber and my requests were denied.
-Madam Speaker!
-Mr.
President, you must yield the floor.
-I will not yield, Madam Speaker.
-[all cheering]
-Because I cannot wait.
-[applauding] [gavel banging]
One of the murderers...
One of the murderers who killed Mr. Jim Miller... is still out there.
At large.
How much more proof do you people need?
[cheering]
I demand that every member of this House take a stand.
Like FDR before, and Wilson before him.
I demand that this Congress declare a formal declaration of war against ICO, both here and abroad.
[congressman 1] Motion to adjourn.
-[congressman 2] Second!
-The House will adjourn.
-The president will cease.
-[Frank] I will not cease!
I will never cease.
I demand that this Congress declare a state of war has existed and does exist between ICO and the United States of America.
And I demand that every member of this House stay in this chamber for as long as it takes, until you bring my request to a vote.
Or you will all go down in history as cowards!
Cowards!
The sergeant at arms will remove the president.
Madam Speaker, I repeat.
I demand a vote.
I will not yield.
I will not yield.
-I will not yield.
-[gavel bangs]
[theme music playing]
Alleged terrorist Zachary Hawthorne was killed by the FBI, but Joshua Masterson is still at large.
While the Miller family mourns, the hunt for the missing terrorist continues and tensions are running high.
The president may be asking for war, but it seems war's already been declared on him.
[chanting in Arabic]
My fans.
FBI is looking into a multiple shooting in Chattanooga.
-Reports have it gang related.
-No.
A private plane went down in West Virginia.
Mechanical failure.
A series of homes were set on fire in Georgia, most likely arson.
Uh... convenience store in North Carolina exploded at about 4:00 in the morning.
-Where's the store?
-Uh, suburb outside of Raleigh.
The cause is still under investigation.
-I'll make an appearance.
-Yes, ma'am.
Just put it on the schedule so the media has time to mobilize.
Yes, ma'am.
I take it the president has declared war on Joshua Masterson.
He never should've kicked me off that call.
But this morning isn't about politics.
[sighs] That's right.
We need to show some compassion for the living.
[Conway] And respect for the dead.
[Doug] The family's agreed to a moment.
No press, no speeches, but we should be able to pull something.
-Mr.
President.
-Governor.
Do they not realize what we've done for them already?
I pointed that out, sir, but... the daughter's medicated and very fragile at the moment.
All right.
[Frank] Mrs. Miller.
-I'm so very sorry.
-Thank you.
And I promise you,
I will not stop until everyone responsible for this terrible tragedy is brought to justice.
And I swear to you, as God is my witness... no one will ever harm you or your family ever again.
The nation mourns with you and your daughter, Mrs. Miller.
-Thank you.
If you don't mind...
-Of course.
[Conway] Mr. President.
I'll be right along.
It's a busy day for you today, sir.
It's a sad, sad day.
It's a shame things didn't turn out differently.
Yes.
Well, some things are bigger than the two of us, Will.
[Melissa] I don't want him here!
Calm down, Melissa.
Please.
It's his fault.
He's dead.
-Daddy's dead.
He killed him.
-Please.
-[knocking on door]
-Give me a minute.
-Did you take your medicine?
-Yes.
Okay?
Yes.
Yes!
You do.
You think about what you would say on a day like today.
If a day like today were to happen.
[sniffles] But you let it pass... because you know you have so much more left ahead of you.
[inhales sharply]
So much to do together.
[sniffles] You think...
You think 40 minutes... [sniffles]
-If we were late 40 minutes...
-[Claire crying]
Or two, or one...
Or if we went somewhere else to eat...
[inhales deeply] [exhales deeply]
But to dwell in the past, to live in what-ifs...
That wasn't my husband.
That wasn't us...
-Honey...
-Please.
Okay.
Come on.
[sniffles]
I need to... [exhales]
I wanted to say about my father... [sighs]
He was so strong... so brave.
My father was taking us to...
My father...
-Come on, baby.
It's okay.
-My father...
You killed my father.
You're the reason he died.
[gasps] Melissa... [sniffles]
-It's all right, Melissa.
We understand.
-[shutters click] [whispers] I hope you die and she becomes president.
What did the girl say to you?
She said she hopes I die and that you become the president.
Mr. Macallan, this is Deputy Director Michaels from the NSA.
I'm literally in your office.
I believe we had a meeting.
[Doug] There's been raids as far up as New York and down to the panhandle.
As of now,
Green's focusing in on the border between Virginia and North Carolina.
Seth has a statement ready for this afternoon.
No.
The best statement is no statement.
Besides, I want Claire to be the voice on this until we're ready.
Yes, sir.
-Quite a crowd out there.
-Well, we better bring Birch in first.
Yes, sir.
-[door opens]
-Congressman Birch.
Bob.
Well, that was a little bit of history this morning, wasn't it?
-It certainly was.
-I couldn't see it any other way.
No disagreement from here.
Well, you know how the Republicans are.
Anything but a decision.
They mistake complaint for leadership.
Well, instead of a committee to investigate you, you got one to discuss your declaration.
All the way to election day.
Even if there's only a handful of Republicans with the grit and spit to put up a fight, we can control the conversation.
Get them talking about anything but that goddamn article.
All right.
Now, who from our side
-do we need to massage?
-Womack.
The declaration caught him off guard.
Had to keep him out of it.
It's his constituents that actually fight the damn thing.
Well, let's call in the honorable gentleman from Missouri.
-Oh, he's a bourbon man, isn't he?
-[Doug] Yes, he is.
-A stunt.
Yes, I'm calling it a stunt.
-[Claire] Charlie, if I may...
Tom, please, what are you implying?
This request for a declaration of war is yet another distraction.
And I've never been prouder of the president than I am today.
I'm not denying what happened to the Millers.
It was a tragedy.
[Claire] No, but you are.
Because denying it is the tragedy.
[inhales] This is a pattern.
Your husband's administration, Mrs. Underwood,
-continues to operate in the shadows.
-Tom...
I understand you believe in the importance of your article.
And I agreed to come here today and talk with you about it.
But we're fighting to keep this country safe.
Mrs. Underwood, the White House has yet to release one piece of information about the attempted capture of those domestic terrorists.
ICO terrorists, yes.
Reports from a few hours ago are saying North Carolina or Virginia.
But that's all we have.
Well, we are circling in, we're getting closer.
[stutters] I will tell you, our intelligence community, they are the real heroes.
Charlie, if we could get back to my point, my sources confirmed--
[Claire] Tom.
Heather Dunbar, no friend of mine or my husband's, looked into these charges, and cleared the president.
Cleared?
Please.
The White House has not had a single press briefing since the Herald ran my article.
You keep saying the White House isn't speaking about this.
I am sitting right here talking to you.
Not Remy Danton or Jackie Sharp.
Or Lucas Goodwin, either.
-[mouthing] What?
-[Rose] Excuse me.
Lucas Goodwin, meaning?
I'm saying, me.
I'm here.
And I don't know how many more times we have to go over this.
You know, a Tom Hammerschmidt article used to be the first thing I would look for when I opened the Washington Herald.
[Marshall] The Underwoods are no longer campaigning.
-[scoffs] -[Conway] They can call it what they want.
Well, if you think about the last few days, what's in the air...
It might not be such a bad idea for us to take it one handshake at a time.
Or call it for what it is.
"Home and abroad."
The president is essentially asking for permission
-to fight a war on our soil.
-We can't push back too hard.
We can't afford to look soft on terror.
[Brockhart] We can't look the other way, either.
You of all people know where this kind of talk leads.
[Frank on TV] ...
ICO and the United States of America.
Make sure the committee dealing with the declaration of war never gets to a vote.
We're not against war, we're against his.
And I want you to reach out to the Speaker and find out who she's putting on that committee.
We need to get back to the president's crimes.
That's the story.
It's the only story.
Anything else?
I have my script.
[Frank on TV] I will not yield!
I will not...
Harry...
I want to know what he says and when he says it.
Our general isn't used to taking orders.
Will, one more thing.
-What?
-Your wife.
Okay, I know we opened up this campaign on Pollyhop, but it might be time to close it down...
or at least be more careful.
Well, what did they find out?
The home of the mother of the terrorist, you know, the one they're looking for, was vandalized last night.
Garage set on fire.
Broken windows.
And, uh, Hannah... well... she posted.
She was defending the mother online.
-When?
-This afternoon.
The timing is not good on this.
-I can show you.
-Not now.
[scattered applause]
[Brockhart] Thank you.
Governor Conway and I are honored to be here with the Miller family and their closest friends.
I know the VFW was a big part of Jim's life here in Knoxville.
With the help of Homeland and our hotline, we think that Masterson has crossed into the southwest corner of Virginia.
Scott or Washington.
-[Doug] And?
-And...
Assistant Director Green?
We're relying on aerial support, sightings and local law enforcement.
But we're fairly confident we can have him pinned down in the next 24 hours.
The president wants us to be absolutely sure.
We can't have him getting away again.
Careers are at stake.
Everyone around this table is fully aware of the gravity of the situation.
Good.
The president will be happy to hear that.
[Hannah softly] Okay.
What kind of kiss do you want?
-[Charlie whispers] Eskimo.
-In... and out.
I'll be right back.
-You're angry.
-I am.
[sighs] I was asked a question and I answered.
That's the least of it.
Okay, well, I don't want to talk about it right now.
Are you trying to lose this election?
Are you?
Oh, Will, stop it.
This woman that you're defending...
Her son just cut someone's head off.
And he's still out there somewhere.
-Do you understand what this looks like?
-Stop it.
Do you want to know why our son can't sleep?
He's eight years old, and he can't sleep.
Because he's having nightmares.
Because he thinks there's a big black dog running around the hotel.
-Dog?
-Yes.
He closes his eyes, and he can hear it growling.
He's scared, Will.
I said what I said because that woman is a victim.
We all are.
And it has to stop.
I want you to win.
Get yourself a drink.
I'll be right back.
[sighs]
[LeAnn] That's the mother.
And this is Hannah's response.
She's not a criminal and should not be punished for the sins of her son.
We all, I know, reject the rhetoric and actions of these damaged, troubled young men.
What I mean is, this is a time for reflection, not aggression...
So she's not condoning it, but it is sympathetic.
Plays into the idea that Joshua and Zachary were just a pair of troubled kids looking for a cause, no different than some school shooter.
The post has been shared over 100,000 times.
I want to talk with her.
-Hannah?
-The mother.
[inhales] We've been very careful about where you appear.
-LeAnn, will you excuse us for a moment?
-Of course.
[door opens]
-[door closes]
-We need to dial up the terror.
And the mother can help us with that.
But that also means we have to locate Masterson.
Soon.
Tom is waiting for me.
Well, you go on.
Francis...
I shouldn't have cried at the funeral.
-No, it played beautifully.
-Not for me.
Come with me.
Come on.
Just tell him you'll be late.
-Mr.
President.
-It's all right, Officer.
Ma'am.
May I have your scope?
Scope on your gun.
I promise I'll give it back.
Thank you.
Come here.
Now, if you just hold the scope a little a ways from your face... and look down, straight down, across the lawn... right to the gate.
-You see them?
-Hmm.
[Frank] Those people want a voice.
Some for, some against.
And they're looking back across the lawn, toward this house and these windows... and they're thinking,
"I wonder what the president and the First Lady are doing tonight.
And will they be able to protect us?"
I should have been there.
Where?
When you got shot.
I wish I was there.
Maybe I could've... protected you.
You see, all those people want... is someone to keep them from what they're afraid to know.
And what are the president and First Lady doing tonight, Francis?
Well, I believe Thomas is waiting for you.
[officer] Thank you, sir.
[Frank] I'll see you in the morning.
[whispers] Do you have a smoke?
[Frank] Thank you.
[singing] ♪ I know what my people Are thinking tonight ♪
♪ As home through the shadows They wander ♪
♪ Everyone smiling in secret delight ♪
♪ As they stare at the castle and ponder ♪
♪ And whenever the wind blows this way ♪
♪ You can almost hear everyone say ♪
♪ I wonder what the king Is doing tonight ♪
I've been looking for you.
I got hungry.
So I went down to the main kitchen.
That's a lovely group of people you have down there.
If there's anything you need, it can be brought up.
I didn't know what I needed until I was eating it.
I heard the president's declaration.
Very compelling.
What did you really think?
It was almost like the real thing.
[sighs] The NSA has good people.
Very good.
-Too good.
-Not as good as you.
Good enough to find my algorithms.
That doesn't mean they knew what we were using them for.
No, no.
One second, they send me home, and then the next, they tell me, "Come back!"
-They'll been watching me.
This is a trap.
-Or the only way out.
God damn it.
-You want out?
-Don't you?
LeAnn... we have done some illegal things here.
There are other campaigns.
-If you can get into the NSA...
-That's not possible.
...into their system, you can fix this.
-You're not listening to me.
-I am.
I know the Underwoods.
The only way that we are gonna survive this... is if they win.
-You can help them win.
-[sighs]
I know you can.
I got on the paper right around the time you left.
[Tom] Did you start in Style?
Metro desk.
But then I did this piece, a street fashion, kids on the street thing.
-I'm surprised you asked for me.
-[inhales deeply]
Some people are being moved around and off the team.
The Masterson story.
"War, what is it good for?"
[chuckles]
Were you ever interested in investigative journalism?
If you ask me, if it's not investigating, it's not journalism.
Word around here is you can get anybody to talk to you.
After 8:00, with a drink in their hands... yeah.
[inhales deeply]
She's the one they say you called a... you know.
I'm sorry.
I'm a little nervous.
[stutters] You're sort of a legend and...
articles on the president?
It'd be an honor to work with you in any capacity.
To be part of this.
Did you find him?
Did you?
It'll only be another moment.
Because I've done all I can.
Everything you told me to.
You know that.
They know that, don't they?
Mrs. Underwood.
[Claire] I was hoping to speak to Ms. Masterson.
Just the two of us.
[whispers inaudibly]
Is there a problem?
It is a bit extreme.
Expanding the no-fly list to this extent.
The restrictions on visas alone is unprecedented.
How do we justify?
The White House counsel's been all through that.
It's there in black and white.
We're virtually closing down our borders
-without any hard evidence to back it up.
-It's coming.
A lot of innocent people are trying to get into this country.
They could be hurt by this.
A change in policy this big, I want it done right.
[inhales] I want you to let the world know that if they want to continue coming to this country for our hospitals, our colleges, our golf courses and God knows what else... they're going to have to deliver more than my head on the end of a burning stick.
Now look, Cathy, I know you have well-earned relationships out there.
Long-standing.
I'm not holding back, Francis.
I have reached out.
Then I need you to reach further.
I want actionable intelligence.
I want to know where ICO is, or at the very least, that everyone's out there looking.
Are we clear?
We're clear.
Thank you, Cathy.
I know you won't let me down.
He's dead.
-Is that why you're here?
-We're still looking for him--
Because if he's dead, I want to see him.
To touch him.
I'm trying to help...
-Ms.
Masterson, please.
-...but he hasn't contacted me.
-[stutters] I wish he would.
-I understand.
Calm down.
[sighs]
He's not a monster like they all say.
I lost him somewhere.
But he's not... [inhales]
But still, monsters do exist, don't they?
I want my lawyer.
What for?
I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that.
[chuckles nervously] I don't know why I say anything anymore.
I wanted to see you...
to ask you a simple question.
Didn't you know what was going on in your home?
-Excuse me?
-You knew... even before he went to Pakistan.
-I mean, you raised him.
-No.
No.
He had some problems.
He got lost.
-But no, nothing like this.
-But you saw what he did, didn't you?
-No.
-Would you like to see it?
We can show it to you, if you like.
No.
Please don't.
[inhales deeply]
What he did to that family, to that man...
What sort of person would do such a thing?
[crying] He's my son.
[sniffling] [sobbing] Oh, God.
I know.
It's awful, isn't it?
[breathing shakily] Thank you.
When you leave today, there will be some reporters, some cameramen out there.
But you don't need to say very much.
You just need to ask Josh to turn himself in.
There are so many hardworking mothers and fathers out there.
This could've happened to any of them.
We are close to capturing your son, Ms. Masterson, and I will do my best to have you see him.
[breathing shakily]
I want to go.
No one's keeping you.
But who did she put in?
Who did the Speaker put on the committee?
Mostly lifers, with secure seats.
We're two weeks out.
It's hard to say no to war.
[breathes deeply]
You and I have some things in common.
-We both dislike the president.
-No.
I'm still a Democrat.
[chuckles] Who leans to the right.
Alex, you do actually lean a little to the right.
Look, he's the commander in chief.
He's got all the authority he needs to fight them where they are.
Well, there's one here.
Out there, right now, as we speak.
Well, I'm a big fan of American law enforcement.
They'll find him soon enough.
We can't just let Francis Underwood turn us into a nation that's always looking over their shoulder.
If you can get yourself onto that committee,
I got a feeling the Chair will give you all the time you need.
My driver will take you back to your car.
But, Congressman... this is your chance.
And I think you know it.
[crowd cheering]
Thank you so much for coming out here.
Thank you so much for coming out.
-Great to see you.
Thanks for coming out.
-[cheering]
[reporters clamoring]
[Roseanne] Just go away!
You have no idea what is happening in your own homes.
[reporter] Have you any idea where he is, Mrs. Masterson?
Josh, please... please, please turn yourself in.
-This has all got to stop.
No, no.
-[reporters clamoring]
-[keypad beeps] -[door unlocks]
[indistinct chatter]
[keypad beeps] [sighs]
[keypad beeps and buzzes]
-[buzzing] -[scoffs]
[indistinct chatter in distance]
...this after ten years with Treasury, he was waiting for it.
[man sighs] Yeah... [sighs heavily]
[mouse clicks]
[exhales heavily]
[sighs]
[reporters clamoring]
-[all clamoring]
-Mrs.
Underwood!
Mrs. Underwood!
Does the administration believe that the explosion was connected
-with Joshua Masterson somehow?
-We're not sure yet.
Uh, there is strong evidence to suggest.
The owner of the establishment was foreign-born.
Any connection to ICO overseas?
I think our Deputy Director Clark here is better equipped to answer that.
We're looking into it.
In the meantime, we've set up a hotline.
-If anyone in the community has any--
-And if the Republican candidate and the rest of his party refuse to acknowledge the seriousness of the threat made here at home... know that we will.
The FBI is currently gathering a list of words and images.
If they appear on your children's or your coworkers' devices, please- [man] War whore!
-[people gasp]
-[officer 1] Move!
-[officer 2] Car!
-[agents clamoring] -[camera shutters clicking] [breathing heavily]
[Doug] It was just paint.
She's all right.
And what else?
Spit it out, Doug.
It won't taste so bad.
Sir, I know you disagree with me on this.
But Director Green and his team have a location for the takedown and they're ready to act.
And they're positive it's the right location?
-Adamant.
-When?
Hours.
We can coordinate out of the Situation Room.
Oh, no.
I'm gonna meet him in person.
Sir, I strongly advise against that.
Duly noted, but I'll be on-site.
Yes, sir.
[door closes]
It's amazing how ready people are to be afraid.
History would prove them right.
[sirens blaring in distance]
You're lucky this is coming off with water.
Could've been worse.
Some found its way behind your ear.
-Should I be afraid?
-Don't be smart.
I should, shouldn't I?
I stole something from you.
What?
What it is, doesn't matter.
I just wanted something that was yours.
Well, put it back.
Waterfalls.
The NSA marked their zero-day exploits as waterfalls.
What can they get us into?
We can backdoor into some very popular social media.
I can insert anything your imagination can think of into those sites.
Underwoods or otherwise.
[reporter on laptop] ...reports coming in from a variety of sources stating that local police enforcement and FBI agents are currently on the ground.
We're receiving reports that there's a great deal of police activity on the Virginia border.
We cannot confirm at this time, but we believe this is connected to the manhunt for domestic terrorist Joshua Masterson.
The capture of Joshua Masterson may be close at hand.
The FBI is still not commenting, but if you look at this aerial view, you can see heavily-armed men making their way through this wooded area.
[indistinct radio chatter]
[FBI agent] Sir, he's not here.
All we have are some loose domestic connections.
A perverse idolization of ICO overseas.
He refuses to confirm any wide-ranging homegrown network.
Our interrogators are confident the asset is no longer valuable.
And risk to reward no longer tenable.
Sir, we have reached a breaking point.
Did you think I didn't already have him?
That I would have left him out there somewhere?
And I thought you knew me.
Josh.
Joshua.
Do you want to live?
Tell us what we want.
Tell us what we want to hear.
You're no martyr, are you?
[scoffs] Look at you.
No, you're not a martyr.
No one will remember what you've done, either here on Earth or in your heaven.
[sighs]
So why did you pick the Millers?
Why?
What did you see?
[softly] Was it the girl?
Did you see her first?
What did you see?
Or did she see you first?
Yeah, that's it, isn't it?
She saw you.
-She looked right through you, didn't she?
-[breathing heavily]
I don't need to see this person anymore.
-Get rid of the asset.
-[Green] Sir.
He's an animal, but he's still an American citizen.
[Frank] We are at war.
And he is an enemy combatant.
And he lost whatever rights he might have had as an American when he cut that poor man's head off.
So don't give me your pride or your position.
Because none of this would have happened if you'd done what you were told in the first place.
I'll take care of it.
Yes, you will, and you will do so willingly.
And I want you to get some good, usable footage... of his killing.
And then destroy everything else.
[Frank] We will be releasing footage of Joshua Masterson's killing.
The administration and the intelligence community were hoping to take him alive.
But I would like to commend
Assistant Director of Counterterrorism, Nathan Green.
And of course all of the work that Secretary Durant has done behind the scenes on all of this.
The information the investigation has gathered so far points to Joshua Masterson and Zachary Hawthorne having strong connections to ICO abroad and ICO's growing network domestically.
And so I would like to say this to ICO directly.
You will not infect the mind of one more of our young people, because I will not stop until I find you.
And I say that for the grieving Miller family, whom I hope will find some sleep tonight.
I also urge Congress to accelerate the process and vote on my request for a declaration of war.
-[reporters] Mr. President?
-I will not be answering questions.
Seth will take it from here.
-[reporters clamoring] -[Seth clears throat]
[phone ringing]
-[reporter speaking indistinctly on TV] -[gunshots on TV] [reporter] It's hard to see, but I think that was the killshot.
Now, please remember, these reports are unconfirmed and we're waiting on a statement from the White House.
-What we can report is a great deal...
-Why are you watching this?
...this wooded area.
And shots being fired, both by and--
Hello?
[Frank] Hello.
This is Francis Underwood.
It's him.
The committee is looking for Remy Danton and Jackie Sharp.
What do either of them have to do with ICO or the war?
The talk up on the Hill is they're going to invite you and the rest of your staff to testify.
They're gonna use the Declaration of War to investigate.
That's right.
They're gonna use the committee Frank asked for to investigate him.
-Fuck.
-That's right, Doug.
"Fuck."
[Frank] It's difficult to underst--
Well, perhaps if you could just calm down for a moment.
[Caroline] Please stop it.
[Frank] I thought this news would bring you some relief.
The president called Mrs. Miller.
I promised you and your daughter that I would--
Leave her alone.
Well, perhaps we should speak when you're feeling a little more up to it.
I don't want to hear you.
Or from you.
-What you did to my family...
-What?
Leave us out of it.
And do not use my husband's name.
-Listen, Mrs.-- -[dial tone]
She hung up.
[sighs]
Let's go for a walk.
-[all clamoring] -[man] Mr. President!
Tell them what they need to know.
[all clamoring]
[man] Mr. President!
[Frank] Hello.
[man] Mr. President.
Thank you, thank you.
[Frank] Hello.
You have nothing to be afraid of.
You have nothing to be afraid of.
You have nothing to be afraid of.
This place smells like the wrong end of a Chitauri slime slug!
Yeah, brings back a lot of great memories of hanging out here with Yondu and the Ravagers.
The fun games they used to have me play...
"Scrub the Decks,"
"Lug the Grub," "Unclog the Latrine."
Aw, krutack!
Those weren't games, were they?
Quill, I hate to interrupt this stroll down memory lane, but we need to find the sarcophagus before it falls into the hands of the Believers.
Right, Rocket?
- Hey, is it my fault Yondu stole it?
- Actually, it is.
Picky, picky.
Besides, even if those nutjobs get their grubby paws on that thingy, there's only a 50-50 chance it'll destroy the universe.
- Those are terrible odds.
- Relax, Gamora.
Now, if I know Yondu...
And I do know Yondu, he probably stashed the sarcophagus in one of these old hideouts until he can negotiate the best deal.
All we gotta do is search each one until we find it.
- Easy as pie.
- I have attempted pie.
It is extremely difficult, especially the crust.
My sensitive snout can't take much more of this.
Let's give this dump a once-over and get outta here.
I am Groot!
Careful, Rocket.
These Ravager hideouts are notorious for booby traps.
That's right!
And I'm the booby who set those traps.
Oh, I mean, I built these when I was a teenager, and they still work like a charm.
But don't worry.
You stick close, you don't touch anything, I can get you through.
This will not end well.
Just do what I do.
Come on, it's awesome!
This is almost as difficult as pie.
And almost as deadly as your pies, Drax.
Besides, dancing is for suckers!
Any sign of the sarcophagus?
Nope, but I found this!
Oh, come on!
It's a monkey, people.
And it plays the drums!
I am Groot?
Huh?
What did you do?
Oh, I think he triggered one of my old booby traps.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, I remember this one.
You've reached the Ravagers' hideout.
Hey, look.
That's me.
We're not right here now, but prepare to be destroyed at the beep.
Beep!
Better luck next time!
Oh, wait.
There won't be a next time.
I hate this kid.
Congratulations.
You have activated a patented Peter Quill booby trap.
Quill, you built this trap!
- Where's the kill switch?
- There isn't one!
What kind of idiot builds a trap without a kill switch?
Oh, give me a break!
This is some of my earliest work!
You should see my later stuff.
If we live that long!
All right, this way!
Only step on the green tiles.
Or it might have been the red ones.
Yeah, it's the red ones!
Quill!
Where'd you get so many krutackin' barrels?
Cargo ship raid, back in the day.
I always wondered what was in them.
This smells like Rajak root slime.
Rajak root slime?
That stuff's more potent than proton fuel!
Oh...
Man, I told you I make some awesome traps.
Did you happen to notice that you almost got us incinerated?
But I didn't!
Where's Groot?
Ah, krutack!
He's still inside!
Groot, where are ya?
Whoa!
I am Groot!
You stayed here for an egg?
Very wise.
Eggs are part of a nutritious breakfast.
And omelets are much easier than pie.
I am Groot!
Easy!
Nobody's gonna cook your precious egg!
Groot can get very attached to helpless weaklings.
You should not describe yourself in such a manner.
I meant we should let him keep the stupid egg until this nurturing phase has run its course.
Fine.
How long can that take?
Groot!
That's my chair!
I am Groot.
He's got a point.
It is the comfiest seat on board, especially with the temperature control and built-in massager.
Yeah.
I know.
That's because it's my seat!
How am I supposed to fly the ship?
I am Groot.
Three more hideouts, and still no sarcophagus.
Whoa!
Ow!
Hey, where's my hammock?
I am Groot.
Don't shush me.
That's my hammock!
And my mitt!
I am Groot.
Anyone seen my headphones?
Rocket said Groot heard that playing music was supposed to be good for intelligence.
Oh, yeah.
My mom did that with me.
I am Groot.
Groot?
Hey, buddy,
I found the perfect place for your egg.
It's warm and cozy.
It has dim lighting and soothing ambient sounds.
Ooh!
I am Groot.
And best of all, it's nowhere near my stuff.
Much better.
All right, what's our status?
We're approaching the Ravager hideout on Veros Seven.
Yes!
That hideout has my trap-making masterpiece.
My magnum opus.
Oh, okay, that has to be where Yondu hid the sarcophagus, 'cause my trap there is so mind-blowingly awesome.
You do realize we don't actually want to get caught in one of your stupid traps, right?
Well, duh.
The only thing I'm better at than building traps is dodging them.
There isn't a trap made that I can't get out of, except maybe my masterpiece on Veros Seven.
No one can get outta that bad boy!
Engines are shutting down!
Whoa!
I just did our 400,000-light-year checkup!
What could've caused this?
Groot!
I am Groot.
Just 'cause Quill told you to stay here don't mean you gotta listen to him!
Uh, Groot, old buddy, I'm sorry I stuck you in there, but if we don't get those engines cleared, all you're gonna be left with is scrambled eggs!
I like scrambled eggs.
- Although, I prefer omelets.
- Not helping!
Okay, just so you know, I blame you for this.
You and the stupid egg that's probably never gonna hatch!
I am Groot!
Cool down, both of you!
This damage ain't as bad as it looks.
Well, fine!
You fix it while we go and check the Ravager hideout.
Drax, stay and give me a hand.
Groot ain't gonna be much help.
I am Groot.
Try and keep up, will you?
- Be patient with him.
- Oh, sure.
"Everybody be patient with Groot!"
No one was half this nice when I got into roller disco.
Groot's behavior is selfless, nurturing, and irritates the krutack out of you.
I don't have a problem with any of those things.
Halt, non-Believers.
Black Dwarf and Proxima Midnight?
Oh, that's great.
'Cause this day just wouldn't be complete without a couple of Black Order goons!
You have something we want.
Give it to us, or be destroyed!
I am Groot!
Groot, FYI,
I kind of blame you for this, too.
The sarcophagus!
Where is it?
The sarcophagus and its contents will be ours, for we believe.
Believe this!
- I am Groot!
- Anytime you wanna help, Groot!
- Bring me the sarcophagus!
- Not on your life.
Did the entire Black Order join up with those crackpot Believers?
Maybe their buddy Ebony Maw got them a group discount!
The tree is hiding something.
It must be what we seek.
Give it your best shot.
We got you outnumbered.
That's unfortunate, but it's still an even match.
Stand still and accept your fate!
You first!
You cannot win, for I believe I am impervious to your attacks.
I believe I will break free.
Whoa.
Quill!
Eyes on the enemy!
Tell your cowardly wooden friend to give us the sarcophagus!
He doesn't have it!
None of us do!
Liar!
I believe we will bury you.
Groot!
Little help?
Ha!
Who's buried now, sucker?
I believe it's you!
- I am Groot!
- Well, look who decided to show up after leaving us high and dry.
I am Groot.
Tell Groot I'm not talking to him.
Let's focus on finding the sarcophagus before the Believers get their hands on it.
Okay, the path's a bit overgrown, but I think the Ravagers' hideout is over there.
And tell this walking knothead to stay out of my way!
As promised, one Ravager hideout.
Doesn't look like anyone's been here in years.
- There it is!
- The sarcophagus?
Nope, my magnum opus!
The trap to end all traps.
Tell Groot not to touch my masterpiece.
I am Groot.
- What did he say?
- I have no idea.
Watch this.
Even the slightest touch will trigger the...
Huh.
Is it...
Will, will trigger the...
Oh, come on!
All right, must be sand in the gears.
Nothing a good old blast of wind won't fix!
Should you really be doing that?
I just want to make sure the trap is working in case those Black Order goons show up...
Uh-oh.
Okay, it's working!
This is your famous trap?
It's just a big hole in the ground.
Uh, you think?
Big hole in the ground, huh?
- I dare you to find a way out!
- You're on!
Whoa!
Not one word.
One word.
- Welcome to the Star-Lord 2000X-Scape.
- I didn't say anything.
He did!
It's the latest in trap-making technology.
Can't get a grip?
That's because this baby's built with a seamless, frictionless, 12-inch metal alloy.
But wait!
There's more!
It also has our patented randomized laser grid.
- It slices, it dices!
- Rocket!
Drax!
Can you hear me?
And don't even think about calling for help, 'cause this trap comes with a powerful EMP generator, guaranteed to stop any broadcast signals from getting out.
- Don't call now, ...
- Ha!
I don't remember
- being that annoying back then.
- Some things never change.
So, what now, genius?
And this is my fault?
It appears you were telling the truth after all.
At least the part about the walking tree not having the sarcophagus.
Well, look who joined the party.
The original Black Order Believer himself, Ebony Maw.
Apparently, I'll need to extract the location of the sarcophagus directly from your minds.
Ha!
Good luck with that!
Even the most powerful Believer can't just wish for that kind of mental ability.
I don't need to wish.
I believe.
More importantly, so does everyone on that ship.
Their Belief Energy powers me a thousandfold!
And you will believe, too!
Can you believe this...
I will find the location of the sarcophagus, even if it tears your minds apart!
With Quill, how will you know the difference?
Hey, I heard that!
My mind is as sharp as a...
Now let us see what secrets this mind holds.
What vile abomination is this?
It's a monkey playing the drums.
Come on, man, it's funny!
You think this is a joke?
I am Groot?
Groot...
Dude, why didn't you tell me you were hatching an energy-absorbing parasite?
Who can do that!
Nice birdie!
Whoa!
I am Groot!
Your pathetic pet can't save you from my mental siphon!
Really?
'Cause it looks like baby bird's doing a little siphoning of his own!
Boom!
It shorted out the pit's defenses!
I am Groot.
Groot.
Hey, what about us?
Whoa!
Whoa!
Okay, drop us anywhere!
I believe we will be saved!
I am Groot!
Impossible!
No!
Don't leave us!
- We still have a score to settle.
- Brain freeze!
I believe we should run!
- They're getting away.
- I don't think so.
Wait for it.
You know, those traps aren't as useless as I thought.
Groot, I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time about that egg.
I had no idea that it was gonna turn into an awesome lightning-shooting space eagle!
Wait.
He's not the only one?
Apparently, Yondu stole the egg from this planet.
What are the odds?
Groot.
I am Groot.
You're just gonna let him go?
I know that was hard, Groot, but it was the right thing to do.
Don't you agree, Peter?
Yeah, I guess so.
But, I mean, a lightning space eagle?
That would have totally rocked!
Am I to understand that you did not locate the sarcophagus?
What a waste of time!
Well, not a total waste.
I did find something down there.
Something for you, Groot.
You know, to make up for me being such a jerk.
I am Groot.
I am Groot?
I am Groot!
What?
How was I supposed to know?
This place smells like the wrong end of a Chitauri slime slug!
Yeah, brings back a lot of great memories of hanging out here with Yondu and the Ravagers.

I found the perfect place for your egg.
It's warm and cozy.
It has dim lighting and soothing ambient sounds.
Ooh!
I am Groot.
And best of all, it's nowhere near my stuff.
Much better.
All right, what's our status?
We're approaching the Ravager hideout on Veros Seven.
Yes!
That hideout has my trap-making masterpiece.
My magnum opus.
Oh, okay, that has to be where Yondu hid the sarcophagus, 'cause my trap there is so mind-blowingly awesome.
You do realize we don't actually want to get caught in one of your stupid traps, right?
Well, duh.
The only thing I'm better at than building traps is dodging them.
There isn't a trap made that I can't get out of, except maybe my masterpiece on Veros Seven.
No one can get outta that bad boy!
Engines are shutting down!
Whoa!
I just did our 400,000-light-year checkup!
What could've caused this?
Groot!
I am Groot.
Just 'cause Quill told you to stay here don't mean you gotta listen to him!
Uh, Groot, old buddy, I'm sorry I stuck you in there, but if we don't get those engines cleared, all you're gonna be left with is scrambled eggs!
I like scrambled eggs.
Although, I prefer omelets.
Not helping!
Okay, just so you know, I blame you for this.
You and the stupid egg that's probably never gonna hatch!
I am Groot!
Cool down, both of you!
This damage ain't as bad as it looks.
Well, fine!
You fix it while we go and check the Ravager hideout.
Drax, stay and give me a hand.
Groot ain't gonna be much help.
I am Groot.
Try and keep up, will you?
- Be patient with him.
- Oh, sure.
"Everybody be patient with Groot!"
No one was half this nice when I got into roller disco.
Groot's behavior is selfless, nurturing, and irritates the krutack out of you.
I don't have a problem with any of those things.
Halt, non-Believers.
Black Dwarf and Proxima Midnight?
Oh, that's great.
'Cause this day just wouldn't be complete without a couple of Black Order goons!
You have something we want.
Give it to us, or be destroyed!
I am Groot!
Groot, FYI,
I kind of blame you for this, too.
The sarcophagus!
Where is it?
The sarcophagus and its contents will be ours, for we believe.
Believe this!
I am Groot!
Anytime you wanna help, Groot!
Bring me the sarcophagus!
Not on your life.
Did the entire Black Order join up with those crackpot Believers?
Maybe their buddy Ebony Maw got them a group discount!
The tree is hiding something.
It must be what we seek.
Give it your best shot.
We got you outnumbered.
That's unfortunate, but it's still an even match.
Stand still and accept your fate!
You first!
You cannot win, for I believe I am impervious to your attacks.
I believe I will break free.
Whoa.
Quill!
Eyes on the enemy!
Tell your cowardly wooden friend to give us the sarcophagus!
He doesn't have it!
None of us do!
Liar!
I believe we will bury you.
Groot!
Little help?
Ha!
Who's buried now, sucker?
I believe it's you!
I am Groot!
Well, look who decided to show up after leaving us high and dry.
I am Groot.
Tell Groot I'm not talking to him.
Let's focus on finding the sarcophagus before the Believers get their hands on it.
Okay, the path's a bit overgrown, but I think the Ravagers' hideout is over there.
And tell this walking knothead to stay out of my way!
As promised, one Ravager hideout.
Doesn't look like anyone's been here in years.
- There it is!
- The sarcophagus?
Nope, my magnum opus!
The trap to end all traps.
Tell Groot not to touch my masterpiece.
I am Groot.
- What did he say?
- I have no idea.
Watch this.
Even the slightest touch will trigger the...
Huh.
Is it...
Will, will trigger the...
Oh, come on!
All right, must be sand in the gears.
Nothing a good old blast of wind won't fix!
Should you really be doing that?
I just want to make sure the trap is working in case those Black Order goons show up...
Uh-oh.
Okay, it's working!
This is your famous trap?
It's just a big hole in the ground.
Uh, you think?
Big hole in the ground, huh?
I dare you to find a way out!
You're on!
Whoa!
Not one word.
Word.
- Welcome to the Star-Lord 2000X-Scape.
- I didn't say anything.
He did!
It's the latest in trap-making technology.
Can't get a grip?
That's because this baby's built with a seamless, frictionless, 12-inch metal alloy.
But wait!
There's more!
It also has our patented randomized laser grid.
- It slices, it dices!
Rocket!
- Drax!
Can you hear me?
And don't even think about calling for help, 'cause this trap comes with a powerful EMP generator, guaranteed to stop any broadcast signals from getting out.
Don't call now, operators are not standing by.
Ha!
I don't remember being that annoying back then.
Some things never change So, what now, genius?
And this is my fault?
It appears you were telling the truth after all.
At least the part about the walking tree not having the sarcophagus.
Well, look who joined the party.
The original Black Order Believer himself, Ebony Maw.
Apparently, I'll need to extract the location of the sarcophagus directly from your minds.
Ha!
Good luck with that!
Even the most powerful Believer can't just wish for that kind of mental ability.
I don't need to wish.
I believe.
More importantly, so does everyone on that ship.
Their Belief Energy powers me a thousandfold!
And you will believe, too!
Can you believe this...
I will find the location of the sarcophagus, even if it tears your minds apart!
With Quill, how will you know the difference?
Hey, I heard that!
My mind is as sharp as a...
Now let us see what secrets this mind holds.
What vile abomination is this?
It's a monkey playing the drums.
Come on, man, it's funny!
You think this is a joke?
I am Groot?
Groot...
Dude, why didn't you tell me you were hatching an energy-absorbing parasite?
Who can do that!
Nice birdie!
Whoa!
I am Groot!
Your pathetic pet can't save you from my mental siphon!
Really?
'Cause it looks like baby bird's doing a little siphoning of his own!
Boom!
It shorted out the pit's defenses!
I am Groot.
Groot.
Hey, what about us?
Whoa!
Whoa!
Okay, drop us anywhere!
I believe we will be saved!
I am Groot!
Impossible!
No!
Don't leave us!
- We still have a score to settle.
- Brain freeze!
I believe we should run!
They're getting away.
I don't think so.
Wait for it.
You know, those traps aren't as useless as I thought.
Groot, I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time about that egg.
I had no idea that it was gonna turn into an awesome lightning-shooting space eagle!
Wait.
He's not the only one?
Apparently, Yondu stole the egg from this planet.
What are the odds?
Groot.
I am Groot.
You're just gonna let him go?
I know that was hard, Groot, but it was the right thing to do.
Don't you agree, Peter?
Yeah, I guess so.
But, I mean, a lightning space eagle?
That would have totally rocked!
Am I to understand that you did not locate the sarcophagus?
What a waste of time!
Well, not a total waste.
I did find something down there.
Something for you, Groot.
You know, to make up for me being such a jerk.
I am Groot.
I am Groot?
I am Groot.
I am Groot!
What?
How was I supposed to know?

ROCKET: (GROANS)
This place smells like the wrong end of a Chitauri slime slug!
(SIGHS)
Yeah, brings back a lot of great memories of hanging out here with Yondu and the Ravagers.
The fun games they used to have me play...
"Scrub the Decks,"
"Lug the Grub," "Unclog the Latrine."
Aw, krutack!
Those weren't games, were they?
Quill, I hate to interrupt this stroll down memory lane, but we need to find the sarcophagus before it falls into the hands of the Believers.
(METAL CLATTERING) Right, Rocket?
- Hey, is it my fault Yondu stole it?
- Actually, it is.
Picky, picky.
Besides, even if those nutjobs get their grubby paws on that thingy, there's only a 50-50 chance it'll destroy the universe.
- Those are terrible odds.
- Relax, Gamora.
Now, if I know Yondu... (CHUCKLES) And I do know Yondu, he probably stashed the sarcophagus in one of these old hideouts until he can negotiate the best deal.
All we gotta do is search each one until we find it.
- Easy as pie.
- I have attempted pie.
It is extremely difficult, especially the crust.
My sensitive snout can't take much more of this.
Let's give this dump a once-over and get outta here.
(SHOUTS)
(GRUNTS)
I am Groot!
Careful, Rocket.
These Ravager hideouts are notorious for booby traps.
That's right!
And I'm the booby who set those traps.
Oh, I mean, I built these when I was a teenager, and they still work like a charm.
But don't worry.
You stick close, you don't touch anything, I can get you through.
(BEEPS)
(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)
This will not end well.
Just do what I do.
Come on, it's awesome!
This is almost as difficult as pie.
(SHOUTS)
And almost as deadly as your pies, Drax.
Besides, dancing is for suckers!
(CHUCKLES)
GAMORA:
Any sign of the sarcophagus?
Nope, but I found this!

It's a monkey, people.

That's me.
We're not right here now, but prepare to be destroyed at the beep.

Better luck next time!
Oh, wait.
There won't be a next time.

What kind of idiot builds a trap without a kill switch?
Oh, give me a break!
This is some of my earliest work!
You should see my later stuff.
If we live that long!
All right, this way!
Only step on the green tiles.
Or it might have been the red ones.

Did you happen to notice that you almost got us incinerated?
But I didn't!
Where's Groot?
Ah, krutack!
He's still inside!
Groot, where are ya?
Whoa!
I am Groot!
You stayed here for an egg?
Very wise.
Eggs are part of a nutritious breakfast.
And omelets are much easier than pie.
(GRUNTS)
I am Groot!
Easy!
Nobody's gonna cook your precious egg!
Groot can get very attached to helpless weaklings.
You should not describe yourself in such a manner.
I meant we should let him keep the stupid egg until this nurturing phase has run its course.
Fine.
How long can that take?

Oh, okay, that has to be where Yondu hid the sarcophagus, 'cause my trap there is so mind-blowingly awesome.
You do realize we don't actually want to get caught in one of your stupid traps, right?
Well, duh.
The only thing I'm better at than building traps is dodging them.
There isn't a trap made that I can't get out of, except maybe my masterpiece on Veros Seven.
No one can get outta that bad boy!
(ENGINES POWERING DOWN)
GAMORA:
Engines are shutting down!
Whoa!
I just did our 400,000-light-year checkup!
What could've caused this?
(GASPS) Groot!
I am Groot.
Just 'cause Quill told you to stay here don't mean you gotta listen to him!
Uh, Groot, old buddy, I'm sorry I stuck you in there, but if we don't get those engines cleared, all you're gonna be left with is scrambled eggs!
I like scrambled eggs.
Although, I prefer omelets.
Not helping!
(ALL SHOUTING)
Okay, just so you know, I blame you for this.
You and the stupid egg that's probably never gonna hatch!
I am Groot!
Cool down, both of you!
This damage ain't as bad as it looks.
Well, fine!
You fix it while we go and check the Ravager hideout.
Drax, stay and give me a hand.
Groot ain't gonna be much help.
(SING SONG) I am Groot.
QUILL:
Try and keep up, will you?
- (GRUNTS) Be patient with him.
- Oh, sure.
"Everybody be patient with Groot!"
No one was half this nice when I got into roller disco.
Groot's behavior is selfless, nurturing, and irritates the krutack out of you.
I don't have a problem with any of those things.
(QUILL SCREAMS)
Halt, non-Believers.
Black Dwarf and Proxima Midnight?
Oh, that's great.
'Cause this day just wouldn't be complete without a couple of Black Order goons!
You have something we want.
Give it to us, or be destroyed!
I am Groot!
Groot, FYI,
I kind of blame you for this, too.
(SHOUTS)
(YELLING)
The sarcophagus!
Where is it?
(GRUNTS)
(SHOUTS) (GRUNTS)
(GRUNTING)
The sarcophagus and its contents will be ours, for we believe.
Believe this!
I am Groot!
Anytime you wanna help, Groot!
Bring me the sarcophagus!
Not on your life.
(GRUNTS)
(GROWLING)
(GROANS) Did the entire Black Order join up with those crackpot Believers?
Maybe their buddy Ebony Maw got them a group discount!
The tree is hiding something.
It must be what we seek.
(GRUNTS)
Give it your best shot.
We got you outnumbered.
That's unfortunate, but it's still an even match. (SHOUTS)
(BLACK DWARF ROARING)
Stand still and accept your fate!
You first!
(SIGHS)
(GROWLS)
(YELLS)
You cannot win, for I believe I am impervious to your attacks.
(ENERGY PULSING)
(STRAINING)
I believe I will break free.
(GROWLS)
Whoa.
Quill!
(SIGHS)
(CHUCKLES)
Eyes on the enemy!
Tell your cowardly wooden friend to give us the sarcophagus!
He doesn't have it!
None of us do!
Liar!
I believe we will bury you.
(PANTING)
QUILL:
Groot!
(GASPS)
Little help?
(GROUND RUMBLING)
Ha!
Who's buried now, sucker?
I believe it's you!
I am Groot!
Well, look who decided to show up after leaving us high and dry.
I am Groot.
Tell Groot I'm not talking to him.
Let's focus on finding the sarcophagus before the Believers get their hands on it.
Okay, the path's a bit overgrown, but I think the Ravagers' hideout is over there.
And tell this walking knothead to stay out of my way!
(GRUNTING)
As promised, one Ravager hideout.
Doesn't look like anyone's been here in years.
- (GASPS) There it is!
- The sarcophagus?
Nope, my magnum opus!
The trap to end all traps.
Tell Groot not to touch my masterpiece.
I am Groot.
- What did he say?
- I have no idea.
Watch this.
Even the slightest touch will trigger the...
Huh.
Is it...
Will, will trigger the...
Oh, come on!
(GRUNTING)
(HUFFING)
All right, must be sand in the gears.
Nothing a good old blast of wind won't fix!
Should you really be doing that?
I just want to make sure the trap is working in case those Black Order goons show up...
(AIR WHOOSHING)
(ALL COUGHING)
Uh-oh.
(ALL YELLING)
QUILL:
Okay, it's working!
This is your famous trap?
It's just a big hole in the ground.
Uh, you think?
(ALL SCREAMING)
(SIGHS)
Big hole in the ground, huh?
I dare you to find a way out!
You're on!
(YELLING)
Whoa!
Not one word.
(SOFTLY) Word.
- Welcome to the Star-Lord 2000X-Scape.
- I didn't say anything.
He did!
It's the latest in trap-making technology.
(GRUNTING)
Can't get a grip?
That's because this baby's built with a seamless, frictionless, 12-inch metal alloy.
But wait!
There's more!
It also has our patented randomized laser grid.
- It slices, it dices!
Rocket!
- Drax!
Can you hear me?
And don't even think about calling for help, 'cause this trap comes with a powerful EMP generator, guaranteed to stop any broadcast signals from getting out.
Don't call now, operators are not standing by.
Ha!
I don't remember being that annoying back then.
Some things never change So, what now, genius?
And this is my fault?
EBONY MAW:
It appears you were telling the truth after all.
At least the part about the walking tree not having the sarcophagus.
Well, look who joined the party.
The original Black Order Believer himself, Ebony Maw.
Apparently, I'll need to extract the location of the sarcophagus directly from your minds.
Ha!
Good luck with that!
Even the most powerful Believer can't just wish for that kind of mental ability.
I don't need to wish.
I believe.
More importantly, so does everyone on that ship.
Their Belief Energy powers me a thousandfold!
And you will believe, too!
Can you believe this... (ALL SCREAMING)
(ALL SCREAMING)
I will find the location of the sarcophagus, even if it tears your minds apart!
(QUILL GROANING) With Quill, how will you know the difference?
Hey, I heard that!
My mind is as sharp as a... (SCREAMS)
(GROANS)
Now let us see what secrets this mind holds.
(MONKEY SHRIEKING)
(CYMBALS BANGING)
(SHRIEKING)
What vile abomination is this?
(GRUNTS)
It's a monkey playing the drums.
Come on, man, it's funny!
You think this is a joke?
(YELLS)
(ALL SCREAMING)
I am Groot?
Groot... (ALL SCREAMING)
(SHRIEKS)
Dude, why didn't you tell me you were hatching an energy-absorbing parasite?
Who can do that!
Nice birdie!
Whoa!
(YELPS)
I am Groot!
(SCREECHES)
Your pathetic pet can't save you from my mental siphon!
(GROWLING)
Really?
'Cause it looks like baby bird's doing a little siphoning of his own!
Boom!
It shorted out the pit's defenses!
I am Groot.
(SCREECHING) Groot.
Hey, what about us?
Whoa!
(PANTING)
(BIRD SCREECHING)
Whoa!
Okay, drop us anywhere!
I believe we will be saved!
(ENGINE HUMMING OVERHEAD)
I am Groot!
(SCREECHES)
Impossible!
No!
Don't leave us!
- We still have a score to settle.
- Brain freeze!
(SCREAMS)
I believe we should run!
They're getting away.
I don't think so.
Wait for it.
You know, those traps aren't as useless as I thought.
Groot, I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time about that egg.
I had no idea that it was gonna turn into an awesome lightning-shooting space eagle!
(BIRDS SCREECHING)
Wait.
He's not the only one?
Apparently, Yondu stole the egg from this planet.
What are the odds?
Groot.
(SIGHS) I am Groot.
(SCREECHING)
You're just gonna let him go?
I know that was hard, Groot, but it was the right thing to do.
Don't you agree, Peter?
Yeah, I guess so.
But, I mean, a lightning space eagle?
That would have totally rocked!
DRAX:
Am I to understand that you did not locate the sarcophagus?
What a waste of time!
Well, not a total waste.
I did find something down there.
Something for you, Groot.
You know, to make up for me being such a jerk.
I am Groot.
(CREATURE COOING)
I am Groot?
(SCREECHING) I am Groot.
(GROANING) I am Groot!
QUILL:
What?
How was I supposed to know?

Skylar, get off your butt and unload the car.
Hey, I know you girls heard me.
Go get the groceries.
Did you get more yogurt?
Nope.
Wasn't on the list.
I always eat yogurt.
Well, then you should have put it on the list.
Now go help.
Come on.
Good morning.
Oh, Christ.
I think I'm getting sick.
I brought you something.
Thanks, love.
I'm going to Burbank later to pick up a new girl.
Where is she from?
Florida.
18.
Looks like she's 14.
Double D's, but I'll believe that when I fucking see it.
We'll do a cam-show tonight.
- We'll ease her in, okay?
- Mm-hmm.
What's her name?
Kayla.
We'll put her in Skylar's room.
Oh, can you tell her or Monique or Shannon, whoever the fuck it is that's flushing tampons down the fucking toilet to knock it off?
They're fucking up the pipes.
I've told them before, but I'll tell them again.
All right.
Cheers, love.
Oh, and can you turn the AC down a bit?
It's hotter than shit in here.
Chrissy... thanks for the breakfast.
Don't know what we'd do without you, love.
I'm gonna fight again.
I mean, they're setting it up right now, but, yeah.
Yeah.
Legends Fight.
- That's what they call it.
- Hmm.
I'm a legend.
Crazy.
I wasn't looking for it.
You know, it came out of the blue.
It...
I'm done, you know?
I've been done 10 years.
Even then, I...
I fought too long.
What makes you say that?
- What?
- That you fought too long?
I mean...
My last few fights weren't too good, you know?
I-I lost a couple that I shouldn't have.
I lost the last one.
It still bothers me.
You mean as far as legacy?
Oh, fuck that.
Fuck legacy.
I don't care how some motherfucker sees me in his head, you know?
It's, uh...
It's useless.
You fucking die, you're gone.
Nobody's thinking about you.
Unless they want to blame for some of their own shit, you know, whatever that may be.
What I'm talking about is an... is an... is an open wound.
You know what I mean?
It's a job not complete.
You win, you go out on your own terms.
You lose... they push you the fuck out.
Couldn't finish.
What happens if you lose again?
Where does that put you?
You're thinking too far ahead.
No, I don't...
I don't...
Honestly, ever since this came up,
I...
I, uh...
I feel optimistic.
Optimistic about the future?
Yeah, I guess.
Maybe.
I mean, I don't know.
You know, I just...
I'll tell you what.
I haven't felt like this in a while.
Well, that's a good thing.
I want to come off the Lexapro.
Well, we tried that before.
It didn't go so well.
Yeah, well, I was a fucking idiot before.
You know, we do it the right way this time.
You wean me off.
You'll still feel some withdrawals.
You got anxiety, uh, depression, irritability...
Mm-hmm. insomnia.
Okay.
I mean, I can handle it.
I'm gonna fight again.
I got to...
I got to feel something.
I got to feel my full range of emotions, you know?
I got to be who I was.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Ryan, this is what happens when you don't help me with these.
And I...
What?
Why?
Coming.
Good morning.
I'm looking for Ryan Wheeler.
King Beast?
That's right.
Does he live here?
Ryan?
Rough neighborhood, huh?
If you're a sex offender, this neighborhood is a jungle, sir.
I bet.
- Ryan?
- What, Keith?
What?
Someone's here.
Oh, hey, man.
What are you doing here?
I have a gift for you.
Your chariot awaits.
A gift from your friends at King Beast and the Middle East.
- You're giving this to me?
- Yes.
It's a nice car.
It's a beautiful car.
Thing is, I already have a car.
What I don't have is a contract.
I'll give you both.
Talk to Lisa.
Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait.
Hey, hey, hey.
I love Lisa, okay?
She does a great job for you, but she's a manager.
Sometimes they cloud the message.
I want you to know exactly... exactly how important you are to this promotion, okay?
Please.
It's a gift from me to you, no strings.
One string.
You come out with me tonight, let me show you the love.
You don't like it, we part ways, but you keep the car.
We've been through a lot together, man.
Give me one night.
It's about time you spent some fucking money on me.
I love it.
Bring a sports coat, okay?
- Classy night tonight.
- Okay.
Yeah.
I'll have a car sent for you.
Hey, don't tell Lisa, huh?
Boys' night out.
Take your vitamins, motherfucker.
We're gonna have some good times.
As you surface... slowly feeling your surroundings... and when you're ready, open your eyes.
Okay.
Ahh.
Does anyone want to talk about their experience?
Tim, go ahead.
Uh, at first, I felt kind of fidgety, just couldn't sit still, was thinking to myself,
"Well, Tim, here's another thing you suck at."
And that lasted about 19 minutes.
But then I went back to my mantra.
And that last minute was solid.
That's great, Tim.
Thank you.
Anyone else?
Lisa.
Uh, yeah,
I didn't have any trouble at all, unlike Tim here.
Um, I just felt completely still, but, like, in my soul, you know?
Does anyone ever have that?
No.
No.
And then, for some reason,
I thought of a bunch of Smurfs carrying a cantaloupe.
Except they weren't blue, so I have no idea what that means.
When the mind is still, we can think of some pretty funny things.
Uh, what color were they?
All different colors.
Oh, like a rainbow.
Yeah, like a rainbow.
Exactly.
Uh, Lisa?
Tim.
Hi.
You are so good at meditation.
I mean, the way you keep your eyes open the whole time... that is just next-level shit.
I learned it from an old Indian woman.
Oh, wow.
- I would love to get her number.
- Oy.
Unfortunately, she, uh, doesn't have a phone.
She lives outside.
That makes sense.
Uh, sorry.
Do you want to maybe have dinner sometime?
Uh, normally I would slow-play this, but I don't really think you're coming back 'cause you're already so good.
Yeah.
I don't like tapas.
Big plates.
Got it.
Hello, uh, Andy.
- Jay Kulina.
- What do you want?
I've been calling you for several days.
Why haven't you called me back?
My bad.
It's nobody's bad.
Just return my fucking phone calls.
You have a hostile tone.
No.
I have a cordial tone.
I'm being very cordial.
I tried to give you information via telephone, but you refused to accept my phone calls, so I've had to knock on your door, which has been an inconvenience for us both.
I live here.
And you're making me very uncomfortable.
I do not feel safe in the home
- that I am lawfully inhabiting.
- Mnh.
Nope.
Nope.
- Yes.
- No, sir.
Yes.
Your tone... it's aggressive and alarming.
So, uh, get off the property, or I will call the police.
Whoa.
What the fuck are you doing, man?
Get out of my house.
I'm showing this house on Thursday.
That's all.
Yeah, well, you just fucked up.
Fuck.
Oh, you're so fucking big!
Where is it?
Damn, you keep grabbing my balls.
Ouch.
Cheating motherfucker.
Oh!
What's the matter, old man?
You hurt your hand?
What's going on?
Fighting Dirty.
My hand is sore.
You're out of shape.
Yeah.
Ohh.
I had a few last night.
With who?
Friends.
What friends, huh?
Female friends?
Huh?
Don't be putting a... a baby in any of those friends.
I don't want you ending up like your brother.
That's a very nice thing to say about your granddaughter.
I love that kid, man.
I'm just saying, you know, you have a baby, you got to give up on the things that you want.
Didn't seem to slow you down.
Nothing does.
Two more?
As many as you want, kid.
Nothing.
Up!
Up!
Coming to dinner tonight?
What are you making?
Huh?
What are you making?
What do you mean, what am I making?
Are you coming to dinner?
You'll eat what I make.
What I make you're gonna eat, right?
Ohh!
- Good morning, Mr. Mooney.
- Good morning...
This is Kayla with the double D's.
Hey.
Hi, Kayla.
I'm Christina.
Hey, listen to her if you want to stay around.
Shannon.
Shannon.
Oh, my god, you guys are...
you guys are so cute.
I actually...
I used to have that top.
- It's really cute.
- Thank you.
Come on.
I'll get you settled in.
You'll be sharing a room with Skylar.
It's comfy.
The bathroom's in the hall.
There's plenty of food in the kitchen.
You can help yourself to whatever you want as long as there's nobody's name on it.
And if there's anything special you want for snacks, put it on the list on the fridge.
Is this where I do my shows?
Sometimes.
We have double beds in the other rooms.
Yeah.
Terry said I'm doing one tonight, so I'm so fucking excited.
Have you, uh, ever done VIP?
Yeah, like, all the time.
It's mostly, like, all I did in Florida.
Ah.
Oh, wait, I wanted to show you.
Um, Terry already got me, like, 50 new followers.
I only have 73, but I just started this one.
Amber Taylor.
Do you like that?
Or are there, like, too many Ambers already?
No such thing as too many Ambers.
God, I'm gonna blow the fuck up out here.
I love L.A.
- Hey, Shel.
- Hey.
Is there a guy named Dominick here to see me?
Yes.
He is, um, on the mat with Juan.
That shit, right?
Very simple.
It's there for you,
- especially being a wrestler.
- Yes.
- Nice job.
- Thank you.
Dominick?
- Hi.
I'm Lisa Prince.
- Hi, Lisa.
How are you?
- Sorry I'm late.
- No.
It's okay.
I met Juan over here.
- He's a killer.
- Yeah.
We'll just go back in my office.
I quit fighting about six years ago, went to business school, got a good job, you know, lots of money, mortgage, you know, steaks in the freezer, all of it.
Never been more miserable in my fucking life.
- God.
You and every other ex-fighter.
- No, no, no.
It's...
It's different for me.
You know, I-I don't go chasing that.
You know, I can't do what I used to do, right?
So, that's life.
I accept it and move on.
I just felt that, you know,
I had a lot more to give, you know?
And, uh, I realized that I'm a lot better coach than I ever was as a fighter.
So, maybe it's 'cause my mom was an educator, but whatever it is, I know that this... this is what I'm meant to do, you know?
You moved to L.A. four months ago?
Yeah.
From Jersey.
Why?
It's turning 40.
Having a mid-life, you know?
I just needed to shake things up.
Why?
Can I say it's personal reasons, and we just leave it at that?
Yeah.
Not if you want a job.
I don't want to shit-talk on anyone.
The guy whose gym it was...
I didn't like the way he did business.
How so?
He was managing them, too, wasn't paying them bonuses right, putting them in shitty fights, setting them up to fail.
He was fucking greedy.
Not for me.
I manage a lot of the fighters here.
Do you have a problem with that?
No, ma'am.
I did my homework on you.
You got a good reputation.
People respect you.
I just want to be with people who do things the right way.
You do things the right way.
Hi, Maya.
Hello, beautiful girl.
Hi.
You know, I'm pissed at you.
Why?
You haven't even called me in three weeks.
Phone works both ways, though.
I don't like having to invite myself over to see my granddaughter, my baby granddaughter.
Mom, you're right.
I'm gonna call more.
Where's Amy?
She's getting a cavity filled.
She's gonna be home soon.
I got to go back to work.
You two hanging in there?
We're tired.
Babies are hard.
You need to be there for her, Jay.
However tired you are, it's a thousand times worse for her.
Isn't that right?
Isn't that right?
Your phone's buzzing.
Who is it?
Um...
Dan?
Dan.
Yeah.
That's not how it happened.
Yeah, I understand.
I can be there in 30 minutes.
It could even be sooner.
I-I just, uh...
I've...
I've got a child issue, so...
I got to go to work.
You need me to watch her?
No.
Amy will be home soon.
I'm just gonna put her down for her nap.
We're getting her baptized.
You'll be there.
Catholic?
Yeah.
Well, I think that's really nice.
Even if you don't believe in it, it's good to have the morals.
You'll be there?
Of course I'll be there.
All right.
- There you go.
- Thank you, pal.
How you want to do this going forward?
Uh, no change, man.
Fight's in California, right?
- No TRT.
- Yeah, but I, uh...
I don't have to piss until I sign a contract, and I'm...
I'm not gonna sign a contract till the day of.
What's Garo gonna do, right?
Yeah, but they got all this shit now that they don't even know how to test for.
Mac, I just want to...
I just want to keep what I got here, pal.
Come in.
Hey, Mac.
Okay.
Hi.
How long you gonna keep that up for?
I don't know.
No deal, no test, you know.
Gotcha.
I got a coach I want you to meet.
- Who?
- Dom Ramos.
- Where's he from?
- East Coast.
Kenny from Black House said that he wanted him, but he didn't have the room.
Oh, you're killing me with these fucking meetings.
- How many more of them I got to do?
- Three more... after this one.
- He's here?
- Mm-hmm.
In my office.
Come.
See for yourself.
All right, I'll be right there.
I'll be right there.
Jesus Christ.
Did you push your way into the house?
I spoke to him in his front door...
- But were you...
- in his jamb on the door.
- Were you in the man's house?
- No!
Fuck, no!
Jay, were you in the man's house?
Fuck.
Dude, I just spent 45 minutes trying to convince him not to file a police report.
Police report?
Yeah.
He provoked me.
- Wait.
He provoked you?
- He fucking provoked me, and he's gonna file a police report?
Yeah.
What are you, a fucking wild dog?
Get a grip, okay?
Look, the guy... he's an asshole, okay?
I'd like to shoot him in the fucking face, but I don't because I have a lot to lose.
Oh, man, you're...
Look, you're a nice guy, okay?
But you're acting crazy, and I just...
I can't...
I can't get sued.
Maybe this isn't for you, man.
- Yes, it is.
- No, I...
- Yes, it is, Dan.
- I don't...
I don't see it.
- Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan.
- I don't...
I don't see it.
- I don't see it, dude.
I don't...
- Dan, Dan.
What?
- Listen to me.
- Mm-hmm.
I have a daughter.
I can do better.
I can.
But I cannot lose this job.
So, I'm asking you.
I'm begging you.
I have two kids.
This is my business, man.
All right, go home.
You're done for the day.
I'm taking you off the Culver house.
We're gonna give you new listings tomorrow.
I don't have an offer.
Nothing?
Fuck, man.
The UFC loves you.
The offer is coming.
These things always take longer than they should.
Ryan?
Hello?
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.
Why haven't they offered yet?
Sean Shelby's traveling.
Well, then just talk to somebody else.
I'm not going to call them.
It looks weak.
Lisa, all due respect, you said that I was gonna have leverage.
And you do.
Well, it doesn't feel like it because there's not even an offer and they're treating me like shit, so fuck them.
Take a deep breath and let it play out.
Hey, hey, if they...
if they fuck around, they're gonna lose me.
You tell them that.
Motherfucker.
Are you finished?
You want some shake?
No, I'm good.
No?
I need a good shake.
So, you, uh... you're primarily a striker?
Yeah, yeah.
I got a black belt in BJJ, so I can help you out there, too, so...
I got Joe Daddy for that.
Uh, you know, basically I need somebody to hold pads,
- move around with these guys.
- All right.
- I'll do that all day.
- Good.
Why'd you leave your last gym?
What happened?
- Female.
- Mm.
Hand to God.
But I learned my lesson, though.
Yeah.
We all do.
Where you from?
You sound...
You sound familiar.
The Bronx.
- Puerto Rican.
- Wow.
You don't get many Puerto Ricans in the Bronx, now, do you?
South Bronx, not Puerto Rican.
Yeah.
No, no, I know where you're from.
King Kulina casts a long shadow, brother.
Well, I don't know about that.
You do.
You do.
You ever head back?
- To New York?
- Yeah.
Nah.
It's fucking cold.
What do I want to go back there for?
- Yeah, freeze your fucking balls off.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
So, Lisa... she told you that I'm gonna fight again?
Mm-hmm.
I think it's great.
Well, it's that or it's a shit-show.
Who knows?
Either way, I'm gonna need somebody to pick up the slack while I'm training.
All right.
Well, listen.
I can take on as much or as little as you need.
- Whatever lightens your load, I got it.
- Okay.
All right.
Yeah, that's great.
That's great.
I, uh...
Well, that's it.
I mean, you have any other questions, you call Lisa.
Uh, I think we're seeing a couple more people, but, you know, we'll let you know
- next day or so.
- Cool.
- All right?
- Yeah.
- Good.
Thanks for coming down.
- Hey.
It's an honor to meet you, really.
- Nah.
- No.
It is.
It's an honor.
If I didn't make it clear,
I really want to be a part of this.
All right.
All right.
We'll talk soon, all right?
- Yes, sir.
- Thanks, man.
Yeah.
Fuck.
Come on.
Terry will set up the camera, make sure you're lit.
- You know how to stream video?
- Yeah.
What service do you guys use?
I don't remember the name, but, um, we'll start you at $2 a minute.
And if you bring in more guys, you can charge whatever you want.
- Just got to get them hooked?
- Yeah.
Now, rember, you run the show.
If some guy asks you to do something and you don't feel comfortable, you cut them off.
You're in charge.
Hey, I mean, it's cool.
Most guys just need a friend.
Change of plans.
Get dressed.
Where is she going?
Glendale to do a scene.
Hey, it's cold out!
Get your...
Grab your coat!
Those guys are fucking assholes.
She just got here.
I have got a fucking headache, Chrissy.
I don't want to fucking talk about it, okay?
This is her first night.
Let her do the cam show.
She's not ready for this.
How the fuck do you know what she's ready for?
Come on.
Hey, what's under them sweats?
Should I change them?
No, keep them.
But take this.
Whoo!
Let's go.
What'd you think of Dom?
Eh.
You don't like anyone.
He's okay.
"He's okay."
All right, did you like him more or less than the others?
I liked him more or less.
You're killing me.
What the fuck do you want?
I spoke to him for 10 minutes.
- What do you want me to tell you?
- And whose fault is that?
I talked to Juan.
He said he was all right, he was good, he had some good ideas, he liked him.
You like him, right?
I like him for the money, but I can keep looking.
Mnh.
No.
No, no, no.
Enough with these desperate cunts.
Really, it's depressing me.
Yeah, well, we're scraping the bottom of the desperate-cunt barrel right now, so we really need to make a decision.
No.
Just hire him.
Go.
It's good.
It's good.
I'm...
I'm excited.
I'll call him tonight.
Don't hurt yourself.
That's very funny.
Wouldn't hurt you to exercise a bit.
Oh, God.
It's game time, baby.
Dude, we're trying to put the fucking baby down, dude.
- Fuck, man.
I'm...
- Are you kidding me?
I'm sorry, dude.
I didn't fucking know.
- Hey...
- What the fuck you wearing, man?
It's a Jay Kulina special.
That's what this is.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Looks like it's off the rack.
Looks highly fucking flammable.
I'd never fucking wear that shit.
- Go get dressed.
- We're going out.
I'm not going anywhere, man.
I got to go down.
- Dude, dude.
- What?
I have a limousine sitting out there.
Go get dressed.
We're going.
Yeah.
I'm fucking broke, dude.
- I can't afford a goddamn drink.
- Hey, hey, Garo's paying.
He wants me to sign.
Everything is covered.
Hey, when was the last fucking time
- we hung out, bro?
- Shh.
No.
When's the last time we hung out?
I miss my fucking friend, man.
No homo.
I miss you, bro.
Stop.
What, are you gonna make me fucking go alone?
Shh.
Look, I'm gonna sit in a fucking limousine by myself?
- Come on, man.
- Let me talk to Amy.
- Put a fucking suit on.
- Shut up.
- Put a fucking suit on.
- Shut the fuck up.
Never bang on this fucking door at night again.
Okay.
I'm gonna be out in a minute.
- Shh.
- Just go in the fucking...
Go!
Thank you, Amy.
Fuck, yes.
Hey.
It's Dom.
Hey, Dom.
It's Lisa Prince.
Hey.
How's it going?
Good.
Is this a bad time?
No, no, no, no, no.
What's, uh...
What's going on?
Uh, well, I spoke to Alvey, and we'd like to offer you the job.
We think you'd be a great fit.
Dom?
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, I'm...
I'm, uh, super excited, super excited.
I got to be honest with you.
I thought I, um...
I thought I...
I thought I fucked it up with Alvey.
No.
He just hates interviews.
Don't worry about it.
It's all good.
I fucking hate them, too.
So, like I said, the job pays $900 a week, and there's no benefits.
Why is there no benefits?
I told you that before.
Right.
Can you do...
Can you do $1,200?
The job pays $900 a week.
It's the best we can do.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Great.
Come by tomorrow, and we'll get your paperwork done.
God bless you.
God bless you.
God bless you, too.
What the fuck?
Yes!
Yes!
Motherfucker!
Yes!
Come on.
Come on.
Come get it.
Before the evening commences...
What?
What's up?
I just want to tell you that we're gonna be baptizing Maya.
- Yeah.
- Amy and I would greatly appreciate your presence there.
Dude, hell, yes.
I'll be there.
- Good.
- God is good, man.
Hey.
Ugh.
God is great.
Garo's gonna pay me a shit-ton of money.
- You want to know why?
- Why?
'Cause I'm a fucking legend.
I am a fucking legend.
- You are.
- And that's why they call it a Legends fight.
- You are definitely a legend.
- Yeah.
Mm.
Honor thy father.
Mmm.
Fuck.
You think I'm too old?
Yeah.
Yes.
I'm serious.
You think I'm too old?
Yeah.
You fucking think I'm too old?
I think you're an old man with old-man balls.
Hmm?
All right, you need to back up.
- You think I'm too old?
- Yes.
- Really?
- All right, you need to back up.
- What are you gonna do?
- What's that?
- Ooh.
- That's old-man strength.
Oh, where you going, big guy?
Where you going?
Whoa!
Think I'm gonna break your hip.
You're gonna break my hip?
I'll put you through the window, you cunt.
- Ahh!
- All right, we're gonna break something.
I can't afford to replace anything.
All right, on three, we're gonna let each other go.
On three, on three.
Oh, I love you so much.
One, two, three.
Ahh!
You cocksucker.
No, seriously, seriously, seriously.
Seriously.
I got a stomachache.
On three.
One, two, three.
Ahh.
Mnh.
That's old-man strength, my friend.
Well, something.
You want pizza?
Sure.
Word.
Who do you want to fight?
Uh...
Hughes.
I want to fight Hughes, that fucking farm boy.
I got a score to settle with him.
He's tough.
Yeah.
So what?
I'll fucking beat him.
I'm not gonna embarrass you.
I wouldn't do it if I didn't think I could.
We'll get you ready.
Run.
Be free.
Yeah, be free.
Having fun?
Yeah, it is very nice.
All for you, my friend, all for you.
Let me tell you something.
If you ever want to come back, you always, always have a home with me.
No?
Okay.
Aah.
Ahh.
How's your brother?
Nate could use a fight.
Eh.
Can we have an awkward conversation?
Fire away, Garo.
Do you know why Nate's fight fell apart?
Yeah.
Dixon got hurt.
No, that's not what happened.
There's a rumor that your brother's a fag.
I'm not saying it.
I'm not saying it.
- He's not.
- No.
He's not.
- Who the fuck is saying that?
- Eh, many people...
Whoa!
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm just talking that it's just out there!
It's just out there!
Take it easy, man!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's okay.
He's drunk.
He's drunk.
It's okay.
Relax.
We're gonna have a fun time.
Jesus.
Relax.
Hey.
What's up?
Man, you got a problem.
What?
Um... people know, man.
People know what?
Um, about you.
Garo just told me that Dixon pulled out of the fight because he heard you were fucking gay.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Casey.
You told Casey?
She looked through my phone a year and a half ago, and she fucking told her cousin in Anaheim.
Okay, fucking Dixon trains in Anaheim.
Fuck.
Oh, my God.
Is...
Is Garo running his mouth?
No.
I threatened his life in a very fucking credible way.
He's not gonna say shit, but...
it's out there.
Fuck.
I'm just telling you.
Alvey's gonna find out.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
2015,
Dana went into rehab for a second time.
With meth-addiction statistics at a 7% recovery rate, the odds were against her, but Dana's family remained hopeful...
What happened?
She's fine.
She did a scene.
Fuck.
What's wrong with you?
I feel like shit.
My whole fucking body hurts.
You should go to the doctor.
Shut the fuck up, please, and go away.
Kayla?
Kayla, let me in, sweetie.
Come on.
What did they do?
Did you vomit?
Yeah.
They wanted me to.
What happened to you?
Nothing.
It was for a fetish site.
They were really respectful, and I think they got the scene that they wanted.
They seemed really happy.
Uh, I don't want to be a bitch.
Can I just take a bath?
I just kind of want to be alone.
Of course, sweetie.
I love fucking drinking.
Love the culture of it, you know?
Around the world.
Germans and Chinese and Mongolians, fucking Chileans...
We're all fucking drinking.
You know why that is?
Three reasons.
Number one is we are slaves to ritual.
Same reason why I fucking train every day.
Men crave the same shit day in, day out, same fucking time, like dogs.
Without ritual, there is no rhyme or fucking reason, which of course, there isn't anyway.
But, uh... you got to go in blind and buy the myth.
What are the other two?
Pain relief and pussy.
You should write a book.
Maybe I will.
Mm.
Listen, the sh... the shit I was...
I was saying earlier about Jay... you know, it just... it came out wrong.
I didn't...
I didn't...
I didn't mean it the way it sounded.
No, no, I know he loves the baby.
I do.
I just...
You know, you have a kid, you got to fucking sacrifice a lot.
And then next thing you know, you're fucking selling real estate, and I know he doesn't want to do that.
It's worth it to him.
I mean, he loves Maya... and Amy, too.
I know.
I know.
I know he loves that baby, and she's good for him...
Amy.
She's a...
She's a good kid.
And I, you know...
I don't know.
I just...
Just be careful, all right?
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah.
You all right?
Yeah.
I think I'm gonna go, though.
I'm gonna go home.
Yeah?
So early?
I'm tired.
All right.
It was good, yeah?
It was a good meal.
I'll...
I'll see you tomorrow, all right?
I think I'm actually gonna take a couple days off.
Yeah.
But I'll, uh...
I'll see you at the baptism.
What baptism?
For Maya?
Jay didn't mention anything about it.
Who's...
Who going?
Uh, Mom, Ryan, Lisa.
Lisa?
Hmm.
Never said a word to me.
Okay.
All right, good.
Don't worry about it.
It's all right.
We'll figure it out.
All right.
Leave it.
Leave it.
Leave it.
You okay to drive?
- Yeah.
- All right.
- We'll talk.
- Yeah.
Be careful.
Yep.
Ladies, we need some privacy.
I love you.
Okay.
Give us a second.
Mmm.
What is this?
This is the part of my job that I love.
This is where I get to change a friend's life.
I have two things in my possession.
Both belong to you.
Would you like to know what they are?
- Yes, I would.
- All right.
This is $25,000 in cash.
And this is a contract.
If you sign the contract, the cash is yours.
25 grand, Garo?
25 grand.
Let me get this straight.
You think that an eight ball and some titties in my face are gonna convince me to fucking bend over for $25,000, Garo?
No.
No.
I don't think this.
The 25 grand is a signing bonus, under the table, tax-free.
The contract...
The contract... is three fights for the sum of $300,000.
Now, if you sign right now, you get the cash and the deal.
But if you don't, the deal's off the table.
Ryan, the UFC will offer, but it won't be close.
Let's fucking do it!
Yes!
Let's do it!
Yes!
Take it easy.
Hey, hey, hey, take it easy.
I need you sober.
You're gonna be training.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Ah!
Yeah!
Fucking idiot.
Hi.
This is Jay Kulina.
Fuck.
What?
Don't send me to voicemail.
The baby's sleeping.
Is there something wrong?
I heard you're getting Maya baptized.
Your brother told me.
We don't have a date yet.
I'd like to be there.
Mm.
Well, I will let you know when we have a date.
I'm sorry for calling so late.
Good night.
Tonight, the scandal at the top of Britain's banking establishment caught on tape.
Interest rates were rigged.
There are calls for an inquiry into whether Parliament was misled.
That is shocking.
We need an immediate inquiry to look into exactly who knew what, when.
Last week, two Barclays bankers walked free from court.
- How are you feeling?
- Delighted.
But what about the bankers accused of conspiring with them who've been jailed?
Barclays, they just threw us to the wolves.
They get off with their fine while we rot in jail.
We ask, should they have been prosecuted?
'You've got the Bank of England involved in the whole thing.'
It's my opinion that if this was available last year, the result might have been very different.
- Stylianos.
How are you feeling?
- Delighted.
Last week, two former Barclays traders,
Ryan Reich and Stylianos Contogoulas, walked free from court, cleared of conspiracy to defraud by rigging interest rates.
It was the end of a long battle to clear their names.
I am very happy, obviously, and this has been five and a half years of my life, and I just want to go back to my family now.
That's it.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you, thank you.
Sometimes I look at it and I think I'm in a bad movie.
It's like...
It's just something completely...
If you'd told me this ten years ago, I would say, "You're mad."
It's destroyed big parts of my life, like my career, totally gone.
I'm very sad that people are in jail when they shouldn't be, that's my opinion.
The acquittals raised serious questions about the convictions of four other Barclays bankers who Stylianos Contogoulas was accused of conspiring with.
They were convicted and jailed last June.
Four ex-employees of Barclay Bank have been sentenced to jail for rigging Libor, the benchmark for how much it costs banks to borrow from each other.
'I've been investigating this story for the last 18 months.'
I just can't believe it, at this age, my son goes to jail?
Jay Merchant, who's 45, he was sentenced to six and a half years.
Peter Johnson, who's 61, was sentenced to four years.
Jonathan, do you have anything to say?
Jonathan Mathew, 35, was sentenced to four years.
How are you feeling about it?
- Not great.
- Not great.
And Alex Pabon, an American who worked for Barclays.
He was sentenced to nearly three years.
I don't know what you want, you want your Cheerios?
- Oh, God!
- Oh, yeah.
- OK.
Just two hours before he was jailed, he and his wife Julie agreed to speak to me.
I never thought that what we were doing was wrong.
We've been saying the same story for ten years.
They didn't do anything wrong.
I don't know what will happen from here, you know?
It's just very scary and I feel like it could happen to anyone to be honest, you know.
Alex Pabon and the other Barclays bankers were all prosecuted over rigging an interest rate called Libor.
The London Interbank Offered Rate is meant to track the cost of borrowing money.
It has a big influence on your mortgage and other loans.
Libor is now more tightly policed, but until recently it used to be set by taking an average each day of what the big banks thought they'd have to pay to borrow money.
Libors, if you like, are interest rates.
That is THE major benchmark for global interest rates.
350 trillion or so of financial products based on Libor, it is the major global benchmark for interest rates.
The very same banks involved in setting Libor had big money staked on whether Libor went up or down.
If a trader could influence the rate, the bank could make money.
It's been called trader manipulation.
The convicted Barclays traders say that what they were doing was encouraged by their bosses, a normal commercial practice dating back to the '90s.
In the City, it was common knowledge for years that traders would try to secure tiny shifts in Libor rates every day.
Pippa Malmgrem is a leading US financial expert, and was an economic advisor to President Bush.
When you work on a trading floor, your whole job is to buy something for one price and you sell it for something a little higher.
This is the way every trader on a trading floor thinks.
So when they're asked to establish a rate, they're thinking in terms of the two sides, and so this is their attempt to create a little space because you always want to make money on the deal.
The way I saw it was, it was perfectly OK to do it.
It was almost like what we call a free option, you might as well do it.
You can do it, it's perfectly normal and proper, you can do it.
If it works, great, if not, that's it.
In August 2007, the world changed.
Global financial markets went into meltdown.
British banking was on the brink.
Tonight at Ten:
Northern Rock appeals for calm and urges its customers not to panic.
Banks became scared of lending to each other, worried they wouldn't get their money back.
The market seized up.
The economy was heading towards a crisis.
Not since the beginning of the First World War has our banking system been so close to collapse.
Whenever you have a major financial crisis, you always have what might be called the recrimination phase of the economic cycle which is when everybody goes,
"Wait, how the heck did this happen and who is responsible for it?"
The public and politicians on both sides of the Atlantic wanted to know what had gone on, and who was to blame.
Banks had to be called to account.
Financial regulators targeted the so-called trader manipulation of Libor.
Whee!
Tom Hayes was the very first trader to be jailed for it, found guilty of conspiracy to defraud.
He was working for the Swiss bank UBS.
Tom Hayes is now in prison.
- I feel angry about it.
- Why?
Because Daddy shouldn't be in his new place, should he?
We call it Daddy's new place.
That new place is Lowdham Grange Prison in Nottinghamshire where Tom Hayes is serving 11 years.
The sentence is just inexplicable.
What does it compare with?
What are you talking about?
I think you can get less time for killing somebody.
Sarah, a lawyer, is fighting to get her husband released.
All I really want is for the truth to come out, because if the truth came out, I think he would come out of prison, but the truth has never come out about this.
Tom Hayes had a reputation as a trading superstar.
He earned millions.
From his base in Tokyo, he had a network of London brokers who he tried to use to make small changes to Libor.
One of them was Noel Cryan.
He was the biggest trader at the time, he had power over not only the brokers but other traders were scared of him as well.
He would always take advantage of that.
Tom Hayes started asking Noel to try to influence Libor.
The requests Tom Hayes was making were tiny, but because his bank had billions staked on Libor, even a minuscule move could make big money.
Everyone knew there is this very important benchmark out there, that the banks were in charge of setting and lots of traders, making their living was based on playing with that and no-one made any effort to stop that or impose order on it.
Tom Hayes said he HAD tried to influence Libor, like the Barclays traders who later followed him into the dock.
But they all said it was a day-to-day banking practice, something their bosses expected them to do.
Tom Hayes says he should never have been prosecuted by the Serious Fraud Office, or SFO.
There's e-mails, there are phone recordings, there are chat transcripts, that show that people up and down the organisational ladders knew about, condoned, in some cases participated in what was going on.
Don't forget, Tom Hayes never made any secret of it.
He was completely open.
He never acted once like a man who thought he was doing anything wrong or illegal.
Noel Cryan and five other brokers were later charged with conspiring with Tom Hayes.
They told the court they hadn't done what he'd asked them to do.
They were all acquitted.
We've been scapegoated in the whole thing.
They've gone to the bottom of the food chain, the brokers, six brokers answering the Libor question.
Really?
If there's things to be answered,
WE shouldn't be answering the questions.
The SFO need to ask themselves, should they have wasted that much time and money bringing this case against six money brokers?
I don't think so.
UBS, Tom Hayes's employer, was fined 1.5 billion for allowing its traders to attempt to rig Libor.
UBS told us, "Criminal and regulatory investigations..."
But UBS wasn't the only bank punished for manipulating Libor.
Barclays Bank was fined £290 million.
A week later, its boss, Bob Diamond, was forced to resign.
The bank's Chief Executive, Bob Diamond, has surprised the City by quitting with immediate effect.
When MPs demanded to know what had been going on,
Bob Diamond told them a handful of traders down the ranks deserved to be punished.
Do you think a criminal prosecution of a banker...
He was asked whether those bankers should be locked up.
It's reprehensible behaviour, and if you're asking me should those actions be dealt with, absolutely.
Thank you very much indeed.
But throwing the book at a handful of bankers is not where this story ends.
Hundreds of miles from the City in Cumbria, a family of caravan park owners were about to discover evidence of what looked like a cover-up at the top of the banking establishment.
In 2005, Paul Holgate and his father Martin wanted to borrow £3.5 million to expand their business.
We were recommended to move to Barclays.
It was absolutely fine, it was very good long-term prospects.
Barclays lent the money on condition the Holgates bought a financial product to protect them against rising interest rates.
What Barclays didn't tell them was that if interest rates went down, they'd end up losing money.
Lots of money.
That's where the problems arose.
Because the liabilities they put on us were incredible.
Interest rates plummeted and in 2012, the business went under.
I was thrown off the park that day, when the administrators were sprung upon us.
I had some clothing in an overnight bag, and for the next 14 months I had to make do with the clothes in that bag because the administrators wouldn't even let me obtain my own clothes.
After Barclays boss Bob Diamond resigned over Libor, the Holgates began investigating.
If they could prove that senior people inside Barclays knew about Libor rigging, they might get compensation.
During their legal case against the bank, they discovered thousands of confidential documents from inside Barclays.
We've been fighting the bank for seven to eight years.
You have to have... great tenacity to be able to carry this through.
Most people can't do it.
The documents revealed that senior managers within the bank had instructed staff to rig Libor.
This wasn't about the tiny shifts of Libor made by the traders.
This was massive rigging, ordered from the top of the bank.
As the banks started running out of cash during the financial crisis, most of them started doing something called low balling.
Deliberately submitting artificially low Libor rates so they'd look in better shape than they really were.
If I asked to borrow £1,000 from you, and you'd heard my finances were in a mess, you might want to charge me more in interest to cover the risk that you don't get your money back.
But, if I admitted I was paying higher interest rates, people might think I was in trouble, so I might lie and pretend I was paying no more than anyone else.
That's what many banks did during the financial crisis.
The Bank of England had warning signs about this certainly in 2007.
It's not just like little whispers they were hearing.
There were unequivocal signs that there was something very wrong with this rate.
In October 2008, the Government launched emergency measures to get stricken banks lending again.
It's been a tumultuous day, it started with the announcement of a giant rescue package for the British banking sector.
The Government pumped £37 billion of capital into the troubled banks.
It was part of a huge rescue plan.
If it worked, Libor would fall.
But it stayed frozen.
The problem for the Bank of England was even with a huge bailout, the banks knew they were all in trouble.
It still wasn't getting any cheaper for them to borrow money from each other, and Barclays kept their Libor rate high to reflect that.
The Bank of England wasn't happy.
On 29th October, 2008, its then executive director Paul Tucker phoned up the Barclays boss, Bob Diamond.
A conversation was had.
That conversation was interpreted by Barclays, by senior people within Barclays, as an instruction to lower their Libors and they acted on that.
This leads to a flurry of phone calls and e-mails between senior people, traders, Libor submitters at Barclays.
Bob Diamond has said he was misinterpreted, but an instruction to lower Libors was passed down to the bank's submitters.
One of those submitters was Peter Johnson.
He pleaded guilty to manipulating Libor and is now serving four years in prison.
During the Holgates' investigation, they found the transcript of a phone call between Peter Johnson and his boss, Mark Dearlove.
It also happened on 29th October, 2008.
I've got hold of the actual recording, crucial evidence that Barclays was setting false Libor rates on instructions from above.
It's never been broadcast before.
Mark Dearlove didn't respond to our questions.
Chris Philp is a member of the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee.
We played him the recording.
- What do you think?
- If what Dearlove is saying is true, that is shocking.
This tape suggests that in fact the Bank of England knew about it and indeed were encouraging or even instructing it.
So we need an immediate inquiry to find out exactly what is going on, given what we've just heard on this tape.
The banking system was on life support and the Bank of England wanted Libor down.
If it dropped, it would look like things were on the mend.
Banks were so unwilling to lend to each other...
But when Mervyn King, the then Governor of the Bank of England, was called to answer questions before Parliament in 2012, he said there was no instruction to doctor the Libor rate.
This is like the temperature, when a patient is sick, you want to bring the temperature of the patient down.
But there's a world of difference between trying to think of what measures you could adopt to bring the temperature of the patient down and actually tampering with the thermometer.
That was nowhere near anyone's thoughts at the time.
But tampering with that thermometer, Libor, is exactly what the Bank of England had ordered.
We were not aware...
Mervyn King's second in command at the Bank of England was Paul Tucker.
Despite making that call to Barclays boss, Bob Diamond, back in 2008, he told MPs he'd only just found out about low balling.
In your recollection, when was the first time that Libor was raised as an issue in relation to low balling?
- To...?
- Low balling.
- Erm...
The...
I mean, I wasn't aware of allegations of low balling until the last few weeks.
Ditto Bob Diamond.
For the third time, what month did you discover
- the low balling was going on?
Just give me a date.
- This month.
'It sounds to me like those people giving evidence, 'particularly Bob Diamond and Paul Tucker, were misleading Parliament.
'That is contempt of Parliament.'
It's a very serious matter and I think we need to urgently summon those individuals back before Parliament to explain why it is they appear to have misled MPs.
It's extremely serious.
Bob Diamond told Panorama, "I never misled Parliament.
"And I stand by everything I have said previously."
Mervyn King says that his evidence was clear and he stands by it.
And that there is "a world of difference
"between dysfunctional markets and criminal behaviour".
Paul Tucker didn't respond to our questions.
But Panorama has discovered evidence that the Bank of England was involved in Libor rigging even earlier.
We found a confidential US Department of Justice document that shows Paul Tucker began pressuring Barclays to lower its Libor rates from September 1st, 2007.
You've now got two separate bits of evidence, one dating from October 2008, one dating from September 2007, over a year before, where there's clear evidence, audio evidence and written evidence, that the Bank of England were pressuring Barclays to lower Libor.
It suggests that it was part of a more systematic and ongoing attempt by the Bank of England to put pressure on Barclays.
But the trials of the Barclays bankers didn't get to hear this, and much of the other evidence of low balling, because the Serious Fraud Office said their Libor conspiracy had come to an end on 1st September, 2007.
That's the thing, in these trials that we went through, they separated everything.
Separated trading requests and low balling.
So anything that has to do with this did not go in.
So you're asking me, do I think if all this was in, would it make a difference?
Erm...
Probably, is the answer.
- SHE SNIFFLES
- OK.
Alex Pabon was one of the Barclays bankers jailed last summer.
He was released from prison three weeks ago and immediately deported to his home in Texas.
He still thinks he didn't get a fair trial.
What effect do you think it had on your case that they didn't bring in what we know about your bosses and the Bank of England doing that?
The failure to not put in front of the jury specific evidence really hamstrung the defence on how we could respond to what the prosecution was saying.
What's the scale of the difference between what you might have achieved by making a Libor request and what your bosses and the Bank of England might have achieved?
We were asking for an eighth of a basis point and they were asking for 50 basis points, so about 400 times more.
The Bank of England says Libor was not regulated in the UK or elsewhere during the period in question.
But it's been assisting the criminal investigations into Libor manipulation by employees at commercial banks.
The Serious Fraud Office says it's still investigating low balling.
It says it follows the evidence and aims to charge the most senior people, where there is a realistic prospect of conviction.
The prosecution period, which ended on 1st September, 2007, was led by the evidence and material dated after this point was provided to the defence.
The 2008 recording was disclosed to the defence but it wasn't admitted into court.
Barclays, they just threw us to the wolves.
They were happy, I think.
Because they get off with their fine and then they get some low level guys that go to jail and they just continue to work and make millions of dollars a year, while we sit there and rot in jail.
But there is one more twist in the Libor tale.
Back in Cumbria, the campsite sleuths came across another extraordinary piece of evidence.
At the height of the financial crisis,
Barclays sensed an opportunity.
Having been instructed by the Bank of England to lower its Libor rates, it hatched a top-secret plan, involving something called the Ricardo Master Fund.
The goal of Ricardo Master Fund, like all such funds, was to make money for the bank.
They were investing in financial instruments whose performance was based on the movement of interest rates.
Barclays put 100 million of its own money into the secret fund.
If you look at this, Andy, this is what we've been shown.
It is a transcript of a telephone conversation at Barclays.
More evidence that the Bank of England's Paul Tucker had told Barclays to get its Libors down.
"I've been told to get Libor rates down.
"It's political from very, very high,
"so it's Tucker calling the tune."
Because Barclays knew that interest rates would fall, the Ricardo Master Fund made 100 million for the bank in a matter of months.
And who was in charge of the Barclays company that ran the fund?
Bob Diamond.
The man who told MPs he knew nothing about low balling until 2012.
For the third time, what month did you discover that low balling was going on?
- Just give me a date.
- This month.
As the Holgates' caravan business was being destroyed by falling interest rates, Barclays was making a killing.
Barclays didn't answer our questions about the Ricardo Master Fund but told us it remains committed to fundamental change in its culture and operations.
The bank reached a financial settlement with the Holgates but insisted that the amount of compensation they received be kept confidential.
You just would not think in a country that has the reputation, prides itself on being a very, very upstanding, honest nation, allows these things not only to happen, but they aren't sorted out, just ignored and swept away.
I think that's the biggest shock, not just what's gone on, but the way it's been dealt with afterwards.
Tom Hayes, the first banker to be jailed, has lost an appeal against conviction and is now in his second year behind bars.
His son Joshua will be eight by the time his father's due to be released.
It is hard because, you know, when we go to the field,
I have to kick the football with him because his dad's not around to do it.
Tom Hayes sends his wife and son video messages recorded from prison.
Hello again, Josh.
Hi, Mummy.
I hope you're both OK.
Love you loads, both.
See you soon, bye.
No senior banker in the UK has ever been prosecuted for fixing Libor.
I think that they don't want to go after the guys at the top, so they come for the low guys and then just leave the top guys to float away.
To the bankers who've been prosecuted, there's a huge double standard in the Libor blame game.
It's now clear the scandal of the big bank fix goes far higher than the banking establishment ever wanted us to know.
5,000 next year.
On this "Gold rush"...
I got boulders the size Of small cars in my way.
There could be 100 or 200 ounces Just in this little section.
Fireworks.
- Yeah!
- Whoo!
With this cleanup, We beat last year's total.
That's a big pan of gold.

In dawson city,
Tony beets is on the ropes.
His dream of getting His second dredge.
Running this season is over.
At the start of this season,
Tony vowed he'd barge His 70-year-old dredge.
Down the yukon river to dawson.
But problems with his fleet Of barges...
And the struggle To find a skipper...
I can't turn my back On this for a day.
Have left The $1-million dredge.
Stranded 100 miles away At thistle creek.
Now, with the yukon river Starting to freeze,
Tony has no choice.
But to get his fleet Onto dry land.
First up, tony's 20-ton barge.
Hey, tony!
Pull the slack up!
Hey, hey, hey!
Tony's son mike.
Will haul it out of the water Using the oshkosh,
A military-grade Eight-wheel drive semi,
Capable of towing 60 tons.
Daughter monica helps out In the loader.
People seem to call My dad crazy.
But, I mean, I think He's actually done.
Pretty well for himself.
Can't back up straight?
Don't worry.
We'll push it.
Looking good there!
Good!
All right.
My tires, they're Basically sunk in.
- Hooked on.
- Okay.
He needs the help Of his little sister!
For two months,
Tony has been trying To convince.
Sternwheeler captain Brad whitelaw.
To skipper his power barge.
Yeah, man.
I couldn't be more glad.
Yeah, no.
This, This came on real quick.
Running out of water And filling full of ice.
Season's done.
What are you up to?
That's a pretty Dangerous trip.
And now, the river's Down so low.
- Yep.
- Lot of ice in there.
Tell you what, As long as I'm the captain,
If it's too dangerous...
- yep.
- We're turning back.
I'll always help The beets family, tony.
See ya, tony.
So, yeah.
It's all hands on deck,
The final push To the end the season.
Going for 1,000 ounces.
I really want to make sure.
That my guys are taken care Of for the winter.
Hopefully, we can Pull this off.
To hit his 1,000-ounce,
$1.2-million season goal,
Todd hoffman is running Two operations,
Fairplay and sacramento.
Both fairplay and us, We're on the gold.
We're doing good.
But every time I look At those mountains,
I'm a little bit scared And a little bit more worried.
Because, at any day,
It could dump 2 Or 3 feet of snow overnight.
And we will be shut down.
10,000 feet up In the rockies,
Winter is about to hit.
Aw, crap.
At fairplay...
This sucks!
You can't catch Gold with mud.
Rusty red is Running out of water.
I'll show you Some mud, todd.
Look at that water.
- Wow.
- It's thick.
I don't have Any fresh water coming.
Yeah.
Look at the snow On the mountains.
All the headwaters Are frozen.
We got no water Coming in now.
The temperature has plummeted To 20 degrees.
And the creek that feeds Their holding pond has frozen.
Hopefully freddy figures Out the solution.
Because pretty scary Right now.
Without water, We're not getting any gold.
Trust me.
That river, we got water.
It's just getting there's Gonna be a nightmare, trey.
It's gonna be A nightmare.
Their only option...
The nearby platte river.
But it's 200 feet down A 70-degree slope.
I think I'm just Gonna go for it.
I'm gonna try and cut On this slope.
Takes some big cajones.
So you just take it easy, Be safe,
And keep it upright.
I hope this works.
Freddy's old friend, Trey poulson,
Has over 20 years Of operating experience.
My dad had a saying growing up.
He'd always say it.
If you're not living On the edge,
You're just taking up space.
Right now, We're living on the edge.
Basically cutting out Little avalanches.
I'm letting the bank come down.
And using the material That comes down to push out.
You really have to be careful.
Too much of that On that side, pop you up.
It can be a bad day.
Holy moly.
That's what'll get You right there.
That come down on your tracks.
When you're down on the side And have nowhere to go.
There!
We got her!
We're down on land.
With the road completed,
It's andy's job to transport The pump down to the river.
I, I don't know If I can go down this.
What do you think If I brought the dozer around.
And just, Acted as an anchor for you?
10-4.
Better safe than sorry.
Got to hook this chain To that dozer.
To keep this hoe From tipping over.
Come on in, trey.
On your call, andy.
All right.
Let's roll.
Easy, andy.
Easy, guys.
I'll tell you what.
When you got steel tracks And you're on solid rock,
If I start sliding And he can't hold me,
We both go all the way To the bottom.
Freddy!
I'm slipping!
I'm slipping!
Andy!
Watch out!
In colorado, andy spinks.
Is teetering on the edge.
I'm slipping!
I'm slipping!
I'm slipping!
To provide water For the wash plant,
He's hauling a pump down.
To the river In his 70-ton excavator.
Just set the pump Right there, andy!
Okay.
That son of a gun Is steep.
It's like roller skating On ball bearings.
If that sucker Would've taken off,
If you hadn't have been Hooked to me,
I'd have been all the way In the river.
- No doubt.
- Let's get the lines.
Hooked up, Pump some water.
- Okay.
Sounds good.
- Starting the pump.
I got 1,200 rpm, trey!
1,300!
Freddy's new Water supply is flowing.
The hoffman crew can get back.
To running rusty red At 150 yards an hour.
Sure a nice sight, Water coming into that pond.
Hopefully now, we have no more Obstacles to our 1,000!
The winter's setting in.
We still have A lot of gold to find.
And real cold this time of year.
Parker is still 1,100 ounces short.
Of his 4,000-ounce, $4.8-million season goal.
And the klondike winter Will freeze him out.
In the next couple of weeks.
Not quite at our goal yet.
But, you know, We've never gone home before.
Without hitting our goal.
And I don't think anything's Gonna change this year.
In fact, I know nothing's Gonna change this year.
We'll be here fighting it Till the bitter end.
And we're gonna get it.
At indian river,
Rick is pushing hard To get 1,000 ounces.
While up at the creek cut,
Parker is running Some of the best.
Pay dirt he has ever mined.
This creek cut's Paying off good.
But, you know, we're still A long way off of 4,000 ounces.
If they had any problems, Then we're gonna be in trouble.
What the
overnight, The creek cut has flooded.
Is it just Bleeding through?
Yeah, through here, This berm.
Just keeps finding places To crack through.
It looks like we didn't Pack the thing down enough.
- Yeah.
- And this could really cost us.
Water from the settling pond.
Has leaked through the berm, Flooding the creek cut.
Parker normally builds a berm.
Using rock trucks and a dozer.
But for the creek cut berm,
He used a super conveyor.
Which didn't compact the dirt.
Water is now seeping From the settling pond.
Through the berm into the cut.
We're kind of up, Aren't we?
Yeah.
We can't dig pay dirt That's underwater.
Yeah.
I...
I...
I need you To deal with it.
- Okay.
- Um...
All right.
Fine.
I'll get this water Out of the cut.
I don't care if it takes All day.
Sake.
I got a lot Of ditching ahead of me.
Trying to get rid Of all this water.
Gonna make for a long day.
To stop water Flowing in to the creek cut,
Rick will excavate A 60-foot-deep mega trench.
Through an old berm.
Allowing the water In the settling pond.
To escape into the existing Drainage ditch.
Been working at this For about six hours.
Come on, you heap!
Um, well, once I bust Through this.
Last little bit here, Our s...
Our settling pond should start Draining through this ditch.
After that, we shouldn't Have any issues.
That's it.
Yeah, it's moving out Pretty quick.
So that's a good sign.
Good deal.
Four hours later,
The creek cut Is already drying out.
You know, we've still Got 1,100 ounces to do.
But both plants are on The pay and running good.
So, you know, we don't have A whole lot of time left.
But 4,000 is still Within shot.
All season,
Tony beets has been Wanting to head upriver.
To retrieve his second dredge.
Now that day has finally come.
We're going on a boat That tony built.
We got to bring everything We need for survival.
Cold.
It's gonna be colder On the water.
Hey, tony.
All right.
How are you?
You sure this is...
This is what you want to do?
Well... tony's last-ditch Plan... journey 100 miles.
Up the mighty yukon river To thistle creek,
Dismantle the dredge And get as much of it back.
Before the yukon freezes For the winter.
Holy.
No, it's iced in.
We got to chip away From the steering here.
That's for sure.
Yeah.
I can stand on.
There's a lot of work before There's any consideration.
Of going out On a river full of ice.
This is more than Just a challenge.
Th... this is crazy.
Bull
Tony uses a forced-air heater.
To thaw out the engine room And heat up the hull.
Everything seems To be working.
Tony is barging in a loader And a pair of welders.
To dismantle The 70-year-old dredge.
We're done?
We're, We're heading out of here?
After five months of delays,
Tony's power barge.
Is finally heading upriver To bring back his dredge.
Go to 1,750.
Freddy's been busting His ass on this plant.
We have water.
We... we got to pump Out of the platte river.
Dave's over there running double Trouble at sacramento creek.
They're competing With each other.
And they're both getting gold.
Three weeks ago,
Dave turin Bet freddy dodge $100.
His sacramento crew Would catch more gold.
In the race to 1,000 ounces.
But at fairplay,
Freddy and andy's pay dirt Contains twice as much gold.
We're on the best pay that, We've had all season.
I think we're probably Gonna kick their butt.
It's gonna be, nice.
Watching dave handing over That $100 bill to freddy.
Boulders are fricking huge.
I've never even begun To see boulders this size.
I tell you what, I get Any more rocks like this,
I ain't gonna be able To mine this ground,
That's for dang sure.
Come on, you son of a gun.
That's the biggest Boulder I've seen so far.
That's 20,000 pounds, I'll bet you.
I got one down here That's even bigger than that.
Crap.
Excavator won't even touch it.
Freddy, you might want to Come take a look at this.
Got kind of a problem down here.
It's slowing me down.
What's going on, andy?
I got boulders The size of small cars.
In my way To get this pay dirt out.
Holy cow.
It's a catch-22, andy, 'cause the gold's probably Pretty damn good in here.
Big rocks can mean Bigger and more gold.
It's a good sign.
But at the same time,
Those big-ass rocks Slow us way down.
Because we have to double Or triple move 'em.
Or maybe not even be able To move 'em.
Then we can't get pay To the plant.
Thousands of years ago,
A receding glacier Deposited monster boulders.
And gold-rich dirt.
When the river From the melt water.
Washed down most of the dirt And gold,
It concentrated valuable pockets Of gold beneath the boulders.
Come on.
Come on.
Andy's 460 excavator.
Is rated to lift Over 50,000 pounds,
The weight of eight Heavy-duty pick-ups.
Whoa!
Look out!
But it still can't move.
The biggest of the boulders.
Hey, todd.
You got to get your butt Down here and look at this.
Well, at this point,
Todd, I am frustrated with this.
I cannot get these boulders out.
Some of those big rocks,
It pulls the whole Excavator over.
Some of our best Pay came from un...
Right on that far side Of that boulder.
There could be 100 Or 200 ounces.
Just in This little section.
Well, I'll tell you what.
I keep screwing around With these boulders,
Kevin's gonna run Out of pay.
You want... what do you Want to do, freddy?
I mean...
Fireworks.
Make big rocks Into small rocks.
Yeah.
Let's fricking blow 'em up.
Let's blow 'em to rat.
You blow 'em up And we can move the material.
We'll call a blaster.
And hopefully, we don't Have to shut down.
Okay.
We'll do it.
- Let's go, freddy.
- Let's go.
If we can't get through Those damn rocks right there,
We're gonna run out of pay.
At this time of the year, It'll be game over for us.
Yeah.
Nice and level.
Tony is five hours.
Into his 100-mile Journey upriver.
To dismantle His second dredge.
You know, we...
We're able to get out today.
But I don't know how many More days we're gonna get.
Skippering the power barge,
Yukon river veteran Brad whitelaw.
Any day right now Is a blessing.
Yeah, but not with The ice in the river.
You can see How flat it is.
You can't read The river anymore.
You can't see where the shallows Are with the ripples.
- No.
- This ice is blocking.
The view of it all.
Even with a steel hull,
This much weight And the momentum,
A big rock, A rock edge...
Cut that damn thing open.
Can just rip her Right open like a can.
Yeah.
Man, you run aground again, There's nobody out here.
And there's no help.
The 6-ton power barge.
Is approaching one of the most Treacherous parts of the river,
Notorious for Its shifting sandbars.
You can see the difference.
I come through here About three months ago.
And there was...
- yeah.
- At least 3, 4 feet more of water Than there is now.
And I'm gonna Just pull back here.
And... and we'll just Take it real easy.
Yeah.
I don't see The depth finder working.
Hey, kevin, we need To lift this depth sounder.
By the water.
That's in there tight.
Yep!
Now it's froze up.
Of course.
Get out of the way.
Yeah, okay.
This is getting a little Too skinny for me here.
Yeah, It's getting too shallow.
I'll just back it off and...
Really getting shallow, tony.
I'm nervous.
I don't want to get...
I don't want to get Your ship stuck.
Watch your bulkhead!
70 miles Up the yukon river...
I'm nervous.
I don't want to get this...
I don't want to get Your ship stuck.
Tony's 60-ton power barge.
Is navigating through Treacherous sandbars.
Watch your bulkhead!
Got to watch out For that thing.
Two and a half feet, tony.
That's it.
I'm pulling out of here.
We can't... we can't go Any further than this.
Yeah, because you can see.
Those rocks Here, right?
After a brush With a sandbar.
And with the light fading, Brad plays the safety card.
And moors the barge Up for the night.
Man.
You're gonna Trust that knife?
You don't know where The that's been.
When you fricking,
Came up On that one spot there,
Sand or rock, It almost sounded like a rock 'cause it had a bang to it.
Yeah, I know.
There was something Alongside of the ship.
That's never A good feeling.
And I couldn't get Out of there quick enough.
You got to respect The challenges of this river.
We all know people That have gone out.
And then they're not...
They didn't make it back home.
Yeah, man.
We'll get...
- Do it in the daylight.
- Yeah.
See what Tomorrow brings.
- Yeah.
- What a dork!
Fine.
8:00 a.M., The crew is up early.
For the final push To thistle creek.
I want to drive.
No kidding.
Having completed 100 miles In 18 hours,
Tony spots familiar ground.
Yeah, we're here now, Tony.
Close it in.
Then, wherever We may land,
Looks like you can't Go wrong here.
It's a beach.
Under these conditions, I think we fared pretty good.
After five months Of failures,
Tony has managed To get his power barge.
To thistle creek.
Tony can finally start Dismantling his second dredge.
Geez!
At fairplay, Giant boulders.
Are blocking the hoffman crew.
From mining gold-rich pay dirt.
Freddy and todd's solution,
Blow them up.
He's a local blaster.
- You mark?
- Todd?
- This is freddy.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Morning, freddy.
- Mark mayer.
If you follow this road Right down,
Andy's down there In the excavator.
And you can talk to him And tell him what you want.
See what we got.
Thank you.
To clear the boulders,
Freddy's called in colorado Blaster mark mayer.
I love my job.
Where else in the world Do you get to go blow things up.
On somebody else's property,
Make a mess and let them Clean it up?
- How you doing?
- Andy.
- Nice to meet you.
- What do we got going on here?
There's good gold In the ground.
I just need to get to it, And those rocks are in my way.
Well, looks like We have two options.
We can wait for god To send down.
A lightning bolt And break those rocks.
Or I've got some dynamite.
Let's go With the dynamite.
I'll get out of your way.
No worries.
Mark brings in The commando drill truck.
Its diamond-core drill Will bore.
A 2-inch diameter hole.
Into the heart of the boulder.
I started when I was 13.
Blew these two fingers off.
Big mistake.
I've gotten better.
I still have my head.
Look at that.
He's cutting like.
A hot knife Through butter right there.
Pretty quick.
Underneath those boulders,
I guarantee There's a lot of gold.
Looking good, mark!
Good job!
The drill's job is done.
Extra gelatin dynamite.
That ought to do it.
To blast a 20,000-pound boulder,
It will take a stick And a half of dynamite.
The energy equivalent of this.
Is on the order of about 100 million horsepower.
What's cutting it Do, mark?
Cutting will allow the cartridge.
To shrink and expand In the bore hole.
So we get most of the energy Down on the ground.
And in the rock.
We'll have to tamp it A little bit, very lightly.
Finish her up with sand.
That'll do.
Let's get out of here.
The detonator box Is wired and ready to fire.
They're gonna blast!
We got to take cover!
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
- Blasting.
- Fire in the hole.
- Damn, that was awesome!
- Bye-bye, boulders.
You got to love blasting.
You know, I mean, for real.
Mark, kick-ass, man.
All clear!
Awesome.
No more big boulders.
- Look at that!
- That'll work.
- That, I can move.
- Good job, mark.
- My pleasure.
- Bring it in!
Andy, get the excavator!
Let's go!
Andy's 460.
Can now make light work Of the shattered boulders.
That's all I needed, Just a little bit of help.
Being able to run this Material right here.
Is what's gonna get us Our 1,000 ounces 'cause it is Loaded with gold.
At scribner creek, The crew's thoughts.
Are turning to the end Of the season.
Hey, brennan.
Start thinking about What the first thing.
You're gonna do When you get home is?
- I can't wait to watch tv.
- Yeah, I heard this...
There's a show on, Friday nights.
Yeah, it's about Some guys that mine.
They kind of do Some stuff like we do.
They must be the coolest.
There's even this One guy on there,
Looks like he's got a tattoo Of a on his neck.
You, man.
We were wondering If you were listening in.
At scribner, time is running out.
To hit parker's 4,000-ounce, $4.8-million season goal.
Yea.
The big freeze is coming fast.
And they're still 1,100 ounces short.
- Hey, ash.
- Hello.

We're at 100.
That's good.
109.4.
Worth over $130,000.
So, doumitt, where's this Put us at on big red?
That'll put you At about 811 ounces.
I'm not gonna Walk away with 800.
You know, that ain't...
That ain't good enough for me.
So we're getting 1,000.
That's The attitude you need.
All right.
What'd we do last week,
Like 320-something?
- 326.
- Yeah.
That was a record For sluicifer.
That's a big pan Of gold, buddy.
This is some Clean stuff, doumitt.
Ashley, count it!
70, 80, 90, 100, 140, 160, 70, 180, 90, 200.

Keep going.
340, 360, 380... 396.1.
Man!
$475,000 in gold,
Bringing parker's weekly Total to a massive 505 ounces, worth $600,000.
I'd tell you what, you guys.
I got some smoking news For you.
With this cleanup, We beat last year's total.
We have 3,375...

Ounces right now.
That calls for a cheers!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
3,375 ounces,
A staggering $4 million.
Yeah, I mean, we beat Last year's total,
Which is impressive With these two cleanups,
But the work's not done.
Parker still has To find 625 ounces of gold.
Before he's frozen out.
So let's just keep Pounding the dirt through.
And let's see some 4,000 ounces in the box.
- Yeah!
- Do it!
- Let's do it!
- Let's do it.
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
Whoo!
In colorado, The hoffmans' two operations.
Have been competing Against each other.
In a bid to hit todd's 1,000-ounce season goal.
Double trouble just Keeps running.
Well, the thing about it is, We need both.
Good.
We've got to have 'em both To get to 1,000 ounces.
You guys all done eating?
- You want to go check?
- Yeah.
To send his crew home With gold for the winter,
Todd still needs 220 ounces.
Get her done.
How'd we do, dad?
Where are we at?
Sacramento, 45.7.
- Yeah!
- Not bad!
Worth $54,000.
But fairplay Kicked your butts.
105.2.
- Whoa!
- Yeah!
Over $120,000.
Fairplay's way ahead Of, sacramento.
Hey, there's a little Matter of the bet.
What are you at?
- Over 500 ounces.
- And we're at 190.
And there's snow On the mountains.
- Yeah.
- I concede.
Mr. Dodge, this hurts.
It hurts a lot.
Here's your $100.
I'd frame that.
Here's the deal...
The bet's over.
But the competition's Still going.
- That's right.
- We're gonna bust ass.
- We got to get over 1,000.
- Okay.
So together, We did 150 ounces.
How close are we Right now to 1,000?
Where we are?
- 929.
- Getting there.
- We can get this!
That's a hell of a lot of gold In a short period of time.
This is just fantastic.
I...
I love it.
Good job, you guys.
I lost 100 bucks.
I don't care.
We're gonna get 1,000 ounces.
$100 of dave's money, That's priceless.
I'm super happy.
I just can't believe it.
I can't believe the comeback In such a short period of time.
If we can keep running,
I think we're gonna sail Right over 1,000.
On the season finale Of "Gold rush"...
See how Thick this stuff is.
Well, this just Nicely me.
If we stop moving At this point, we die.
So we just got to Keep everything going.
What the.
Shut her down!
Shut her down!
- No way!
- Woo-hoo-hoo!
- Let go of me now!
- Hey!
I think I failed this year.
I will resign.
hey.
On this "Gold Rush"...
I got boulders the size of small cars in my way.
There could be 100 or 200 ounces just in this little section.
Fireworks.
Yeah!
Whoo!
we beat last year's total.
That's a big pan of gold.
Tony Beets is on the ropes.
His dream of getting his second dredge running this season is over.
Tony vowed he'd barge his 70-year-old dredge down the Yukon River to Dawson.
But problems with his fleet of barges... and the struggle to find a skipper...
I can't turn my back on this for a day.
have left the $1-million dredge stranded 100 miles away at Thistle Creek.
Tony has no choice but to get his fleet onto dry land.
Tony's 20-ton barge.
Tony!
Pull the slack up!
hey!
Tony's son Mike will haul it out of the water a military-grade eight-wheel drive semi capable of towing 60 tons.
Daughter Monica helps out in the loader.
People seem to call my dad crazy.
I think he's actually done pretty well for himself.
Can't back up straight?
Don't worry.
We'll push it.
-Looking good there!
-Good.
All right.
they're basically sunk in.
-Hooked on.
-Okay.
He needs the help of his little sister! Tony has been trying to convince sternwheeler Captain Brad Whitelaw to skipper his power barge.
man.
I couldn't be more glad.
no.
this came on real quick.
Running out of water and filling full of ice.
Season's done.
What are you up to?
That's a pretty dangerous trip the river's down so low.
-Yep.
-Lot of ice in there.
Uh... if it's too dangerous...
-Yep.
-We're turning back.
Tony.
Tony.
yeah.
It's all hands on deck.
the end of the season.
000 ounces.
I really want to make sure that my guys are taken care of for the winter.
we can pull this off.
Fairplay and Sacramento.
we're on the gold.
We're doing good.
I'm a little bit scared and a little bit more worried.
it could dump two or three feet of snow overnight and we will be shut down.
winter is about to hit.
crap.
At Fairplay...
This sucks!
You can't catch gold with mud.
Rusty Red is running out of water.
Todd.
Look at that water.
-Wow.
-It's thick.
-I don't have any fresh water coming.
-Yeah
Look at the snow on the mountains.
All the headwaters are frozen.
We got no water coming in now.
The temperature has plummeted to 20 degrees and the creek that feeds their holding pond has frozen.
Hopefully Freddy figures out the solution because pretty scary right now.
we're not getting any gold.
Trust me.
we got water.
Trey.
It's gonna be a nightmare.
Their only option...
The nearby Platte River.
But it's 200 feet down a 70-degree slope.
I think I'm just gonna go for it.
I'm gonna try and cut on this slope.
Takes some big cajones.
and keep it upright.
Whew.
I hope this works. has over 20 years of operating experience.
My dad had a saying growing up.
He'd always say it.
you're just taking up space.
we're living on the edge.
Basically cutting out little avalanches.
I'm letting the bank come down and using the material that comes down to push out.
You really have to be careful.
pop you up.
It can be a bad day.
Holy moly.
That's what'll get you right there.
That come down on your tracks when you're down on the side and have nowhere to go.
There!
We got her!
We're down on land.
it's Andy's job to transport the pump down to the river.
I uh...
I don't know if I can go down this.
What do you think if I brought the dozer around acted as an anchor for you?
10-4.
Better safe than sorry.
Got to hook this chain to that dozer to keep this hoe from tipping over.
Trey.
Andy.
All right.
Let's roll.
Andy.
guys. we both go all the way to the bottom.
Freddy!
I'm slipping!
I'm slipping!
Andy!
Watch out!
Andy Spinks is teetering on the edge.
I'm slipping!
I'm slipping!
I'm slipping! he's hauling a pump down to the river in his 70-ton excavator.
Andy!
Okay.
That son of a gun is steep.
It's like roller skating on ball bearings.
I'd have been all the way in the river.
No doubt.
pump some water.
Sounds good.
Starting the pump.
Trey!
300!
Freddy's new water supply is flowing.
The Hoffman crew can get back to running Rusty Red at 150 yards an hour.
water coming into that pond.
000!
The winter's setting in.
We still have a lot of gold to find and real cold this time of year.
100 ounces short
$4.8-million season goal and the Klondike winter will freeze him out in the next couple of weeks.
Not quite at our goal yet...but we've never gone home before without hitting our goal and..
I don't think anything's gonna change this year.
I know nothing's gonna change this year.
We'll be here fighting it 'till the bitter end and we're gonna get it 000 ounces.
While up at the Creek Cut
Parker is running some of the best pay dirt he has ever mined.
'Cause Creek Cut's paying off good.
000 ounces.
then we're gonna be in trouble.
What the fuck?
the Creek Cut has flooded.
Is it just bleeding through?
this berm.
Just keeps finding places to crack through.
It looks like we didn't pack the thing down enough.
Yeah.
And this could really cost us.
Water from the settling pond flooding the Creek Cut.
Parker normally builds a berm using rock trucks and a dozer.
he used a super conveyor which didn't compact the dirt.
Water is now seeping from the settling pond through the berm into the cut.
aren't we?
Yup.
We can't dig pay dirt that's underwater.
Yeah.
I...
I...
I need you to deal with it.
Okay.
Um...
All right.
Fine.
I'll get this water out of the cut.
I don't care if it takes all day.
For fuck sakes.
I got a lot of ditching ahead of me.
Trying to get rid of all this water.
It's gonna make for a long day.
Rick will excavate a 60-foot-deep mega trench allowing the water in the settling pond to escape into the existing drainage ditch.
Been working at this for about six hours.
you sheep.
once I bust through... our s...
Our settling pond should start draining through this ditch.
we shouldn't have any issues.
That's it.
it's moving out pretty quick.
So that's a good sign.
Good deal.
Four hours later the Creek Cut is already drying out.
100 ounces to do but both plants are on the pay and running good.
So... we don't have a whole lot of time left.
000 is still within shot.
Tony Beets has been wanting to head upriver to retrieve his second dredge.
Now... that day has finally come.
We're going on a fuckin' boat that Tony built.
We gotta bring everything we need for survival.
Fuckin' cold.
It's gonna be colder on the water.
Tony.
All right.
How are you?
You sure this is...
this is what you want to do?
Well...
Tony's last-ditch plan... dismantle the dredge and get as much of it back before the Yukon freezes for the winter.
Holy fuck.
it's iced in.
we got to chip away from the steering here.
That's for sure.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I can stand on.
There's a lot of work before there's any consideration of going out on a river full of ice.
This is more than just a challenge.
This is..
crazy.
Bullshit.
No bullshit
Tony uses a forced-air heater to thaw out the engine room and heat up the hull.
Everything seems to be working.
Tony is barging in a loader and a pair of welders to dismantle the 70 year old dredge.
uh we're heading out of here.
Tony's power barge is finally heading upriver to bring back his dredge.
750.
Freddy's been busting his ass on this plant.
We have water.
We got to pump out of the Platte River.
Dave's over there running Double Trouble at Sacramento Creek.
They're competing with each other and they're both getting gold.
Dave Turin bet Freddy Dodge $100 000 ounces.
Freddy and Andy's pay dirt contains twice as much gold.
we've had all season.
I think we're probably gonna kick their butt.
nice watching Dave hand over that $100 bill to Freddy.
Boulders are fricking huge.
I've never even begun to see boulders this size. that's for dang sure.
you son of a gun.
That's the biggest boulder I've seen so far.
I'll bet you.
And I got one down here that's even bigger than that.
Crap.
Excavator won't even touch it.
you might want to come take a look at this.
Got kind of a problem down here.
It's slowing me down.
Andy?
I got boulders the size of small cars in my way to getting this pay dirt out.
Holy cow. 'cause the gold's probably pretty damn good in here.
Big rocks can mean bigger and more gold.
It's a good sign. those big-ass rocks slow us way down because we have to double or triple move 'em.
Or maybe not even be able to move 'em.
Then we can't get pay to the plant. a receding glacier deposited monster boulders and gold-rich dirt.
When the river from the melt water it concentrated valuable pockets of gold beneath the boulders.
Come on.
Come on. the weight of eight heavy-duty pick-ups.
Whoa!
Look out!
But it still can't move the biggest of the boulders.
Todd.
You got to get your butt down here and look at this.
Aww.
I am frustrated with this.
I cannot get these boulders out.
it pulls the whole excavator over.
Some of our best pay came from un... right on that far side of that boulder.
There could be 100 or 200 ounces just in this little section.
I'll tell you what.
Kevin's gonna run out of pay.
Freddy?
I mean..
Fireworks.
Make big rocks Into small rocks.
Yeah.
Let's fricking blow 'em up.
Huh?
Blow 'em to rat shit.
You blow 'em up and we can move the material.
we don't have to shut down.
Okay.
We'll do it.
Freddy.
-Let's go. we're gonna run out of pay.
it'll be game over for us.
Yeah.
Nice and level.
Tony is five hours into his 100-mile journey upriver to dismantle his second dredge.
we were able to get out today.
But I don't know how many more days we're gonna get.
Yukon River veteran Brad Whitelaw.
Any day right now is a blessing.
but not with the ice in the river you can see how flat it is.
You can't read the river anymore.
You can't see where the shallows are with the ripples.
This ice is blocking the view of it all. a rock edge... cut that damn thing wide open.
Can just rip her right open like a can.
Yeah.
there's nobody out here and there's no help.
The 60 ton power barge notorious for its shifting sandbars.
you can see the difference.
I come through here about three months ago and there was... 4 feet more of water than there is now.
and I'm gonna just pull back here.
and... and we'll just take it real easy.
Yeah.
I don't see the depth finder working.
we need to lift this depth sounder by the water.
That's in there tight.
Yep!
Now it's froze up.
Of course.
Get out of the way.
okay.
This is getting a little too skinny for me here.
It's getting too shallow.
I'll just back it off and...
Tony.
I'm nervous.
I don't want to get this...
I don't want to get your ship stuck.
Watch your bulkhead!
70 miles Up the Yukon River...
I'm nervous.
I don't want to get this...
I don't want to get your ship stuck.
Tony's 60-ton power barge is navigating through treacherous sandbars.
Watch your bulkhead!
watch out for that thing.
Tony.
That's it.
I'm pulling out of here.
We can't... we can't go any further than this.
right? Brad plays the safety card and moors the barge up for the night.
Man.
You're gonna trust that knife?
You don't fuckin' know where that's been.
Shit. it almost sounded like a rock 'cause it had a bang to it.
I know.
There was something alongside of the ship and that's never a good feeling.
and I couldn't get out of there quick enough.
You got to respect the challenges of this river.
We all know people that have gone out and then they're not...
They didn't make it back home.
we'll get and do it in the daylight.
-Yup.
-See what tomorrow brings.
-Yeah.
-What a dork!
Fine.
8:00 a.m. The crew is up early for the final push to Thistle Creek.
I want to drive.
No kidding.
Tony spots familiar ground.
Tony.
Close it in.
Looks like you can't go wrong here.
Lot's of beach.
I think we fared pretty good.
Tony has managed to get his power barge to Thistle Creek.
Tony can finally start dismantling his second dredge.
Geez!
giant boulders are blocking the Hoffman crew from mining gold-rich pay dirt.
Blow them up.
He's a local blaster.
You Mark?
-Todd?
-Yeah.
-Todd.
-This is Freddy.
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Fred?
-I'm Freddy.
Andy's down there in the excavator and you can talk to him and tell him what you want.
See what we got.
Thank you.
Mark Mayer.
I love my job.
Where else in the world do you get to go blow things up on somebody else's property.
Make a mess and let them clean it up.
How you doing?
Andy.
Nice to meet ya.
What do we got going on here? and those rocks are in my way.
looks like we have two options.
We can wait for... god to send down a lightning bolt and break those rocks.
Or I've got some dynamite.
Let's go with the dynamite.
Ha ha ha.
I'll get out of your way.
No worries.
Mark brings in the commando drill truck.
Its diamond-core drill will bore a 2-inch diameter hole into the heart of the boulder.
I started when I was 13.
Blew these two fingers off.
Big mistake.
I've gotten better.
I still have my head.
Look at that.
He's cutting like a hot knife through butter right there.
Drills through it pretty quick.
I guarantee there's a lot of gold.
Mark!
Good job!
The drill's job is done.
Extra gelatin dynamite.
That ought to do it. it will take a stick and a half of dynamite.
The energy equivalent of this is on the order of about 100 million horsepower.
Mark?
Cutting will allow the cartridge to shrink and expand in the bore hole so we get most of the energy down on the ground and in the rock.
very lightly.
Finish her up with sand.
That'll do it.
Let's get out of here.
The detonator box is wired and ready to fire.
They're gonna blast!
We got to take cover!
Blasting.
Fire in the hole.
that was awesome!
boulders.
I love blasting.
You're all having fun.
man.
(Air horn warning))
All clear!
Awesome.
No more big boulders.
Look at that!
That'll work.
That I can move.
Mark.
My pleasure.
Bring it in!
get the excavator!
Let's go!
Andy's 460 can now make light work of the shattered boulders.
just a little bit of help.
000 ounces 'cause it is loaded with gold.
the crew's thoughts are turning to the end of the season.
Brennan.
Start thinking about what the first thing you're gonna do when you get home is?
I can't wait to watch TV.
I heard this...
Friday nights.
it's about some guys that mine.
And they kind of do some stuff like we do.
They must be the coolest.
looks like he's got a tattoo of a (bleep) on his neck.
(laughter) man.
We were wondering if you were listening in.
time is running out
$4.8-million season goal.
Hey uh...
The big freeze is coming fast 100 ounces short.
Ash.
-Hello.
-How's it going?
-How are you?
-Not too bad.
-What are you guys up to?
Weighing up some gold.
Yeah.
Come join us.
you're up.
-Oh boy.
000 ounces at Indian River.
25
He's still 300 ounces short.
90.
We're at 100.
That's good.
109.4 000.
where's this put us at on Big Red?
That'll put you at about 811 ounces.
I'm not gonna walk away with 800.
that ain't...
That ain't good enough for me.
000.
That's the attitude you need.
like 320-something?
326.
-Yeah.
That was a record for Sluicifer.
buddy.
Doumitt.
count it! 200.
man.
250 300.
Keep going.
380... 396.1
-Oh.
-Yay. bringing Parker's weekly total to a massive
000.
you guys.
I got some smoking news for you.
we beat last year's total.
375 ounces...
-No way!
right now.
That calls for a cheers!
-Yeah!
-Yeah! a staggering $4 million. but the work's not done.
Parker still has to find 625 ounces of gold before he's frozen out. 000 ounces in the box.
-Yeah!
-Do it!
Let's do it.
-Whoo!
-Whoo!
Whoo!
the Hoffmans' two operations have been competing against each other
000-ounce season goal.
Double Trouble just keeps running.
we need both.
000 ounces.
You guys all done eating?
-You want to go check?
-Yeah.
Todd still needs 220 ounces.
Got 'er done.
dad?
Where are we at?
45.7
-Yeah!
-Not bad!
000.
But Fairplay kicked your butts.
105.2
-Whoa!
-Yeah!
000.
Sacramento.
there's a little matter of the bet.
What are you at?
-Over 500 ounces.
-and we're at 190.
and there's snow on the mountains.
-Yeah.
-I concede. this hurts.
It hurts a lot.
Here's your $100.
I'd frame that.
Here's the deal...
The bet's over but the competition's still going.
-That's right.
-We're gonna bust ass.
000.
-Okay.
we did 150 ounces.
000?
Where we at?
Nine hundred and twenty nine.
Getting there.
We can get close.
That's a hell of a lot of gold in a short period of time.
This is just fantastic.
I...
I love it.
you guys.
I lost 100 bucks.
I don't care.
000 ounces.
$100 of Dave's money.
{\fnLucida Calligraphy} Subs by {\fs71.8\b1\i1} Jack T
That's priceless.
I'm super happy.
I just can't believe it.
I can't believe the comeback in such a short period of time.
uh..
000.
On the season finale of "Gold Rush"...
See how fuckin' thick this stuff is.
this just nicely fucks me.
we die.
So we just got to keep everything going.
What the fuck?
Shut her down!
Shut her down!
-No way!
-Woo-hoo-hoo!
(cheers)
-Let go of me now!
-Hey!
I think I failed this year.
I will resign.
Hey, hey, hey.
On this "Gold Rush"...
I got boulders the size of small cars in my way.
There could be 100 or 200 ounces just in this little section.
Fireworks.
Yeah!
Whoo!
With this cleanup, we beat last year's total.
That's a big pan of gold.
In Dawson City, Tony Beets is on the ropes.
His dream of getting his second dredge running this season is over.
At the start of this season,
Tony vowed he'd barge his 70-year-old dredge down the Yukon River to Dawson.
But problems with his fleet of barges... and the struggle to find a skipper...
I can't turn my back on this for a day.
have left the $1-million dredge stranded 100 miles away at Thistle Creek.
Now, with the Yukon River starting to freeze,
Tony has no choice but to get his fleet onto dry land.
First up, Tony's 20-ton barge.
Hey, Tony!
Pull the slack up!
Hey, hey, hey!
Tony's son Mike will haul it out of the water using the Oshkosh, a military-grade eight-wheel drive semi capable of towing 60 tons.
Daughter Monica helps out in the loader.
People seem to call my dad crazy.
But, I mean, I think he's actually done pretty well for himself.
Can't back up straight?
Don't worry.
We'll push it.
-Looking good there!
-Good.
All right.
My tires, they're basically sunk in.
-Hooked on.
-Okay.
He needs the help of his little sister!
For two months,
Tony has been trying to convince sternwheeler Captain Brad Whitelaw to skipper his power barge.
Yeah, man.
I couldn't be more glad.
Yeah, no.
This, this came on real quick.
Running out of water and filling full of ice.
Season's done.
What are you up to?
That's a pretty dangerous trip and now, the river's down so low.
-Yep.
-Lot of ice in there.
Uh...
Tell you what, as long as I'm the Captain, if it's too dangerous...
-Yep.
-We're turning back.
I'll always help the Beets family, Tony.
See ya, Tony.
So, yeah.
It's all hands on deck.
The final push, the end of the season.
Going for 1,000 ounces.
I really want to make sure that my guys are taken care of for the winter.
Hopefully, we can pull this off.
To hit his 1,000-ounce, $1.2-million season goal,
Todd Hoffman is running two operations,
Fairplay and Sacramento.
Both Fairplay and us, we're on the gold.
We're doing good.
But... every time I look at those mountains,
I'm a little bit scared and a little bit more worried.
Because, at any day, it could dump two or three feet of snow overnight and we will be shut down.
10,000 feet up In the Rockies, winter is about to hit.
Aw, crap.
At Fairplay...
This sucks!
You can't catch gold with mud.
Rusty Red is running out of water.
I'll show you some mud, Todd.
Look at that water.
-Wow.
-It's thick.
-I don't have any fresh water coming.
-Yeah
Look at the snow on the mountains.
All the headwaters are frozen.
We got no water coming in now.
The temperature has plummeted to 20 degrees and the creek that feeds their holding pond has frozen.
Hopefully Freddy figures out the solution because pretty scary right now.
Without water, we're not getting any gold.
Trust me.
That river, we got water.
It's just getting there's gonna be a nightmare, Trey.
It's gonna be a nightmare.
Their only option...
The nearby Platte River.
But it's 200 feet down a 70-degree slope.
I think I'm just gonna go for it.
I'm gonna try and cut on this slope.
Takes some big cajones.
So just take it easy, be safe, and keep it upright.
Whew.
I hope this works.
Freddy's old friend, Trey Poulson, has over 20 years of operating experience.
My dad had a saying growing up.
He'd always say it.
If you're not living on the edge, you're just taking up space.
Right now, we're living on the edge.
Basically cutting out little avalanches.
I'm letting the bank come down and using the material that comes down to push out.
You really have to be careful.
Too much of that on that side, pop you up.
It can be a bad day.
Holy moly.
That's what'll get you right there.
That come down on your tracks when you're down on the side and have nowhere to go.
There!
We got her!
We're down on land.
With the road completed, it's Andy's job to transport the pump down to the river.
I uh...
I don't know if I can go down this.
What do you think if I brought the dozer around and just, uh, acted as an anchor for you?
10-4.
Better safe than sorry.
Got to hook this chain to that dozer to keep this hoe from tipping over.
Come on in, Trey.
On your call, Andy.
All right.
Let's roll.
Easy, Andy.
Easy, guys.
I'll tell you what.
When you got steel tracks and you're on solid rock,
If I start sliding and he can't hold me, we both go all the way to the bottom.
Freddy!
I'm slipping!
I'm slipping!
Andy!
Watch out!
In Colorado, Andy Spinks is teetering on the edge.
I'm slipping!
I'm slipping!
I'm slipping!
To provide water for the wash plant, he's hauling a pump down to the river in his 70-ton excavator.
Just set the pump right there, Andy!
Okay.
That son of a gun is steep.
It's like roller skating on ball bearings.
If that sucker would've taken off, If you hadn't have been hooked to me,
I'd have been all the way in the river.
No doubt.
Let's get the lines hooked up, pump some water.
Sounds good.
Starting the pump.
I got 1,200 rpm, Trey!
1,300!
Freddy's new water supply is flowing.
The Hoffman crew can get back to running Rusty Red at 150 yards an hour.
Sure a nice sight, water coming into that pond.
Hopefully now, we have no more obstacles to our 1,000!
The winter's setting in.
We still have a lot of gold to find and real cold this time of year.
Parker is still 1,100 ounces short of his 4,000-ounce, $4.8-million season goal and the Klondike winter will freeze him out in the next couple of weeks.
Not quite at our goal yet...but you know, we've never gone home before without hitting our goal and..
I don't think anything's gonna change this year.
In fact, I know nothing's gonna change this year.
We'll be here fighting it 'till the bitter end and we're gonna get it
At Indian River,
Rick is pushing hard to get 1,000 ounces.
While up at the Creek Cut
Parker is running some of the best pay dirt he has ever mined.
This Creek Cut's paying off good.
But, you know, we're still a long way off of 4,000 ounces.
If they had any problems, then we're gonna be in trouble.
What the fuck?
Overnight, the Creek Cut has flooded.
Is it just bleeding through?
Yeah, through here, this berm.
Just keeps finding places to crack through.
It looks like we didn't pack the thing down enough.
Yeah.
And this could really cost us.
Water from the settling pond has leaked through the berm, flooding the Creek Cut.
Parker normally builds a berm using rock trucks and a dozer.
But for the Creek Cut berm, he used a super conveyor which didn't compact the dirt.
Water is now seeping from the settling pond through the berm into the cut.
We're kind of fucked up, aren't we?
Yup.
We can't dig pay dirt that's underwater.
Yeah.
I...
I...
I need you to deal with it.
Okay.
Um...
All right.
Fine.
I'll get this water out of the cut.
I don't care if it takes all day.
For fuck sakes.
I got a lot of ditching ahead of me.
Trying to get rid of all this water.
It's gonna make for a long day.
To stop water flowing in to the Creek Cut,
Rick will excavate a 60-foot-deep mega trench through an old berm, allowing the water in the settling pond to escape into the existing drainage ditch.
Been working at this for about six hours.
Come on, you sheep.
Um, well, once I bust through...
Last little bit here, our s...
Our settling pond should start draining through this ditch.
After that, we shouldn't have any issues.
That's it.
Yeah, it's moving out pretty quick.
So that's a good sign.
Good deal.
Four hours later the Creek Cut is already drying out.
You know, we've still got 1,100 ounces to do but both plants are on the pay and running good.
So... you know, we don't have a whole lot of time left.
But 4,000 is still within shot.
All season,
Tony Beets has been wanting to head upriver to retrieve his second dredge.
Now... that day has finally come.
We're going on a fuckin' boat that Tony built.
We gotta bring everything we need for survival.
Fuckin' cold.
It's gonna be colder on the water.
Hey, Tony.
All right.
How are you?
You sure this is...
this is what you want to do?
Well...
Tony's last-ditch plan... journey 100 miles up the mighty Yukon River to Thistle Creek, dismantle the dredge and get as much of it back before the Yukon freezes for the winter.
Holy fuck.
Uh.
No, it's iced in.
Yeah, we got to chip away from the steering here.
That's for sure.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I can stand on.
There's a lot of work before there's any consideration of going out on a river full of ice.
This is more than just a challenge.
This is..
crazy.
Bullshit.
No bullshit
Tony uses a forced-air heater to thaw out the engine room and heat up the hull.
Everything seems to be working.
Tony is barging in a loader and a pair of welders to dismantle the 70 year old dredge.
We're done?
We're, uh we're heading out of here.
After five months of delays, Tony's power barge is finally heading upriver to bring back his dredge.
Go to 1,750.
Freddy's been busting his ass on this plant.
We have water.
We got to pump out of the Platte River.
Dave's over there running Double Trouble at Sacramento Creek.
They're competing with each other and they're both getting gold.
Three weeks ago, Dave Turin bet Freddy Dodge $100 his Sacramento crew would catch more gold in the race to 1,000 ounces.
But at Fairplay,
Freddy and Andy's pay dirt contains twice as much gold.
We're on the best pay that, we've had all season.
I think we're probably gonna kick their butt.
It's gonna be, nice watching Dave hand over that $100 bill to Freddy.
Boulders are fricking huge.
I've never even begun to see boulders this size.
I tell you what, I get any more rocks like this,
I ain't gonna be able to mine this ground, that's for dang sure.
Come on, you son of a gun.
That's the biggest boulder I've seen so far.
That's 20,000 pounds, I'll bet you.
And I got one down here that's even bigger than that.
Crap.
Excavator won't even touch it.
Freddy, you might want to come take a look at this.
Got kind of a problem down here.
It's slowing me down.
What's going on, Andy?
I got boulders the size of small cars in my way to getting this pay dirt out.
Holy cow.
It's a catch-22, Andy, 'cause the gold's probably pretty damn good in here.
Big rocks can mean bigger and more gold.
It's a good sign.
But at the same time, those big-ass rocks slow us way down because we have to double or triple move 'em.
Or maybe not even be able to move 'em.
Then we can't get pay to the plant.
Thousands of years ago, a receding glacier deposited monster boulders and gold-rich dirt.
When the river from the melt water washed down most of the dirt and gold, it concentrated valuable pockets of gold beneath the boulders.
Come on.
Come on.
Andy's 460 excavator is rated to lift over 50,000 pounds, the weight of eight heavy-duty pick-ups.
Whoa!
Look out!
But it still can't move the biggest of the boulders.
Hey, Todd.
You got to get your butt down here and look at this.
Aww.
Well, at this point in time, Todd, I am frustrated with this.
I cannot get these boulders out.
Some of those big rocks, it pulls the whole excavator over.
Some of our best pay came from un... right on that far side of that boulder.
There could be 100 or 200 ounces just in this little section.
Well, I'll tell you what.
I keep screwing around with these boulders, Kevin's gonna run out of pay.
You want... what do you want to do, Freddy?
I mean..
Fireworks.
Make big rocks into small rocks.
Yeah.
Let's fricking blow 'em up.
Huh?
Blow 'em to rat shit.
You blow 'em up and we can move the material.
We'll call a blaster, and hopefully, we don't have to shut down.
Okay.
We'll do it.
-Let's go, Freddy.
-Let's go.
If we can't get through those damn rocks right there, we're gonna run out of pay.
At this time of the year, it'll be game over for us.
Yeah.
Nice and level.
Tony is five hours into his 100-mile journey upriver to dismantle his second dredge.
You know, we were able to get out today.
But I don't know how many more days we're gonna get.
Skippering the power barge,
Yukon River veteran Brad Whitelaw.
Any day right now is a blessing.
Yeah, but not with the ice in the river you can see how flat it is.
You can't read the river anymore.
You can't see where the shallows are with the ripples.
This ice is blocking the view of it all.
Yeah, uh, even with a steel hull, this much weight and the momentum, a big rock, a rock edge... cut that damn thing wide open.
Can just rip her right open like a can.
Yeah.
Man, you run aground again, there's nobody out here and there's no help.
The 60 ton power barge is approaching one of the most treacherous parts of the river, notorious for its shifting sandbars.
Fuck, you can see the difference.
I come through here about three months ago and there was...
-yeah.
-at least 3, 4 feet more of water than there is now.
and I'm gonna just pull back here.
and... and we'll just take it real easy.
Yeah.
I don't see the depth finder working.
Hey, Kevin, we need to lift this depth sounder by the water.
That's in there tight.
Yep!
Now it's froze up.
Of course.
Get out of the way.
Yeah, okay.
This is getting a little too skinny for me here.
Yeah, It's getting too shallow.
I'll just back it off and...
Really getting shallow, Tony.
I'm nervous.
I don't want to get this...
I don't want to get your ship stuck.
Watch your bulkhead!
70 miles up the Yukon River...
I'm nervous.
I don't want to get this...
Yeah, I don't want to get your ship stuck.
Tony's 60-ton power barge is navigating through treacherous sandbars.
Watch your bulkhead!
Yeah, watch out for that thing.
Two and a half feet, Tony.
That's it.
Yeah, I'm pulling out of here.
We can't... we can't go any further than this.
Yeah, because you can see those rocks there, right?
After a brush with a sandbar and with the light fading,
Brad plays the safety card and moors the barge up for the night.
Man.
You're gonna trust that knife?
You don't fuckin' know where that's been.
Shit.
When you fricking uh, came up on that one spot there, sand or rock, it almost sounded like a rock 'cause it had a bang to it.
Yeah, I know.
There was something alongside of the ship and that's never a good feeling.
and I couldn't get out of there quick enough.
You got to respect the challenges of this river.
We all know people that have gone out and then they're not...
They didn't make it back home.
Yeah, we'll get and do it in the daylight.
-Yup.
-See what tomorrow brings.
-Yeah.
-What a dork!
Fine.
8:00 a.m. The crew is up early for the final push to Thistle Creek.
I want to drive.
No kidding.
Having completed 100 miles in 18 hours,
Tony spots familiar ground.
Yeah, we're here now, Tony.
Close it in.
Then, wherever we may land,
Looks like you can't go wrong here.
Lot's of beach.
Under these conditions, I think we fared pretty good.
After five months of failures,
Tony has managed to get his power barge to Thistle Creek.
Tony can finally start dismantling his second dredge.
Geez!
At Fairplay, giant boulders are blocking the Hoffman crew from mining gold-rich pay dirt.
Freddy and Todd's solution,
Blow them up.
He's a local blaster.
You Mark?
-Todd?
-Yeah.
-Todd.
-This is Freddy.
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Fred?
-I'm Freddy.
If you follow this road right down, Andy's down there in the excavator and you can talk to him and tell him what you want.
See what we got.
Thank you.
To clear the boulders,
Freddy's called in Colorado Blaster, Mark Mayer.
I love my job.
Where else in the world do you get to go blow things up on somebody else's property.
Make a mess and let them clean it up.
How you doing?
Andy.
Nice to meet ya.
What do we got going on here?
There's good gold In the ground.
I just need to get to it, and those rocks are in my way.
Well, looks like we have two options.
We can wait for... god to send down a lightning bolt and break those rocks.
Or I've got some dynamite.
Let's go with the dynamite.
Ha ha ha.
I'll get out of your way.
No worries.
Mark brings in the commando drill truck.
Its diamond-core drill will bore a 2-inch diameter hole into the heart of the boulder.
I started when I was 13.
Blew these two fingers off.
Big mistake.
I've gotten better.
I still have my head.
Look at that.
He's cutting like a hot knife through butter right there.
Drills through it pretty quick.
Underneath those boulders, I guarantee there's a lot of gold.
Looking good, Mark!
Good job!
The drill's job is done.
Extra gelatin dynamite.
That ought to do it.
To blast a 20,000-pound boulder, it will take a stick and a half of dynamite.
The energy equivalent of this is on the order of about 100 million horsepower.
What's cutting it do, Mark?
Cutting will allow the cartridge to shrink and expand in the bore hole so we get most of the energy down on the ground and in the rock.
We'll have to tamp it a little bit, very lightly.
Finish her up with sand.
That'll do it.
Let's get out of here.
The detonator box is wired and ready to fire.
They're gonna blast!
We got to take cover!
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Blasting.
Fire in the hole.
Damn, that was awesome!
Bye-bye, boulders.
I love blasting.
You're all having fun.
Kick-ass, man.
(Air horn warning))
All clear!
Awesome.
No more big boulders.
Look at that!
That'll work.
That I can move.
Good job, Mark.
My pleasure.
Bring it in!
Andy, get the excavator!
Let's go!
Andy's 460 can now make light work of the shattered boulders.
That's all I needed, just a little bit of help.
Being able to run this material right here is what's gonna get us our 1,000 ounces 'cause it is loaded with gold.
At Scribner Creek, the crew's thoughts are turning to the end of the season.
Hey, Brennan.
Start thinking about what the first thing you're gonna do when you get home is?
I can't wait to watch TV.
Yeah, I heard this...
There's a show on, Friday nights.
Yeah, it's about some guys that mine.
And they kind of do some stuff like we do.
They must be the coolest.
There's even this one guy on there, looks like he's got a tattoo of a (bleep) on his neck.
(laughter)
Fuck you, man.
We were wondering if you were listening in.
At Scribner, time is running out to hit Parker's 4,000-ounce, $4.8-million season goal.
Hey uh...
The big freeze is coming fast and they're still 1,100 ounces short.
-Hey, Ash.
-Hello.
-How's it going?
-How are you?
-Not too bad.
-What are you guys up to?
Weighing up some gold.
Yeah.
Come join us.
-Rick, you're up.
-Oh boy.
This season, Rick pledged to get 1,000 ounces at Indian River.
25
He's still 300 ounces short.
Come on, 90.
We're at 100.
That's good.
109.4
Worth over $130,000.
So, Doumitt, where's this put us at on Big Red?
That'll put you at about 811 ounces.
I'm not gonna walk away with 800.
You know, that ain't...
That ain't good enough for me.
So we're getting 1,000.
That's the attitude you need.
All right.
What'd we do last week, like 320-something?
326.
-Yeah.
That was a record for Sluicifer.
That's a big pan of gold, buddy.
This is some clean stuff, Doumitt.
Ashley, count it!
70, 80, 90, 100, 140, 160, 70, 180, 90, 200.
There's another 100 left in there, man.
220, 250 280, 300.
Keep going.
340, 360, 380... 396.1
-Oh.
-Yay.
$475,000 in gold, bringing Parker's weekly total to a massive
505 ounces, worth $600,000.
I'd tell you what, you guys.
I got some smoking news for you.
With this cleanup, we beat last year's total.
We have 3,375 ounces...
-No way!
right now.
That calls for a cheers!
-Yeah!
-Yeah!
3,375 ounces, a staggering $4 million.
Yeah, I mean, we beat last year's total, which is impressive with these two cleanups, but the work's not done.
Parker still has to find 625 ounces of gold before he's frozen out.
So let's just keep pounding the dirt through, and let's see some 4,000 ounces in the box.
-Yeah!
-Do it!
Let's do it.
-Whoo!
-Whoo!
Whoo!
In Colorado, the Hoffmans' two operations have been competing against each other in a bid to hit Todd's 1,000-ounce season goal.
Double Trouble just keeps running.
Only thing about it is, we need both.
Good.
We've got to have 'em both to get to 1,000 ounces.
You guys all done eating?
-You want to go check?
-Yeah.
To send his crew home with gold for the winter,
Todd still needs 220 ounces.
Got 'er done.
How'd we do, dad?
Where are we at?
Sacramento, 45.7
-Yeah!
-Not bad!
Worth $54,000.
But Fairplay kicked your butts.
105.2
-Whoa!
-Yeah!
Over $120,000.
Fairplay's way ahead of, Sacramento.
Hey, there's a little matter of the bet.
What are you at?
-Over 500 ounces.
-and we're at 190.
and there's snow on the mountains.
-Yeah.
-I concede.
Mr. Dodge, this hurts.
It hurts a lot.
Here's your $100.
I'd frame that.
Here's the deal...
The bet's over but the competition's still going.
-That's right.
-We're gonna bust ass.
-We got to get over 1,000.
-Okay.
So together, we did 150 ounces.
How close are we right now to 1,000?
Where we at?
Nine hundred and twenty nine.
Getting there.
We can get close.
That's a hell of a lot of gold in a short period of time.
This is just fantastic.
I...
I love it.
Good job, you guys.
I lost 100 bucks.
I don't care.
We're gonna get 1,000 ounces.
$100 of Dave's money.
Subs by {\fs71.8\b1\i1} Jack T
That's priceless.
I'm super happy.
I just can't believe it.
I can't believe the comeback in such a short period of time.
If we can keep running, uh..
I think we're gonna sail right over 1,000.
On the season finale of "Gold Rush"...
See how fuckin' thick this stuff is.
Well, this just nicely fucks me.
If we stop moving at this point, we die.
So we just got to keep everything going.
What the fuck?
Shut her down!
Shut her down!
-No way!
-Woo-hoo-hoo!
(cheers)
-Let go of me now!
-Hey!
I think I failed this year.
I will resign.
- I'm glad we could help.
- It's very impressive.
Ever since the announcement, we've had a large number of Hairies come forward for the initiative.
Well, you're making us both look good.
What are you doing?
Grab your stuff.
I need to know who or what that is.
It's a power not to be messed with, boy.
Anyone who's caught in its blast can no longer move on from this life.
I'm pregnant.
My child's a Hairy.
Please!
Well, you've been dealing with this your whole life.
But it's moulded you, shaped you for this role.
You're ready for this.
Wait.
I can't keep up this pace.
Wait.
What are you doing?
I can walk.
Alright.
I'll walk.
I've never seen one like this before.
No.
And I'm sure it's not a random attack.
No police.
Of course.
Whatever happens, she mustn't be taken to a hospital, subjected to a barrage of tests.
I understand.
Street surveillance cameras would have found them.
Won't take me long to track them down.
And get that footage off the CA system.
We don't want them anywhere near this.
Consider it done.
I'm pregnant.
Please don't hurt me.
Please, I need...
I need food and water.
I'm worried about my baby.
Do you speak English?
- We'll get you some water.
- Oh, thank God.
Please, please let me go.- -
I don't understand.
Why have you brought me here?
Perhaps I can help.
I'm a doctor.
I looked after your people in the city.
I wish your people no harm.
Please.- -
Please don't go.
Don't leave me here with him.
Oh, God.
In other headline news today, the search continues for the subhumans that escaped the Containment Authority's prison convoy.
Numbers at the Inclusion Clinic, led by the Department of Human Safety's newly appointed Waruu West, are lower than expected.
In...
Have you got a minute?
How can I help?
Anything you'd like to report?
The other creature.
The thing with the blue light.
You were going to investigate and get back to me.
He... didn't kill any of those men, did he?
No.
They appear to have been...
stunned only.
Are you suggesting it's not dangerous?
Not at all.
I'm just gathering as much information as I can.
If you can't tell me what it is, what it wants, how we can deter it?
Trust me, Minister, I will find a way to stop him.
Let me know if there's any developments.
- Been worried about you.
- Waruu tried to kill me.
That prick's trying to wipe us off the face of the earth.
He's pumping Hairies full of chemicals.
Makes them lose their hair, their strength.
All you've gotta do is volunteer, play nice.
Eventually, no CA.
No containment.
No DNA testing.
- He can't do that.
- He's doing it.
Well, then, we need to stop him.
Its scales would shimmer under the water like jewels.
And that fish was so big, so big, that whenever it moved its fin, huge waves would crash against the shore.
You telling her lies too?
I'll finish it later.
Don't do this here.
You killed my parents.
Stoned off your head.
Driving a car with your own son in the back.
What kind of person... mother does that?
Did you plan it?
Huh?
Deliberately set the whole thing up?
Answer me.
Koen...
I'm so sorry.
That's it?
"Sorry"?
What the hell was that?
I don't even know you.
Just...
listen to me.
Koen, listen.
She's sick.
Uncle Jimmy.
Unc!
Uncle!
Uncle Jimmy!
How many more people knew about the accident?
Huh?
You knew.
Waruu knew.
So was it everybody except me?
You all lied to me.
My whole life.
I grew up in bullshit!
Tell me you've found them.
Cameras tracked them all the way through the city, but then we lost them after they left sector 534.
Lost them?
They've travelled west out of the city some hours ago.
No cameras.
Moving surprisingly fast.
Highway patrols?
They weren't using roads.
But she's still alive.
West could mean mountains.
Well, can you show me?
How do I find her in there?
You'd need an army.
No-one's seen Latani?
No.
Maybe she found a way out.
We need to believe that.
After Djukara...
Our boy.
I have to go.
Boondee.
I understand why you gave up hope.
Came here.
No.
They forced me.
I never would have chosen this.
- Waruu.
- Minister.
A word?
Of course.
The polling results are in.
We've dropped several points on average.
Granted, there's a drop in competence across the board, but responses to your specific appointment and performance, well... it's not good.
You're not invoking faith in the electorate.
They see you as an ineffectual poster boy.
Takes time.
As a black man, I'll always be seen as a poster boy.
Opinion will change once we start getting results through.
We don't have time.
You need to change people's perception of you.
Convince me to trust you.
If you have seen these subhumans or Hairy sympathisers, contact your local CA branch immediately.
If you have seen these subhumans or Hairy sympathisers, contact your local CA branch immediately.
Hurry.
You have entered a prohibited area.
Run.
Run!
Run.
Go!
- No.
- Come on, Alinta.
Go!
- Drop the weapon.
- I will shoot.
I said drop the weapon.
Mum!
Go!
Run!
Stop!
Step back.
You're under arrest.
You bastard.
Latani!
- Latani!
- Latani!
You've been with Jimmy.
Yeah.
The old bastard showed you the accident, didn't he?
You have every reason to hate me.
Yeah, I do.
He showed me something else too.
What's that?
Muya.
Anyone who gets caught in the blue blast, their muya gets trapped.
Anyone?
Yeah, anyone.
Oh, if the cancer takes me right now... there's no reunion for me with the ancestors.
Yep.
CA scum.
I'll take that as a compliment, darling.
Thank you, boys.
We'll take it from here.
I'm sorry.
- We gotta let 'em go.
- What's your problem?
Let 'em go.
Stand down, Dolan.
They're just kids.
- Subbies aren't kids.
- She'll be right.
- They're animals.
- Hey?
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Are you okay?
You sure?
The woman...
She's the one I told you about.
- You're doing her mum?
- Mm-hm.
You're doing her mum?
Oh.
Well, I never would have expected that.
Turn around.
Face the car.
Turn around.
These subbies are ripping out people's hearts, and you're supposed to be stopping them.
Get in the car.
What are you going to do with me?
You know they'll be looking for me.
Where are you going?
Wait!
Why are we stopping?
Why are we stopping?
Dolan.
Dolan!
Come here.
You can have your woman.
Go on, take her.
Get out of here.
But just the mum.
You can't separate them.
You are in no position to negotiate.
- It'll be alright.
- What about the girls?
I'll take them in for processing.
Oh, man, you can't do that!
Listen, sunshine.
Take the deal or I'll report you.
Your call.
Wise man.
- Let her go!
- Come on, you're coming with me.
- Let her go!
- Come on.
Mum!
- Stop it!
- You're going with me.
In the van.
Get in the van.
- Shush!
Quiet down, darling.
- Watch your head.
- Watch your head.
- Mum!
Mum!
Where are they taking them?
Processing, alright?
We have got to go.
You can't separate us.
Please!
You being locked up won't help, alright?
Alinta, I'll come for you.
I am so sorry, Jarrod.
This is...
This is terrible.
It's an outrage.
Must be beside yourself.
Have you heard anything from them?
Any set of demands?
Nothing.
Well, the Containment Authority should handle this.
We really don't need news of it getting out.
This footage has already been edited into a package for broadcast.
Look, I understand this is your wife, but this is also a terrorism issue, national security.
On that basis, it would be a criminal offence... indeed, treason for you to...
disseminate the footage.
Wouldn't you say the public has a right to know the serious danger it faces?
I would say the public has a need to feel assured they are safe and protected from terrorism by the government.
But they're not.
Do not broadcast that footage.
The last sighting of that Hairy and my wife was in sector 532, which would suggest they're headed for the mountains.
How do you know which sector?
I want full clearance for Steve Mclntyre.
You're blackmailing me.
I'd like to think of it more as a strategic alliance.
The government and Slade Industries have worked together before.
- We can do it again.
- That's just not possible.
Well, perhaps this might persuade you that we all want the same thing, Minister.
That's from one of your CA surveillance cameras.
- But this is classified information.
- Vigilante.
Some sort of superpower, roaming the streets.
A new kind of Hairy.
The government hushes it up.
Give full access to Steve Mclntyre.
And I want whoever gave that footage to Slade.
I don't care what rules you have to bend or break.
Waruu West.
He's the first place you should look.
- How you doing?
- Good.
My partner, he took the two young females for processing?
The human and the Hairy?
Yeah.
Female human, yes.
But she was processed alone.
There's no Hairy prisoner recorded.
Okay.
Um... no worries.
He must still have her.
Can I have a quick word with the young girl?
I've gotta follow something up.
Sorry, she's being interviewed.
I'd say she won't be going anywhere tonight.
Give me a call when she's done.
Dolan, 249.
Uncle Jimmy...
Did he mention a way to get my muya back?
I think the muya can only be re-entered if someone's dead.
I have to wait?
You should kill me.
I don't know if I can bring you back.
Why would you want to?
After what I did...
That's not it.
- Something's broken.
- What do you mean?
I can't heal right anymore.
This is Waruu, isn't it?
I messed both you boys up.
I thought cancer was my punishment, but I should have realised it was bigger than that.
I'm condemned to live alone for eternity.
Aunty...
It's alright, boy.
I don't expect anything from you.
Things are as they should be.
I guess we've got nothing to lose if we give it a try, then.
Your friend, Tim Dolan, gave you to me.
That was nice of him, wasn't it?
You're the worst kind of subbie.
You know that?
Not sticking with your own kind.
Preying on weak, innocent humans.
Selling them your sob story.
I'm not afraid of you.
Good.
Well, we're going to have a little fun, then.
Don't touch me.
Not if you were the last thing on earth, darling.
You're probably crawling with lice.
So, how fast are you, subbie?
I want to see you run.
I'm sorry...
What's that?
- -
What's that?
You're casting a spell or something?
You're going to need a lot more than that.
Are you ready?
One...
Two...
Three..
Come on, come on.
Shh, shh...
You alright?
That calls for a smoke.
Jarli.
I know your people.
I've worked for them.
I've helped them.- -
You will stay here.
What?
How long?
As long as it takes.
No, I...
I need to be in a hospital.
I need a doctor.
Please.
I can walk by myself.
I can walk by myself.
Thanks.
Been searching for your girl?
Yeah.
One day, you won't come back.
You know that.
Until I know she's...
I gotta keep trying.
Sometimes, you've got to learn to live without them.
I already lost two to the CA.
They're not getting them all.
I'll die before I let that happen.
You probably will, looking like that.
She'll never even know you tried.
I've got none left.
And look at me.
First day I walked without fear... was the day I walked out of that clinic.
I think I have something you might be interested in.
Been looking for your man, the creature.
And?
Nothing on his movements.
Got another lead, about to follow up.
Elaborate.
I think I know someone who can help.
And who is that?
That animal has Charlotte.
What?
Took her, out the front of the house.
Know where she is?
No.
Same clan as our initiative man, Boondee.
Bilamunju.
You should have told me you had this.
Of course, without the Cleverman, it's just a stick.
All this is useless.
It has a pulse.
One drop of Koen's blood activated it.
Now, nothing can damage it.
Nothing.
Except this.
But I don't know how yet.
May I?
It's organic.
Once plant material and now, through petrification, stone.
It's amazing.
It was liquid when I took it.
Is that so?
Strange.
Waruu West.
Don't do anything until I get there.
Gotta go.
We're working together now, aren't we?
I'll bring it back.
We'll lose valuable time.
Turn it back into its original form.
It'll be my pleasure.
Where's my daughter?
Alinta West was found in the company of a Hairy.
That's a serious offence.
That offence needs to disappear.
Your daughter's details are not in the system.
It's as if she never existed.
Can you explain that?
Then how do you know the girl you have is my daughter?
She told us... after some argument.
If you've hurt her in any way...
She's unharmed.
Don't worry.
And all of her details now, including her crime,
- are in the system.
- I am the system.
Release her to me under house arrest, put a security tag on her.
I'll deal with the charges later.
Now, where is she?
I'll take you.
Thank God you're alright.
How stupid are you?
Nice to see you too, Dad.
Does your mother know what you've been up to?
- Where is she?
- I don't know.
Tell me.
I have no idea.
We all got split up when we were arrested.
I need to find Latani.
- You're coming home with me.
- No way.
I'm not losing you again.
You didn't lose me.
They're going to fit you with a security tag.
I'll take you home.
You're sick.
You want this back?
It's yours.
You're in a good mood.
Are you coming?
- Keep this warm for us.
- I reckon.
Maybe you're not such a prick.
- That's a crap apology.
- Who's apologising?
Whatever you said to Linda worked.
Good one.
Getting any better?
No.
Any news on Nerida and the girls?
Mustn't have been easy, what you did.
Just a bit of deep breathing, that's all.
Nah, not that bit.
You forgave the unforgiveable.
Why'd you do it?
I was crazy with grief.
Jealousy.
I loved your father.
Too much.
I just drove straight at them.
And I could see your mother had gone into labour.
I grabbed her arm and I pulled...
I pulled her from the wreckage.
There was... so much blood.
And you were coming.
I could see that.
Weren't nothing going to stop you popping out right there, in the glass and... blood and metal.
I didn't have to do much.
I always thought it was my fault that she died.
This got nothing to do with you, boy.
I brought all this on.
I guess we're even, then.
Enough yapping.
We gotta get you out of them clothes.
You're a leader, boy.
You're going to start looking like one.
Like Uncle Jimmy...
mad hair and no shoes.
Do you like it?
Don't I get to choose any of my own stuff?
Step outside, the alarm gets activated at CA.
Damage or break the security tag, same thing.
I'll make us some dinner.
Come inside.
It's safe.
You can have a shower, get some rest.
We can talk later.
I promise.
You're just another slaver.
What makes it worse is that you're a black slaver.
I'm more black than you'll ever be.
Your skin's the only thing about you that says black man.
I need this tested.
I'd appreciate if you kept this
- between the two of us.
- Of course.
One of your people took something that belongs to Slade.
We are going to get it back.
Keep quiet.
You shut this down, then what?
I go back to being hunted on the streets.
Previously on Cleverman...
You don't know anything about him.
He's CA.
I need to know who or what that is.
It's a power not to be messed with, boy.
Anyone who's caught in its blast can no longer move on from this life.
I'm pregnant.
My child's a Hairy.
Please!
You lied to me all my life!

No.
And I'm sure it's not a random attack.
No police.
Of course.
Whatever happens, she mustn't be taken to a hospital, subjected to a barrage of tests.
I understand.
Street surveillance cameras would have found them.
Won't take me long to track them down.
And get that footage off the CA system.
We don't want them anywhere near this.
Consider it done.
I'm pregnant.
Please don't hurt me.
Please, I need...

I'm worried about my baby.

NEWSREADER:
In other headline news today, the search continues for the subhumans that escaped the Containment Authority's prison convoy.
Numbers at the Inclusion Clinic, led by the Department of Human Safety's newly appointed Waruu West, are lower than expected.
In...
(DOOR OPENS)
Have you got a minute?
How can I help?
Anything you'd like to report?
The other creature.
The thing with the blue light.
You were going to investigate and get back to me.
He... didn't kill any of those men, did he?
No.
They appear to have been...
stunned only.
Are you suggesting it's not dangerous?
Not at all.
I'm just gathering as much information as I can.
If you can't tell me what it is, what it wants, how we can deter it?
Trust me, Minister, I will find a way to stop him.
Let me know if there's any developments.
- Been worried about you.
- Waruu tried to kill me.
That prick's trying to wipe us off the face of the earth.
He's pumping Hairies full of chemicals.
Makes them lose their hair, their strength.
All you've gotta do is volunteer, play nice.
Eventually, no CA.
No containment.
No DNA testing.
- He can't do that.
- He's doing it.
Well, then, we need to stop him.
AUNTY LINDA:
Its scales would shimmer under the water like jewels.
And that fish was so big, so big, that whenever it moved its fin, huge waves would crash against the shore.
You telling her lies too?
I'll finish it later.
Don't do this here.
You killed my parents.
Stoned off your head.
Driving a car with your own son in the back.
What kind of person... mother does that?
Did you plan it?
Huh?
Deliberately set the whole thing up?
Answer me.
Koen...
I'm so sorry.
That's it?
"Sorry"?
What the hell was that?
I don't even know you.
Just...
listen to me.
Koen, listen.
She's sick.
Uncle Jimmy.
Unc!
Uncle!
Uncle Jimmy!
How many more people knew about the accident?
Huh?
You knew.
Waruu knew.
So was it everybody except me?
You all lied to me.
My whole life.
I grew up in bullshit!
Tell me you've found them.
Cameras tracked them all the way through the city, but then we lost them after they left sector 534.
Lost them?
They've travelled west out of the city some hours ago.
No cameras.
Moving surprisingly fast.
Highway patrols?
They weren't using roads.
But she's still alive.
West could mean mountains.
Well, can you show me?
How do I find her in there?
You'd need an army.
No-one's seen Latani?
No.
Maybe she found a way out.
We need to believe that.
After Djukara...
Our boy.
I have to go.
Boondee.
I understand why you gave up hope.
Came here.
No.
They forced me.
I never would have chosen this.
- Waruu.
- Minister.
A word?
Of course.
The polling results are in.
We've dropped several points on average.
Granted, there's a drop in competence across the board, but responses to your specific appointment and performance, well... it's not good.
You're not invoking faith in the electorate.
They see you as an ineffectual poster boy.
Takes time.
As a black man, I'll always be seen as a poster boy.
Opinion will change once we start getting results through.
We don't have time.
You need to change people's perception of you.
Convince me to trust you.

You have every reason to hate me.
Yeah, I do.
He showed me something else too.
What's that?
Muya.
Anyone who gets caught in the blue blast, their muya gets trapped.
Anyone?
Yeah, anyone.
Oh, if the cancer takes me right now... there's no reunion for me with the ancestors.
Yep.

I'll take that as a compliment, darling.
Thank you, boys.
We'll take it from here.
I'm sorry.

Let 'em go.
Stand down, Dolan.
They're just kids.

I always thought it was my fault that she died.
This got nothing to do with you, boy.
I brought all this on.
I guess we're even, then.
Enough yapping.
We gotta get you out of them clothes.
You're a leader, boy.
You're going to start looking like one.
Like Uncle Jimmy...
mad hair and no shoes.
(BOTH LAUGH)
Do you like it?
Don't I get to choose any of my own stuff?
Step outside, the alarm gets activated at CA.
Damage or break the security tag, same thing.
I'll make us some dinner.
- WARUU:
I'm glad we could help.
- It's very impressive.
Ever since the announcement, we've had a large number of Hairies come forward for the initiative.
Well, you're making us both look good.
NARIDA:
What are you doing?
Grab your stuff.
I need to know who or what that is.
It's a power not to be messed with, boy.
Anyone who's caught in its blast can no longer move on from this life.
(SCREAMS)
I'm pregnant.
My child's a Hairy.
Please!
Well, you've been dealing with this your whole life.
But it's moulded you, shaped you for this role.
You're ready for this.

MAN:
I've never seen one like this before.
JARROD:
No.
And I'm sure it's not a random attack.
No police.
Of course.
Whatever happens, she mustn't be taken to a hospital, subjected to a barrage of tests.
I understand.
Street surveillance cameras would have found them.
Won't take me long to track them down.
And get that footage off the CA system.
We don't want them anywhere near this.
Consider it done.
I'm pregnant.
Please don't hurt me.
Please, I need...
I need food and water.
I'm worried about my baby.
Do you speak English?
- We'll get you some water.
- Oh, thank God.
Please, please let me go.- -
I don't understand.
Why have you brought me here?
Perhaps I can help.
I'm a doctor.
I looked after your people in the city.
I wish your people no harm.
Please.- -
Please don't go.
Don't leave me here with him.
Oh, God.
NEWSREADER:
In other headline news today, the search continues for the subhumans that escaped the Containment Authority's prison convoy.
Numbers at the Inclusion Clinic, led by the Department of Human Safety's newly appointed Waruu West, are lower than expected.
In...
(DOOR OPENS)
Have you got a minute?
How can I help?
Anything you'd like to report?
The other creature.
The thing with the blue light.
You were going to investigate and get back to me.
He... didn't kill any of those men, did he?
No.
They appear to have been...
stunned only.
Are you suggesting it's not dangerous?
Not at all.
I'm just gathering as much information as I can.
If you can't tell me what it is, what it wants, how we can deter it?
Trust me, Minister, I will find a way to stop him.
Let me know if there's any developments.
- Been worried about you.
- Waruu tried to kill me.
That prick's trying to wipe us off the face of the earth.
He's pumping Hairies full of chemicals.
Makes them lose their hair, their strength.
All you've gotta do is volunteer, play nice.
Eventually, no CA.
No containment.
No DNA testing.
- He can't do that.
- He's doing it.
Well, then, we need to stop him.
AUNTY LINDA:
Its scales would shimmer under the water like jewels.
And that fish was so big, so big, that whenever it moved its fin, huge waves would crash against the shore.
You telling her lies too?
I'll finish it later.
Don't do this here.
You killed my parents.
Stoned off your head.
Driving a car with your own son in the back.
What kind of person... mother does that?
Did you plan it?
Huh?
Deliberately set the whole thing up?
Answer me.
Koen...
I'm so sorry.
That's it?
"Sorry"?
What the hell was that?
I don't even know you.
Just...
listen to me.
Koen, listen.
She's sick.
Uncle Jimmy.
Unc!
Uncle!
Uncle Jimmy!
How many more people knew about the accident?
Huh?
You knew.
Waruu knew.
So was it everybody except me?
You all lied to me.
My whole life.
I grew up in bullshit!
Tell me you've found them.
Cameras tracked them all the way through the city, but then we lost them after they left sector 534.
Lost them?
They've travelled west out of the city some hours ago.
No cameras.
Moving surprisingly fast.
Highway patrols?
They weren't using roads.
But she's still alive.
West could mean mountains.
Well, can you show me?
How do I find her in there?
You'd need an army.
No-one's seen Latani?
No.
Maybe she found a way out.
We need to believe that.
After Djukara...
Our boy.
I have to go.
Boondee.
I understand why you gave up hope.
Came here.
No.
They forced me.
I never would have chosen this.
- Waruu.
- Minister.
A word?
Of course.
The polling results are in.
We've dropped several points on average.
Granted, there's a drop in competence across the board, but responses to your specific appointment and performance, well... it's not good.
You're not invoking faith in the electorate.
They see you as an ineffectual poster boy.
Takes time.
As a black man, I'll always be seen as a poster boy.
Opinion will change once we start getting results through.
We don't have time.
You need to change people's perception of you.
Convince me to trust you.
LOUDSPEAKER:
If you have seen these subhumans or Hairy sympathisers, contact your local CA branch immediately.

Go!
- MAN:
Drop the weapon.
- I will shoot.
I said drop the weapon.
(GRUNTS)
Mum!
Go!
Run!
Stop!
Step back.
You're under arrest.
You bastard.
- (GUNSHOT)
- Latani!
- Latani!
- Latani!
You've been with Jimmy.
Yeah.
The old bastard showed you the accident, didn't he?
You have every reason to hate me.
Yeah, I do.
He showed me something else too.
What's that?
Muya.
Anyone who gets caught in the blue blast, their muya gets trapped.
Anyone?
Yeah, anyone.
Oh, if the cancer takes me right now... there's no reunion for me with the ancestors.
Yep.
ALINTA:
CA scum.
I'll take that as a compliment, darling.
Thank you, boys.
We'll take it from here.
I'm sorry.
- We gotta let 'em go.
- What's your problem?
Let 'em go.
Stand down, Dolan.
They're just kids.
- Subbies aren't kids.
- She'll be right.
- They're animals.
- Hey?
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Are you okay?
You sure?
The woman...
She's the one I told you about.
- You're doing her mum?
- Mm-hm.
(LAUGHS)
You're doing her mum?
(CHUCKLES)
Oh.
Well, I never would have expected that.
Turn around.
Face the car.
Turn around.
These subbies are ripping out people's hearts, and you're supposed to be stopping them.
Get in the car.
What are you going to do with me?
You know they'll be looking for me.
Where are you going?
Wait!
Why are we stopping?
Why are we stopping?
Dolan.
Dolan!
OFFICER:
Come here.
You can have your woman.
Go on, take her.
Get out of here.
But just the mum.
You can't separate them.
You are in no position to negotiate.
- It'll be alright.
- What about the girls?
I'll take them in for processing.
Oh, man, you can't do that!
Listen, sunshine.
Take the deal or I'll report you.
Your call.
Wise man.
- ALINTA:
Let her go!
- Come on, you're coming with me.
- Let her go!
- Come on.
Mum!
- Stop it!
- You're going with me.
In the van.
Get in the van.
- Shush!
Quiet down, darling.
- Watch your head.
- Watch your head.
- Mum!
Mum!
Where are they taking them?
Processing, alright?
We have got to go.
You can't separate us.
Please!
You being locked up won't help, alright?
Alinta, I'll come for you.
I am so sorry, Jarrod.
This is...
This is terrible.
It's an outrage.
Must be beside yourself.
Have you heard anything from them?
Any set of demands?
Nothing.
Well, the Containment Authority should handle this.
We really don't need news of it getting out.
This footage has already been edited into a package for broadcast.
Look, I understand this is your wife, but this is also a terrorism issue, national security.
On that basis, it would be a criminal offence... indeed, treason for you to...
disseminate the footage.
Wouldn't you say the public has a right to know the serious danger it faces?
I would say the public has a need to feel assured they are safe and protected from terrorism by the government.
But they're not.
Do not broadcast that footage.
The last sighting of that Hairy and my wife was in sector 532, which would suggest they're headed for the mountains.
How do you know which sector?
I want full clearance for Steve Mclntyre.
You're blackmailing me.
I'd like to think of it more as a strategic alliance.
The government and Slade Industries have worked together before.
- We can do it again.
- That's just not possible.
Well, perhaps this might persuade you that we all want the same thing, Minister.
That's from one of your CA surveillance cameras.
- But this is classified information.
- Vigilante.
Some sort of superpower, roaming the streets.
A new kind of Hairy.
The government hushes it up.
Give full access to Steve Mclntyre.
And I want whoever gave that footage to Slade.
I don't care what rules you have to bend or break.
Waruu West.
He's the first place you should look.
(ELECTRIC RAZOR BUZZES)
(DOOR BEEPS)
- How you doing?
- Good.
My partner, he took the two young females for processing?
The human and the Hairy?
Yeah.
Female human, yes.
But she was processed alone.
There's no Hairy prisoner recorded.
Okay.
Um... no worries.
He must still have her.
Can I have a quick word with the young girl?
I've gotta follow something up.
Sorry, she's being interviewed.
I'd say she won't be going anywhere tonight.
Give me a call when she's done.
Dolan, 249.
AUNTY LINDA:
Uncle Jimmy...
Did he mention a way to get my muya back?
I think the muya can only be re-entered if someone's dead.
I have to wait?
You should kill me.
I don't know if I can bring you back.
Why would you want to?
After what I did...
That's not it.
- Something's broken.
- What do you mean?
I can't heal right anymore.
This is Waruu, isn't it?
I messed both you boys up.
I thought cancer was my punishment, but I should have realised it was bigger than that.
I'm condemned to live alone for eternity.
Aunty...
It's alright, boy.
I don't expect anything from you.
Things are as they should be.
I guess we've got nothing to lose if we give it a try, then.
Your friend, Tim Dolan, gave you to me.
That was nice of him, wasn't it?
You're the worst kind of subbie.
You know that?
Not sticking with your own kind.
Preying on weak, innocent humans.
Selling them your sob story.
I'm not afraid of you.
Good.
Well, we're going to have a little fun, then.
- Don't touch me.
- (CHUCKLES)
Not if you were the last thing on earth, darling.
You're probably crawling with lice.
So, how fast are you, subbie?
I want to see you run.
I'm sorry...
What's that?
- -
What's that?
You're casting a spell or something?
You're going to need a lot more than that.
Are you ready?
One...
Two...
Three..

MAN:
Jarli.
I know your people.
I've worked for them.
I've helped them.- -
You will stay here.
What?
How long?
As long as it takes.
No, I...
I need to be in a hospital.
I need a doctor.
Please.
I can walk by myself.
I can walk by myself.
Thanks.
Been searching for your girl?
Yeah.
One day, you won't come back.
You know that.
Until I know she's...
I gotta keep trying.
Sometimes, you've got to learn to live without them.
I already lost two to the CA.
They're not getting them all.
I'll die before I let that happen.
You probably will, looking like that.
She'll never even know you tried.
I've got none left.
And look at me.
First day I walked without fear... was the day I walked out of that clinic.
(FOOTAGE REPLAYS CONTINUOUSLY)
I think I have something you might be interested in.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)
Been looking for your man, the creature.
And?
Nothing on his movements.
Got another lead, about to follow up.
Elaborate.
I think I know someone who can help.
And who is that?
JARROD:
That animal has Charlotte.
What?
Took her, out the front of the house.
Know where she is?
No.
Same clan as our initiative man, Boondee.
Bilamunju.
You should have told me you had this.
Of course, without the Cleverman, it's just a stick.
All this is useless.
It has a pulse.
One drop of Koen's blood activated it.
Now, nothing can damage it.
Nothing.
Except this.
But I don't know how yet.
May I?
It's organic.
Once plant material and now, through petrification, stone.
It's amazing.
It was liquid when I took it.
Is that so?
Strange.
(PHONE BUZZES)
Waruu West.
Don't do anything until I get there.
Gotta go.
We're working together now, aren't we?
I'll bring it back.
We'll lose valuable time.
Turn it back into its original form.
It'll be my pleasure.
Where's my daughter?
Alinta West was found in the company of a Hairy.
That's a serious offence.
That offence needs to disappear.
Your daughter's details are not in the system.
It's as if she never existed.
Can you explain that?
Then how do you know the girl you have is my daughter?
She told us... after some argument.
If you've hurt her in any way...
She's unharmed.
Don't worry.
And all of her details now, including her crime,
- are in the system.
- I am the system.
Release her to me under house arrest, put a security tag on her.
I'll deal with the charges later.
Now, where is she?
I'll take you.
(DOOR BEEPS)
(DOOR UNLOCKS)
Thank God you're alright.
How stupid are you?
Nice to see you too, Dad.
Does your mother know what you've been up to?
- Where is she?
- I don't know.
Tell me.
I have no idea.
We all got split up when we were arrested.
I need to find Latani.
- You're coming home with me.
- No way.
I'm not losing you again.
You didn't lose me.
They're going to fit you with a security tag.
I'll take you home.
You're sick.
You want this back?
It's yours.
You're in a good mood.
Are you coming?
- Keep this warm for us.
- I reckon.
Maybe you're not such a prick.
- That's a crap apology.
- Who's apologising?
Whatever you said to Linda worked.
Good one.
Getting any better?
No.
Any news on Nerida and the girls?
Mustn't have been easy, what you did.
Just a bit of deep breathing, that's all.
Nah, not that bit.
You forgave the unforgiveable.
Why'd you do it?
I was crazy with grief.
Jealousy.
I loved your father.
Too much.
I just drove straight at them.
And I could see your mother had gone into labour.
I grabbed her arm and I pulled...
I pulled her from the wreckage.
There was... so much blood.
And you were coming.
I could see that.
Weren't nothing going to stop you popping out right there, in the glass and... blood and metal.
I didn't have to do much.
I always thought it was my fault that she died.
This got nothing to do with you, boy.
I brought all this on.
I guess we're even, then.
Enough yapping.
We gotta get you out of them clothes.
You're a leader, boy.
You're going to start looking like one.
Like Uncle Jimmy...
mad hair and no shoes.

Do you like it?
Don't I get to choose any of my own stuff?
Step outside, the alarm gets activated at CA.
Damage or break the security tag, same thing.
I'll make us some dinner.
Come inside.
It's safe.
You can have a shower, get some rest.
We can talk later.
I promise.
You're just another slaver.
What makes it worse is that you're a black slaver.
I'm more black than you'll ever be.
Your skin's the only thing about you that says black man.
I need this tested.
I'd appreciate if you kept this
- between the two of us.
- Of course.
MAN:
One of your people took something that belongs to Slade.
We are going to get it back.
(WHISTLES)
Keep quiet.
You shut this down, then what?
I go back to being hunted on the streets.
Previously on Cleverman...
You don't know anything about him.
He's CA.
I need to know who or what that is.
It's a power not to be messed with, boy.
Anyone who's caught in its blast can no longer move on from this life.
I'm pregnant.
My child's a Hairy.
Please!
You lied to me all my life!
Wait.
I can't keep up this pace.
Wait.
What are you doing?
I can walk.
Alright.
I'll walk.
I've never seen one like this before.
No.

A new kind of Hairy.
The government hushes it up.
Give full access to Steve Mclntyre.
And I want whoever gave that footage to Slade.
I don't care what rules you have to bend or break.
Waruu West.
He's the first place you should look.
- How you doing?
- Good.
My partner, he took the two young females for processing?
The human and the Hairy?
Yeah.
Female human, yes.
But she was processed alone.
There's no Hairy prisoner recorded.
Okay.
Um... no worries.
He must still have her.
Can I have a quick word with the young girl?
I've gotta follow something up.
Sorry, she's being interviewed.
I'd say she won't be going anywhere tonight.
Give me a call when she's done.
Dolan, 249.
Uncle Jimmy...
Did he mention a way to get my muya back?
I think the muya can only be re-entered if someone's dead.
I have to wait?
You should kill me.
I don't know if I can bring you back.
Why would you want to?
After what I did...
That's not it.
- Something's broken.
- What do you mean?
I can't heal right anymore.
This is Waruu, isn't it?
I messed both you boys up.
I thought cancer was my punishment, but I should have realised it was bigger than that.
I'm condemned to live alone for eternity.
Aunty...
It's alright, boy.
I don't expect anything from you.
Things are as they should be.
I guess we've got nothing to lose if we give it a try, then.
Your friend, Tim Dolan, gave you to me.
That was nice of him, wasn't it?
You're the worst kind of subbie.
You know that?
Not sticking with your own kind.
Preying on weak, innocent humans.
Selling them your sob story.
I'm not afraid of you.
Good.
Well, we're going to have a little fun, then.
Don't touch me.
Not if you were the last thing on earth, darling.
You're probably crawling with lice.
So, how fast are you, subbie?
I want to see you run.
I'm sorry...
What's that?
- -
What's that?
You're casting a spell or something?
You're going to need a lot more than that.
Are you ready?
One...
Two...
Three...
Come on, come on.
Shh, shh...
You alright?
That calls for a smoke.
Jarli.
I know your people.
I've worked for them.
I've helped them.- -
Please.- -
You will stay here.
What?
How long?
As long as it takes.
No, I...
I need to be in a hospital.
I need a doctor.
Please.
I can walk by myself.
I can walk by myself.
Thanks.
Been searching for your girl?
Yeah.
One day, you won't come back.
You know that.
Until I know she's...
I gotta keep trying.
Sometimes, you've got to learn to live without them.
I already lost two to the CA.
They're not getting them all.
I'll die before I let that happen.
You probably will, looking like that.
She'll never even know you tried.
I've got none left.
And look at me.
First day I walked without fear... was the day I walked out of that clinic.
I think I have something you might be interested in.
Been looking for your man, the creature.
And?
Nothing on his movements.
Got another lead, about to follow up.
Elaborate.
I think I know someone who can help.
And who is that?
That animal has Charlotte.
What?
Took her, out the front of the house.
Know where she is?
No.
Same clan as our initiative man, Boondee.
Bilamunju.
You should have told me you had this.
Of course, without the Cleverman, it's just a stick.
All this is useless.
It has a pulse.
One drop of Koen's blood activated it.
Now, nothing can damage it.
Nothing.
Except this.
But I don't know how yet.
May I?
It's organic.
Once plant material and now, through petrification, stone.
It's amazing.
It was liquid when I took it.
Is that so?
Strange.
Waruu West.
Don't do anything until I get there.
Gotta go.
We're working together now, aren't we?
I'll bring it back.
We'll lose valuable time.
Turn it back into its original form.
It'll be my pleasure.
Where's my daughter?
Alinta West was found in the company of a Hairy.
That's a serious offence.
That offence needs to disappear.
Your daughter's details are not in the system.
It's as if she never existed.
Can you explain that?
Then how do you know the girl you have is my daughter?
She told us... after some argument.
If you've hurt her in any way...
She's unharmed.
Don't worry.
And all of her details now, including her crime,
- are in the system.
- I am the system.
Release her to me under house arrest, put a security tag on her.
I'll deal with the charges later.
Now, where is she?
I'll take you.
Thank God you're alright.
How stupid are you?
Nice to see you too, Dad.
Does your mother know what you've been up to?
- Where is she?
- I don't know.
Tell me.
I have no idea.
We all got split up when we were arrested.
I need to find Latani.
- You're coming home with me.
- No way.
I'm not losing you again.
You didn't lose me.
They're going to fit you with a security tag.
I'll take you home.
You're sick.
You want this back?
It's yours.
You're in a good mood.
Are you coming?
- Keep this warm for us.
- I reckon.
Maybe you're not such a prick.
- That's a crap apology.
- Who's apologising?
Whatever you said to Linda worked.
Good one.
Getting any better?
No.
Any news on Nerida and the girls?
Mustn't have been easy, what you did.
Just a bit of deep breathing, that's all.
Nah, not that bit.
You forgave the unforgiveable.
Why'd you do it?
I was crazy with grief.
Jealousy.
I loved your father.
Too much.
I just drove straight at them.
And I could see your mother had gone into labour.
I grabbed her arm and I pulled...
I pulled her from the wreckage.
There was... so much blood.
And you were coming.
I could see that.
Weren't nothing going to stop you popping out right there, in the glass and... blood and metal.
I didn't have to do much.
I always thought it was my fault that she died.
This got nothing to do with you, boy.
I brought all this on.
I guess we're even, then.
Enough yapping.
We gotta get you out of them clothes.
You're a leader, boy.
You're going to start looking like one.
Like Uncle Jimmy...
mad hair and no shoes.
Do you like it?
Don't I get to choose any of my own stuff?
Step outside, the alarm gets activated at CA.
Damage or break the security tag, same thing.
I'll make us some dinner.
Previously on "Cleverman..."
We don't know anything about him.
He's CA.
I need to know who or what that is.
It's a power not to be messed with, boy.
Anyone who's caught in its blast can no longer move on through this life.
No, I'm pregnant!
My child's a hairy!
Please!
You lied to me all my life.
Wait!
I can't keep up this pace.
Boy...
What are you doing?
!
I can walk.
All right?
I'll walk.
I've never seen one like this before.
No.
But I'm sure it's not a random attack.
No police.
Of course.
Whatever happens, she mustn't be taken to a hospital, subjected to a barrage of tests.
I understand.
Street surveillance cameras would have found them.
Won't take me long to track them down.
And get that footage off the CA system.
We don't want them anywhere near this.
Consider it done.
I'm pregnant!
Please don't hurt me!
- Please, I need...
- I need food and water.
I'm worried about my baby.
Do you speak English?
- We'll get you some water.
- Thank God.
Please, please let me go.
I don't understand.
Why have you brought me here?
Perhaps I can help.
I'm a doctor.
I looked after your people in the city.
I wish your people no harm.
Please don't go!
Don't leave me here with him!
God...
In other headline news today, the search continues for the subhumans that escaped the Containment Authority's prison convoy.
Numbers at the Inclusion Clinic, led by the Department of Human Safety's newly appointed Waruu West, are lower than expected.
In...
Have you got a minute?
How can I help?
Anything you'd like to report?
The other creature.
The thing with the blue light.
You were going to investigate, get back to me.
He, um, didn't kill any of those men, did he?
No, they appear to have been... stunned only.
Are you suggesting it's not dangerous?
Not at all.
I'm just gathering as much information as I can.
But you can't tell me what it is?
What it wants?
How we can deter it?
Trust me, Minister, I will find a way to stop him.
Let me know if there's any developments.
Been worried about you.
Waruu tried to kill me.
That prick's trying to wipe us off the face of the earth.
He's pumping Hairies full of chemicals.
Makes them lose their hair, their strength.
All you gotta do is volunteer, play nice.
Eventually no CA, no containment, no DNA testing.
- He can't do that.
- He's doing it.
Well, then, we need to stop him.
Its scales would shimmer under the water like jewels.
And that fish, it was so big...
So big that whenever it moved its fin, huge waves would crash against the shore.
You telling her lies, too?
We'll finish it later.
Don't do this here.
You killed my parents.
Stoned off your head, driving a car with your own son in the back.
What kind of person...
Mother does that?
Did you plan it?
Deliberately set the whole thing up?
Answer me.
Koen...
I'm so sorry.
That's it?
Sorry?
- What the hell was that?
- I don't even know you.
Just listen to me.
Koen, listen.
She's sick.
Uncle Jimmy!
Unc?
!
Uncle?
!
Uncle Jimmy!
How many more people know about the accident?
You knew.
Waruu knew.
So, is it everybody except me?
You all lied to me my whole life.
I grew up in bullshit!
Tell me you found her.
Cameras tracked them all the way through the city, but then we lost them after they left Sector 534.
Lost them?
They've travelled west out of the city some hours ago.
No cameras.
Moving surprisingly fast.
Highway patrols?
They weren't using roads.
But she's still alive.
West could mean mountains.
What can you show me?
How do I find her in there?
You'd need an army.
No one's seen Latani?
No.
Maybe she found a way out.
We need to believe that.
After Djukara... our boy...
I have to go.
Boondee...
I understand why you gave up hope, came here.
No.
They forced me.
I never would have chosen this.
- Waruu.
- Minister.
- A word?
- Of course.
The polling results are in.
We've dropped several points on the rolling average.
Granted, there's a drop in confidence across the board, but responses to your specific appointment and performance, well...
it's not good.
You're not invoking faith in the electorate.
They see you as an ineffectual poster boy.
It takes time.
As a black man, I'll always be seen as a poster boy.
Opinion will change once we start getting results through.
We don't have time.
You need to change people's perception of you.
Convince me to trust you.
If you have seen these subhumans or Hairy sympathizers, contact your local CA branch immediately.
If you have seen these subhumans or Hairy sympathizers, contact your local CA branch immediately.
Hurry.
You have entered a prohibited area.
Run!
Run!
Latani!
Agh!
Run.
Go!
- No!
- Come on, Alinta!
- Go!
- Drop the weapon!
- I will shoot!
- I said drop the weapon!
Mom!
Go!
Run!
- Relax.
- Hey!
- Stop!
- Alinta.
- Step back!
- You're under arrest!
You bastard!
Latani!
- Latani!
- Latani!
Hey.
- You've been with Jimmy.
- Yeah.
The old bastard showed you the accident, didn't he?
You have every reason to hate me.
Yeah, I do.
He showed me something else, too.
What's that?
Muya.
Anyone that gets caught in the blue blast, their muya gets trapped.
Anyone?
Yeah, anyone.
Well, if the cancer takes me right now, there's no reunion for me with the ancestors.
Yep.
- CA are scum!
- I'll take that as a compliment, darling.
Thank you, boys.
We'll take it from here.
I'm sorry.
We gotta let them go.
- What's your problem?
- Let them go.
- Oi.
- Stand down, Dolan.
They're just kids.
Subbies aren't kids.
- They're animals.
The hell is wrong with you?
- Hey.
You okay?
You sure?
The woman.
She's the one I told you about.
You're doing a mum?
You're doing a mum?
Well, I never would've expected that.
Turn around, face the car.
Turn around.
These subbies are ripping out people's hearts and you're supposed to be stopping them.
Get in the car.
What are you gonna do with me?
Where are you going?
Wwait!
Why are we stopping?
Why are we stopping?
Dolan.
Dolan!
Come here.
You can have your woman.
Go on, take her.
Get out of here.
- But just the mum.
- Man, you can't separate them.
You are in no position to negotiate.
- It'll be all right.
- What about the girls?
- I'll take them in for processing now.
- Man, you can't do that!
Listen, sunshine.
Take the deal, or I'll report you.
Your call.
Wise man.
Let her go!
Come on, you're coming with me.
- Let her go!
Mum!
- Come on!
Come on!
- Just stop it!
- You're coming with me!
- In the van!
- No!
- Get in the van!
- You bastard!
- Watch your head.
- Shh, quiet down, darling.
- Watch your head.
- Mom!
Mom!
Where are they taking them?
!
Processing, all right?
We have gotta go.
- You can't separate us!
- You being locked up won't help, all right?
!
Alinta!
I'll come for you!
I am so sorry, Jarrod.
This is... this is terrible.
It's an outrage.
You... must be beside yourself.
Have you heard anything from them, any sort of demands?
Nothing.
Well, the Containment Authority should handle this.
We really don't need news of it getting out.
This footage has already been edited into a package for broadcast.
Look, I understand this is your wife, but this is also a terrorism issue, national security.
On that basis, it'd be a criminal offense, indeed treason, for you to disseminate the footage.
Wouldn't you say the public has a right to know the serious danger it faces?
I would say the public has a need to feel assured they are safe and protected from terrorism by the government.
But they're not.
Do not broadcast that footage.
The last sighting of that Hairy and my wife was in Sector 532, which would suggest they're headed for the mountains.
How do you know which sector?
I want full clearance for Steve Mclntyre.
You're blackmailing me.
I'd like to think of it more as a strategic alliance.
The government and Slade Industries have worked together before.
- We can do it again.
- That's just not possible.
Well, perhaps this might persuade you that we all want the same thing, Minister.
That's from one of your CA surveillance cameras.
But this is classified information.
A vigilante with some sort of super power roaming the streets.
A new kind of Hairy.
The government hushes it up.
Give full access to Steve Mclntyre.
And I want whoever gave that footage to Slade, and I don't care what rules you have to bend or break.
Waruu West.
He's the first place you should look.
- How you doing?
- Good.
My partner, he dropped off two young females for processing...
A human and a Hairy.
Yeah, female human, yes, but she was processed alone.
There's no Hairy prisoner recorded.
Okay, um, no worries.
He must still have her.
Can I have a quick word with the young girl?
I've gotta follow something up.
Sorry.
She's being interviewed.
I'd say she won't be going anywhere tonight.
Right.
Give me a call when she's done?
- Dolan, 249.
- Got it.
Uncle Jimmy... did he mention a way to get my muya back?
I think the muya can only be reentered if someone's dead.
I have to wait.
You should kill me.
I don't know if I can bring you back.
Well, why would you want to after what I did?
That's not it.
- Something's broken.
- What do you mean?
I can't heal right anymore.
This is Waruu, isn't it?
I messed both you boys up.
I thought cancer was my punishment, but I should've realized it was bigger than that.

This footage has already been edited into a package for broadcast.
Look, I understand this is your wife, but this is also a terrorism issue, national security.
On that basis, it'd be a criminal offense, indeed treason, for you to disseminate the footage.
Wouldn't you say the public has a right to know the serious danger it faces?
I would say the public has a need to feel assured they are safe and protected from terrorism by the government.
But they're not.
Do not broadcast that footage.

If it's not too urgent, let's talk at home.
Okay.
See you at home.
Okay.
Madam Lee.
Were you very surprised?
I apologize.
Then... is Mr. Kim my son?
Is he really my son?
Yes.
He is.
How...
How could this be?
Then...
Why did you lie to me until now?
Why?
I had no other option.
What about my husband?
I heard Mr. Kim only has a grandmother.
My husband.
Is he really dead?
Yes.
When Mr. Kim was eight years old, he lost his father.
I thought my whole family had died in the war.
How could this be true?
Madam Lee, you need to think carefully.
Mr. Kim grew up thinking you were dead.
I feel the same.
I had buried my son in my heart.
The son I thought was dead is actually alive and I know now.
I only just found out.
There's another problem other than that one.
What?
Think what will happen when Mr. Kim learns of all this.
The mom he thought was dead is alive... and you're the mother of the woman he's in love with.
How do you think he will feel then?
Then...
What should I do now?
I know how shocked and confused you are.
But now is the time when you must be clear-headed.
Mr. Kim and Soo In are going through... too much right now to be able to... handle the truth.

Hello?
Mother, it's me.
Why did you ask to see me?
I found out yesterday that... the son I'd lost when he was two weeks old... is actually Mr. Kim.
Seon Woo.
I never got to call his name.
I just found out that he is my son.
I wanted to go to him right away.
But I just couldn't.
I couldn't bring myself to do that, so I asked to see you instead.
Go to Seon Woo?
And do what?
Tell him that you're his mom?
What should I do now?
If you really care for him and want to do the right thing, do not let him see you again.
That's the best you can do for him.
I heard that...
Il Joo died when Seon Woo was eight.
What happened?
Was he very sick?
It was an accident.
Then... did you raise Seon Woo from then onward?
Yes.
Thank you, Mother.
You raised him well.
Thank you for raising him into such a nice young man.
Seon Woo went through a lot as a child... because he had no parents.
He was hurt more than enough.
I don't want him to suffer because of what we adults did.
Finding out the son I thought was dead is alive... is a miracle and you'll never know how thankful I am.
But... not being able to tell him that I'm his mother... breaks my heart and it hurts so much.
What can you do?
Soo In and Seon Woo cannot be, and you must think how badly the truth will hurt Seon Woo.
If you care for him, please do not show up around him again.

"Gonna" live up to it?
Oh, so you're one of those types.
You take everyone-'s ride, and then ship it back to the States?
You watch your mouth.
Now you got a problem.
I'm gonna keep it about the cars.
(IN ENGLISH} You want a car, get it the right way.
How?
Race for it.
I already own it, bro.
Not that car.
Mine.
Dom, his car is the fastest car on the island.
Do you know what he has under that hood?
He knows it doesn't matter what's under a hood.
The only thing that matters is who's behind the wheel.
You think so?
I know so.
Then race his car.
And we ain't racing no quarter-mile, here.
We race the Cuban mile.
Done.
I appreciate what you're trying to do, but my car is the slowest car on the island.
Was.
Pull the seats, the doors, the battery...
If it ain't the motor, take it off.
Laughing gas?
Nah, Fed.
This is Cuban NOS.
You guys are crazy.
What are you doing?
Poor man's turbo.
Pull the vacuum line and hold on.
Old trick that Buster used to play, in case of emergencies.
You know that's way too much boost for that engine.
It's gonna be fast.
It's gonna be a bomb.
Only needs to go a mile.
Vamonos!
That car belongs in the trash, bro!
Where are they going?
I don't know.
Let's go!
Ghost him.
MAN;
Si.
Adios, Toretto!
Okay, Buster.
Let's see if this works.
That's impossible.
Lookout!
A clears a deal.
You won my car.
And you earned my respect.
Keep your car.
Your respect is good enough for me.
Yo, cousin...
Sorry about your car.
Yours was too slow for a Toretto, anyway.
Your Impala?
Are you serious?
Look at that smile.
I love it when you smile.
You make me happy.
Mmm, I think this place makes you happy.
It's like it speaks to you.
You remember that guy, the racer and his dad?
The one with the boat engine under the hood?
Yeah!
Yes.
Of course.
I was looking at them, and I...
And I couldn't help but to imagine what you'd be like if you were a dad.
No, no, no!
I'm not pregnant.
Is that what you want?
It's not about what I want or what you want.
It's about why we haven't asked the question.
What?
You need a hand?
Yeah, I think I do.
Sounds like you're not getting any fuel.
Yeah?
Probably the shut-off solenoid.
Let's see if we can get some power to it.
What brings you to Cuba?
The same thing that brings everyone else to Cuba.
Culture, people, the beauty.
What brings you to Cuba?
Work.
Must be casual Friday.
How's that honeymoon going, Dom?
Your fuel relay is missing.
I know.
I love to play games.
I've beaten the best of 'em.
But I'm kind of in a rush, so if you've got something to say to me...
Oh, this is a very different game, that I can assure you.
This...
There's something much greater at work here.
This is fate.
I choose to make my own fate.
Not today.
Is this the road you take to your apartment every morning?
What else is different, Dom?
Was Santiago's closed'?
Did you have to cross two blocks to go get your Cuban coffees'?
What is it, black, no sugar?
Yeah.
I put a lot of work into getting you here today.
Well, now that I'm here, what do you want?
I want you to work for me.
Work for you?
Oh, I could've saved you a lot of time, then.
See, I don't work for anyone.
You can't walk away from this, Dom.
We're gonna have this conversation, one way or the other.
You see, that's the funny thing about fate.
It's cunning.
It can bring you beautiful things, and it can also bring you moments like this.
Oh, you're gonna want to work for me.
You're gonna betray your brothers, abandon your code, and shatter your family.
You see, your team is about to go up against the only thing they can't handle.
What's that?
You.
Oh, and, Dom, I wouldn't mention this to anyone.
They are gonna be hitting us with everything they got.
So we wanna engage with maximum speed.
Neutralize their shooters, and then move on to our objective.
There's two things I want you to keep in mind.
Number one, I chose you for this squad because you are the most fearsome warriors on the planet.
And number two, you go out there, you do your job, and you take 'em down.
Everyone.
And I mean everyone.
Mani's and pedi's at the mall later on today.
Huh?
Monarchs!
What?
I don't wanna play anymore.
All right, let's go, girls.
Let's go, let's go!
Final two minutes.
Quite the cheering section.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it's the moms.
They come out to support the kids.
Except there seem to be more moms than kids.
Way more moms.
Yeah.
It's a big soccer town.
Let's go, girls!
So, your intel was spot-on.
That Damocles 7 EMP weapon that went missing in the Gulf?
Arms dealers from the Liberation Front have it in Berlin.
Shit!
This thing can wipe out an entire electrical grid in a major city.
No lights, no power.
Instant Stone Age.
Chloe, Maya, you can't let her run by you like that.
Let's go, let's go!
Cross!
Agent Hobbs, this is a Class Four WMD.
Do you have any idea what's at stake here?
Yes, I know exactly what is at stake here, okay?
If the Pink Butterflies beat my Red Dragons, that means we lose the championship.
Which means I have 20 little girls who are crying, and that's not a good thing.
Which then means I have to spend a lot of time in ice-cream shops and a lot of time at Tay Tay concerts.
Tay Tay?
Taylor Swift.
Gotta be shittin' me.
Get it together, okay?
Let's go, girls!
We need you to do this.
It's a lot of lives at stake.
All right, but I need to be clear here.
The US government cannot sanction this operation in any way.
You're on your own.
Hey.
If this thing goes sideways, you don't just get burned.
You go to prison.
And there's nothing we can do to get you out.
Let me tell you something.
The only thing that I love more than saving lives is my daughter.
So, if you don't shut up with this government bullshit right now, and start showing some team spirit and respect for the Red Dragons,
I'm gonna have all 20 of them line up and kick you right in the tay-tay.
Go Dragons!
Say it again.
Go Dragons!
Attaboy.
Go Dragons.
Go Dragons.
I'm open.
She's open!
Go, go!
Yes!
That is my daughter right there.
Yes.
Yes, come here.
How did I do?
Awesome.
Nice job, kid.
Daddy's gotta go to work?
Uh, yeah.
Daddy's gotta go to work.
Now, you're gonna need to get a team you can trust.
Oh, I already got one.
Hey, Dom.
Hey, Hobbs.
I got a job in Berlin and I need a favor, brother.
No problem.
I'll grab the team and meet you in Berlin.
Thanks, man.
Hi see you soon.
You were only supposed to create a diversion, Roman.
That was a diversion!
How many of the damn explosives did you use?
I don't know, Tej.
All of it?
Wait, all of it?
Roman, Jesus Christ.
We got more of your fan club ahead.
They're still on us!
These guys are taking this personal.
Roman, we just blew up their facility and stole their EMP.
Other than your doctor's cold finger,
I'd say it's about as personal as it can get.
Phase Two!
Phase Two?
So you just gonna keep that to yourself'?
What happened to Phase One?
What about that part?
Yeah.
Remember the airplane?
Everyone drove their cars out but you?
I told you, my engine seized up.
It's your balls that seized up.
Just follow my lead, okay?
And, Roman, whatever you do, don't think.
Huh?
Tel, drop it.
Bombs away.
Split, now!
Holy...
Great plan, Tej.
But just so you know, you missed some.
Oh, just wait for it.
Oh, shit!
I hate you, Tej!
Got your ass.
You good?
I'll see you when it's done.
All right, great job, team.
Let's break off and meet me at the safe house.
A hell of a job, brother.
When we get back to the base, the beefs on me.
You lost your goddamn mind, Toretto?
Toretto, you put hands on that thing, you're gonna have the whole world gunning for you, including me.
I don't know what you're doing, but you better think about this, Toretto.
It ain't too late to stop this.
It is now.
That sumbitch just crossed us.
What?
Wait a second, what are you talking about?
Dom took the EMP.
Bullshit.
Where are you?
It's too fate for me.
Ger outta here.
Saw that look in his eye, and I've seen that look before.
Dominic Toretto just went rogue.
All right' I got his phone records, y'all.
It's a whole bunch of calls to untraceable numbers.
Burner phones, right?
Nah, scrambler.
Same number, but they got some sort of micro-router to bury the signal path, which means Dom is clearly communicating with somebody that's above our pay grade.
Look, I don't know Dom as well as you, but if we just look at the facts,
Dom's been having highly encrypted conversations with some mysterious person.
He took out Hobbs.
He stole an EMP.
Now he's disappeared.
So, what are you saying?
Maybe we should consider the fact that Hobbs is right.
Dom did go rogue.
Letty.
Before you judge the man, remember, you're breathing right now because he saved your life.
You just gonna let her bump your shoulder like that?
I'm just saying, that was a little aggressive.
What you gonna do, email her?
Check.
Moment, will you, fellas?
Thank you.
Well, this is an exciting new look.
It's a little tight in the crotch, as always.
What boy-band bus did she fall out of?
It's my new junior associate.
He's working with me on this.
All yours.
Mr. Nobody and I have been given the authority to get you out of this.
All you have to do is agree to the terms and you're free.
What's training wheels talking about?
What terms?
Confess to your crimes in Berlin.
Treason, international espionage, massive destruction of civic property.
You do that, we close the case.
And the DSS blacklists you.
And?
Germany loves that.
Officially, you will be a criminal.
Wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You need to work on your delivery, all right?
Unofficially...
You're off the books.
You come work with me.
I'm not a criminal.
Luke, come on.
Labels.
There is no confession.
There are no backroom deals.
I got myself into this, I'm gonna get myself out of it.
You know that.
I do, and that's what I told him.
Well, there you have it.
Good luck in the courts, man.
What about your daughter?
You know, if you're not gonna do it for your country, at least do it for your kid.
Big mistake, kid.
Hold on.
Luke, Luke.
He's still working from the manual.
I mean, he doesn't even really know the rules.
Now, come on, give him a break.
Give me a break.
Luke.
Appreciate it.
It's good to see you, Nobody.
You, too.
Rule number one...
Know your audience.
I gave you your shot.
You shit the bed.
Now I'm gonna show you how to get this done.
You're dead, cop.
Dead!
I'm gonna slice some bacon off your back, pig.
Well, well, well...
Luke Hobbs behind bars.
Would you look at that.
The bent cop got his day.
You know, that color looks good on you.
Yeah, it'll look a whole hell of a lot better with your blood on it.
Yeah, good luck with that, Hercules.
Lawman gone bad, huh?
Such a cliché.
Oh, well, welcome to the club.
I wouldn't get that twisted, son.
We ain't in no club, we got nothing in common.
And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.
What, you bring a shovel, did you?
Because it's 38 feet of steel and concrete.
Or so I've been told.
Better get to digging.
Wanker.
Yeah.
Move.
Say that again.
If I say it again, it'll be to a corpse.
I'm gonna enjoy this.
Welcome back, Dom.
Nice job out there.
You excited about tonight?
You're going on this?
You're with me, Dom.
Showing me your shoe collection?
Yep.
A pair for every occasion.
You have enough guns in hereto outfit a small army, huh?
Oh, this is just the tip of the iceberg.
You know what I like about you, Dom?
You're a genuine outlaw.
I mean, you're a man who lives by his own rules.
Which is surprising, because when I saw you in Cuba,
I heard about a guy who almost killed you with a motorcycle, and you let him keep his car?
Oh, that confused you?
Hmm.
'Course I could've taken his car.
But it's about something bigger.
This way...
I changed him.
That's not your responsibility.
But it's who I am.
Is it?
Let me ask you something, Dom.
What's the best thing in your life?
Family.
No, it's not.
Not if you're being honest
It's the 10 seconds between start and finish, when you're not thinking about anything.
No family, no obligations.
Just you.
Being free.
I gotta tell you, this whole saving-the-world, Robin Hood nonsense you've been doing recently?
It's bullshit.
It's not you.
Be who you are.
Why live only a quarter mile at a time when you can live your whole life that way?
Is that it?
Is that all those bloated-out muscles will give ya?
All show and no go.
Oh, I got plenty of go.
You must've misplaced that when I kicked your arse up and down that office of yours.
Yeah.
Just like you Brits, rewriting history, huh?
All I know is, it wasn't me that was thrown out of a four-story window.
Jumped.
I jumped out of a four-story window, saving my partner's life.
'Cause where I'm from, we don't settle fights by throwing bombs.
Well, that's funny, because where I'm from, we don't need women to run to our rescue.
I mean, do you really believe you can stand in front of me and beat me in a straight-up, old-fashioned fist fight'?
Let me tell you something.
Me and you, one-on-one, no one else around.
I will beat your ass like a Cherokee drum.
Maybe one day we'll find out.
Oh, you better hope that day never comes.
I said no, Mr. Nobody.
I'm not leaving this cell.
I'll get out my way.
The right way!
Hey!
Why's the door open?
Get back in your cell!
Relax.
It's just a malfunction.
- Get back!
- Just a malfunction.
Stop him!
Don't let him get away!
Hobbs!
I've been waiting a long time for this.
Keep waiting, bitch.
Rubber bullets.
Big mistake.
Well, that took longer than I expected.
Two questions.
MR. NOBODY;
Yeah.
My daughter?
With your sister.
Toretto?
It's interesting you ask.
This is my new base.
Welcome to nowhere.
It's a little sterile for you.
Listen, there's something I wanna talk to you about after.
Hey, listen, guys.
Thanks...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What?
Handcuffs?
What is this?
It's called abuse of power.
You told me to round them up.
I didn't tell you to hand...
Cut 'em loose.
Oh, man.
This is embarrassing.
I'm sorry, guys, really, I...
So, this is how you treat old friends?
Friends?
We don't even really know who the hell this guy is.
Doesn't matter who I am, Tej.
I'm, like, nobody, okay?
Nobody.
So, then, who is he?
Him?
He's nothing.
He's, like, less than me.
Clearly, we're getting nowhere with nobody.
I've been in here for four hours, and my ribs are showing.
I don't know about y'all, but I'm out.
I wouldn't recommend that What?
Well, thanks to your botched Berlin job, you all made Interpols Top 10 Most Wanted list.
- Top 10.
- Mmm-hmm.
That's all right.
Well, not you, Roman.
What do you mean?
You just missed the cut.
You're number 11, so...
I'm...
I missed?
Yeah.
That's impossible!
What number did they come in at?
Six, eight, nine, ten.
She's 10?
Mmm-hmm.
That's impossible.
There's no way she's a 10.
Oh, she's definitely a 10.
How about we focus on someone who we're not gonna find on anybody's list.
We're awaiting hard confirmation, but I believe that's the cyber terrorist known as Cipher.
Wait, no.
Cipher's an organization.
Not a person.
Not according to our sources.
What does she want?
No one knows.
Cipher is like a digital act of God.
They...
Well, she can manipulate world systems from the shadows.
Anything that can be hacked is hers to play with.
And here's the kicker.
You'll never find her linked to any of it.
Her digital identity is scrubbed every few seconds, worldwide.
So, basically, she's the bogeyman.
Damn, she's one of the hottest bogeymans I've ever seen.
I mean, if y'all know her, tell her to get at your boy.
What are you, 12?
ROMAN:
That was my shin, mother...
Let's just say, people are scared of the hacker group Anonymous.
But even Anonymous won't mess with her.
What the hell does any of this have to do with us?
Probably nothing, Letty, but I do find it interesting that, apparently, for some reason, she's now working with this guy.
He's already delivered a fully operational EMP into her hands.
Detonate that, they can turn any city in the world into a war zone.
So, then, what is it you're suggesting we do?
Maybe we find Dom, huh?
Well, first, let's catch him, and then figure out why he's turned.
So, y'all want us to track Dom.
Yeah, I know, Roman, it's kind of a big job.
It's impossible.
Which is why I'm bringing in an extra pair of hands.
Ah, my day just got a whole hell of a lot better.
Mr. Nobody, you wanna tell me why you just put me in a room with this tea-and-crumpets eating, criminal sumbitch?
What a big mouth on a small head, coming from Prisoner 6753.
Don't think we've forgotten everything that you've done.
We are not teaming up with this guy.
Let's get one thing clear.
I ain't on your team.
I don't care about you, your crew, or your little family.
I'm here for Cipher.
What are you gonna do, apply for a job?
Head Asshole?
You know, I think that tight T-shirt's cutting off the circulation to your brain.
You should get a bigger size.
Cipher came to me first.
Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.
When I said no, she went after my brother.
Ah, yes, brother Owen.
Who could forget him, huh?
Former hell-raiser and current guest at a nasty little black site prison.
Cipher corrupted him and left him for dead.
So, if I get a shot to take her down, believe me, Flex, I'm taking it.
You're taking my boot right up your ass, is what you're taking.
Guys, guys.
The fastest way to find Cipher is through Toretto.
Now, aside from myself, there's only two men in the world that have ever managed to actually track him down with any success.
And guess what.
They' re both standing in front of me right now.
So, like it or not, you two are gonna work together.
You got that?
I'm gonna take that as a yes.
Am I the only one seeing this?
Oh, this ought to be good.
Use God's Eye.
We put our lives on the line, running around the world trying to figure this thing out.
It can find anybody, right?
Let's use it to find Dom.
Roman, that is a great idea.
Did you hear that?
"Great idea."
No, no, no, don't tune it out.
Huh?
Mr. Nobody, let's fire it up, huh?
Got him.
He's in London.
Yeah.
Wait.
We've got a second match in Hong Kong.
Beijing and Seoul.
And Tokyo.
And just about every other major city on the planet.
And so, God's Eye was where we started.
But Cipher's already created an evasion that masks their location by pinging random spots all over the globe, but it was a good thought, Roman.
So, she's made my program obsolete.
And that, Ramsey, is why you're here.
See, simple solutions aren't gonna cut it here, slick.
Why you look at me when you say that?
Wait a second.
Wait, wait.
Simple solutions might just cut it.
You see, in order for God's Eye to give off all these false pings, means they have to be using a FLEA relay.
Watch these two.
Which means it has a decaying sync randomizer.
Which we can reverse."
And track it back to the originating source and find Dom's true location.
I'm telling you, they got skills.
That was my idea.
That's what I was saying.
Remember in there?
All right, let's try this.
It's working.
Time you wanna check your manual and start organizing a force response.
Let's get a hold of our international assets...
He's still green.
Yeah, like fresh baby shit.
As soon as we have Toretto's location, I want to mobilize.
Let's get a hold of a better asshole.
- No one respects you...
- Cover.
Get away from me.
All right, they're not in China.
Or Russia.
Europe's clear.
But this one's not going away.
This is interesting.
Why?
Because that's here.
Did you all enjoy that?
Next-generation concussion grenade.
It scrambles your senses.
Don't worry, it'll wear off in an hour.
Probably.
Hello, Deckard.
Nice to see you again.
Look at this, body's not even cold, Dom.
Your family's already replacing you.
You chose the losing team.
I guess your brother is smarter than you.
Smart move, embedding God's Eye into the mainframe.
Irritating to make me have to come all the way clown here to get it, but...
Let's go.
Dom!
You're gonna turn your back on family?
Just like that?
Let's go.
You okay?
That wasn't him.
I don't know what she's got on him, but that wasn't Dom.
Brian would know what to do.
No!
We can't bring Brian and Mia into this.
We agreed on that
I know.
Back there, was that for her, for me, or you?
And was it even necessary?
Necessary?
Nothing is necessary.
Everything is a choice.
And I simply made one.
But so did you.
You could've stopped me, but you chose not to.
I wonder what Letty thought about that.
The problem with putting your foot on a tiger's neck is you can never let it up.
I think I need to remind you why you chose to be here.
Elena.
Dom?
I'm sorry.
You shouldn't have come.
Nothing could have kept me away.
Now she has the three of us.
Do you wanna see him?
See Papa?
See Papa.
Papa.
When I realized I was pregnant, you had just found out Letty was alive.
So I decided when Letty and you got back from your honeymoon,
I was going to tell you.
But then she took us before I had the chance.
His name?
I call him Marcos.
But that's his middle name.
I thought his father should give him his first name.
I'm sorry, Dom.
There's nothing to be sorry for.
Whatever happens, just save our son.
Your son.
Good visit?
I know.
I know what you're thinking.
I just let the guards go, so there's only two opponents in the room.
Rhodes has the gun, so you'll take him out first.
I know you.
And then you're thinking, Elena's a cop.
Maybe the two of you can fight your way out of here.
So much to think about.
Let me make it easier for you.
Do with it as you wish.
Have you heard of Choice Theory, Dom?
There is a bunch of axioms, but only two you really need to concern yourself with.
One, the only person's behavior we can control is our own.
And, two, the only thing we can truly give another person is information.
So, let me give you some.
You see these cameras in here?
The moment you make a move, highly-paid men with weapons will make their way into this room with one very specific instruction.
It's not to save me.
It's to kill your son.
Now, that's a lot of bullets, and it only takes one for you to lose everything.
So, I have to ask you, because I know family is so important to you.
Is that really a choice you want to make?
Because I'm ready if you are.
If I pull this trigger, and God knows I want to, if I killed everyone on this plane,
I still couldn't get in there.
'Cause of your two-man fail-safe system.
Since I'm alone,
I got no choice!
I didn't think so.
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch.
Bitch.
Don't, don't.
Sweet dreams.
Please!
Damn it.
She wiped it all.
Took God's Eye.
That was the one thing we could use to find them.
We lost everything.
What do you got, Princess?
Finding Toretto.
But I got a couple of minutes to spare, if you want me to send you to the hospital.
Again.
Yo, Rules.
First off, that's not my name.
Little Nobody.
Don't call me that.
Oh, that's definitely sticking.
Great.
Do me a favor and tell Your Majesty over there that we're gonna find Toretto.
We find Toretto together as a team.
And when this is all over with,
I'm happy to slap that whisker biscuit right off his face.
Wait a minute, guys, I think Deckard's actually onto something.
How do you think Dom and Cipher got into the country without us knowing?
Ghost flights.
I thought untraceable aircraft was all Internet conspiracy stuff.
It's not.
Satellites and radar grids all across the globe shift like an ocean.
They've got channels that open and close.
And theoretically' if you know the right people who know the right patterns...
You can fly right through the blind spots completely undetected.
So you know where Dom is headed?
Yeah.
New York.
You see there, Luke?
You guys are gonna get along just great.
Which proves rule number two, you never lose everything.
Fire up the chopper.
Well, guys' have a ball in the Big Apple.
And why are we traveling like this again?
Because Dom took God's Eye, so we need to stay of!
the grid.
But like this?
Look here, man.
Before I throw up in my mouth, let me ask you, what are we doing here?
That's a good question, Roman.
Let me show you.
Welcome to our new base of operations.
No, seriously.
What is this place?
This is heaven.
It's the agency garage.
They call it the Toy Shop.
This is where we house every vehicle seized from drug dealers on the East Coast.
Now, Mr. Nobody said that if we're gonna have a chance at catching Dom,
we're gonna have to be damn fast.
Figured this would help.
We got a tank.
750 horsepower, 6.6 liter, V8 Duramax engine with an M153 GROWS remotely operated weapon station on top.
You didn't get this from drug dealers.
No.
No, that, uh, the United States Army lent me.
See, the Army's developing machines like this that soldiers can drive from a mile away, so they can stay safe and alive.
But, luckily, there's a backup driver's seat for those of us that like to get more "hands on."
I'm sitting here wondering this whole time, will this thing fit in valet at Cheesecake Factory?
No one is getting "hands on."
She doesn't go on city streets.
Wow.
I'm in love.
Again, no, no.
That's a million-dollar show car.
The point is to not draw attention.
It's reverse psychology.
Dom would never see it coming.
It's neon orange.
The International Space Station would see it coming.
Go choose anything less conspicuous.
No, no, no.
Calipers are my...
This is ridiculous.
Not happening.
Hey, my man, you can put that down rig ht there.
This is a gift, a real gift.
I know what you're doing.
I like your beard.
You're Blanta.
Black Santa?
No, I'm serious.
Put it down right there.
What are you doing?
Engine's misfiring.
I gotta check it out.
No, that's not part of the plan, Dom.
Clearly.
But unless you want the engine to seize on the job...
You have five minutes.
Five minutes.
I want another visual.
I got an ATM.
I don't like this.
I want to see Toretto.
There are no more cameras.
Then find something!
Punch in on something reflective.
A car mirror, anything.
Do you know who I am?
It's why I'm here.
Do you know what I'm capable of?
It's why I'm here.
I'll give you until I finish me cuppa.
And I'm fucking thirsty.
I've got limited time, so I won't take up too much of yours.
Oh, no.
No, you've already taken everything I have of value, Mr. Toretto.
What more could you possibly want?
To give you something back.
Talk to me.
Somethings not right here.
First time I saw my son was behind a bulletproof glass.
When he reached for me, I couldn't hold him.
It's the worst pain I ever felt.
I know you know exactly how that feels.
Maybe we could change that
Now, why do I think you're about to suggest something really dodgy, Mr. Toretto?
It's why I'm here.
Jesus, punch in on something.
I'm not liking this.
Somethings not right.
- Rhodes, you close?
- Yeah.
Go.
The delivery truck's moving.
I know.
"Captain Deckard Shaw
"distinguished himself by acts of gallantry
"at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.
"His bold actions saved the lives of hostages and his teammates.
Victoria Cross."
Highest honor the British government has ever given to a traitor.
Something about this whole thing that just doesn't add up to me.
Well, that would be the same kind of funny math that says a DSS agent who has a Silver Star for valor stole an EMP.
Sound familiar, huh?
You want to give me a hand?
On three?
Yeah.
One, two, three.
You know what, Twinkle Toes?
In another life, I bet me and you could've done some serious damage.
Yeah, we could've.
Yeah.
Shame I'm gonna have to bounce your head off the fender when this is all over.
Ah, well, with all due respect, Captain, when this whole thing is over, we're gonna find a location, and I'm gonna knock your teeth so far down your throat, you're gonna stick a toothbrush right up your ass to brush them.
Give me God's Eye.
God's Eye, active.
Good.
Let's find us a Russian.
I spy with my little eye, a Minister of Defense.
Upload those coordinates to Dom's nav.
Copy that.
He's in the third car.
It's a Guard Class limousine.
Where's my team?
Where's his team?
There's no sign of them yet.
They're off the grid.
They' re probably just bunkered down somewhere.
We're closing in on 'em.
You guys ready?
One thing I can guarantee, Dom, no one's ready for this.
I want every chip with a zero-day exploit in a two-mile radius around that motorcade now.
There's over a thousand of them.
Hack 'em all.
It's zombie time.
I'd buckle up if I were you.
Hmm?
What are you doing?
Ah!
Safety sensors overridden.
Thank you.
Whoa.
Hey!
Target the motorcade.
And here they come.
Ouch.
Police escort down.
Take out the lead and follow cars.
Two more down.
They're still under warranty.
We got an army of cars driving themselves!
Send backup, send SWAT!
I don't care if you send the goddamn Boy Scouts, just send 'em some help!
Now, that's Dom.
The motorcade just turned on Seventh.
Perfect.
Make it rain.
Ah!
Target immobilized.
You're up, Dom.
Give me the case.
Good work, Dom.
Meet you at the pickup.
I think I know where my team's at.
Where?
Right in front of me.
This is on you.
Get out of there, Dom.
Guys, I know why Dom's here.
Police scanners are saying he stole a nuclear football.
It's over, Toretto.
Get your ass outta the car now.
So, that's how you wanna play this?
Let's play-
Don't do this, Dom.
He's going for it!
What are you doing?
It's a trap!
Damn it!
Now I know what it feels like to be every cop ever chasing us!
I'm gonna get a little closer.
I'm gonna PIT him.
Oh, so, you just gonna PIT Dom?
Little Nobody has clearly lost his little mind.
I'm on him.
Easy.
Work together.
Wait, wait, wait!
Oh, sh...
I'll take the shortcut!
Look out!
Watch those people!
Big Sexy coming' through!
Not this time, Dom.
Watch the drag or the line will snap!
Stretch him out!
Hold him!
He's gotta have about 2,000 horsepower in that thing.
Try 3,000!
Try five.
Get out of there.
I'm working on it.
Stop working on it and do it.
No, no, no, this my Bentley!
No!
No!
Get that case and run.
Move.
They thought this was gonna be a street fight.
What are you waiting for, Toretto?
No!
Letty, stop!
What are you gonna do?
I don't know why you're doing this, but I know one thing.
You love me.
And you are not gonna shoot me.
You should've given him the case, 'cause I won't chase you.
Okay.
I will just take it from a dead girl.
You willing to die for it?
Let's go, then.
Anything?
They're gone.
And DOD confirmed it was a nuclear football.
He's got an EMP and nuclear launch codes.
I don't know what it is, but they're building towards something.
Deckard?
He didn't make it.
I'm disappointed in you, Dom.
When push came to shove, you were gonna let Letty just walk away with the codes.
You got the codes!
Rhodes got the codes.
You made the choice to let her go.
And now I have to make one of my own.
They are adorable little things, aren't they?
God, I hope I don't hurt him.
Look, psychotic, I did exactly what you asked me to do.
Don't do this.
This is your doing.
My doing?
Da-dada.
Dada.
Da-da.
Please don't hurt him, I'm begging you.
I don't want you to beg.
I want you to learn.
Learn what?
I understand why you did what you did.
I really do.
Da-da.
But it was the wrong choice.
This is the consequence of that.
No!
No!
No!
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait.
Save your son!
No!
Can you pull up the footage from the guy in the alley?
Traffic cams.
I got you.
I knew it.
I recognize that guy.
That's Connor Rhodes.
I met him when I was working with Shaw's brother.
He wanted us to get the Nightshade device for him.
Connor Rhodes.
He's also linked to somebody I'd quite like to forget.
It's Mose Jakande.
Warlord who tried to get God's Eye.
Which means that's twice that Dom has messed up Cipher's business.
Everything you're feeling right now, this rage, a sense of loss, it's not real.
Ifs a survival instinct wired deep into our brains to ensure continuation of the species.
When early man would visit a watering hole, if they didn't watch their child, and it got snatched by a crocodile,
our brains would create a painful but instructional memory, so it would never happen again.
This idea of "family" that is so core with you, that rules your world,
it's a biological lie.
You don't have to accept it.
I don't.
Did you really think you could destroy two of my teams without any repercussions?
I wouldn't have even looked your way if you hadn't done that.
You didn't even know you had a kid.
You can thank me for that and start doing the job I'm asking you to do.
Help you start a war.
Is that what you think I want?
That's so limited.
I didn't take that football to start a war any more than I took your son to start a family.
Taking your son got me the codes.
The codes will get me the nukes and the nukes will get me what I want today, tomorrow, and every day after that.
And what's that?
Accountability.
The second I fire off one of those nukes,
I put the superpowers of this world on notice that, when they cross the line,
I'm gonna be there to hold them responsible.
Because the truth is, Dom, to the world out there,
I am the crocodile at the watering hole.
We've got one last job to do.
Cipher.
If I were you, I'd kiss my son.
Because whether you value it or not, all of this, your plane, your security, and you, are still on this earth because of him.
The problem we've had with tracking Cipher is there's nothing to trace.
But now, we have Rhodes' information.
And we're getting snapshots of his data before it's scrubbed off the net.
That looks like somebody's bank account, so why don't we just go ahead...
It's a longitude.
Given the fact that Dom hit a Russian motorcade, it's safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead and bring up the map.
Good.
Let's start here and run the possibilities.
Yalta, Poltava... it's like they just threw letters together.
Kronyurt.
It's "Vladovin."
What are you doing here?
What?
Told you I was gonna check in on you from time to time to see how you were doin'.
By the way, not so hot.
But there's nothing in Vladovin.
It's just ice.
That's funny.
Could've sworn there was a secret Russian naval base where they retrofitted Cold War submarines.
Well, technically, it's not Russian anymore.
The base was taken over by a terror group of military separatists about a month ago, and the Russians haven't taken it back yet, so there is a little window of opportunity here.
Russian submarines.
Nuclear football.
It sounds like everything we do, our legs gonna be blown off.
It sounds like you still number 11 on the list.
It sounds like you've changed since your little punk-ass facial hairs done came in.
Guys.
Guys.
Hey, we gotta call this in.
All the way up the chain.
That's good thinking, champ, except unfortunately, the Russian Minister of Defense got himself involved in a little incident on US territory, and the two governments aren't talking to each other for a while.
By the time they do, it'll be too late.
So, any other suggestions?
Yeah.
I got one.
How about we just stop them ourselves?
You're talking about a Russian military base.
Separatist.
Whatever.
It's suicide.
It's stopping World War Ill.
What's it gonna be, rook?
You gonna close your eyes on this one, too?
Pray that the apocalypse doesn't come knocking on your mama's front door?
Or, are you gonna saddle up, be a man, and save the entire goddamn world?
You know, I think I figured it out.
What's that?
Rule number three.
Which is?
There are no rules.
What'd I tell you, Luke?
I knew he'd get it in three.
Aerial transport leaves in an hour.
Take whatever vehicle you want.
All bets are off.
All bets are off?
Bets are off?
Do svidanya!
Letty, I don't like telling you this one bit.
But the game's changed.
Before, we were just trying to catch Dom, but now, after all this,
I want you to know, if I have to,
I'm gonna put him down.
Then you might have to take us both down.
I'm freezing, man.
This ain't for me.
I come from a different kind of lifestyle, brah.
Ladies know me.
They know where I'm at with it.
I tried to take a piss, I didn't even recognize myself.
Man, that's entirely too much information.
I'm just sayin'.
Well, one thing's for sure.
Dom's gotta be either working with them or making a trade, because no one would be this insane to hit this place without a damn army.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Speak of the devil.
All right, Dom, you're one step closer to that family reunion.
400 meters to base.
Prep the EMP.
Let's take these defenses down.
Gates are open.
Let's get this party started.
EMP is recharging.
How long?
Sixty seconds.
All right, Dom, you have one pulse left in that EMP.
That sub is heavily insulated.
You're gonna need to be right underneath it for this thing to work.
Come on.
Yes!
Two birds with one stone.
We've got control of the sub.
Dom, we are good.
Head over to the rendezvous.
Okay, Matty, let's take this baby for a spin.
Damn!
I think Cipher just rebooted that sub to slave its command system.
What the hell is he talking about?
In layman's terms, she just carjacked a submarine.
We can't let it get away.
There's the control room.
If you can get me into that wheelhouse,
I can tap the network and counter-hack Cipher.
Keep it from lowering into the water.
No, what we need to do is get me on that sub.
I find the weapons room and I can pull the launch chip before she can fire any of those nukes.
That is too crazy.
What you're saying is too dangerous.
We'll do both.
Knock, knock.
Five vehicles just breached the base.
They just don't give up, do they?
All right, let's haul ass, team.
Double time, double time!
Letty, let's roll!
Go!
Go, go, go!
Change of plans, Dom.
I'm sending you new coordinates.
Head there immediately.
I'm done.
I want my son.
I'll tell you when you're done.
Your team is in play.
Now, meet Rhodes and follow my instruction.
I've got you covered!
Go!
Move, move!
Get outta here!
Go, go, go!
Okay.
How do you like this?
Remote link has been severed.
I'll take care of this.
Hi, Ramsey.
She's regained control.
Damn it.
She's good.
They're entering the weapons room.
Oh, that's cute.
Pull!
Pull!
Roman, Roman!
We gotta find the chip, go!
Oh, she's slick.
Gonna have to do better than that, though.
Okay, now you're starting to piss me off.
Ramsey, how much time we talkin' here?
You're smart, but not smart enough.
She's locked me out.
Tej, I can't stop her.
You're gonna have to pull that chip.
I can't!
This thing's gone into attack mode!
The door's not gonna open until you pull the chip!
Tej, we got no idea what the hell we're looking for.
I got it!
What in the hell are you guys doin'?
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me, okay?
It'll be labeled "Guidance Go."
Guidance Go, Guidance Go...
Okay, I got somethin'.
What?
It says...
Do you understand that?
Wow.
Nasty.
Hmm.
Quite a show.
We're arming the nuke.
Nuke's going hot!
She's tryin' to fire this thing!
Roger that.
We're moving out.
Disable the nukes!
Roman, what are you seeing?
Come on, talk to me.
I don't see shit.
I'm holding on!
And we have a countdown.
What the hell is goin' on, man?
We're about to launch a nuclear missile, is what the hell is goin' on!
Pull me damn chip!
Countdown, countdown!
Look for a countdown!
What countdown?
The missiles need to activate to launch.
The countdown timer won't be in Russian.
The countdown...
Let's show the world what we've got.
No, no, no!
Don't press that!
I got it.
Somethings wrong.
It won't launch.
Get that sub outta there.
Now!
Move your ass, Roman!
You all right?
There's nothing all right about any of this!
Let's go!
What about the missiles?
We got the chip.
No nukes for her.
Hell' yeah.
Let's roll.
Guys, we got company.
A lot of company!
All right, team, here's the plan.
There's a sea lock at the opening of the bay.
We get there firs!
And close it, we can stop the submarine from escaping into open water and disappearing forever.
I've got the location.
It's 10 miles southwest.
Ten miles?
We're not gonna make it ten seconds!
Ah!
No, no, no!
This is not good!
What's the matter, Roman?
Forgot your snow tires?
Whoa!
You lovin' that Lambo now?
Whoa!
Ah!
All right, everyone.
We'll deal with that launch chip later.
Right now, I want that sub in deep water where no one can find it.
Find me the fastest route out of that bay.
Copy that.
Why are they shootin' at me?
Maybe 'cause you're in an orange Lamborghini, I don't know.
Shut up, Te]!
Dom...
Do you really wanna put that' car in gear?
Do it.
Huh?
I didn't think so.
They're heading for the sea lock.
They're trying to trap the sub in the bay.
I should have taken care of this a long time ago.
Rhodes, take his team out.
I'm on it.
Roman, get in front of me!
Okay, y'all wanna play rough?
Now it's my turn.
Yeah, baby!
Guys, we got snowmobiles on the right.
They're gonna flank us!
No, they ain't!
Oh, shit!
Tej!
Roman, hold tight, I'm on the way!
I don't wanna go swimmin'!
No!
Really, Tej?
Oh, no, no, no!
Oh, shit!
Roman, grab your door!
Tej!
Grab the door, Roman!
It's so cold!
Shit!
Oh, shit!
Whoa!
Whoo!
Yeah!
What is going on?
Roman, hang on!
Tej!
Get me off of this thing!
Tej!
Come on!
Argh!
All right.
I've had enough of this shit!
Number 11, my ass!
Yo, shrinkage!
We got a sub to catch.
Get in!
What?
Depressurization alert in the cargo hold.
Drop it to 10,000 feet.
I know how much these people mean to you.
So I will let you pick the first target.
I don't pick a target from a mile away.
I stand face to face and look 'em dead in the eye.
Okay.
The wife it is.
Nice plane.
I'm gonna enjoy having this.
Hey, don't go gettin' any ideas.
You and planes don't have a good history.
No shit.
Okay, let's go, Scarface.
These assholes ain't gonna kill themselves.
Pull up surveillance right now.
Surprise.
You're supposed to be dead.
We have a security breach in the cargo hold.
Take care of it now.
Jesus, Mum.
You're supposed to avoid the nerves.
Oh, shut up.
Don't be such a baby.
Get to the pilot.
He's got the second key.
Wait for my signal.
Give Cipher my regards.
Did Toretto hold up his end of the deal?
He gave us this little thing here.
No, no, no.
Don't touch.
You can track Cipher with this, but you can't do this on your own.
There's gotta be two of ya.
Fine.
I've got contacts.
No, you're gonna take your brother.
Oh, dear...
Yes.
Toretto knows where he is.
He's got this thing.
It can see everything.
It's like...
It's called the Devil's Bum Hole or something.
It's called the God's Eye.
Yeah, well, whatever.
There's no way I'm using Owen, all right?
He's a lost cause.
He's your brother, Decks.
He's my son.
He's our family.
And our family don't die in bloody cages.
How can you talk like that about Owen?
I can't believe you.
You've gone and upset me.
You've really upset your mother.
Call yourself a brother?
You're...
Look, come here...
Mum.
Okay, okay.
Every time.
Owen.
In position.
Go.
I'm in.
I've got the package, Toretto.
All 12 pounds of him.
Ah.
Dada.
Dada.
You made me miss my shot.
What you think you're doing?
Looking at you dead in the eye.
That was for Elena.
Rhodes.
He's no longer with us.
Rhodes picked the wrong target.
Congratulations, Dom.
You just killed your son.
You're wrong.
I just saved him.
And you just look your foot off the tiger's neck.
All right, governor, it's gonna get noisy.
This is for your ears.
Good?
Let's go.
No!
Stop him!
Do not let him get off this plane!
We got another problem.
That truck's got enough missiles to take us all out.
Then don't give 'em a target.
Everybody, get in front of us, line up, and we'll take the hit.
What?
I need to switch cars right now!
Roman, here comes the bad part.
What?
Hang in there, guys.
We're almost to the lock.
Ifs easy for you to say when your ass ain't on fire.
All right, little man, this might be a little scary, but it's gonna be a lot of fun.
How's the music, good?
Ah.
They're locking on.
Sorry, guys, I got no tricks left.
What do we do now?
We start prayin'!
Hell, yeah!
There's Dom!
What, is this guy on our side now?
Who the hell cares?
He just saved our ass!
Good to be riding with you again, man.
Toretto just cleared the way for them.
Someone, give me something!
Torpedoes are ready.
Then launch them!
Shit.
Take the wheel!
I ain't taking' shit!
Take the wheel!
Where you goin'?
This is crazy!
Speed up!
Left and back!
What?
Turn the goddamn wheel to the left really quickly!
Boom, baby!
Goin' for a ride.
Back in a sec.
Where's that smile?
Ah.
There it is.
You were gonna shoot a baby?
You sick bastard.
You're not gonna wanna see this.
Is that you or him?
Him.
Good.
The torpedoes missed.
They're gonna reach the lock before the sub does.
The hell they are.
Get ready for this.
Oh, shit!
We're gonna need a bigger truck.
It's right under us!
Get out the way!
Get us out of here!
Why are you always yelling?
This bitch is crazy!
Lookout!
That's not good.
That's not good.
Please tell me there's nothing to worry about!
We got this.
That's my girl.
The sub's too close.
We ain't making it to the gate in time.
We're just going to let it get away?
Not if I know Dom.
You lose, Dom.
I destroyed two of your teams.
I killed your red-headed boyfriend.
And I put two killers on your untraceable plane.
You lost the minute you interrupted my honeymoon.
Now guess who I'm coming for.
Put a heatseeker on him now.
Now!
Fire!
That's a goddamn heatseeker coming at us!
Peel off!
Head to the shore!
All right.
Come and get it.
No, no, no.
Dive!
Dive!
This...
This is for my son.
Dom!
You're out of bullets, Deckard.
Not like I'm gonna need a gun to take care of you.
How did you find me?
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch.
Resourceful.
You have a lot to answer for, Cipher.
What you've put my family through.
My mother.
I'm gonna make sure that never happens again.
To anyone.
There is only one flaw in your plan.
What's that?
Only one of us has a parachute.
Told you this would be fun.
Time to land, boys.
You know I never left you, Letty.
I know.
And you know I never will.
I know.
I have so much to tell you.
Yeah, you do.
And you can start with that bitch.
Now, that's Dominic Toretto.
Hey, Dom!
I'm just throwin' it out there, we need to get up outta here 'cause there's all kinda nuclearism happening under this ice.
Relax.
Without the trigger chips, those nukes are harmless.
Okay.
So we good, then.
Let me go on and get my young selfie levels up.
You realize this is classified, right'?
Not today.
Unbelievable.
All right, can we get up outta here, now?
I'm freezin'!
It's okay.
Don't worry.
He's gonna be here soon.
I get it.
Y'all got a lot in common.
Computer hacks, God's Eye, geeks, nerd...
You know.
But we got a lot in common, too, right?
Like what?
We walk in the room and we're oozing' sex appeal.
Me and you, hip to hip, is a problem.
I'm askin' a real question right now.
Is it gonna be Revenge of the Nerds or The Dark Knight?
Huh'?
To be honest, I like both of you.
But just before we get into all of that, let me ask you one question.
You can ask me anything.
Anything.
What's my last name?
When you guys figure it out, then, I guess you can let me know.
It's gonna be Parker.
That's all that really matters.
- Jones.
- Mrs. Parker.
Right?
Hey, Mrs. Parker...
Hey.
Letty.
I wanted to thank you.
No need.
Well...
Ciphers still on the loose.
There's been some reports she's in Athens, but she won't be nuking any cities anytime soon.
Thanks to you guys.
So, I got you a party favor.
This can't be good.
Your record's been cleared.
Full reinstatement.
You've got your job back.
That is, if you want it.
If I want?
Mmm-hmm.
You know, after 16 years, I figure it's time for a little break.
Wow.
Daddy's swim' home.
Nobody.
Keep in touch.
Ah.
Hang on a second.
This could be interesting.
What made you think I'd do it?
Brotherhood.
I saw that look you gave Cipher, knew you wanted revenge.
Glad I did it.
I can't believe you went to see my mother.
All this fuss over you.
Yes.
Elena, I promised to keep our son safe.
And now, he always will be.
I wanna introduce you to the most important person in my universe.
One who never gave up on me.
He's beautiful.
You've heard me say that you never turn your back on family,
and I wanna thank you all for never turning your back on me.
You wanna meet them?
All right.
Everyone, meet Brian.
To Brian!
Welcome to the family, Brian.
Okay, I guess it's my turn to say grace.
We thank you for giving us family.
We sit here in praise.
Thank you for giving us the strength...
HAVANA, CUBA
We swap in parts from Ford Plymouths and Cadillac.
My grandfather bought it in 1957.
When he died it passed to my father.
Then my brother and now to me.
Look at this, this is an engine from a boat.
- No way.
- Yeah!
Whatever it takes to keep it running!
This is a cuban spirit.
Your spirit, keep it up.
Never ever lose that.
Dom..
It's your cousin..
He's in trouble, come quickly!
Come on, come on.
Please don't do this, Understand my problem.
You know I can't make living without my car.
Isn't my problem bro.
Dominic Toretto..
I heard about you.
Welcome to my island.
Why he hooking up my cousin's car?
In the morning, I gave it to him..
He can't pay..
I take the car.
I just need a few more days.
Few more days isn't part of the deal.
Come on..
You make a deal you gotta live up to it.
You make a deal You gonna live up to it.
Gonna live up to it?
So you are one of those types..
You take everyone's ride and then ship it back to the states.
You should show your people some respect.
You watch your mouth.
Now you got a problem.
I'm gonna keep it about the cars.
I am really scared.
You want a car?
Get it the right way.
- How?
- Race war.
I already own it, bro.
Not that car.
Mine.
Dom, his car is the fastest car in the Island.
Do you know what he has under the hood?
Do you know, it doesn't matter what's under a hood?
The only thing that matters is who's behind the wheel.
- You think so?
- I know so.
Then race his car.
We ain't racing a quarter mile here.
We race the cuban mile.
Done!
I appreciate you what you're trying to do.
My car is the slowest car on the Island.
Was...!
Pull the seats the doors the battery..
It ain't the motor, take it off.
- Laughing gas?
- Nah, Fed.
This is cuban NOS.
You guys are crazy.
- What are you doing?
- Warm as turbo.
Pull that back in line..
Hold on!
Old trick used to play.
In case of emergencies.
You know that's way too much booze for that engine.
- It's going to be fast.
- It's gonna be a bomb.
Only needs to go a mile.
Are you ready for this, family?
This is Havana!
Be fast!
Be safe!
But don't be last.
Racers ready...?
Go...!
Stop.
That car belongs in the trash bro.
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.
Let's go.
- Go steer.
- Si.
Adios, Toretto.
Ok, buster...
Let's see if this works.
That's impossible..
Look out.
A deal's a deal.
You own my car.
And you earn my respect.
Keep your car.
Your respect is good enough for me.
Yo Cousin.
Sorry 'bout your car,
Your's was too slow for a Torreto anyway.
Your Impala.
Are you serious?
Look at that smile
I love it when you smile.
Make me happy.
I think this place makes you happy.
It's like it speaks to you.
You remember that guy?
The Racer and his dad.
- The one with the boat engine.
- Yeah!
- Yeah.
- Of course.
I was looking at them, and I..
And I couldn't help but too imagine what you'd be like, if you were dad.
No, no, no...
I'm not pregnant.
Is that what you want?
It's not about what I want or what you want..
It's about why we haven't asked the question.
Can I help you with that?
- What?
- You need a hand?
Yeah, I think I do.
Sounds like you're not getting any fuel.
Yeah.
See if we can get some power into it.
What brings you to Cuba?
The same thing that brings everyone else to Cuba.
Culture.
People.
Beauty.
What brings you to Cuba?
- Work!
- Must be casual Friday.
How is that honeymoon going Dom?
Your fuel relay is missing.
I know.
I'd love to play games.
Beaten the bests alone.
I'm kinda in a rush, so if you got something to say...
Oh this is a very different game that I can assure you.
This...?
There is something much greater at work here.
This is fate.
- I choose to make my own fate.
- Not today.
This is the road you take to your apartment every morning.
What else is different, Dom?
The Santiago's closed?
Did you have to cross two blocks to go get your cuban coffee?
So, what is it?
Black, no sugar?
Yeah..
I've put a lot of work into getting you here in today.
Now that I'm here, what do you want?
I want you to work for me.
Work for you?
Well, I could have saved you a lot of time then.
See, I don't work for anyone.
You can't walk away from this Dom.
We're gonna have this conversation one way or the other.
See that's the funny thing about fate.
It's cunning.
It can bring you beautiful things, and it can also bring you moments like this.
I will hear that you want to work for me.
You're gonna betray your brothers, abandon your code, shatter your family.
See, your team..
Is about to go up against the only thing they can't handle.
What's that?
You.
Oh, and Dom, I wouldn't mention this to anyone.
They are gonna be hitting us with everything they've got.
So, we wanna engage with maximum speed.
Neutralize the shooters and then move on to our objective.
There are two things I want you to keep in mind,
Number one,
I choose you for this squad because you are the most fearsome warriors on the planet.
And number two,
You go out there, you do your job.
And you take 'em down.
Everyone...
And I mean everyone..
Manice and pedice at the mall.
Later on today.
I don't wanna play anymore.
Alright, let's go, girls.
Let's go, let's go.
- Final 2 minutes.
- Quite the cheering section.
Oh yeah.
That's moms they come out to sport the kids.
Except there seems to be more moms than kids,
Way more like moms and..
Yeah, it's a big soccer job.
Let's go girls.
So your intel was spot on...
A democly 7 EMP weapon that went missing in the gulf.
Arms dealer from the Liberation front have it in Berlin.
- Shit.
- This thing can wipe out..
An entire electrical grid in a major city.
No lights, no power, instant stone age.
Chloe, Maya...
You can't let her run by you like that.
- Let's go, let's go.
- Hey, Hobbs.
This is a class 4 WMD.
Do you have any idea what's at stake here...?
Yes...!
I know exactly what is at stake here, okay?
If Pink Butterflies beat my Red Dragon that means we lose the championship.
Which means I have 20 little girls who are crying..
And that's not a good thing.
Which then means I have to spend a lot of time in ice cream shops and lot of time in Tay-Tay concerts.
- Tay-Tay?
- Yep?
Taylor Swift.
You gotta be shitting me Get it together.
Let's go girls.
We need you to do this,
Lot of lives are at stake.
I need to be clear here.
US Government can not sanction this operation in anyway.
You're on your own.
This thing goes sideways you don't just get burned, you go to prison.
And there's nothing we can do to get you out.
Let me tell you something.
The only thing that I love more than saving lives..
Is my daughter.
So you don't shut up with this government bullshit right now and start showing some team spirit and respect for the Red Dragons.
I'm gonna have all 20 of them lined up kick you right in the Tay-Tay.
Go, Dragons!
Say it again.
- Go, Dragons!
- Good boy.
Go Dragons..
Go Dragons..
Go, he's open...
Go, Yup!
Yes!
That is my daughter right there!
Yes!
Ah, yes, come here.
- Awesome.
- Nice job.
Daddy's gotta go to work?
Oh yeah, daddy's gotta go to work.
Now, you gonna need to get a team that you can trust.
Oh, I already got one.
- Hey, Dom.
- Hey, Hobbs.
We got a job in Berlin, and I need a favor, brother.
No problem.
I grab the team and meet you in Berlin.
Thanks man.
I'll see you soon.
You were only to supposed to create a diversion, Roman.
That was a diversion.
How many of the damn explosives did you use?
I do not know, Tez.
All of it?
- Wait, all of it?
- Roman, Jesus!
- Christ!
- You have more of your fan club ahead.
They're still on us.
These guys are taking this personal.
Roman, we just blown up their facility and stole their EMP.
Other than your doctor's cold fingers,
I'd say it's about as personal as it can get.
- Phase 2.
- Phase 2?
So you just gonna keep that to yourself?
What happen to Phase 1?
What about that part?
Yeah, remember the airplane?
Everyone drove their cars out but you.
I told you my engine seized up.
It's your balls that seized up?
Just follow my lead, okay?
And Roman, whatever you do.
Don't think.
Tez, drop it.
Bomb's away.
Split now!
Holy shit!
Look out...!
- Great plan Tez.
- Just so you know.
You miss some.
I'll just wait for it.
Oh...
Shit!
I hate you, Tez!
Got your ass.
You good?
I'll see you when it's done.
Alright.
Great job, team.
Let's break up and meet me at the safe house.
Hell of a job, brother.
When we can get back to the base.
Beers on me.
You lost your god damn mind, Toretto!
Toretto you put hands on that thing, you're gonna have the whole world coming for you including me.
I don't know what you're doing but you better think about this, Toretto.
It ain't too late to stop this.
It is now.
That some bitch just crossed us..
What?
Wait a second, what are you talking about?
- Dom took the EMP.
- Bullshit.
Where are you?
It's too late for me.
Get out of here.
Saw that look in his eyes.
I've seen that look before.
Dominic Toretto just went rogue.
Alright, I got his phone records, y'all.
It's a whole bunch of calls to untraceable numbers.
Burner phone, right?
Nah.
Scrambled.
Same number but they got some sort of micro-router..
To bury the signal path which means Dom is clearly..
Communicating with somebody that is above our pay grade.
Look, I do not know Dom as well as you, but if we just look at the facts.
Dom's been having highly encrypted conversation with some mysterious person.
He took out Hobbs.
He stole the EMP, now he's disappeared.
So what're you saying?
Maybe we should consider the fact that..
Hobb's right.
Dom did go rogue.
- Letty.
- Before you judge the man,
Remember you're breathing now because he saved your life.
You just gonna let her bump your shoulder like that
I'm just saying it out..
That was a little aggressive.
What're you gonna do.
Email her?
Chick..
No no, wait, fellas.
Thank you.
Well, this is an exciting new look.
That's a little tight on the crotch as always.
What boyband bus did she fallen off?
My new junior associate.
He's working with me on this.
All yours.
Mr Nobody and I have been given the authority to get you out of this.
All you have to do is agree to the terms and you're free.
Restraining wills, talking about, what terms?
Confess to your crimes in Berlin.
Treason, international espionage.
Massive destruction of civic property.
You do that, we close the case.
And?
And the DSS blacklist.
Sure Germany loves that.
Officially you'll be a criminal.
Woah, woah, woah.
You need to work on your delivery alright.
Unofficially.
You're off the books.
Come work with me.
- I'm not a criminal.
- Luke Come on.
Labels.
There is no confession.
There are no back room deals.
Got myself into this, I'm gonna get myself out of it.
You know that.
I do and that's what I told them.
Well, there you have it.
Good luck in the course, man!
What about your daughter?
You know, if you're not gonna do it your country, at least do it for your kid.
Big mistake kid.
Hold on.
Look, look.
He's still working from the manual.
I mean, he doesn't even really know the rules.
Oh come on.
Give him a break.
Get a break.
Luke?
I appreciate that.
- It's good to see you, Nobody.
- You too.
Rule No.1, know your audience.
I gave you your shot, you shit the bed.
Now I'm gonna show you how to get this done.
- You're dead cop!
- Dead!
Well, well, well...
Luke Hobbs behind bars.
Would you look at that?
The band cop got it's day.
You know, that color looks good on you.
Yeah.
Look a whole hell of a lot better with your blood on it.
Yeah.
Good luck with that, Hercules.
Gone bad.
Huh?
Such a cliche.
Ah well.
Welcome to the club.
I wouldn't get that twisted son.
We ain't in no club.
We got nothing in common.
And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.
You bring the shovel did you?
Cause it's 38 feet of steel and concrete.
What's up big dog?
Better get to dig in.
You wanker.
Move..
Say that again.
If I say it again, It will be to acorpse.
I'm going to enjoy this.
Welcome back, Dom.
Nice job out there.
Excited about tonight?
You're going on this?
You're with me Dom.
- Showing me your shoe collection?
- Yup.
A pair for every occasion.
There's enough guns here to outfit a small army.
Huh?
Oh this is just the tip of the iceberg.
You know what I like about you, Dom.
You're a genuine outlaw.
I mean, you're a man who lives by his own rules.
Which was surprising because when I saw you in Cuba, I heard about a guy who almost killed you with a motorcycle and you..
let him keep his car?
- Oh, that confused you?
- Hmm.
Of course I could've taken his car.
But it's about something bigger.
This way...
I changed them.
That's not your responsibility.
- That's who I am.
- Is it?
Let me ask you something Dom, what's the best thing in your life?
- Family.
- No, it's not.
But if you're being honest?
It's the 10 seconds between start and finish, when you're not thinking about anything.
No family, not obligations, just you.
Being free.
I gotta tell you.
This whole saving the world...
Robin Hood nonsense you've been doing recently...
It's bullshit.
It's not you.
Be who you are.
Why live only a quarter mile at a time, when you can live your whole life that way?
See all those blow that muscles will give you.
All show and no..
Well I got plenty of goal.
You must have misplaced that.
When I kicked your ass up in down that office of yours.
Yeah.
Just like you Brits, rewriting History, huh?
All I know.
It was not me who was thrown out of a 4 storey window.
Jumped.
I jumped out of a 4 storey window.
Saving my partner's life.
Because where I'm from, we don't settle fight by throwing bombs.
Well, that's funny, because where I'm from, we don't need women to run to our rescue.
I mean, do you really believe you could stand in front of me?
And beat me in a straight up old fashioned fist fight?
Let me tell you something.
Me and you...
One on one, no one else around.
I will beat your ass like a Cherokee drum.
Maybe one day we will find that out.
Oh, you better hope that day never comes.
I said no, Mr. Nobody.
I'm not leaving this cell.
I'll get out my way.
The right way.
- Get back to your cell.
- It's just a malfunction.
- Get back!
- Just a malfunction.
Don't let him get away.
Hobbs!
I've been waiting a long time for this.
Keep waiting bitch!
Rubber bullets, big mistake.
Ah, took longer than I expected.
- 2 questions.
- Yeah.
- My daughter?
- With your sister.
- Toretto?
- That's interesting you ask.
This is my new base, welcome to Nowhere.
Nice little stair for you.
Listen, It's something I don't wanna talk to you about...
Hey, listen guys.
Thanks..
Whoa, whoa, what handcuff.
What is this?
It's called the abuse of power.
You told me to round 'em up.
I told you that...
hand..
Cut 'em loose.
Oh man, this is embarrassing.
I'm sorry guys, what do I have?
This is how you treat old friends?
Friend?
We don't even really know who the hell this guys is.
It does not matter who I am, Tez I'm like Nobody ok?
Nobody, then who is he?
He's nothing he's like less than me.
Clearly we're getting nowhere, with nobody.
I've been in here for 4 hours, my ribs are sore.
I don't know about y'all, but I'm out.
- I wouldn't recommend that.
- What?
Well, thanks to your bust Berlin job.
You all made interpol's top 10 most wanted list.
Top 10?
Uh-huh.
That's alright.
Well, not you.
What do you mean?
You just missed the cut, you're number 11.
- So.
- I missed it?
- Yeah.
- That's impossible.
What number did they come in at?
Six, eight, nine...
Ten.
She's Ten?
That's impossible, there is no way she's at 10.
Oh, She's definitely at 10.
How about we focus on someone who we're not gonna find out in anybody's list?
We are awaiting hard confirmation, but...
I believe that's the cyber terrorist known as Cipher.
Wait, no, Cipher's an organization.
Not a person.
Not according to our sources.
- What does she want?
- I don't know.
Cipher is like a digital active God.
They, she, can manipulate world systems under shadows.
Anything that can be hacked..
And here is the kicker.
You will never find her linked to any other.
Her digital identity is scrubbed every few seconds worldwide.
So basically, she is the boogeyman.
Yeah, she is.
One of the hottest boogeyman I have ever seen, I mean...
If y'all know her, tell her to get extra boy.
- What are you, 12?
- That was my scene.
Let's just say.
People are scared of the hacker group Anonymous.
But even anonymous won't mess with her.
What the hell does any of this have to do with us?
Probably nothing, Letty.
But...
I do find it interesting, apparently for some reason.
She's now working with this guy.
He's already delivered a fully operational EMP into her hands.
Detonate that, they can turn any city in the world into a war zone.
So then what is it that you're suggesting?
Maybe we find Dom huh?
Well, first let's catch him and then figure out
- why he's turned.
- So y'all want us...
To track Dom.
And I know Roman, it's kinda a big job.
- It's impossible.
- Which is why...
I'm bringing in an extra pair of hands.
Ah.
My day just got a whole hell of a lot better.
Mr. Nobody you want to tell me why you just put me in a room with this teen crumpeting criminal, some bitch.
You got a big mouth on a small head.
Coming from prisoner 6753.
Don't think we've forgotten everything that you've done.
We're not...
teaming up with this guy.
Let's get one thing clear.
I ain't on your team.
I don't care about you, you crew...
Your little family.
I'm here for Cipher.
You gonna do apply for a job, Head-asshole?
You don't think that tight t-shirt is cutting off the circulation to your brain.
You should get bigger size.
Cipher came to me first.
Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.
When I said no, she went off to my brother.
Oh Yes.
Brother Owen who could forget him?
Former hell-raiser and current guest, at a nasty little black site prison.
Cipher corrupted him left him for dead.
So if I get a shot to take her down, believe me, flicks I'm taking it.
You're taking my boot right up your ass.
Guys, guys, guys.
The fastest way to find Cipher is through Toretto.
Now aside from myself, there's only two men in the world, that have ever managed to actually track him..
Down with any success.
And guess what.
They're both standing in front of me right now.
So like it or not, you two are gonna work together.
You got that?
I'm gonna take that as a yes.
Am I the only one seeing this?
Oh, this oughtta be good.
Use God's eye.
We put our lives on the line..
Running around the world trying to figure this thing out.
It can find anybody, right?
Let's use it to find Dom.
Roman, that is a great idea.
Did you hear that?
Great idea.
- And no, no!
No pointing out.
- Mr. Nobody.
Let's fire it up.. huh?
Got him.
He's in London.
Wait, we have got a 2nd match in Hong Kong.
- Bejing and Seole.
- And Tokyo.
And just about every other major city on the planet.
And so...
God's eye was where we start.
Cipher's already created an evasion that masked her location by..
Pinging random spots all over the globe.
But it was a good thought Roman.
So she's made my programme obsolete.
And that Ramsey..
- Is why are you here.
- See, simple solutions... aren't gonna cut it here slick.
Why are you looking at me when you're saying that?
Wait a second, wait, wait.
Simple solutions might just cut it.
In order for God's eyes to give up all this false pings,
Means they have to be using a free relay.
Watch these two.
Which means it has a decaying sync quantanizer.
Which we can reverse.
And track it back to the originating source and find Dom's true location.
Telling you, they got skills.
That was my idea.
That's what I was saying, remember in there?
Alright.
Let's try this.
It's working..
Time you wanna take your manual and start organizing first response...
Let's get a hold of our internatio...
He's still..
Yes, like first baby shit.
Yes, we've tried those location... wanna mobilize.
Let's get a hold of a, better asshole.
No one respects you, over.
Get away from me.
Alright they are not in China..
Or Russia.
Europe's clear.
But this one's not going away.
This is interesting.
Why?
Because that's here.
Did you all enjoy that?
Next generation concussion grenade.
It scrambles your senses.
Don't worry, It'll wear off in an hour.
Probably.
Hello, Deckard.
Nice to see you again.
Look at this, bodies not even cold Dom.
Your family's already replacing you.
You chose the loosing team.
I guess your brother is smarter than you.
Smart move embedding God's eye into the mainframe.
Irritating to make me have to come all the way down here to get it, but.
Let's go.
Dom!
You're gonna turn your back on family?
Just like that?
Let's go.
You okay?
That wasn't him.
I don't know what she's got on him.
But that wasn't Dom.
- Bryan would know what to do.
- No.
We can't bring Bryan and Mia into this.
We agreed on that.
I know.
Back there was that for her, for me, or you?
Or was it either necessary?
Necessary?
Nothing is necessary.
Everything is a choice.
I simply made one but so did you.
You could have stopped me, but you chose not to do.
I wonder what Letty thought about that.
The problem of putting your foot on a Tiger's neck... is you can never let it up.
I think I need to remind you why you chose to be here.
Dom.
Sorry.
You shoudn't have come.
Nothing's gonna get me away.
Now she has the three of us.
You wanna see him?
See papa.
Papa.
When I realized I was pregnant.
You had just find out Letty was alive.
So I decided when Letty and you go back from your honeymoon.
I was going to tell you.
And then she took us before I had the chance.
I call him Michaels.
That his middle name.
I thought his father should give him first name.
I'm sorry, Dom.
There is nothing to be sorry for.
Whatever happens...
Just save our son.
Your son.
-
Good visit?
I know.
I know what you're thinking.
I just let the guards go, so there is only two opponents in the room.
Rhodes has the gun, so you'll take him out first, I know you.
And then you're thinking.
Elena is a cop, maybe the two of you can fight your way out of here.
So much to think about.
Let me make it easier for you.
Do with it as you wish.
Have you heard of choice theory Dom?
There's a bunch of axiems but only two you really need to concern yourself with,
One.
The only person's behavior we can control is our own.
And two, the only thing we can truly give another person is information, so let me give you some.
You see this cameras in here?
The moment you make a move, highly paid men with weapons, will make there way into this room.
With one very...
specific instruction.
It's not to save me.
It's to kill your son.
And that's a lot of bullets.
And it only takes one for you to loose everything.
So, I have to ask you, because...
I know family is so important to you.
Is that really a choice you wanna make?
Because I'm ready as you are.
I pull this trigger, and God knows I wanna..
I'll kill everyone on this plane...
I still couldn't get in there.
Cause you here manipulate this system.
Since I'm alone!
I got no choice!
I don't think so.
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch.
Damn it..
She wiped it off.
Took God's eye.
That was the one thing we could use to find him.
We lost everything.
- Yeah, princess?
- Find it to rail.
But I've got couple of minutes to spare.
If you want me to send you to the hospital again.
- Yo Rules!
- First off,
- That's not my name.
- Little nobody.
- Don't call me that.
- Oh that's definitely stinky.
Great do me a favor, and tell your majesty over there, that we're gonna find Toretto.
We find Toretto together as a team.
When this is all over, you have me to slap that whickest biscuit right off his face.
Wait a minute, guys.
I think Decker's actually onto something.
How do you think Dom and Cipher got into the country without us knowing?
- Ghost flights.
- That untraceable aircraft it was all internet conspiracy stuff.
It's not.
Satellites and radar grids...
All across the globe shift.
Like an ocean.
And they've got channels that open and close.
And theoretically, if you know the right people who...
Know the right patterns.
You can fly right through the blind's box... can't be intercepted.
So you know where Dom is headed?
Yeah, New York.
You see there Luke..
You guys...
are gonna get along just great.
Which proves, rule number two, you never lose everything.
Fire up the chopper.
Guys, have a bowl and a Big Apple.
Are we travelling like this again?
Because Dom took God's Eye, so we need to stay off the grid.
But like this?
Look here man.
Before I throw up in my mouth...
Let me ask you what are we doing here?
That's a good question, Roman.
Let me show you.
Welcome to our new base of operations.
Now seriously, what is this place?
This... is heaven.
The agency garage.
We call it the toy shop.
This is where we house every vehicles seized from drug dealers of East coast.
Now.
Mr nobody said..
If we're gonna have a chance of catching Dom..
We're gonna have to be damn fast.
Maybe this could help.
We got a tank.
750 horsepower.
6.6 liter V8 Duramax engine.
With the M153 probe remotely operated weapon station on top.
You didn't get this from drug dealers.
No.
No that...
United State's army weaponry.
See the army developing machines like this the soldiers could drive from a mile way so they can stay safe.
And alive.
But luckily..
There is a back up driver seat for those of us who like to get more..
Hands on.
I'm sitting there wondering this whole time when this thing feeling badly and she's getting fact.
No one is getting hands on it.
She doesn't go on some streets.
I'm in love.
Again?
No.
No...
That's a million dollar show car.
The point is to not draw attention.
It's reverse psychology.
Dom will never see it coming.
It's neon orange,
The international space station would see it coming.
Go choose anything less inspeculous.
No no.
This is ridiculous.
Hey my man, you can put that down right there.
This is a gift.
A real gift.
I know what you're doing.
I like your beard.
You're blanta.
Black santa?
No, I'm serious.
Put it down right here..
What are you doing?
Engine's mis-firing, I gotta check it out.
No.
That's not part of the plan, Dom.
Clearly..
But unless you want the engine to cease on the job,
You have five minutes.
I want another visual.
I got an ATM
I don't like this.
I want to see Toretto.
There are no more cameras.
Then find something.
Punch in on something reflective A car mirror, anything..
- You know who I am?
- That's why I'm here.
You know what I'm capable of.
It's why I'm here.
I'll give you until I finish my cup up.
And I'm fucking thirsty.
I got limited time.
So won't take up too much of yours.
Oh no.
No, you've already taken everything I have of value, Mr. Toretto,
What more could you possibly want?
To give you something back.
Talk to me.
Something's not right here.
First time I saw my son... was behind a bulletproof glass.
When he reached me, I couldn't hold on.
It's the worst pain I ever felt..
I know you know exactly how that feels.
Maybe we could change that..
I think..
You are about to suggest something really dodgy Mr Toretto.
It's why I'm here.
Just punch in on something, I'm not liking this.
Something is not right.
- Rhodes, you close?
- Yeah.
- Go.
- The delivery truck's moving.
Captain Deckard Shaw, distinguished himself by acts of gallantry of the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.
His bold actions saved the lives of hostages and his team mates.
Recommendation:
Victoria Cross.
Highest honor the British Government has ever given.
To a traitor.
Some about this old thing just doesn't add up to me.
Well then don't do the same kind of funny math,
It says a DSS agent who has a soul to stop a valid stolen EMP.
Sound familiar huh?
Wanna give me a hand?
- On three?
- Yeah.
One two..
You know, you can tell this in another letter..
But maybe we could've caused some serious damage.
- Yes, we could have.
- Yeah.
Shame I'll have to punch you, head of defend, when this is all over.
Ah well.
With all due respect, Captain,
When this whole thing is over we're gonna find a location and I'm gonna knock your teeth so far down your throat.
You're gonna stick a toothbrush right up in your ass to brush up.
Give me God's eyes.
- God's eye active.
- Thanks.
Let's find us some Russian.
That spy with my little lie...
Minister of defense.
We land back in Moscow by nine.
Here's the latest defense report, All the items in yesterday's meet.
Upload this coordinates to Dom's nav.
Copy that.
He's in the third car.
It's a guard class limousine.
Where's my team?
- Where's his team?
- There's no sign of 'em yet.
They are off the grid.
Probably just bunker down somewhere.
Closing in on him.
You guys ready?
One thing I can guarantee you Dom.
No one's ready for this.
I want every with chip with the GEODIE exploits in a two mile radius around that motorcade now.
There's over a thousands of them.
Hack 'em all.
It's zombie time.
I'd buckle up if I were you.
AUTO-DRIVE ACTIVATED.
Hey...!
Target the motorcade.
And here they come.
What is going on?
Ouch.
Drive fast!
Police escort down..
Take out the lead and follow cars.
Drive!
Drive!
- Two more down.
- Still a new warranty.
There's more cars ahead of us.
Shoot their engines.
Oh God!
We got an army of cars driving themselves.
Send backup!
Send S.W.A.T!
I don't care if you send the goddamn boy scout...
- Just send up some help!
- Now that's Dom.
Faster, faster!
The motorcade just turned on 7th.
Perfect.
Make it rain.
Target immobilized.
You are up Dom.
- Who the hell is that?
- What is he doing?
What the hell are you waiting for?
Shoot him!
Come on, come on!
I'm out.
Shit.
Don't worry sir.
This car is bulletproof.
You'll be safe in here.
- Give me the case.
- Give him the case.
These are nuclear launch codes.
We cannot give it to him.
What is he doing now?
He just cut a hole in our gas tank.
Good work, Dom.
Meet you at the pick-up.
I think I know where my team's at.
- Where?
- Right in front of me.
This is on you.
Get out of there, Dom.
Guys, I know why Dom's here.
Police scanners are saying he's stolen Nuclear Football.
It's over, Toretto.
Get your ass out of the car now.
That's how you wanna play this?
Let's play.
Don't do this, Dom.
- What're you doing?
- It's a trap!
Now I know what it feels like be every cop ever chasing us.
I'm gonna get a little close and I ped him.
Oh, so you just gonna take Dom?
Little Nobody has clearly lost his little mind.
I'm on him.
Easy, work together.
- Look out!
- Wait, wait, wait!
Oh shit.
I will take the short cut.
Look out!
Watch these people.
Big Sexy coming through!
Not this time, Dom.
Stretch him out.
Hold them.
He gotta have about 2000 Horse Power in that thing.
Try 3000..
Try Five.
Get out of there.
I'm working on it.
Stop working on it, and do it..
No, no no...
It's my Bentley.
No!
Get that case and run!
Move!
They thought...
this was gonna be a streetfight.
You wait for it..
No!
Letty, stop!
What are you gonna do?
I don't know why you're doing this, but I know one thing.
You love me.
And you're not gonna to shoot me.
You should've given him the case, cause I won't chase you.
Okay.
I will just take it from a dead girl.
You willing to die for it?
Let's go then.
Anything?
They're gone.
And D.O.D confirmed it was a nuclear football.
He's got an EMP and nuclear launch codes.
I don't know what it is, but they're building towards something.
Deckard?
He didn't make it.
I'm disappointed in you, Dom.
You're gonna Letty just walk away with the codes.
- You've got the codes!
- Rhodes got the codes.
You made the choice to let her go.
And now I have to make one on my own.
They are adorable little things, aren't they?
I hope I don't hurt him.
Look, Cipher, I did exactly what you asked me to do.
Don't do this.
- This is your doing.
- My doing?
Please don't hurt him.
I'm begging you.
I don't want you to beg.
- I want you to learn.
- Learn what?
I understand why you did what you did.
I really do.
But it was the wrong choice.
This is a consequence, Dom.
No!
No!
No...
Wait.
Wait.
No!
Can you pull up the footage from the guy in the ally.
- Traffic cams.
- I got you.
I knew it.
I recognize that guy.
That's Connor Rhodes.
I met him when I was working with Shaw's brother.
He wanted us to get the Nightshade device him.
Connor Rhodes.
He's also linked to somebody who I like to forget.
Mose Jakande.
Warlord who tried to get God's eye.
Which means that's twice that Dom has messed up Cipher's business.
Everything you're feeling right now, that's rage, sense of loss.
It's not real.
It's a survival instinct wired deep into our brains.
To ensure continuation of species.
When early men went visit a watering hole...
If they didn't watch their child, they got snatched by a crocodile.
Their brains would create a painful but a structural memory.
So it will never happen again.
This idea of family that is so core with you, that rules your world...
It's a biological lie.
You don't have to accept it.
I don't!
Did you really could think you could destroy two of my teams.
Without any repercussions?
I wouldn't have even looked your way..
If you hadn't done that.
You didn't even know you had a kid.
You can thank me for that.
And start doing the job I'm asking you to do.
Help you start a war.
Is that what you think I want.
That's so limited.
I didn't take that football to start a war..
Anymore than I took your son to start a family.
Taking your son got me the codes..
The codes will get me the nukes, and the nukes will get me what I want...
Today, tomorrow...
and every day after that.
What's that?
Accountability.
The second I fire off one of those nukes..
I put the superpowers of this world on notice that... when they cross the line,
I'm gonna be there to hold the responsible..
Because the truth is, Dom...
To the world out there...
I'm the crocodile at the watering hole.
You've got one last job to do.
Cipher..
If I were you, I would kiss my son.
Because whether you value it or not, all of this...
Your plane, your security and you... are still on this earth because of him.
The problem we have with tracking Cipher is there's nothing to trace then.
Now we have Rhodes' information.
And we're getting snapshots of this data before it's scrubbed off the net.
That looks like somebody's bank accounts?
Always just...
The Longitude.
Given the fact that Dom hit the Russian Motorcade safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead, bring up the map.
Great, let's start here run the possibilities.
Yalta, Poltava.
Looks like they just threw letters together.
- Konyert.
- It's Vladupi.
What are you doing here?
Thought I was gonna check in on you from time to time,
To see you how you're doing.
By the way, not so hot.
But there's nothing in Vladiven.
It's just ice..
That funny...
Could've sworn there was a secret Russian naval base with the retrophilic cold war Submarines.
Well, technically, it's not Russian anymore.
Base was take by a terror grope of military separatists about a month ago.
And the Russians haven't taken it back yet.
So there is a little window of opportunity here.
Russian submarines, nuclear football, it sounds like everything we do our legs gonna be bombed off.
Sounds like you're still a No. 11 on the list.
It sounds like you've changed since you look punk ass.
Facial hairs and camen.
Guys... guys.
Hey.
We gotta call this in all the way up the chain.
That's good thinking champ.
Except... unfortunately the Russian Minister of Defense.
Got himself involved in little incident on US territory and two governments aren't talking to each other for a while.
By the time they do...
It will be too late.
So, any other suggestions?
Yeah, I got one.
How about we just stop them ourselves?
You're talking about a Russian Military Base.
Separatists.
Whatever.
It's suicide.
It's stopping world war 3.
What's it gonna be rook?
You're gonna close your eyes on this one too?
Pray that the apocalypse doesn't come knocking on your mama's front door?
Or are you're gonna saddle up, be a man and save the entire goddamn world.
You know, thank god they read it out.
What's that?
- Rule number three.
- Which is?
There are no rules.
What did I told you, Luke?
I knew he'd get in three.
Areal transport leaves in an hour.
Take whatever vehicle you want.
- All bets are off.
- All bets are off.
Bets are off?
See you later...
Letty I don't like telling you this one thing,
The game's changed.
Before we were trying just to catch Dom, but now after all of this...
I want you to know, if I have to...
I'm gonna put him down..
Then you might have to take us both down.
I'm freezing man.
This ain't for me.
I come from a different kind of lifestyle brah.
Ladies know me.
They know where I'm at with.
I try to take a piss, I ain't even recognize myself.
Now that's entirely too much information.
I'm just saying.
Well, one thing is for sure.
Dom's gotta be either working with them or making a train cause no one will be this insane to hit this place without a damn army.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Speak of the Devil.
Alright, Dom, you're one step closer to that family reunion.
400 meters to base.
Prep the EMP.
Let's take these defenses down.
We have a possible threat incoming.
Raise the barricade, As soon as possible.
We've lost power, get to your positions now.
Gates are open.
Let's get this party started.
- EMP's are charging.
- How long?
60 seconds.
Alright, Dom, You've one pulse left in that EMP.
That sub is heavily insulated.
You're gonna need to be right underneath it, for this thing to work.
Come on.
Engaging target.
He's beneath the Sub.
I'm loosing control, mayday, mayday.
I'm going down.
Yes, two birds with one stone.
We've got control of the sub.
Dom, we are good.
Head over to the Rendezvous.
Ok Matty...
Let's take this baby for a spin.
Damn!
I think Cipher just rebooted that Sub's command system.
What the hell is he talking about?
In Leyman's terms...
She just carjacked a submarine.
We can't let it get away.
There's the control room.
If you can get me into that warehouse
I can tap with network and counter hack Cipher.
Keep it from flowing into water.
No, what we need to do is get me on that sub.
I find the weapon's room and I can pull the lunch chip before she can fire any of those nukes.
That is too crazy.
- Just saying it's too dangerous.
- We'll do both.
Knock, knock!
Five vehicles just reached the base.
They just don't give up, do they..
A'right.
Let's haul ass team.
Double time, double time.
Letty, let's roll.
Go, go, go, go.
Change of plans, Dom.
I'm sending you the co-ordinates, head there immediately.
- I'm done.
I want my son.
- I'll tell you when you're done.
Your team is in play, now meet Rhodes and follow my instruction.
I got you covered, go.
Move, move!
Get out of here, go go!
Ok, how do you like this?
- Remote link has been separated.
- I'll take care of this.
Hi Ramsey.
She's regaining control.
Damn it, she's good.
They are entering the Weapon's room.
Oh that's cute.
Go, pull pull!
Roman, guard up by the chip, go.
Oh she's slick.
Gonna have to do better in that way.
Ok, now you're starting to piss me off.
Ramsey, how much time we talking to you?
You're smart, but no smart enough.
She's locked me out.
Tez, I can't stop.
Now you're gonna have to pull that chip.
I can't.
This thing's going into attack mode.
The door's not gonna open until you pull the chip.
Tez we got no idea what the hell we are looking for.
I got it.
What in the hell are you guys doing?
It wasn't me, okay?
It will be labeled "Guidance Go".
- Ok.
I got something.
- What?
It says haha.. slack slack back smoke, dear jack n jack.
Do you understand that?
Well, nasty.
Quite a show.
Arming the nuke..
Nuke's going hot, she's trying to fire this thing.
- Roger that, we're moving out.
- Disable the nukes.
Roman, what are you seeing?
- Come on, Talk to me.
- I don't see shit.
I'm holding on.
Now we have a countdown.
What the hell is going on man?
We are about to launch a nuclear missile, what the hell is going on.
Pull the damn chip.
Countdown.
Countdown.
Look for a countdown.
What countdown?
The missile needs to activate for launch.
The countdown timer won't be in Russian.
The countdown.
Let's show the world what we've got.
No.
No.
No.
Don't press that.
I got it.
Something is wrong.
It won't launch.
Get that sub out of there.
Now!
Move your ass Roman.
You alright?
There's nothing alright about any of this.
Let's go.
What about the missiles?
We got the chip, no nukes for her.
Hell yeah.
Let's roll.
Guys we got company.
A lot of company.
Alright team, here is the plan.
There is a Sea lock at the opening of the bay,
We get there first, and close it, we can stop the submarine from escaping into open water.
And disappearing forever.
I've got the location.
It's 10 miles south west.
10 miles?
Like I make it in 10 seconds.
What's the matter Roman, you forgot the snow tyre?
Loving that Lambo now?
Alright everyone, hold you with that launch trip later.
Right now I want that sub, in deep water, where no one can find it.
Find me the fastest route out of that bay.
Copy that.
Why are they shooting at me?
I think off you're in that orange Lamborghini I don't know.
Shut up Tez.
Dom.
Do you really wanna put that car in gear?
Do you?
I don't think so.
They're heading for the sea lock.
They're trying to trap the sub in the bay.
I should have taken care of this a long time ago.
Rhodes, check his team out.
I'm on it.
Roman, get in front of me.
Ok, y'all wanna play it rough?
Now it's my turn.
Yeah, baby!
Guys, we got snow mobile on the right.
They're going to flank us.
No they ain't!
Oh shit!
Tez!
Roman hold tight.
I'm on the way.
I don't wanna go swimming.
No!
Really Tez?
Oh, No.
No.
No.
Oh shit.
Roman, grab your door.
Tez!
Grab the door Roman.
It's all gone.
Oh Shit.
Roman, hang on.
Tej!
Get me off this thing.
Tez.
Come on!
Alright, I've had enough of this shit!
Number 11 my Ass.
Don't shrink it.
We got a sub to catch, get in.
What?
The pressure is on alert in the cargo hold.
Drop it to 10 thousand feet.
I know how much these people mean to you.
So I'll let you pick the first target.
I'm not picking target from a mile away.
I'd stand face to face, and look 'em dead in the eye.
Ok.
The wife it is.
Nice plane.
I'm gonna enjoy her remains.
You don't go get any ideas.
You and planes don't have a good history.
No shit.
Let's go scarface.
The arseholes ain't gonna kill themselves.
Pull up surveillance, right now.
Surprise.
Pierce must be dead.
You're driving.
I said it from the beginning.
No way, I'm not driving.
We have a security breach in the cargo hold.
Take care of it now.
Jesus Mum, you should pose to avoid the nerves.
Oh, shut up, don't be such a baby.
Get to the pilot, he's got the second key.
Wait for my signal.
Give Cipher my regards.
Did Torretto hold up his end of the deal?
He gave us this little thing here.
No, don't touch.
You can track Cipher with this, but you can't do this on your own.
There's gotta be two of you.
Fine, I got contacts.
Now you're gonna take your brother.
- No.
- Yes.
Torretto knows where he is...
He's got this thing.
He can see everything it's like it's called the devil's bumhole or something?
- It's called the God's eyes.
- Yeah, well.
Whatever.
There's no way I'm using Owen, alright?
He's a lost cause.
He's your brother, Deck.
He's my son.
He's our family.
And our family that died...
Bloody shit happening.
You lied about, I mean, I can't believe you.
You've gotten upset, you really upset your mother.
Call yourself a brother?
Look, I'm in, mum.
Ok.
Every time!
- Owen.
- In position.
Go.
I'm in.
I've got the package to lay on.
Whole pounds of him..
You made me miss my son?
What do you think you're doing?
Looking at you dead in the eye.
That was for Letty.
- Rhodes.
- He is no longer with us.
Rhodes picked the wrong target.
Congratulations Dom.
You just killed your son.
You are wrong.
I just saved him.
And you just took your foot off the tiger's neck.
You're welcome.
It's gonna get noisy.
This is for your relief.
Good?
Let's go.
Go stop him, do not let him get off this plane.
That truck's got enough munition to take us all out.
We don't give 'em a target.
Everybody get in front of us, line up
- we will take the hit.
- What?
I need to switch cars, right now.
- Roman, here comes the bad part.
- What?
Hang in there guys!
We're almost through the lock.
It's easy for you to say, when your ass ain't on fire.
Alright little mate.
It's might be a little scary,
It's gonna be a lot of fun.
The music good?
They're locking on.
Sorry guys, I got no trick for us..
- What do we do now?
- We start praying.
Hell yeah!
That's Dom!
- This guy in our side now?
- Who the hell cares?
He just saved our asses.
Good to be riding with you again man.
Torretto just cleared the way for them.
Someone give me something.
- Torpedoes are ready.
- Then launch them.
- Take the wheel.
- I ain't taking shit.
- Take the wheel!
- Where are you doing?
- This is crazy!
- Speed up,
- Left and back!
- What?
Turn the goddamn wheel to the left, really quickly.
Boom, baby!
That's alright!
Back in the sink.
Where is that smile?
There it is!
You're gonna shoot a baby You shoud bust it...
You aren't gonna wanna see this?
Is that you or him?
Him.
Good.
The torpedo's missed, they are gonna reach lock before the sub does.
The hell they are.
Get ready for this.
Oh shit!
We're going to need a bigger truck.
- Get us out of here.
- Why are you always yelling?
- This bitch is crazy!
- Look out!
That's not good.
That's not good.
We got this.
That's my girl.
The sub's too close.
We ain't making it to the gate in time.
We just gonna let it get away?
Not if I know Dom.
You loose.
Dom.
I destroyed two of your teams
I killed your red headed boyfriend.
And I put two killers on you untraceable plane.
You lost the minute you interrupted my honeymoon.
Put a heat-seeker on him now.
Now!
That's a goddamn heat seeker coming at us.
Oh my...
come and get it.
Guys!
Dive..
This...
This is for my son!
Dom!
You are out of bullets Deckard.
Like I'm need a gun to take care of you,
How did you find me?
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch!
Resourceful.
You have a lot to answer Cipher.
You pulled my family through.
A mother.
I'm gonna make sure that never happens again.
To anyone.
There is only one flaw in your plan.
What's that?
Only one of us has a parachute!
Told you this would be fun!
Time to land, Boys!
You know I've never left you, Letty?
I know.
And you know I never will..
I know.
I've so much to tell you.
Yeah you do, and you can start with that bitch!
Now, that's...
Dominic Toretto.
Hey Dom!
I'm just towing it out there?
We need to get up out of here.
Cause this all kinda neuclearism happening under this ice.
Relax!
Without the trigger chips, those nukes are harmless.
Ok.
So we good then.
Lemme go and get my young selfie levels up.
You realize this is classified, right?
Not today.
We have to get up out of here man.
I'm freezing.
It's Okay.
Don't worry, he's gonna be here soon.
I get it, y'all got a lot in common.
Computer hacks, god's eyes, geeks, nerd.
You know, but we got a lot in common too!
Alright?
- Like what?
- We walk in the room, and we are oozing sex appeal.
Me and you?
There's a problem.
I am asking the real question right now.
Is it gonna be... the Nerd or...
the dark knight?
To be honest I like both of you.
A'rigt!
Yeah..yea!
But just before we get into all of that,
Let me ask you one question.
- You can ask me anything.
- Anything.
What's my last name?
When you guys pick around with then I guess you can let me know.
It's gonna be a Parker.
That's all that really matters.
Jones, Miss Parker.
Hey Miss Parker.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I wanted to thank you.
No need.
Cipher's still on the loose.
There's been some reports she's in Athens.
But she won't be nuking any city anytime soon.
Thanks to you guys.
- So, I got you a parting favor.
- This can't be good...
Your record's been clreared.
Full re-instatement.
You got you job back.
That is if you want it.
If I want?
You know after 16 years.
I figured it's time for a little break.
Wow.
Daddy's stayin' home.
- Nobody.
- Get in touch!
Ah, hang on a second.
This could be interesting.
What made you think I would do it?
Brother-hood.
I saw that look you gave Cipher.
I knew you wanted revenge.
Glad I did it.
Can't believe you went to see my Mother.
Come on.
All this fuss of you.
Yes.
Alena, I promise to keep our son safe.
And now.. he always will be.
I want to introduce you to the most important person in my universe.
Who will never give up on me.
You've heard me say.
"That you never turn your back on family."
And I wanna thank you all for never turning your back on me.
You wanna meet them?
Alright!
Everyone...
Meet Bryan.
Hey Bryan.
Okay, I guess he's my turning secret.
Thank you for giving us family.
Thank you for giving us the strength.
HAVANA, CUBA
-
We swap in parts from Ford Plymouths and Cadillac.
My grandfather bought it in 1957.
When he died it passed to my father.
Then my brother and now to me.
Look at this, this is an engine from a boat.
- No way.
- Yeah!
Whatever it takes to keep it running!
This is a cuban spirit.
Your spirit, keep it up.
Never ever lose that.
Dom..
It's your cousin..
He's in trouble, come quickly!
Please don't do this, Understand my problem.
You know how I make a living on my car.
Not my problem bro.
Dominic Toretto..
I heard about you.
Welcome to my island.
Why you hooking up my cousin's car?
In the morning, I gave it to him..
He can't pay..
I take the car.
I just need a few more days.
Few more days isn't part of the deal.
Make a deal you gotta give up to it.
You make a deal You gonna give up to it.
Gonna give up to it?
So you are one of those types..
Take everyone's ride and then ship it back to the states.
You should show your people some respect.
You watch your mouth.
Now you got a problem.
- I'm gonna keep it about the cars.
- You scared me there!
You want a car?
Get it the right way.
- How?
- Race war.
I already own it, bro.
Not that car.
Mine.
Dom, his car is the fastest car in the Island.
Do you know what he has in that hood?
Do you know, it doesn't matter what's under a hood?
The only thing that matters is who's behind the wheels.
- You think so?
- I know so.
Then race his car.
We ain't racing a quarter mile here.
We race the cuban mile.
Done!
I'd wish you what you're trying to do.
My car is the slowest car on the Island.
What else?
Pull the seats the doors the battery..
Leave the motor, take it off.
- Laughing gas?
- Nah, Fed.
This is cuban NOS.
You guys are crazy.
What are you doing?
Why you messing with the west-gate.
Used to play.
It's in emergencies.
You know that's way too much booze for that engine.
- It's going to be fast.
- It's gonna be bomb.
Only needs to go a mile.
Be fast!
Be safe!
But don't be last.
Racers ready..?
Go..!
Stop.
That car belongs in the trash bro.
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.
Let's go.
- Go straight..
- Come on in.
Adios, Toretto.
See if this one works.
That's impossible..
Look out.
A Deal's a deal.
You own my car.
And you earn my respect.
Keep your car your respect is good enough for me.
Cousin.
Sorry bout your car,
Your's was too slow for a Torreto anyway.
Your Impala.
Are you serious?
-
Look at that smile
I love it when you smile.
Make me happy
I think this place makes you happy.
Like it speaks to you.
You remember that guy?
The Racer and his dad.
- The one with the boat engine.
- Yeah!
- yeah.
- Of course.
I was looking at them, and I..
And I couldn't help but too imagine what you'd be like, if you were dad.
No, no, no.
I'm not pregnant.
Is that what you want?
It's not about what I want or what you want..
It's about why we haven't asked the question.
Can I help you with that?
- What?
- You need a hand?
Yeah, I think I do.
Sounds like you're not getting any fuel.
Yeah.
Have a look inside that solenoid.
See if we can get some power into it.
What brings you to Cuba?
The same thing that brings everyone else to Cuba.
Culture.
People.
Beauty.
What brings you to Cuba?
- Work!
- Must be casual Friday.
How is that honeymoon going Dom?
Your fuel relay is missing.
I know.
I'd love play games.
Beaten the bests alone.
I'm kinda in a rush, so if you got something to say...
Oh this is a very different game that I can assure you.
This..?
There is something much greater at work here.
This is fate.
- I choose to make my own fate.
- Not today.
This is the road you take to your apartment every morning.
What else is different, Dom?
The Santiago's closed?
Did you have to cross two blocks to go get your cuban coffee?
So, what is it?
Black, no sugar?
Yeah..
I've put a lot of work into getting you here in today.
Now that I'm here, what do you want?
I want you to work for me.
Work for you?
I could have saved you a lot of time then.
See, I don't work for anyone.
You can't walk away from this Dom.
We're gonna have this conversation one way or the other.
See that's the funny thing about fate.
It's cunning.
It can bring you beautiful things, and it can also bring you moments like this.
I will hear that you want to work for me.
You're gonna betray your brother, abandon your code, shatter your family.
See, your team..
Is about to go up against the only thing they can't handle.
What's that?
You.
Oh, and Dom, I wouldn't mention this to anyone.
They are gonna be hitting us with everything they've got.
So, we wanna engage with maximum speed.
Neutralize the shooters and then move on to our objective.
There are two things I want you to keep in mind,
Number one,
I choose you for this squad because you are the most fearsome warriors on the planet.
And number two,
You go out there, you do your job.
And you take them down.
Everyone... and I mean everyone..
Manice and pedice at the mall.
Later on today.
Alright, show 'em what you got.
I don't wanna play anymore.
Alright, let's go, come on, let's go, let's go.
- Final 2 minutes.
- Quite the junior section.
Oh yeah.
That's moms they come out to sport the kids.
Except there seems to be more moms than kids,
Way more like moms and..
Yeah, it's a big soccer job.
Let's go girls.
So your intel was spot on...
A democly 7 EMP weapon went missing in the gulf.
Arms dealer from the Liberation front have it in Berlin.
- Shit.
- This thing can wipe out..
An entire electrical grid in a major city.
No lights, no power, instant stone age.
Chloe, Maya...
You can't let her run by you like that.
- Let's go, let's go.
- Hey, Hobbs.
It's a class 4 WMD.
You have the no idea what's at stake here...
Yes..!
I know exactly what is at stake here, okay?
If Pink Butterflies beat my Red Dragon that means we lose the championship.
Which means I have 20 little girls who are crying..
And that's not a good thing.
Which then means I have to spend a lot of time in ice cream shops and lot of time in Tay-Tay concerts.
- Tay-Tay?
- Yep?
Taylor Swift.
You gotta be shitting me Get it together.
Let's go girls.
We need to do this,
Lot of lives are at stake.
I need to be clear here.
US Government can not sanction this operation in anyway.
You're on your own.
This thing goes sideways you don't just get burned, you go to prison.
And there's nothing we can do to get you out.
Let me tell you something.
The only thing that I love more than saving lives..
Is my daughter.
So you don't shut up with this government bullshit right now and start showing some team spirit and respect for the Red Dragons.
I'm gonna have all 20 of them lined up kick you right in the Tay-Tay.
Go, Dragons!
Say it again.
- Go, Dragons!
- Good boy.
Go Dragons..
Go Dragons..
Yeah, he's open...
Yup!
Yes!
That is my daughter right there!
Yes!
Yes, come here.
- Awesome.
- Nice job.
Dad's gotta go to work?
Oh yeah, daddy's gotta go to work.
Now, you gonna need to get a team that you can trust.
Oh, I already got one.
- Hey, Dom.
- Hey, Hobbs.
We got a job in Berlin, and I need a favor, brother.
No problem.
I'll grab the team and meet you in Berlin.
Good.
You were only to supposed to create a diversion, Roman.
That was a diversion.
How many of the damn explosives did you use?
I do not know, Tez.
All of it?
- Wait, all of it?
- Roman, Jesus!
- Right.
- Yeah, more of you fan club, eh?
They're still on us.
These guys are taking it personal.
Roman, we just blown up their facility and stole their EMP.
Other than the doctor's cold fingers,
I'd say it's about as personal as it can get.
- Phase 2.
- Phase 2?
So you just gonna keep that to yourself?
What happen to Phase 1?
What about that part?
Yeah, remember the airplane?
Everyone drove their cars out but you.
I told you my engine seized up.
Seized up?
Just follow my lead, okay?
Roman, whatever you do.
Don't think.
Tez, drop it.
Bomb's away.
Split now!
Holy shit!
Look out..!
- Rock n roll.
- Just so you know.
You miss some.
I'll just wait for it.
I hate you, Tej!
You good?
I'll see you when it's done.
Alright.
Great job, team.
Let's break up and meet me at the safe house.
Hell of a job, brother.
When we can get back to the base.
Beers on me.
You lost your god damn mind, Toretto!
Toretto you put hands on that thing, you're gonna have the whole world coming for you including me.
I do not know what you're doing but you better think about this, Toretto.
It ain't too late to stop this.
It is now.
That some..
What?
Wait a second, what are you talking about?
- Dom taking the EMP.
- Bullshit.
Where are you?
It's too late for me.
Get out of here.
I saw that look in his eyes.
I've seen that look before.
Dominic Toretto just went rogue.
I got his phone records, y'all.
It's a whole bunch of calls to untraceable numbers.
Burner phone, right?
Nah.
Scrambled.
Faked number.
They got some sort of micro-router..
..to bury the signal patterns which means Dom is clearly..
Look, I do not know Dom as well as you, but if we just look at the facts.
Dom's been having highly encrypted conversation with some mysterious person.
He took out Hobbs.
He stole the EMP, now he's disappeared.
So what're you saying?
Maybe we should consider the fact that..
Hobb's right.
Dom did go rogue.
- Letty.
- Before you judge the man,
Remember you're breathing now because he saved your life.
You just gonna let her bump yourself like that
I'm just hanging out.
That was a little risk.
What you gonna do.
Email her?
Long wait fellas.
Thank you.
Well, this is an exciting new look.
It's a little tight on the crotch as always.
What boyband bus did she fallen off?
He's my new junior associate.
He's working with me on this.
All yours.
Mr Nobody and I have been given the authority to get you out of this.
All you have to do is agree to the terms and you're free.
Restraining wills, talking about, what terms?
Confess to your crimes in Berlin.
Treason, international espionage.
Massive destruction of scenic property.
You do that, we close the case.
And?
And the DSS blacklist.
Germany love that.
Officially you're a criminal.
Woah, woah, woah.
You need to work on your delivery alright.
Unofficially.
You're off the books.
Come work with me.
- I'm not a criminal.
- Luke Come on.
Labels.
There is no confession.
There are no back room deals.
Got myself into this, I'm gonna get myself out of it.
You know that.
As you and that's what I told them.
Well, there you have it.
Good luck in the course, man!
What about your daughter?
You know, if you're not gonna do it your country, at least do it for your kid.
Big mistake kid.
Hold on.
Look, look.
He's still working from the manual.
I mean, he doesn't even really know the rules.
Give him a break.
Luke?
I appreciate that.
- It's good to see you, old man.
- You too.
Rule No.1:
know your audience.
I gave you your shot, you shit the bag.
Now I'm gonna show you how to get this done.
- You're dead cop!
- Dead!
Well, well, well...
Luke Hobbs behind bars.
Would you look at that?
The bad cop got it's day.
That color looks good on you.
Yeah.
Look a whole lot better with your blood on it.
Yeah.
Good luck with that, Hercules.
Roaming gone bad.
Huh?
Such a cliche.
Ah well.
Welcome to the club.
I wouldn't get that twisted son.
We ain't in no club.
We got nothing in common.
And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.
You put the shovel did you?
Cause it's 38 feet of steel and concrete.
What's up big dog?
Now you get to dig in.
Wanker.
Move..
Say that again.
If I say it again, It will be two corpse.
I'm going to enjoy this.
Welcome back, Dom.
Nice job out there.
Excited about tonight?
Dom in this?
You're with me now.
- Showing me your shoe collection?
- Yup.
A pair for every occasion.
There's enough guns here to outfit a small army.
Oh this is just the tip of the iceberg.
You know what I like about you, Dom.
You're a genuine outlaw.
I mean, you're a man who lives by his own rules.
Which was surprising because when I saw you in Cuba, I heard about a guy who almost killed you with a motorcycle and you..
let him keep his car?
- That confused you.
- Oh.
Of course I could've taken his car.
It's about something bigger.
This way...
I changed them.
That's not your responsibility.
- That's how I am.
- Is it?
Let me ask you something Dom, what's the best thing in your life?
- Family.
- No, it's not.
Mind if you're being honest?
It's the 10 seconds between start and finish, when you're not thinking about anything.
No family, not obligations, just you.
And freedom.
I gotta tell you.
This whole thing in the world...
Robin Hood nonsense you've been doing recently...
It's bullshit.
It's not you.
Be who you are.
Why live only a quarter mile at a time, when you can live your whole life that way?
Hey..!
Sure those muscles will give you.
All show and no..
Well I got plenty of goal.
You must have misplaced that.
When I kicked your ass up in that office of yours.
Yeah.
Just like you Brits, rewriting History, huh?
All I know.
It was not me who was thrown out of a 4 storey window.
Jumped.
I jumped out of a 4 storey window.
Saving my partner's life.
Because where I'm from, we don't settle fight by throwing bombs.
Well, that's funny, because where I'm from, we don't need women to run to the rescue.
Do you really believe you could stand in front of me?
And beat me in a straight up old fashioned fist fight?
Let me tell you something.
Me and you...
One on one, no one else around.
I will beat your ass like a Cherokee drum.
Maybe one day we will find out.
Oh, you better hope that day never comes.
I said no, Mr. Nobody.
I'm not leaving this cell.
I'll get out my way.
The right way.
- Get back to your cell.
- It's just a malfunction.
- Get back!
- Just a malfunction.
Don't let him get away.
Hobbs!
I've been waiting a long time for this.
Keep waiting!
Rubber bullets, big mistakes.
Took longer than I expected.
- 2 questions.
- Yeah.
- My daughter?
- With your sister.
- Toretto?
- That's interesting you ask.
This is my new base,
Next level stuff for you.
Listen, I don't wanna talk to you about this,
Hey, listen guys.
Thanks..
Wow, handcuff.
What is this?
It's called the abuse of power.
You told me to round 'em up.
I told you that...
hand..
Cut 'em loose.
Oh man, this is embarrassing.
I'm sorry guys, what do I have?
This is how you treat old friends?
Friend?
We don't even really know who the hell that guys is.
It does not matter who I am, As in like Nobody ok?
Nobody, then who is he?
He's nothing he's like less than me.
Clearly we're getting nowhere, with nobody.
I've been 4 hours here, my ribs are sore.
I don't know about y'all, but I'm out.
- I wouldn't recommend that.
- What?
Well, thanks to your past Berlin job.
You all made interpol's top 10 most wanted list.
Top 10?
Uh-huh.
That's alright.
Well, not you.
What do you mean?
You just missed the cut, you're number 11.
- So.
- I missed it?
- Yeah.
- That's impossible.
What number did they come in at?
Six, eight, nine...
Ten.
She's Ten?
That's impossible, there is no way she's 10.
Oh, She's definitely 10.
How about we focus on someone who we're not gonna find out in anybody's list.
We are waiting hard confirmation, but...
I believe that's the cyber terrorist known as Cipher.
Wait, no, Cipher's an organization.
Not a person.
Not according to our sources.
- What does she want?
- I don't know.
Cipher is like a digital active God.
They, she, can manipulate world systems under shadows.
Anything that can be hacked..
And here is the kicker.
You will never find her.
Linked to any other.
Her digital identity is scrubbed every few seconds worldwide.
So basically, she is the boogeyman.
Yeah, she is.
One of the hottest boogeyman I have ever seen, I mean...
If y'all know her, tell her to get extra boy.
- What are you, 12?
- That was my scene.
Let's just say.
People are scared of the hacker group Anonymous.
But even anonymous won't mess with her.
What the hell does any of this have to do with us?
Probably nothing, Letty.
But...
I do find it interesting, apparently for some reason.
She's now working with this guy.
He's already delivered a fully operational EMP into her hands.
Detonate that, they can turn any city in the world into a war zone.
So what is it that you're suggesting?
Maybe we find Dom huh?
Well, first let's catch him and then figure out
- why he's turned.
- So you'all want us...
To track Dom.
And I know Roman, I know it's kinda a big job.
- It's impossible.
- Which is why...
I'm bringing in an extra pair of hands.
Ah.
My day just got a whole hell of a lot better.
Mr. Nobody you want to tell me why you just put me in a room with this tin crumpled tin criminal, some bitch.
You got a big mouth for a small head.
Coming from prisoner 6753.
Don't think we've forgotten everything that you've done.
We're not...
teaming up with this guy.
Let's get one thing clear.
I ain't on your team.
I don't care about you, you crew...
Your little family.
I'm here for Cipher.
You here to apply for a job, asshole?
You don't think that tight t-shirt is cutting off the circulation to your brain.
You should get bigger size.
Cipher came to me first.
Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.
When I said no, she went off to my brother.
Oh Yes.
Brother Owen who could forget him?
Former hell-raiser and current guest, at a nasty little black site prison.
Cipher corrupted him left him for dead.
So if I get a shot to take her down, believe me, flicks up, I'm taking it.
You're taking my boot right up your ass.
Guys, guys, guys.
The fastest way to find Cipher is through Toretto.
Now aside fromm myself, there's only two men in the world, that have ever managed to actually track him..
Down with any success.
And guess what.
They're both standing in front of me right now.
So like it or not, you two are gonna work together.
You got that?
I'll take that as a \x22yes.\x22.
Am I the only one seeing this?
Oh, this oughtta be good.
Use God's eye?
We put our lives on the line..
Running around the world trying to figure this thing out.
You can find anybody, right?
Let's use it to find Dom.
Roman, that is a great idea.
Did you hear that?
Great idea.
- And no, no!
No pointing out.
- Mr. Nobody.
Let's find it up.
Got him.
He's in London.
Wait, we have got a 2nd match in Hong Kong.
- And another in Seoul.
- In Tokyo.
And just about every other major city on planet.
And so God's eye is where we start.
Cipher's already created an evasion.
Masked her location by..
Pinging random spots all over the globe.
But it was a good thought Roman.
So she's made my programme obsolete.
And that Ramsey..
- is why are you here.
- See, simple solutions... aren't gonna cut it here slick.
Why are you looking at me when you're saying that?
Wait a second, wait, wait.
Simple solutions might just cut it.
In order for God's eyes to give up all this false pings,
Means they have to be using a free relay.
Watch these two.
Which means it has a decaying sync quantanizer.
Which we can reverse.
And track it back to the originating source and find Dom's true location.
That was my idea.
That's what I was saying, remember?
Alright.
Let's try this.
It's working..
Now you wanna take your manual and start organizing for response...
Let's get a hold of our internatio...
He's still..
Yes, like the first baby.
Yes, we're tracked his location.
We wanna mobilize.
Let's get a hold of a, better.
No one respects you, over.
Get away from me.
Alright they are not in China..
- Or Russia.
- Europe's there.
But this one's not going away.
That's interesting.
What?
Because that's here.
It scrambles your senses.
Don't worry, It'll wear off in an hour.
Probably.
Hello, Deckard.
Nice to see you again.
Look at this, bodies lying in pool Dom.
Your family's already replacing you.
You chose the loosing team.
I guess your brother is smarter than you.
Smart move by putting God's eye into the mainframe.
Irritating to make me have to come all the way down to get it, but.
Nice gun.
Dom!
You're gonna turn your back on family?
Just like that?
Let's go.
You okay?
That wasn't him.
I don't know what she's got on him.
But that wasn't Dom.
- Bryan would know what to do.
- No.
We can't bring Bryan and Mia into this.
We agreed on that.
I know.
Back there was that for her, for me, or you?
Or was it either necessary?
Necessary?
Nothing is necessary.
Everything is a choice.
I simply made one but so did you.
You could have stopped me, but you chose not to do.
I wonder what Letty thought about that.
The problem of putting your foot on a Tiger's neck... is you can never let it up.
I think I need to remind you why you chose to be here.
Dom.
Sorry.
You shoudn't have come.
Now they are going to get me away.
Now she has the three of us.
You wanna see him?
See papa.
Papa.
When I realized I was pregnant.
You had just find out Letty was alive.
So I decided when Letty and you go back from your honeymoon.
I was going to tell you.
And then she took us before I hugged the child.
I call him Michaels.
That's a middle name.
I thought his father should give him first name.
I'm sorry, Dom.
There is nothing to be sorry for.
Whatever happens...
Just save our son.
Your son.
Good visit?
I know.
I know what you're thinking.
I just let the guards go, so there is only two opponents in the room.
Rhodes has the gun, so you'll take him out first, I know you.
And then you're thinking.
Elena is a cop, maybe the two of you can fight your way out of here.
So much to think about.
Let me make it easier for you.
Do with it as you wish.
Have you heard of choice theory Dom?
There's a bunch of accidents, but only two you really need to concern yourself with,
One.
The only person's behavior we can control is our own.
And two, the only thing we can truly give another person is information, so let me give you some.
You see this cameras in here?
The moment you make a move, highly paid men with weapons, will make there way into this room.
With one very specific instruction.
It's not to save me.
It's to kill your son.
And that's a lot of bullets.
And it only takes one for you to loose everything.
So, I have to ask you, because...
I know family is so important to you.
Is that really a choice you wanna make?
Because I'm ready as you are.
I pull this trigger, and God knows I wanna..
I'll kill everyone on this plane...
I still couldn't get in there.
Because you could manipulate this system.
Since I'm alone!
I got no choice!
I don't think so.
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch.
Damn it..
She wiped it off.
Took God's eye.
That was the one thing we could use to find him.
We lost everything.
- Yeah, princess?
- Find him to rail.
I've got couple of minutes to spare.
If you want me to send you to the hospital again.
- Yo Rules!
- First off,
- That's not my name.
- Little nobody.
- Don't call me that.
- Oh that's definitely stinky.
Great do me a favor, and tell your majesty over there, that we're gonna find Toretto.
We find Toretto together as a team.
When this is all over, y'all can have me to slap that whickest biscuit right off his face.
Wait a minute, guys.
I think Decker's actually onto something.
How do you think Dom and Cipher got into the country without us knowing?
- Ghost flights.
- An untraceable aircraft it's all internet conspiracy stuff.
It's not.
Satellites and radar grids...
All across the globe shift.
Like an ocean.
And they've got channels that open and close.
And theoretically, if you know the right people who...
Know the right patterns.
You can fly right through the blind's box... can't be be intercepted.
So you know where Dom is headed?
Yeah, New York.
You see that Elle..
You guys...
are gonna get along just great.
Which proves, rule number two, you never lose everything.
Fire up the chopper.
Guys, have a bowl and a Big Apple.
Why are we driving like this again?
Because Dom took God's Eye, so we need to stay off the grid.
But like this?
Hey.
So before I have to open my mouth...
Let me ask you man, what are we doing here?
That's a good question, Roman.
Let me show you.
Welcome to our new base of operations.
Now seriously, what is this place?
This... is heaven.
The agency garage.
We call it a toy shop.
This is where we have every vehicles seized from drug dealers of East coast.
Now.
Mr nobody said..
If we're gonna have a chance of catching Dom..
We're gonna have to be damn fast.
Maybe this could help.
We got a tank.
750 horsepower.
6.6 liter V8 Duramax engine.
With the M153 probe remotely operated weapon station on top.
You didn't get this from drug dealers.
No.
No that...
T96 army weaponry.
See the army developing machines like this the soldiers could drive from a mile way so they can stay safe.
And alive.
But luckily..
There is a back up driver seat for those of us who like to get war..
Hands on.
I'm sitting there alone the whole time when this thing feeling badly and she's getting fat.
No one is getting hands on it.
She doesn't go on some streets.
I'm in love.
Again?
No.
No...
That's a million dollar show car.
The point is to not draw attention.
It's reverse psychology.
Dom will never see it coming.
It's neon orange,
The international space station would see it coming.
Go choose anything less inspeculous.
No no.
This is ridiculous.
Hey my man, you can put that down right there.
This is a gift.
A real gift.
I know what you're doing.
I like your beard.
You're blanta.
Black santa?
You know I'm serious.
Put it down right here..
What are you doing?
Engine mis-firing, I gotta check it out.
No.
That's not part of the plan, Dom.
Clearly..
But unless you want the engine to cease on the job,
You got five minutes.
I want another visual.
I got an ATM
I don't like this.
I want to see Toretto.
There are no more cameras.
Then find something.
Punch in on something reflective A car mirror, anything..
- You know who I am?
- That's why I'm here.
You know what I'm capable of.
It's why I'm here.
I'll give you until I finish my cup up.
And I'm.. thirsty.
I'm not here to waste your time.
Oh no.
No, you've already taken everything I have of value, Mr. Toretto,
What more could you possibly want?
To give you something back.
Talk to me.
Something's not right here.
First time I saw my son...
It's behind a bulletproof glass.
When he reached me, I couldn't hold on.
It's the worst pain I ever felt..
I know you know exactly how it feels.
Maybe we could change that..
When I warned you, I think, you are about to suggest something really dodgy Mr Toretto.
It's why I'm here.
Just punch in on something, I'm not liking this.
Something is not right.
- Rhodes, you close?
- Yeah.
- Good girl.
- The delivery truck's moving.
Captain Deckard Shaw, distinguished himself by acts of gallantry at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.
His bold actions saved the lives of hostages and his team mates.
Recommendation:
Victoria Cross.
Highest honor the British Government has ever given.
To a traitor.
Some about this old memory just doesn't add up to me.
Then don't do the same kind of funny math,
It says a DSS agent who has a soul to stop a valid stolen EMP.
Sound familiar huh?
Wanna give me a hand?
- On three?
- Yeah.
One two.. easy.
You know, you can tell this in another letter..
But maybe we could've caused some serious damage.
- Yes, we could.
- Yeah.
Shame I'd have to punch you, head of defend, when this is all over.
Ah well.
With all due respect, Captain,
When this whole thing is over we're gonna find a location and I'm gonna knock your teeth so far down your throat.
You're gonna stick a toothbrush right up in your toothbrush shelf.
Get me God's eyes.
- God's eye active.
- Thanks.
Let's find us some Russian.
That spy is my little lie...
Minister of defense.
We land back in Moscow by nine.
Here's the latest defense report, All the items in yesterday's meet.
Upload this coordinates to Dom's nav.
Copy that.
He's in the third car.
That's a guard class limousine.
Where's my team?
- Where's his team?
- There's no sign of 'em yet.
They are off the grid.
Probably just bunker down somewhere.
Closing in on him.
You guys ready?
One thing I can guarantee you Dom.
No one's ready for this.
I want every with chip with the exploits in a two mile radius around that motorcade now.
There's over a thousands of them.
Hack 'em all.
It's zombie time.
I'd buckle up if I were you.
AUTO-DRIVE ACTIVATED.
Sorry.
Target the motorcade.
And here they come.
What is going on?
Ouch.
Drive fast!
Police escort down..
Take out the lead and follow cars.
Drive!
Drive!
Two more down.
There's more cars ahead of us.
Shoot their engines.
Oh God!
We got locked cars in cyber shock...
Send backup!
Send S.W.A.T!
And take yourself a goddamn boy scout...
- Just send us some help!
- Now that's Dom.
Faster, faster!
The motorcade has turned on 7th.
Perfect.
Make it rain.
Target immobilized.
Your turn.
- Who the hell is that?
- What is he doing?
What the hell are you waiting for?
Shoot him!
Come on, come on!
I'm out.
Shit.
Don't worry sir.
This car is bulletproof.
You'll be safe in here.
- Give me the case.
- Give him the case.
These are nuclear launch codes.
We cannot give it to him.
What is he doing now?
He just cut a hole in our gas tank.
Good work, Dom.
Meet you at the pick-up.
I think I know where my team's at.
- Where?
- Right in front of me.
This is on you.
Get out of there, Dom.
Guys, I know why Dom's here.
Police scanners are saying he's stolen Nuclear Football.
It's over, Toretto.
Get your.. out of the door now.
That's how you wanna play this?
Let's play.
Don't do this, Dom.
He's stomped foot.
- What're you doing?
- It's a trap!
Now I know what it feels like be every cop ever chasing us.
I'm gonna get a little close enough.
Oh, so you just gonna take Dom?
Little Nobody has clearly lost his little mind.
I'm on him.
Easy, work together.
- No, no.
- Wait, wait, wait!
Oh shit.
I will take the short cut.
The path!
Watch these people.
Mr. Sexy coming through!
Not this time, Dom.
Stretch him out.
Hold them.
He gotta have about 2000 Horse Power in that thing.
Try 3000..
Try Five.
Get out of there.
I'm working on it.
Stop working on it, and do it..
No, no no...
It's my Bentley.
No!
Take that case and run!
Move!
They thought...
this was gonna be a streetfight.
You can wait for it Torretto.
No!
Letty, stop!
What are you gonna do?
I don't know why you're doing this, but I know one thing.
You love me.
And you're not gonna to shoot me.
You should've given him the case, cause I won't chase you.
Okay.
I will just take it from a dead girl.
You willing to die for it?
Let's go then.
Anything?
They're gone.
And D.O.D confirmed it was a nuclear football.
He's got an EMP and nuclear launch codes.
I don't know what it is, but they're building towards something.
Deckard?
He didn't make it.
I'm disappointed in you, Dom.
You'd have Letty just walk away with the codes.
- You've got the codes!
- Rhodes got the codes.
You made the choice to let her go.
And now I have to make one on my own.
They are adorable little things, aren't they?
I hope I don't hurt him.
Look, Cipher, I did exactly what you asked me to do.
Don't do this.
- This is your doing.
- My doing?
Please don't hurt him.
I'm begging you.
I don't want you to beg.
- I want you to learn.
- Learn what?
I understand why you did what you did.
I really do.
But it was the wrong choice.
This is a consequence, Dom.
No!
No!
No...
Wait.
Wait.
Don't you do it!
No!
Can you pull up the footage of the guy in the ally.
- Traffic cams.
- I got you.
I knew it.
I recognize that guy.
That's Connor Rhodes.
I met him when I was working with Shaw's brother.
He wanted us to get the Nightshade device him.
Connor Rhodes.
He's also linked to some who I like to be dead.
Mose Jakande.
Warlord who tried to get God's eye.
Which means that's twice that Dom has messed up Cipher's business.
Everything you're feeling right now, that's rage, sense of loss.
It's not real.
It's the survival instinct wired deep into our brains.
To ensure continuation of species.
When early men went visit a watering hole...
If they didn't watch their child, they get snatched by a crocodile.
Your brains would create a painful but a structural memory.
So it will never happen again.
This idea of family that is so core with you, that rules your world...
It's a biological lie.
You don't have to accept it.
I don't!
Did you really could think you could destroy two of my teams.
Without any repercussions?
I wouldn't have even looked your way..
If you hadn't done that.
You didn't even know you had a kid.
You can thank me for that.
And start doing the job I'm asking you to do.
Help you start a war.
Is that what you think I want.
That's so limited.
I didn't take that football to start a war..
Anymore than I took your son to start a family.
Taking your son got me the codes..
The codes will get me the nukes, and the nukes will get me what I want...
Today, tomorrow...
and every day after that.
What's that?
Accountability.
The second I fire off one of those nukes..
I put the superpowers of this world on notice that when they cross line,
...I'm gonna be there to hold the responsible..
Because the truth is, Dom To the world out there I'm the crocodile at the watering hole.
You've got one last job to do.
Cipher..
If I were you, I would kiss my son.
Because whether you value it or not, all of this...
Your plane, your security and you are still on this earth because of him.
The problem we have with tracking Cipher is there's nothing to trace then.
Now we have trace information.
And we're getting snapshots of this data before it's scrubbed off the net.
How do you erase someone's bank accounts?
Always just...
The Longitude.
Given the fact that Dom hit the Russian Motorcade safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead, bring up the map.
Great, let's start here run the possibilities.
Yalta, Poltava.
Looks like they just threw letters together.
- Konyert.
- It's Vladupi.
What are you doing here?
Thought I was gonna check in on you from time to time,
To see you how you're doing.
By the way, not so hot.
But there's nothing in Vladiven.
It's just ice..
That why...
Could've sworn there was a secret Russian naval base with the retrophilic cold war Submarines.
Well, technically, it's not Russian anymore.
Base was take by a terror grope of military separatists about a month ago.
And the Russians haven't taken it back.
So there is a little window of opportunity.
Russia made submarines, nuclear football, it sounds like everything we do our legs gonna be bombed off.
Sounds like you're still a No. 11 on the list.
It sounds like you've changed since you look funky.
Facial hairs and came in.
Guys... guys.
Hey.
We gotta call this in all the way up the chain.
That's good thinking champ.
Except unfortunately the Russian Minister of Defense.
Got himself involved in little incident on US territory and two governments aren't talking to each other.
By the time they do...
It will be too late.
So, any other suggestions?
Yeah, I got one.
How about we just stop them ourselves?
You're talking about a Russian Military Base.
Separatists.
Whatever.
It's suicide.
It's stopping world war 3.
What's it gonna be rook?
You're gonna close your eyes on this one too?
Pray that the apocalypse doesn't come knocking on your mama's front door?
Or are you're gonna saddle up, be a man and save the entire goddamn world
I know, thank god they read it out.
What's that?
- Rule number three.
- Which is?
There are no rules.
What did I told you, Luke?
I knew he'd get in three.
Areal transport leaves in an hour.
Take whatever vehicle you want.
- All bets are off.
- Bets are off?
See you later...
I got an nuclear attack submarine.
Letty I don't like telling you this one thing, but the game's changed.
Before we were trying just to catch Dom, but now after all of this...
I want you to know, if I have to...
I'm gonna put him down..
Then you might have to take us both down.
This ain't right, man.
This ain't funny.
I come from a different kind of lifestyle.
Ladies know me.
They know where I'm at with.
I try to take a piss, I ain't even recognize myself.
That's entirely too much information.
I'm just saying.
Well, one thing is for sure.
Dom's gotta be either working with them or making a train cause no one will be this insane to hit this place in a damn army.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Speak of the Dom.
Alright, Dom, you're one step closer to that family reunion.
400 meters to base.
Prep the EMP.
Let's take these defenses down.
We have a possible threat incoming.
Raise the barricade, quick.
We've lost power, get to your positions now.
Gates are open.
Let's get this party started.
- EMP's are charging.
- How long?
60 seconds.
Alright, Dom, you've one pulse left in that EMP.
That sub is heavily insulated.
You're gonna need to be right underneath it, or this won't work.
Come on.
Engaging target.
He's beneath the Sub.
I'm loosing control, mayday, mayday.
Yes, two birds with one stone.
We've got control of the sub.
Dom, we are good.
Head over to the Rendezvous.
Ok Matty Let's take this baby for a spin.
Damn!
I think Cipher just rebooted Sub's command system.
What the hell is he talking about?
In terms...
She just carjacked a submarine.
We can't let it get away.
That's the control room.
If you can get me into that row house
I can tap with network and counter hack Cipher.
Keep it from flowing into water.
No, what we need to do is get me on that sub.
I find the weapon's room and I can pull the lunch chip before she can fire any of those nukes.
That is too crazy.
- Just think it's too dangerous.
- We'll do both.
Knock, knock!
Five vehicles just reached the base.
They just don't give up, do they..
Come on, let's move, team.
Double time, double time.
Letty, let's go.
Change of plans, Dom.
I'm sending you the co-ordinates, head there immediately.
- I'm done.
I want my son.
- I'll tell you when you're done.
Your team is in play, now leave road and follow my instruction.
Go!
Go!
Move, move!
Get out of here, go go!
Ok, how do you like this?
- Remote link has been separated.
- I'll take care of this.
Hi Ramsey.
She's regaining control.
I mean she's good.
They are entering the Weapon's stream.
Oh that's cute.
Go, pull pull!
Roman, guard by the chip, c'mon.
Oh she's sick.
Gonna have to do better in that way.
Ok, now you're starting to piss me off.
Ramsey, how much time we talking to you?
You're smart, but no smart enough.
She's locked me out.
Tej, I can't stop.
Now you're gonna have to pull that chip.
I can't.
This thing's going into attack mode.
The door's not gonna open until you pull the chip.
Tej we got no idea what the hell we are looking for.
I got it.
What in the hell are you guys doing?
It wasn't me, okay?
It will be labeled Guardians Go.
- Ok.
I got something.
- What?
It says haha.. slack slack back ...smoke, dear jack na jack.
Do you understand that?
Oh yeah, that's sick.
Quite a show.
Arming the nuke..
Nuke's going hot, she's trying to fire this thing.
- Roger that, we're moving out.
- Disable that chip, now.
Roman, what are you seeing?
- Come on, Talk to me.
- I don't see shit.
I'm holding on.
Now we're on countdown.
What the hell is going on man?
We are about to launch a nuclear missile, what the hell is going on.
Pull the damn chip.
Countdown.
Countdown.
Look for a countdown.
What countdown?
The missile needs to activate for launch.
The countdown timer won't be in Russian.
Countdown.
Show 'em what we could.
No.
No.
No.
Press that.
I got it.
Something is wrong.
It won't launch.
Get that sub out of there.
Now!
Roman.
You alright?
There's nothing alright about any of this.
Let's go.
What about the missiles?
We got the chip, no nukes for her.
Well done.
Let's go.
Guys we got company.
A lot of company.
Alright team, here is the plan.
There is a Sea lock at the opening of the bay,
We get there first, and close it, we can stop the submarine from escaping into open water.
And disappearing forever.
I've got the location.
It's 10 miles south west.
10 miles?
Like I make it in 10 seconds.
What's the matter Roman, you forgot the snow time?
Loving that Lambo now?
Alright everyone, hold you over that launch trip later.
Right now I want that sub, beneath water, where no one can find it.
Find me the fastest route out of that bay.
Copy that.
Why are they shooting at me?
I think off you're in that orange Lamborghini I don't know.
Shut up Tez.
Go on.
Do you really wanna put that car in gear?
Do you?
I don't think so.
They're heading for the sea lock.
They're trying to trap the sub in a bay.
I should have taken care of this a long time ago.
Rhodes, check his team out.
I'm on it.
Roman, get in front of me.
Ok, y'all wanna play it rough?
Now it's my turn.
Yeah, baby!
Guys, we got snow mobile on the right.
They're going to flank us.
All there?
Oh shit!
Tej!
Roman hold tight.
I'm on the way.
I don't wanted no swimming.
No!
Really Tez?
No.
No.
No.
Oh shit.
Roman, grab your door.
Tez!
Grab the door Roman.
It's all gone.
Oh Shit.
Roman, hang on.
Tej!
No, man.
Get me off this thing.
No!
Alright, I've had enough of this shit!
Number 11 my Ass.
Don't shrink it.
We got a sub to catch, get in.
What?
Pressure is on alert in the cargo hold.
Drop it to 10 thousand feet.
I know what these people meant to you.
So I'll let you pick the first target.
I'm not picking target from a mile away.
I'd stand face to face, and look 'em dead in the eye.
Ok.
That would wipe in the ass.
I'm enjoing the remains.
You don't go get any ideas.
You aren't placed out of a good history.
No shit.
Let's go start fight.
She's gonna kill himself.
Pull up surveillance, right now.
Surprise.
Pierce must be dead.
You're driving.
I said it from the beginning.
No way, I'm not driving.
We have a security breach in the cargo foil.
Take care of it now.
Jesus Mum, you should pose to avoid the nerves.
Oh, shut up, don't be such a baby.
Get to the pilot, he's got the second key.
Wait for my signal.
Give Cipher my regards.
He gave this, this day, thinking out.
No, don't touch.
You can track Cipher with this, but you can't do this on your own.
There's gotta be two of you.
Fine, I got contacts.
Now you're gonna take your brother.
- No.
- Yes.
Do I don't know where he is...?
His copy's fake, I can see everything inside his..
- It's called the God's eyes.
- Yeah, well.
Whatever.
There's no way I'm using Owen, alright?
He's a lost cause.
He's your brother, Deck.
He's my son.
He's our family.
And our family that died...
Bloody shit happening.
You lied about, I mean, I can't believe you.
You've got me upset, you really upset your mother.
Call yourself a brother?
Oh come on, mum.
Ok.
Every time!
- Owen.
- In position.
Go.
I'm in.
I've got the package to lay on.
It's all personal.
You made me miss my son?
What do you think you're doing?
Looking at you dead in the eye.
That was for Letty.
- Rhodes.
- He is no longer with us.
Rhodes picked the wrong target.
Congratulations Dom.
You just killed your son.
You are wrong.
I just saved him.
Need to took your foot off the tiger's neck.
You're welcome.
It's gonna get noisy.
This is for your relief.
Good?
Let's go.
Go stop him, do not let him get off this plane.
That truck's had enough munition to take us all out.
We don't give 'em a target.
Everybody get in front of us, line up
- we will take the hit.
- What?
I need to switch cars, right now.
- Roman, here comes the bad part.
- What?
Hang in there guys!
We're almost through the lock.
It's easy for you to say, when your ass ain't on fire.
Hold on little mate.
It's gonna be a little scary,
It's gonna be a lot of fun.
Is the music good?
They're locking on.
Sorry guys, I got no trick for us..
- What do we do now?
- We start praying.
Hell yeah!
That's Dom!
- This guy in our side now?
- Who the hell cares?
He just saved our asses.
Good to be riding with you again man.
Torretto's through the way for them.
Someone give me something.
- Torpedoes are ready.
- Then launch them.
- Take the wheel.
- I ain't taking shit.
- Take the wheel!
- Where are you doing?
This is crazy!
- Left or die!
- What?
Turn the goddamn wheel to the left, really requesting.
Boom, baby!
That's alright!
Thank you the same.
Where is that smile?
There is!
You're gonna shoot a baby You shoud...
You aren't gonna wanna see this?
Is that you or him?
Him.
Good.
The torpedo's missed, they are gonna reach lot before the sub does.
To hell they are.
Get ready for this.
Oh shit!
We're going to need a bigger truck.
- Get us out of here.
- Why are you always yelling?
- This shit's crazy!
- Look out!
That's not good.
That's not good.
We got this.
That's my girl.
Sub's too close.
We ain't making it to the gate in time.
We just gonna let it get away?
Not if I know Dom.
You loose.
Dom.
I destroyed two of your teams
I killed your red headed boyfriend.
And I put two killers on you untraceable plane.
You lost the minute you interrupted my honeymoon.
Put a heat-seeker on him now.
Now!
There is a goddamn heat seeker coming at us.
Oh my...
come and get it.
Guys!
Dive..
This...
This is for my son!
Dom!
You aren't pulling this Deckard.
Like I'm need a gun to take care of you,
How did you find me?
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch!
Resourceful.
It belonged to us before Cipher.
You pulled my family through.
A mother.
I'll make sure that never happens again.
To anyone.
There is only one flaw in your plan.
What's that?
Only one of us has a parachute!
Told you this would be fun!
Boys!
You know I've never left you, right?
I know.
You know I never will..
I know.
I've so much to tell you.
Yeah you do, and you can start with that.
Now, that's...
Dominic Toretto.
Hey Dom!
You're just towing it out there?
We need to get up out of here.
Cause this all kinda neuclearism happening under this ice.
Relax!
Without the trigger chips, those nukes are harmless.
Ok.
So we good then.
Lemme go and get my young selfie levels up.
You realize this is a classified, right?
Not today.
We have to get up out of here man.
I'm freezing.
It's Okay.
Don't worry, he's gonna be here soon.
I get it, y'all got a lot in common.
Computer hacks, god's eyes, gigs, nerd.
..you know, but we got a lot in common too!
Alright?
- Like what?
- We walk in the room, and we are oozing sex appeal.
Me and you?
There's a problem.
I am asking the real question right now.
Is it gonna be... the Nerd or...
the dark knight?
This time I like both of you.
A'rigt!
Yeah..yea!
But just before we get into all of that,
Let me ask you one question.
- You can ask me anything.
- Anything.
What's my last name?
When you guys pick around with then I guess you can let me know.
It's gonna be a Parker.
That's all that really matters.
Jones, Miss Parker.
Hey Miss Parker.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I wanted to thank you.
No need.
Cipher's still on the loose.
There's been some reports she's in Athens.
But she won't be nuking any city anytime.
So, thanks to you guys.
- So, I got you a parting favor.
- This can't be...
Full re-instatement.
You got you job back.
That is if you want.
If I want?
You know after 16 years.
I figured it's time for a little break.
Wow.
Daddy's stayin' home.
- Nobody.
- Get in touch!
Ah, hang on a second.
This could be interesting.
What made you think I would do it?
Brother-hood.
I saw that look in your sight man.
I knew you wanted revenge.
Glad I did it.
Can't believe you went to see my mama.
Come on.
All this fuss of you.
Yes.
Alena, I promise to keep our son safe.
And now.. he always will be.
I want to introduce you to the most important person in my universe.
Who will never give up on me.
You've heard me say.
"That you never turn your back on family."
And I wanna thank you all for never turning your back on me.
You wanna meet them?
Alright!
Everyone...
Meet Bryan.
Hey Bryan.
Yeah, I guess he's my turning secret.
Thank you for giving us family.

(LAUGHTER)
- No way.
- Yeah.
This is the Cuban spirit.
Dom!
Dom!
(ENGINE ROARING, TIRE SQUEALING)
(CHEERING)
Raldo, you said I... (CONTINUES IN SPANISH)
You know I can't make a living without my car.
It's not my problem, bro.
Dominic Toretto, I heard about you.
Welcome to my island.
Why you hooking up my cousin's car?
Cousin's car.
Not anymore.
He needed money.
I gave it to him.
He can't pay.
I take the car.
I-I just need a few more days.
"Few more days" wasn't part of the deal.
Come on.
You make a deal, you gotta live up to it.
You make a deal... you going to live up to it.
"Going to live up to it"?
Oh, so you one of those types.
You take everyone's ride and then ship it back to the States?
You know what I respect?
Money.
You watch your mouth.
(LAUGHS)
Now you got a problem.
I'm gonna keep it about the cars.
- You want a car, get it the right way.
- How?
Race for it.
I already own it, bro.
Not that car.
- Mine.
- (CROWD MURMURING)
FERNANDO:
Dom...
His-his car is the fastest car on the island.
Do you know what he has under that hood?
He knows it doesn't matter what's under a hood.
The only thing that matters is who's behind the wheel.
You think so?
I know so.
Then race his car.
And we ain't racing no quarter-mile here.
We race the Cuban mile.
Done.
(CROWD WHOOPING AND CHEERING)
(FERNANDO SPEAKING SPANISH)
(ENGINE RUMBLING)
Listen, I-I appreciate what you're trying to do, but... my car is the slowest car on the island.
Was.
Pull the seats, the doors, the battery.
If it ain't the motor, take it off.
Laughing gas?
Nah, Fed.
This is Cuban NOS.
(CHUCKLES) You guys are crazy.
- FERNANDO:
What are you doing?
- DOM:

Sorry about your car.
Yours was too slow for a Toretto anyway.
Your Impala?
Are you serious?
(CHEERING)
(POP SONG PLAYING IN SPANISH)
Look at that smile.
I love it when you smile.
You make me happy.
Mmm, I think this place makes you happy.
It's like it speaks to you.
You remember that guy...
the racer and his dad?
The one with the boat engine under the hood?
Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Of course.
I was...
I was looking at them, and I... and I couldn't help but to imagine what you'd be like if you were a dad.
(LAUGHING) No, no, no, no!
I'm not pregnant.
Is that what you want?
It's not about what I want or what you want.
It's about why we haven't asked the question.

What brings you to Cuba?
Same thing that brings everyone else to Cuba.
Culture, people, beauty.
What brings you to Cuba?
Work.
Must be casual Friday.
How's that honeymoon going, Dom?
DOM:
Your fuel relay is missing.
I know.
I love to play games...
beaten the best of 'em... but I'm kind of in a rush, so if you've got something to say to me...
Oh, this is a very different game.
That I can assure you.
This...
There is something much greater at work here.
This is fate.
I choose to make my own fate.
Not today.
Is this the road you take to your apartment every morning?
What else is different, Dom?
Was Santiago's closed?
Did you have to cross two blocks to go get your Cuban coffees?
What is it, black, no sugar?
Yeah.
I put a lot of work into getting you here today.
Well, now that I'm here, what do you want?
I want you to work for me.
Work for you?
Oh, I could have saved you a lot of time, then.
See, I don't work for anyone.
You can't walk away from this, Dom.
We're gonna have this conversation, one way or the other.
You see, that's the funny thing about fate.
It's cunning.
It can bring you beautiful things, and it can also bring you moments like this.
Oh, you're gonna want to work for me.
You're gonna betray your brothers, abandon your code and shatter your family.
You see, your team is about to go up against the only thing they can't handle.
And what's that?
You.
Oh, and, Dom,
I wouldn't mention this to anyone.

I chose you for this squad because you are the most fearsome warriors on the planet.

You go out there, you do your job, and you take 'em down.
Everyone... and I mean everyone...

Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, it's the moms, they come out to support the kids.
Except there seem to be more moms than kids.
Way more moms.
(MURMURING, CHUCKLING)
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
It's a big soccer town.
Let's go, girls!
So, your intel was spot-on.
That Damocles 7 EMP weapon that went missing in the Gulf... arms dealers from the Liberation Front
- have it in Berlin.
- Shit.
This thing can wipe out an entire electrical grid in a major city.
No lights, no power...
instant Stone Age.
Chloe, Maya, you can't let her run by you like that.
- Let's go, let's go!
Cross!
- Agent Hobbs, this is a Class 4 WMD.
Do you have any idea
- what's at stake here?
- That's it.
Go, go, go, go!
Yes, I know exactly what is at stake here, okay?
If the Pink Butterflies beat my Red Dragons, that means we lose the championship...
which means I have 20 little girls who are crying, and that's not a good thing.
Which then means I have to spend a lot of time in ice cream shops and spend a lot of time at Tay Tay concerts.
Tay Tay?
Come...
Taylor Swift.
Gotta be shittin' me.
Get it together, okay?
- Let's go, girls.
- GIRL:
Go, go, go!
We need you to do this.
It's a lot of lives at stake.
- All right, but I need to be clear here.
- Ah, ah!
The U.S. government cannot sanction this operation in any way.
- You're on your own.
- Hey...
This thing goes sideways, you don't just get burned, you go to prison.
And there's nothing we can do to get you out.
Let me tell you something.
The only thing that I love more than saving lives is my daughter.
So, if you don't shut up with this government bullshit right now and start showing some team spirit and respect for the Red Dragons,
I'm gonna have all 20 of them line up and kick you right in the tay-tay.
Go, Dragons.
Say it again.
- Go, Dragons!
- Attaboy.
Go, Dragons.
Go, Dragons.
Go.
She's open!
- Go, go!
Yes!
- (CROWD CHEERING)
- (LAUGHS) - (WHISTLE BLOWS)
That is my daughter right there.
Yes.
(CHUCKLES) Yes, come here.
- How did I do?
- HOBBS:
Awesome.
Nice job, kid.
- (HOBBS SIGHS)
- Daddy's gotta go to work?
Uh, yeah.
Daddy's gotta go to work.
Now, you're gonna need to get a team you can trust.
Oh, I already got one.
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)
(SIGHS)
- HOBBS:
Hey, Dom.
- Hey, Hobbs.
I got a job in Berlin, and I need a favor, brother.
No problem.
I'll grab the team and meet you in Berlin.
Thanks, man.
I'll see you soon.
(EXPLOSIONS)
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)
You were only supposed to create a diversion, Roman.
That was a diversion!
How many of the damn explosives did you use?
I don't know, Tej.
All of it?
- Wait, all of it?
- Roman, Jesus Christ.
You got more of your fan club ahead.
(TIRES SQUEALING)
(RAPID GUNFIRE)
They're still on us.
These guys are taking this personal.
Roman, we just blew up their facility and stole their EMP.
Other than your doctor's cold finger,
I'd say it's about as personal as it can get.
Phase two.
Phase two?
So, you just gonna keep that to yourself?
What happened to phase one?
What about that part?
Yeah.
Remember the airplane?
Everyone drove their cars out but you?
I told you my engine seized up.
It's your balls that seized up.
Just follow my lead, okay?
And, Roman, whatever you do... don't think.
What?
Tej, drop it.
Bombs away.
Split now.
Holy...!
(SHOUTS IN GERMAN)
ROMAN:
Great plan, Tej.
But just so you know, you missed some.
Oh, just wait for it.

Oh, shit!

Got your ass.
You good?
I'll see you when it's done.
All right, great job, team.

It ain't too late to stop this.
- It is now.
- (CAR DOOR CLOSES)
- (SIRENS BLARING) - (TIRES SCREECH)
That sumbitch just crossed us.
- What?
- TEJ:
Wait a second.
What are you talking about?
Dom took the EMP.
Bullshit.
Where are you?
HOBBS:
It's too late for me.
Get out of here.
He wrecked my truck and he took it.
I saw that look in his eye, and I've seen that look before.
Dominic Toretto just went rogue.
(SIRENS BLARING)
(SIRENS BLARING)
(ALARM BUZZING)
TEJ:
All right, I got his phone records, y'all.
It's a whole bunch of calls to untraceable numbers.
ROMAN:
Burner phones, right?
TEJ:
Nah.
Scrambler.
Same number, but they got some sort of micro-router to bury the signal path, which means Dom is clearly communicating with somebody that's above our pay grade.
Look, I don't know Dom as well as you, but if we just look at the facts...
Dom's been having highly encrypted conversations with some mysterious person.
He took out Hobbs.
He stole an EMP.
Now he's disappeared.
So, what are you saying?
RAMSEY:
Maybe we should consider the fact that Hobbs is right.
Dom did go rogue.
(CAR DOOR SLAMS)
ROMAN:
Letty.
We're all in this trying to figure it out, okay?
We're on the side.
You sure about that, Roman?
Before you judge the man, remember, you're breathing right now because he saved your life.
You just gonna let her bump your shoulder like that?
I'm-I'm just saying, that...
that was a little aggressive.
What you gonna do, e-mail her?
(SIGHS)
Check.
(BUZZER SOUNDS)
Moment, will you, fellas?
Thank you.
Well, this is an exciting new look.
It's a little tight in the crotch, as always.
(MR. NOBODY CHUCKLES)
What boy-band bus did she fall out of?
It's my new junior associate.
He's working with me on this.
- All yours.
- Agent Hobbs,
Mr. Nobody and I have been given the authority to get you out of this.
All you have to do is agree to the terms, and you're free.
What's Training Wheels talking about?
What terms?
Confess to your crimes in Berlin.
Treason, international espionage, massive destruction of civic property.
You do that, we close the case.
- And?
- And the DSS blacklists you.
- Germany loves that.
- Officially,
- you will be a criminal.
- Wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You need to work on your delivery, all right?
Unofficially... you're off the books.
You come work with me.
I'm not a criminal.
MR. NOBODY:
Luke, come on.
Labels.
There is no confession.
There are no backroom deals.
Got myself into this, I'm gonna get myself out of it.
- You know that.
- I do, and that's what I told him.
Well, there you have it.
Good luck in the courts, man.
What about your daughter?
You know, if you're not gonna do it for your country, at least do it for your kid.
(CHUCKLING) Big mistake, kid.
(GRUNTING)
Hold on.
Look, Luke.
He's still working from the manual.
I mean, he doesn't even really know the rules.
Now, come on, give him a break.
(STRAINED) Give me a break.
Luke.
(GRUNTS, GROANS)
- Appreciate it.
- (COUGHING)

Lawman gone bad, huh?
Such a cliché.
Oh, well, welcome to the club.
I wouldn't get that twisted, son.
We ain't in no club.
We got nothing in common.
And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.
So why don't you get your candy-ass back out there and toss some more salads, boy.
What, you bring a shovel, did you?
Because it's 38 feet of steel and concrete.
Or so I've been told.
(DECKARD CHUCKLING)
Better get to digging.
You wanker.
Yeah.
Move.
Say that again.
If I say it again, it'll be to a corpse.
(CHUCKLES)
I'm going to enjoy this.
WOMAN:
Welcome back, Dom.
Nice job out there.
You excited about tonight?
You're going on this?
You're with me, Dom.
I am impressed.
That job went down exactly like we planned.
It is something to watch somebody at the top of their game.
It must've been a real thrill from 30,000 feet.
Oh, come on, there has to be a small part in you that enjoyed what you just did back there.
No?
Hmm?
Showing me your shoe collection?
Yep.
A pair for every occasion.
You have enough guns in here to outfit a small army, huh?
This?
Oh, this is just the tip of the iceberg.
You know what I like about you, Dom?
You're a genuine outlaw.
I mean, you're a man who lives by his own rules.
Which is surprising because, when I saw you in Cuba,
I heard about a guy who almost killed you with a motorcycle, and you let him keep his car?
Oh, that confused you?
Hmm.
Of course I could have taken his car.
Of course I could have beaten him down.
But it's about something bigger.
This way...
I changed him.
That's not your responsibility.
But it's who I am.
Let me ask you something, Dom.
What's the best thing in your life?
Family.
No, it's not.
Not if you're being honest.
It's the ten seconds between start and finish when you're not thinking about anything.
No family.
No obligations.
Just you... that engine... that open road... being free.
I gotta tell you, this whole saving-the-world,
Robin Hood nonsense you've been doing recently... it's bullshit.
It's not you.
Be who you are.
Why live only a quarter mile at a time when you can live your whole life that way?
(PANTING, GRUNTING)
Is that it?
Is that all those bloated-out muscles will give you?
All show and no go.
(GRUNTS)
(GRUNTS)
(GRUNTING)
Oh, I got plenty of go.
Yeah?
You must have misplaced that when I kicked your arse up and down that office of yours.
Yeah.
Just like you Brits...
rewriting history, huh?
All I know is it wasn't me that was thrown out of a four-story window.
Jumped.
I jumped out of a four-story window saving my partner's life.
'Cause where I'm from, we don't settle fights by throwing bombs.
Well, that's funny, because where I'm from, we don't need women to run to our rescue.
- (KNUCKLES CRACKING)
- I mean, do you really believe you can stand in front of me and beat me in a straight-up, old-fashioned fistfight?
Let me tell you something.
Me and you, one on one, no one else around...
I will beat your ass like a Cherokee drum.
Maybe one day we'll find out.
Oh, you better hope that day never comes.
(BUZZER SOUNDS)
I said no, Mr. Nobody.
I'm not leaving this cell.
I'll get out my way.
(ALARM WHOOPING)
The right way!
Hey!
Why is the door open?
Get back in your cell!

It's just a malfunction.

Toretto?
(CHUCKLING) It's interesting you ask.
This is my new base.
Welcome to nowhere.
It's a little sterile for you.
(CHUCKLES) Listen, there's something
I want to talk to you about after.
Hey, listen, guys, thanks...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
Handcuffs?
What is this?
It's called abuse of power.
You told me to round them up.
I didn't tell you to hand...
Cut 'em loose.
Oh, man.
(CHUCKLING) This is embarrassing.
I'm sorry, guys.
Really, I...
So, this is how you treat old friends?
TEJ:
Friends?
We don't even really know
- who the hell this guy is.
- Doesn't matter who I am, Tej.
- I'm, like, nobody, okay?
- Nobody.
So, then, who is he?
Him?
He's nothing.
He's, like, less than me.
Tej, trust me, brother, that's a maze you don't want to get lost in.
Clearly, we're getting nowhere with nobody.
I've been in here for four hours, and my ribs are showing.
I don't know about y'all, but I'm out.
- I wouldn't recommend that.
- What?
Well, thanks to your botched Berlin job, you all made Interpol's top ten most wanted list.
- Top ten.
- Mm-hmm.
That's all right.
Yeah.
Well, uh...
not you, Roman.
- What do you mean?
- You just missed the cut.
You're number 11, so...
- I...
I missed?
What are you...
- Yeah.
- ROMAN:
That's impossible.
- (CHUCKLING)
What number did they come in at?
Six, eight, nine, ten.
- She's ten?
- Mm-hmm.
She just got here.
That's impossible.
There's no way she's a ten.
Oh, she's definitely a ten.
(CHUCKLES) What?
MR. NOBODY:
How about we focus on someone who we're not gonna find on anybody's list.
We're awaiting hard confirmation, but I believe that's the cyber terrorist known as Cipher.
Wait, no.
Cipher's an organization, not...
not a person.
Not according to our sources.
- What does she want?
- No one knows.
Cipher is like a digital act of God.
They... well, she can manipulate world systems from the shadows...
governments, global markets.
Anything that can be hacked is hers to play with.
And here's the kicker...
you'll never find her linked to any of it.
Her digital identity is scrubbed every few seconds worldwide.
Six years of the intelligence community's coordinated efforts have turned up nothing but this single photo.
So, basically, she's the bogeyman.
Damn, she's... one of the hottest bogeymans I've ever seen.
I mean, if y'all know her, tell her to get at your boy.
- (ROMAN CHUCKLES) - (KICKS CHAIR)
- What are you, 12?
- That was my shin, mother...
Let's just say, people are scared of the hacker group Anonymous.
But even Anonymous won't mess with her.
What the hell does any of this have to do with us?
Probably nothing, Letty, but I do find it interesting that, apparently, for some reason, she's now working with this guy.
(SIGHS)
Do you know why?
Gee, no, Letty, I don't.
He's already delivered a fully operational EMP into her hands.
Detonate that, they can turn any city in the world into a war zone.
So, then, what is it you're suggesting we do?
MR. NOBODY:
Maybe we find Dom, huh?
Well, first, let's catch him and then figure out why he's turned.
And we put a stop to whatever bullshit they got planned.
So, y'all want us to track Dom.
Yeah, I know, Roman, it's kind of a big job.
It's impossible.
Which is why I'm bringing in an extra pair of hands.
(BEEP, BUZZING)
Ah, my day just got a whole hell of a lot better.
Mr. Nobody, you want to tell me why you just put me in a room with this tea and crumpets eating, criminal sumbitch?
What a big mouth on a small head, coming from prisoner 6753.
Don't think we've forgotten everything that you've done.
We are not teaming up with this guy.
Let's get one thing clear...
I ain't on your team.
I don't care about you, your crew or your little family.
- I'm here for Cipher.
- HOBBS:
What are you gonna do, apply for a job?
Head asshole?
You know, I think that tight T-shirt's cutting off the circulation to your brain.
You should get a bigger size.
Cipher came to me first.
Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.
When I said no, she went after my brother.
Ah, yes, brother Owen.
Who could forget him, huh?
Former hell-raiser and current guest at a nasty little black-site prison.
Cipher corrupted him and left him for dead.
So, if I get a shot to take her down, believe me, Flex, I'm taking it.
You're taking my boot right up your ass
- is what you're taking.
- Guys, guys, guys, guys.
The fastest way to find Cipher is through Toretto.
Now, aside from myself, there's only two men in the world that have ever managed to actually track him down with any success.
And guess what... they're both standing in front of me right now.
So, like it or not, you two are gonna work together.
You got that?
I'm gonna take that as a yes.
Am I the only one seeing this?
Oh, this ought to be good.
(STAMMERS)
Use God's Eye.
We put our lives on the line, running around the world trying to figure this thing out.
It can find anybody, right?
Let's use it to find Dom.
It's that easy.
Done.
Roman, that is a great idea.
Did you hear that? "Great idea"?
No, no, no, no, no, don't tune it out, huh?
Uh-huh.
Huh.
See, you and this guy, right here.
Stay out of my lane, dude.
It's all me right here, you know what I mean?
It's crazy.
Mr. Nobody, let's fire it up, huh?
- TEJ:
Got him.
He's in London.
- (CHUCKLES)
Yeah.
(COMPUTER BEEPING)
RAMSEY:
Wait.
We've got a second match in Hong Kong.
ROMAN:
Beijing and Seoul.
TEJ:
And Tokyo.
(RAMSEY SIGHS)
RAMSEY:
And just about every other major city
- on the planet.
- MR. NOBODY:
And so...
God's Eye was where we started.
But Cipher's already created an evasion that masks their location by pinging random spots all over the globe, but it was a good thought, Roman.
So, she's made my program obsolete.
And that, Ramsey, is why you're here.
See, simple solutions aren't gonna cut it here, slick.
Why you look at me when you say that?
TEJ:
Wait a second.
Wait, wait.
Simple solutions might just cut it.
You see, in order for God's Eye to give off all these false pings, means they have to be using a FLEA relay.
Watch these two.
Which means it has a decaying sync randomizer.
Which we can reverse...
And track it back to the originating source and find Dom's true location.

It's working.
HOBBS:
Time you want to check your manual and start organizing a force response.
Let's get a hold of our international assets...
He's still green.
Yeah, like fresh baby shit.
Soon as we have Toretto's location, I want to mobilize.
Let's get a hold of a better asshole.
Uh, no one respects you, uh...

All right, they're not in China.

It scrambles your senses.
Don't worry, it will wear off in an hour.
Probably.
Hello, Deckard.
Nice to see you again.
(CIPHER CHUCKLING)
Look at this.
Body's not even cold, Dom.
Your family's already replacing you.
You chose the losing team.
I guess your brother is smarter than you.
(COUGHING, GROANING)
(TEAM CONTINUES GROANING AND COUGHING)
(HIGH-PITCHED RINGING)

Let's go.
(TEAM GROANING)
Dom!
(GROANING AND COUGHING CONTINUE)
You gonna turn your back on family?
Just like that?
Let's go.
(QUIET, DISTANT CHATTER)
You okay?
That wasn't him.
I don't know what she's got on him, but that wasn't Dom.
Brian would know what to do.
No!
We can't bring Brian and Mia into this.
We agreed on that.
ROMAN:
I know.
You saved me.
I'm...
I'm not really sure how to thank you.
No need.
You got a computer I can use?
That I do.
(TALKING LOW, INDISTINCTLY)
Psst, yo.
(QUIETLY) What, man?
You see this?
Like, they really going at it over there.
Must be the accent.
Bro... he ain't got no accent to her.
They're from the same place.
- Uh, yeah, I was...
I was just joking.
- Yeah, okay.
I got the accent.
Exotic.
Exotic?
Barstow?
Ghetto?
Barstow is exotic to her.
(SCOFFS)
DOM:
Back there, was that for her, for me or you?
And was it even necessary?
Necessary?
Nothing is necessary.
Everything is a choice.
And I simply made one, but so did you.
You could have stopped me, but you chose not to.
Wonder what Letty thought about that.
The problem with putting your foot on a tiger's neck is you can never let it up.
I think I need to remind you why you chose to be here.
(GASPS)
Elena.
Dom.
I'm sorry.
You shouldn't have come.
Nothing could have kept me away.
Now she has the three of us.
(BABY COOS)
Do you want to see him?
See Papa?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Come and see Papa.
Papa.
(BABY COOS)
When I realized I was pregnant, you had just found out Letty was alive.
(BABY BABBLING)
So I decided, when Letty and you got back from your honeymoon,
I was going to tell you.
And then she took us before I had the chance.
(COOING)
His name?
I call him Marcos.
But that's his middle name.
I thought his father should give him his first name.
I'm sorry, Dom.
There's nothing to be sorry for.
ELENA:
Whatever happens... just save our son.
Your son.
(MARCOS COOING)
(DOOR OPENS)
(DOOR CLOSES)
CIPHER:
Good visit?
I know.
I know what you're thinking.
I just let the guards go, so there's only two opponents in the room.
Rhodes has the gun, so you'll take him out first.
I know you.
You have the will so you'll find the way.
Once you've got it, you'll take him out.
Maybe even me.
And then you're thinking...
Elena's a cop.
Maybe the two of you can fight your way out of here.
It's so much to think about.
(INHALES DEEPLY)
(EXHALES)
Let me make it easier for you.
Do with it as you wish.
Have you heard of choice theory, Dom?
There is a bunch of axioms, but only two you really need to concern yourself with.
One...
The only person's behavior we can control is our own.
And two...
The only thing we can truly give another person is information.
So let me give you some.
You see these cameras in here?
The moment you make a move, highly paid men with weapons will make their way into this room with one very specific instruction.
It's not to save me.
It's to kill your son.
Now, that's a lot of bullets, and it only takes one for you to lose everything.
So I have to ask you because...
I know family is so important to you.
Is that really a choice you want to make?
Because I'm ready if you are.
If I pull this trigger...
and God knows I want to... if I killed everyone on this plane,
I still couldn't get in there.
'Cause of your two-man fail-safe system.
Since I'm alone!
I got no choice!
I didn't think so.
(ELENA'S BREATHS TREMBLING)
You want to see the old Dom?

(SOBBING)
ELENA: (CRYING) Bitch.
- Don't... don't...
- Sweet dreams.
Please!
Damn it.
She wiped it all.
Took God's Eye.
That was the one thing we could use to find them.
We lost everything.
What you got, princess?
Finding Toretto.
But I got a couple of minutes to spare, if you want me to send you to the hospital... again.
(CHUCKLES) Yo, Rules.
- First off, that's not my name.
- Little Nobody.
- Don't call me that.
- Oh, that's definitely sticking.
Great.
Do me a favor and tell Your Majesty over there that we're gonna find Toretto.
We find Toretto together as a team.
And when all this is said and done, I'll be happy to slap that dick garage right off his face.
RAMSEY:
Wait a minute, guys.
I think Deckard's actually onto something.
How do you think Dom and Cipher got into the country without us knowing?
Ghost flights.
TEJ:
I thought untraceable aircraft was all
- Internet conspiracy stuff.
- MR. NOBODY:
It's not.
Satellites and radar grids all across the globe shift like an ocean.
And they've got channels that open and close.
And theoretically, if you know the right people who know the right patterns...
You can fly right through the blind spots completely undetected.
So, you know where Dom is headed?
(COMPUTER BEEPS)
Yeah.
New York.
(LAUGHING)
You see there, Luke?
What did I tell you?
You guys are gonna get along just great.
Which proves rule number two...
you never lose everything.

ROMAN:
And why are we traveling like this again?
TEJ:
Because Dom took God's Eye.
So we need to stay off the grid.
ROMAN:
But like this?
(SNIFFS, GROANS)
Look here, man.
Before I throw up in my mouth, let me ask you... what are we doing here?
That's a good question, Roman.
Let me show you.
(ENGINES REVIVING)
Welcome to our new base of operations.
No, seriously, what is this place?
TEJ:
This... is heaven.
HOBBS:
It's the agency garage.
They call it the Toy Shop.
This is where we house every vehicle seized from drug dealers on the East Coast.
Now, Mr. Nobody said,
"If we're gonna have a chance at catching Dom... we're gonna have to be damn fast."
Figured this would help.
You got anything American?
What's the matter with you, huh?
Miss America.
What, are you allergic to quality?
This is the most durable British vehicle ever built.
Oops.
I peed in your tea.
- (CLATTERING) - You're gonna fix that.
We got a tank.
750-horsepower, 6.6-liter V-8 Duramax engine with an M153 CROWS remotely operated weapons station on top.
You didn't get this from drug dealers.
LITTLE NOBODY:
No.
No, that, uh... that, the United States Army lent me.
It's a Ripsaw unmanned combat vehicle.
Did you hear something?
See, the Army's developing machines like this that soldiers can drive from a mile away so they can stay safe and alive.
But luckily, there's a backup driver's seat for those of us that like to get more...
hands-on.
I'm sitting there wondering this whole time...
Oh, whoa.
Will this thing feel like valet
- at Cheesecake Factory.
- Whoa.
No one is getting hands-on.
She doesn't go on city streets.
(MOTOR WHIRRING)
Wow.
I'm in love.
LITTLE NOBODY:
Again... no, no.
That's a million-dollar show car.
The point is to not draw attention.
It's reverse psychology.
Dom will never see it coming.
It's neon orange.
The International Space Station would see it coming.
Go choose anything less conspicuous.
No, no, no.
Calipers are my...
This is ridiculous.
- Not happening.
- Hey, my man, you can put that down right there.
This is a gift, a real gift.
I know what you're doing.
(LAUGHS) I like your beard.
You're Blanta.

No, I'm serious.

(ENGINE RUMBLING)
(ENGINE RATTLING)
What are you doing?
Engine's misfiring.
I gotta check it out.
No, that's not part of the plan, Dom.
Clearly.
But unless you want the engine to seize on the job...
You have five minutes.
I want another visual.
I got an ATM.
I don't like this.
(TRUCK BEEPING)
I want to see Toretto.
- There are no more cameras.
- Then find something.
Punch in on something reflective.
A car mirror, anything.
WOMAN:
Do you know who I am?
It's why I'm here.
Do you know what I'm capable of?
It's why I'm here.
I'll give you until I finish me cuppa.
And I'm fucking thirsty.
I've got limited time, so I won't take up too much of yours.
Oh, no.
No, you've already taken everything I have of value, Mr. Toretto.
What more could you possibly want?
To give you something back.
Talk to me.
Something is not right here.
First time I saw my son was behind a bulletproof glass.
When he heard my voice...
I could see in his eyes he knew I was his father.
When he reached for me,
I couldn't hold him.
It's the worst pain I ever felt.
I know you know exactly how that feels.
Maybe we could change that.
And, now, why do I think you're about to suggest something really dodgy, Mr. Toretto?
It's why I'm here.
CIPHER:
Jesus, punch in on something.
I'm not liking this.
Something's not right.

(SIGHS)
Can you pull up the footage from the guy in the alley?
Traffic cams.
I got you.
I knew it.
I recognize that guy.
That's Connor Rhodes.
I met him when I was working with Shaw's brother.
He wanted us to get the Nightshade device for him.
He must've been working with that bitch the whole time.
Connor Rhodes.
He's also linked to somebody I'd quite like to forget.
Mose Jakande.
Warlord who tried to get God's Eye.
Which means that's twice that Dom has messed up Cipher's business.
Everything you're feeling right now... this rage, this sense of loss...
it's not real.
It's an adaptive, evolutionary response.
It's a survival instinct wired deep into our brains to ensure continuation of the species.
When early man would visit a watering hole, if they didn't watch their child and it got snatched by a crocodile... our brains would create a painful but instructional memory so it would never happen again.
This idea of family that is so core with you, that rules your world, it's a biological lie.
You don't have to accept it.
I don't.
Did you really think you could destroy two of my teams without any repercussions?
I wouldn't have even looked your way if you hadn't done that.
You didn't even know you had a kid.
You can thank me for that and start doing the job I'm asking you to do.
Help you start a war.
Is that what you think I want?
That's so limited.
I didn't take that football to start a war any more than I took your son to start a family.
Taking your son got me the codes.
The codes will get me the nukes, and the nukes will get me what I want today, tomorrow and every day after that.
And what's that?
Accountability.
The second I fire off one of those nukes,
I put the superpowers of this world on notice that when they cross the line,
I'm gonna be there to hold them responsible.
Because the truth is, Dom, to the world out there...
I am the crocodile at the watering hole.
We've got one last job to do.
I have known one thing about you, Cipher.
Behind those contacts, your eyes are brown.
Beneath that dye, your hair is black.
There was probably beauty inside you once, but somehow you let it all die away.
You're so wrapped up in being a mystery, you don't know who the hell you are anymore.
You're lost... you're alone... and you're scared.
If I were you, I'd kiss my son.
Because, whether you value it or not, all of this... your plane, your security and you... are still on this Earth because of him.
RAMSEY:
The problem we've had with tracking Cipher is there's nothing to trace.
But now we have Rhodes' information.
TEJ:
And we're getting snapshots of his data before it's scrubbed off the Net.
ROMAN:
That look like somebody's bank account, so why don't we just go ahead...
HOBBS:
It's a longitude.
Given the fact that Dom hit a Russian motorcade, safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead and bring up the map.
Good.
Let's start here and run the possibilities.
Yalta, Poltava...
It's like they just threw letters together.
- Kronyurt...
- MR. NOBODY:
It's Vladovin.
What are you doing here?
What?
Told you I was gonna check in on you from time to time to see how you were doing.
By the way, not so hot.
But there's nothing in Vladovin.
- It's just ice.
- MR. NOBODY:
That's funny.
Could've sworn there was a secret Russian naval base where they retrofitted Cold War submarines.
Well, technically, it's not Russian anymore.
Base was taken over by a terror group of military separatists about a month ago, and the Russians haven't taken it back yet, so there is a little window of opportunity here.

Russian submarines.

LITTLE NOBODY:
Guys, guys.
Hey, we gotta call this in.
All the way up the chain.
That's good thinking, champ, except, unfortunately, the Russian Minister of Defense got himself involved in a little incident on U.S. territory and... two governments aren't talking to each other for a while.
By the time they do, it'll be too late.
So, any other suggestions?
HOBBS:
Yeah.
I got one.
How about we just stop 'em ourselves?
You're talking about a Russian military base.
- Separatist.
- Whatever.
It's suicide.
It's stopping World War Three.
What's it gonna be, rook?
You gonna close your eyes on this one, too?
Pray that the apocalypse doesn't come knocking on your mama's front door?
Or you gonna saddle up, be a man and save the entire goddamn world?
You know, I think I figured it out.
What's that?
Rule number three.
Which is?
There are no rules.
MR. NOBODY:
What'd I tell you, Luke?
I knew he'd get it in three.

Letty, I don't like telling you this one bit, but the game's changed.
Before, we were just trying to catch Dom, but now, after all this,
I want you to know, if I have to,
I'm gonna put him down.
Then you might have to take us both down.

This ain't for me.

Man, that's entirely too much information.
I'm just saying.
Well, one thing's for sure.
Dom's gotta be either working with them or making a trade, because no one would be this insane to hit this place without a damn army.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

That sub is heavily insulated.
You're gonna need to be right underneath it for this thing to work.

We've got control of the sub.
Dom, we are good.
Head over to the rendezvous.
Okay, Matty... let's take this baby for a spin.
(WHIRRING)
TEJ:
Damn.
I think Cipher just rebooted that sub to slave its command system.
What the hell is he talking about?
In layman's terms, she just carjacked a submarine.
We can't let it get away.
There's the control room.
If you can get me into that wheelhouse,
I can tap the network and counter-hack Cipher.
Keep it from lowering into the water.
No, what we need to do is get me on that sub.
I find the weapons room, and I can pull the launch chip before she can fire any of those nukes.
- That is too crazy.
- What you're saying is too dangerous.
We'll do both.
Knock, knock.

No, no, no, don't press that!

It won't launch.

Everybody out on the ice.
Guys, we got company.
A lot of company.
All right, team, here's the plan.
There's a sea lock at the opening of the bay.
We get there first and close it, we can stop the submarine from escaping into open water and disappearing forever.
(RAPID BEEPING)

I've got the location.
It's ten miles southwest.

We're not gonna make it ten seconds!

We'll deal with that launch chip later.
Right now I want that sub in deep water where no one can find it.
Find me the fastest route out of that bay.
Copy that.
Why are they shooting at me?
!
Maybe 'cause you're in an orange Lamborghini.
I don't know.
Shut up, Tej!
CIPHER:
Dom, do you really want to put that car in gear?
(GUN COCKS)
Do it, huh?
- I didn't think so.
- They're heading for the sea lock.
They're trying to trap the sub in the bay.
I should have taken care of this a long time ago.

He gave us this little thing here.
No, no, no, no.
Don't touch.
You can track Cipher with this, but you can't do this on your own.
It's gotta be two of you.
Fine.
I've got contacts.
No, you're gonna take your brother.

There's no way I'm using Owen, all right?
He's a lost cause.
He's your brother, Decks.
He's my son.
He's our family.

(SONG FADES)
HAVANA, CUBA
We swap in parts from Ford Plymouths and Cadillac.
My grandfather bought it in 1957.
When he died it passed to my father.
Then my brother and now to me.
Look at this, this is an engine from a boat.
- No way.
- Yeah!
Whatever it takes to keep it running!
This is a cuban spirit.
Your spirit, keep it up.
Never ever lose that.
Dom..
It's your cousin..
He's in trouble, come quickly!
Come on, come on.
Please don't do this, Understand my problem.
You know I can't make living without my car.
Isn't my problem bro.
Dominic Toretto..
I heard about you.
Welcome to my island.
Why he hooking up my cousin's car?
In the morning, I gave it to him..
He can't pay..
I take the car.
I just need a few more days.
Few more days isn't part of the deal.
Come on..
You make a deal you gotta live up to it.
You make a deal You gonna live up to it.
Gonna live up to it?
So you are one of those types..
You take everyone's ride and then ship it back to the states.
You should show your people some respect.
You watch your mouth.
Now you got a problem.
I'm gonna keep it about the cars.
I am really scared.
You want a car?
Get it the right way.
- How?
- Race war.
I already own it, bro.
Not that car.
Mine.
Dom, his car is the fastest car in the Island.
Do you know what he has under the hood?
Do you know, it doesn't matter what's under a hood?
The only thing that matters is who's behind the wheel.
- You think so?
- I know so.
Then race his car.
We ain't racing a quarter mile here.
We race the cuban mile.
Done!
I appreciate you what you're trying to do.
My car is the slowest car on the Island.
Was...!
Pull the seats the doors the battery..
It ain't the motor, take it off.
- Laughing gas?
- Nah, Fed.
This is cuban NOS.
You guys are crazy.
- What are you doing?
- Warm as turbo.
Pull that back in line..
Hold on!
Old trick used to play.
In case of emergencies.
You know that's way too much booze for that engine.
- It's going to be fast.
- It's gonna be a bomb.
Only needs to go a mile.
Are you ready for this, family?
This is Havana!
Be fast!
Be safe!
But don't be last.
Racers ready...?
Go...!
Stop.
That car belongs in the trash bro.
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.
Let's go.
- Go steer.
- Si.
Adios, Toretto.
Ok, buster...
Let's see if this works.
That's impossible..
Look out.
A deal's a deal.
You own my car.
And you earn my respect.
Keep your car.
Your respect is good enough for me.
Yo Cousin.
Sorry 'bout your car,
Your's was too slow for a Torreto anyway.
Your Impala.
Are you serious?
Look at that smile
I love it when you smile.
Make me happy.
I think this place makes you happy.
It's like it speaks to you.
You remember that guy?
The Racer and his dad.
- The one with the boat engine.
- Yeah!
- Yeah.
- Of course.
I was looking at them, and I..
And I couldn't help but too imagine what you'd be like, if you were dad.
No, no, no...
I'm not pregnant.
Is that what you want?
It's not about what I want or what you want..
It's about why we haven't asked the question.
Can I help you with that?
- What?
- You need a hand?
Yeah, I think I do.
Sounds like you're not getting any fuel.
Yeah.
See if we can get some power into it.
What brings you to Cuba?
The same thing that brings everyone else to Cuba.
Culture.
People.
Beauty.
What brings you to Cuba?
- Work!
- Must be casual Friday.
How is that honeymoon going Dom?
Your fuel relay is missing.
I know.
I'd love to play games.
Beaten the bests alone.
I'm kinda in a rush, so if you got something to say...
Oh this is a very different game that I can assure you.
This...?
There is something much greater at work here.
This is fate.
- I choose to make my own fate.
- Not today.
This is the road you take to your apartment every morning.
What else is different, Dom?
The Santiago's closed?
Did you have to cross two blocks to go get your cuban coffee?
So, what is it?
Black, no sugar?
Yeah..
I've put a lot of work into getting you here in today.
Now that I'm here, what do you want?
I want you to work for me.
Work for you?
Well, I could have saved you a lot of time then.
See, I don't work for anyone.
You can't walk away from this Dom.
We're gonna have this conversation one way or the other.
See that's the funny thing about fate.
It's cunning.
It can bring you beautiful things, and it can also bring you moments like this.
I will hear that you want to work for me.
You're gonna betray your brothers, abandon your code, shatter your family.
See, your team..
Is about to go up against the only thing they can't handle.
What's that?
You.
Oh, and Dom, I wouldn't mention this to anyone.
They are gonna be hitting us with everything they've got.
So, we wanna engage with maximum speed.
Neutralize the shooters and then move on to our objective.
There are two things I want you to keep in mind,
Number one,
I choose you for this squad because you are the most fearsome warriors on the planet.
And number two,
You go out there, you do your job.
And you take 'em down.
Everyone...
And I mean everyone..
Manice and pedice at the mall.
Later on today.
I don't wanna play anymore.
Alright, let's go, girls.
Let's go, let's go.
- Final 2 minutes.
- Quite the cheering section.
Oh yeah.
That's moms they come out to sport the kids.
Except there seems to be more moms than kids,
Way more like moms and..
Yeah, it's a big soccer job.
Let's go girls.
So your intel was spot on...
A democly 7 EMP weapon that went missing in the gulf.
Arms dealer from the Liberation front have it in Berlin.
- Shit.
- This thing can wipe out..
An entire electrical grid in a major city.
No lights, no power, instant stone age.
Chloe, Maya...
You can't let her run by you like that.
- Let's go, let's go.
- Hey, Hobbs.
This is a class 4 WMD.
Do you have any idea what's at stake here...?
Yes...!
I know exactly what is at stake here, okay?
If Pink Butterflies beat my Red Dragon that means we lose the championship.
Which means I have 20 little girls who are crying..
And that's not a good thing.
Which then means I have to spend a lot of time in ice cream shops and lot of time in Tay-Tay concerts.
- Tay-Tay?
- Yep?
Taylor Swift.
You gotta be shitting me Get it together.
Let's go girls.
We need you to do this,
Lot of lives are at stake.
I need to be clear here.
US Government can not sanction this operation in anyway.
You're on your own.
This thing goes sideways you don't just get burned, you go to prison.
And there's nothing we can do to get you out.
Let me tell you something.
The only thing that I love more than saving lives..
Is my daughter.
So you don't shut up with this government bullshit right now and start showing some team spirit and respect for the Red Dragons.
I'm gonna have all 20 of them lined up kick you right in the Tay-Tay.
Go, Dragons!
Say it again.
- Go, Dragons!
- Good boy.
Go Dragons..
Go Dragons..
Go, he's open...
Go, Yup!
Yes!
That is my daughter right there!
Yes!
Ah, yes, come here.
- Awesome.
- Nice job.
Daddy's gotta go to work?
Oh yeah, daddy's gotta go to work.
Now, you gonna need to get a team that you can trust.
Oh, I already got one.
- Hey, Dom.
- Hey, Hobbs.
We got a job in Berlin, and I need a favor, brother.
No problem.
I grab the team and meet you in Berlin.
Thanks man.
I'll see you soon.
You were only to supposed to create a diversion, Roman.
That was a diversion.
How many of the damn explosives did you use?
I do not know, Tez.
All of it?
- Wait, all of it?
- Roman, Jesus!
- Christ!
- You have more of your fan club ahead.
They're still on us.
These guys are taking this personal.
Roman, we just blown up their facility and stole their EMP.
Other than your doctor's cold fingers,
I'd say it's about as personal as it can get.
- Phase 2.
- Phase 2?
So you just gonna keep that to yourself?
What happen to Phase 1?
What about that part?
Yeah, remember the airplane?
Everyone drove their cars out but you.
I told you my engine seized up.
It's your balls that seized up?
Just follow my lead, okay?
And Roman, whatever you do.
Don't think.
Tez, drop it.
Bomb's away.
Split now!
Holy shit!
Look out...!
- Great plan Tez.
- Just so you know.
You miss some.
I'll just wait for it.
Oh...
Shit!
I hate you, Tez!
Got your ass.
You good?
I'll see you when it's done.
Alright.
Great job, team.
Let's break up and meet me at the safe house.
Hell of a job, brother.
When we can get back to the base.
Beers on me.
You lost your god damn mind, Toretto!
Toretto you put hands on that thing, you're gonna have the whole world coming for you including me.
I don't know what you're doing but you better think about this, Toretto.
It ain't too late to stop this.
It is now.
That some bitch just crossed us..
What?
Wait a second, what are you talking about?
- Dom took the EMP.
- Bullshit.
Where are you?
It's too late for me.
Get out of here.
Saw that look in his eyes.
I've seen that look before.
Dominic Toretto just went rogue.
Alright, I got his phone records, y'all.
It's a whole bunch of calls to untraceable numbers.
Burner phone, right?
Nah.
Scrambled.
Same number but they got some sort of micro-router..
To bury the signal path which means Dom is clearly..
Communicating with somebody that is above our pay grade.
Look, I do not know Dom as well as you, but if we just look at the facts.
Dom's been having highly encrypted conversation with some mysterious person.
He took out Hobbs.
He stole the EMP, now he's disappeared.
So what're you saying?
Maybe we should consider the fact that..
Hobb's right.
Dom did go rogue.
- Letty.
- Before you judge the man,
Remember you're breathing now because he saved your life.
You just gonna let her bump your shoulder like that
I'm just saying it out..
That was a little aggressive.
What're you gonna do.
Email her?
Chick..
No no, wait, fellas.
Thank you.
Well, this is an exciting new look.
That's a little tight on the crotch as always.
What boyband bus did she fallen off?
My new junior associate.
He's working with me on this.
All yours.
Mr Nobody and I have been given the authority to get you out of this.
All you have to do is agree to the terms and you're free.
Restraining wills, talking about, what terms?
Confess to your crimes in Berlin.
Treason, international espionage.
Massive destruction of civic property.
You do that, we close the case.
And?
And the DSS blacklist.
Sure Germany loves that.
Officially you'll be a criminal.
Woah, woah, woah.
You need to work on your delivery alright.
Unofficially.
You're off the books.
Come work with me.
- I'm not a criminal.
- Luke Come on.
Labels.
There is no confession.
There are no back room deals.
Got myself into this, I'm gonna get myself out of it.
You know that.
I do and that's what I told them.
Well, there you have it.
Good luck in the course, man!
What about your daughter?
You know, if you're not gonna do it your country, at least do it for your kid.
Big mistake kid.
Hold on.
Look, look.
He's still working from the manual.
I mean, he doesn't even really know the rules.
Oh come on.
Give him a break.
Get a break.
Luke?
I appreciate that.
- It's good to see you, Nobody.
- You too.
Rule No.1, know your audience.
I gave you your shot, you shit the bed.
Now I'm gonna show you how to get this done.
- You're dead cop!
- Dead!
Well, well, well...
Luke Hobbs behind bars.
Would you look at that?
The band cop got it's day.
You know, that color looks good on you.
Yeah.
Look a whole hell of a lot better with your blood on it.
Yeah.
Good luck with that, Hercules.
Gone bad.
Huh?
Such a cliche.
Ah well.
Welcome to the club.
I wouldn't get that twisted son.
We ain't in no club.
We got nothing in common.
And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.
You bring the shovel did you?
Cause it's 38 feet of steel and concrete.
What's up big dog?
Better get to dig in.
You wanker.
Move..
Say that again.
If I say it again, It will be to acorpse.
I'm going to enjoy this.
Welcome back, Dom.
Nice job out there.
Excited about tonight?
You're going on this?
You're with me Dom.
- Showing me your shoe collection?
- Yup.
A pair for every occasion.
There's enough guns here to outfit a small army.
Huh?
Oh this is just the tip of the iceberg.
You know what I like about you, Dom.
You're a genuine outlaw.
I mean, you're a man who lives by his own rules.
Which was surprising because when I saw you in Cuba, I heard about a guy who almost killed you with a motorcycle and you..
let him keep his car?
- Oh, that confused you?
- Hmm.
Of course I could've taken his car.
But it's about something bigger.
This way...
I changed them.
That's not your responsibility.
- That's who I am.
- Is it?
Let me ask you something Dom, what's the best thing in your life?
- Family.
- No, it's not.
But if you're being honest?
It's the 10 seconds between start and finish, when you're not thinking about anything.
No family, not obligations, just you.
Being free.
I gotta tell you.
This whole saving the world...
Robin Hood nonsense you've been doing recently...
It's bullshit.
It's not you.
Be who you are.
Why live only a quarter mile at a time, when you can live your whole life that way?
See all those blow that muscles will give you.
All show and no..
Well I got plenty of goal.
You must have misplaced that.
When I kicked your ass up in down that office of yours.
Yeah.
Just like you Brits, rewriting History, huh?
All I know.
It was not me who was thrown out of a 4 storey window.
Jumped.
I jumped out of a 4 storey window.
Saving my partner's life.
Because where I'm from, we don't settle fight by throwing bombs.
Well, that's funny, because where I'm from, we don't need women to run to our rescue.
I mean, do you really believe you could stand in front of me?
And beat me in a straight up old fashioned fist fight?
Let me tell you something.
Me and you...
One on one, no one else around.
I will beat your ass like a Cherokee drum.
Maybe one day we will find that out.
Oh, you better hope that day never comes.
I said no, Mr. Nobody.
I'm not leaving this cell.
I'll get out my way.
The right way.
- Get back to your cell.
- It's just a malfunction.
- Get back!
- Just a malfunction.
Don't let him get away.
Hobbs!
I've been waiting a long time for this.
Keep waiting bitch!
Rubber bullets, big mistake.
Ah, took longer than I expected.
- 2 questions.
- Yeah.
- My daughter?
- With your sister.
- Toretto?
- That's interesting you ask.
This is my new base, welcome to Nowhere.
Nice little stair for you.
Listen, It's something I don't wanna talk to you about...
Hey, listen guys.
Thanks..
Whoa, whoa, what handcuff.
What is this?
It's called the abuse of power.
You told me to round 'em up.
I told you that...
hand..
Cut 'em loose.
Oh man, this is embarrassing.
I'm sorry guys, what do I have?
This is how you treat old friends?
Friend?
We don't even really know who the hell this guys is.
It does not matter who I am, Tez I'm like Nobody ok?
Nobody, then who is he?
He's nothing he's like less than me.
Clearly we're getting nowhere, with nobody.
I've been in here for 4 hours, my ribs are sore.
I don't know about y'all, but I'm out.
- I wouldn't recommend that.
- What?
Well, thanks to your bust Berlin job.
You all made interpol's top 10 most wanted list.
Top 10?
Uh-huh.
That's alright.
Well, not you.
What do you mean?
You just missed the cut, you're number 11.
- So.
- I missed it?
- Yeah.
- That's impossible.
What number did they come in at?
Six, eight, nine...
Ten.
She's Ten?
That's impossible, there is no way she's at 10.
Oh, She's definitely at 10.
How about we focus on someone who we're not gonna find out in anybody's list?
We are awaiting hard confirmation, but...
I believe that's the cyber terrorist known as Cipher.
Wait, no, Cipher's an organization.
Not a person.
Not according to our sources.
- What does she want?
- I don't know.
Cipher is like a digital active God.
They, she, can manipulate world systems under shadows.
Anything that can be hacked..
And here is the kicker.
You will never find her linked to any other.
Her digital identity is scrubbed every few seconds worldwide.
So basically, she is the boogeyman.
Yeah, she is.
One of the hottest boogeyman I have ever seen, I mean...
If y'all know her, tell her to get extra boy.
- What are you, 12?
- That was my scene.
Let's just say.
People are scared of the hacker group Anonymous.
But even anonymous won't mess with her.
What the hell does any of this have to do with us?
Probably nothing, Letty.
But...
I do find it interesting, apparently for some reason.
She's now working with this guy.
He's already delivered a fully operational EMP into her hands.
Detonate that, they can turn any city in the world into a war zone.
So then what is it that you're suggesting?
Maybe we find Dom huh?
Well, first let's catch him and then figure out
- why he's turned.
- So y'all want us...
To track Dom.
And I know Roman, it's kinda a big job.
- It's impossible.
- Which is why...
I'm bringing in an extra pair of hands.
Ah.
My day just got a whole hell of a lot better.
Mr. Nobody you want to tell me why you just put me in a room with this teen crumpeting criminal, some bitch.
You got a big mouth on a small head.
Coming from prisoner 6753.
Don't think we've forgotten everything that you've done.
We're not...
teaming up with this guy.
Let's get one thing clear.
I ain't on your team.
I don't care about you, you crew...
Your little family.
I'm here for Cipher.
You gonna do apply for a job, Head-asshole?
You don't think that tight t-shirt is cutting off the circulation to your brain.
You should get bigger size.
Cipher came to me first.
Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.
When I said no, she went off to my brother.
Oh Yes.
Brother Owen who could forget him?
Former hell-raiser and current guest, at a nasty little black site prison.
Cipher corrupted him left him for dead.
So if I get a shot to take her down, believe me, flicks I'm taking it.
You're taking my boot right up your ass.
Guys, guys, guys.
The fastest way to find Cipher is through Toretto.
Now aside from myself, there's only two men in the world, that have ever managed to actually track him..
Down with any success.
And guess what.
They're both standing in front of me right now.
So like it or not, you two are gonna work together.
You got that?
I'm gonna take that as a yes.
Am I the only one seeing this?
Oh, this oughtta be good.
Use God's eye.
We put our lives on the line..
Running around the world trying to figure this thing out.
It can find anybody, right?
Let's use it to find Dom.
Roman, that is a great idea.
Did you hear that?
Great idea.
- And no, no!
No pointing out.
- Mr. Nobody.
Let's fire it up.. huh?
Got him.
He's in London.
Wait, we have got a 2nd match in Hong Kong.
- Bejing and Seole.
- And Tokyo.
And just about every other major city on the planet.
And so...
God's eye was where we start.
Cipher's already created an evasion that masked her location by..
Pinging random spots all over the globe.
But it was a good thought Roman.
So she's made my programme obsolete.
And that Ramsey..
- Is why are you here.
- See, simple solutions... aren't gonna cut it here slick.
Why are you looking at me when you're saying that?
Wait a second, wait, wait.
Simple solutions might just cut it.
In order for God's eyes to give up all this false pings,
Means they have to be using a free relay.
Watch these two.
Which means it has a decaying sync quantanizer.
Which we can reverse.
And track it back to the originating source and find Dom's true location.
Telling you, they got skills.
That was my idea.
That's what I was saying, remember in there?
Alright.
Let's try this.
It's working..
Time you wanna take your manual and start organizing first response...
Let's get a hold of our internatio...
He's still..
Yes, like first baby shit.
Yes, we've tried those location... wanna mobilize.
Let's get a hold of a, better asshole.
No one respects you, over.
Get away from me.
Alright they are not in China..
Or Russia.
Europe's clear.
But this one's not going away.
This is interesting.
Why?
Because that's here.
Did you all enjoy that?
Next generation concussion grenade.
It scrambles your senses.
Don't worry, It'll wear off in an hour.
Probably.
Hello, Deckard.
Nice to see you again.
Look at this, bodies not even cold Dom.
Your family's already replacing you.
You chose the loosing team.
I guess your brother is smarter than you.
Smart move embedding God's eye into the mainframe.
Irritating to make me have to come all the way down here to get it, but.
Let's go.
Dom!
You're gonna turn your back on family?
Just like that?
Let's go.
You okay?
That wasn't him.
I don't know what she's got on him.
But that wasn't Dom.
- Bryan would know what to do.
- No.
We can't bring Bryan and Mia into this.
We agreed on that.
I know.
Back there was that for her, for me, or you?
Or was it either necessary?
Necessary?
Nothing is necessary.
Everything is a choice.
I simply made one but so did you.
You could have stopped me, but you chose not to do.
I wonder what Letty thought about that.
The problem of putting your foot on a Tiger's neck... is you can never let it up.
I think I need to remind you why you chose to be here.
Dom.
Sorry.
You shoudn't have come.
Nothing's gonna get me away.
Now she has the three of us.
You wanna see him?
See papa.
Papa.
When I realized I was pregnant.
You had just find out Letty was alive.
So I decided when Letty and you go back from your honeymoon.
I was going to tell you.
And then she took us before I had the chance.
I call him Michaels.
That his middle name.
I thought his father should give him first name.
I'm sorry, Dom.
There is nothing to be sorry for.
Whatever happens...
Just save our son.
Your son.
-
Good visit?
I know.
I know what you're thinking.
I just let the guards go, so there is only two opponents in the room.
Rhodes has the gun, so you'll take him out first, I know you.
And then you're thinking.
Elena is a cop, maybe the two of you can fight your way out of here.
So much to think about.
Let me make it easier for you.
Do with it as you wish.
Have you heard of choice theory Dom?
There's a bunch of axiems but only two you really need to concern yourself with,
One.
The only person's behavior we can control is our own.
And two, the only thing we can truly give another person is information, so let me give you some.
You see this cameras in here?
The moment you make a move, highly paid men with weapons, will make there way into this room.
With one very...
specific instruction.
It's not to save me.
It's to kill your son.
And that's a lot of bullets.
And it only takes one for you to loose everything.
So, I have to ask you, because...
I know family is so important to you.
Is that really a choice you wanna make?
Because I'm ready as you are.
I pull this trigger, and God knows I wanna..
I'll kill everyone on this plane...
I still couldn't get in there.
Cause you here manipulate this system.
Since I'm alone!
I got no choice!
I don't think so.
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch.
Damn it..
She wiped it off.
Took God's eye.
That was the one thing we could use to find him.
We lost everything.
- Yeah, princess?
- Find it to rail.
But I've got couple of minutes to spare.
If you want me to send you to the hospital again.
- Yo Rules!
- First off,
- That's not my name.
- Little nobody.
- Don't call me that.
- Oh that's definitely stinky.
Great do me a favor, and tell your majesty over there, that we're gonna find Toretto.
We find Toretto together as a team.
When this is all over, you have me to slap that whickest biscuit right off his face.
Wait a minute, guys.
I think Decker's actually onto something.
How do you think Dom and Cipher got into the country without us knowing?
- Ghost flights.
- That untraceable aircraft it was all internet conspiracy stuff.
It's not.
Satellites and radar grids...
All across the globe shift.
Like an ocean.
And they've got channels that open and close.
And theoretically, if you know the right people who...
Know the right patterns.
You can fly right through the blind's box... can't be intercepted.
So you know where Dom is headed?
Yeah, New York.
You see there Luke..
You guys...
are gonna get along just great.
Which proves, rule number two, you never lose everything.
Fire up the chopper.
Guys, have a bowl and a Big Apple.
Are we travelling like this again?
Because Dom took God's Eye, so we need to stay off the grid.
But like this?
Look here man.
Before I throw up in my mouth...
Let me ask you what are we doing here?
That's a good question, Roman.
Let me show you.
Welcome to our new base of operations.
Now seriously, what is this place?
This... is heaven.
The agency garage.
We call it the toy shop.
This is where we house every vehicles seized from drug dealers of East coast.
Now.
Mr nobody said..
If we're gonna have a chance of catching Dom..
We're gonna have to be damn fast.
Maybe this could help.
We got a tank.
750 horsepower.
6.6 liter V8 Duramax engine.
With the M153 probe remotely operated weapon station on top.
You didn't get this from drug dealers.
No.
No that...
United State's army weaponry.
See the army developing machines like this the soldiers could drive from a mile way so they can stay safe.
And alive.
But luckily..
There is a back up driver seat for those of us who like to get more..
Hands on.
I'm sitting there wondering this whole time when this thing feeling badly and she's getting fact.
No one is getting hands on it.
She doesn't go on some streets.
I'm in love.
Again?
No.
No...
That's a million dollar show car.
The point is to not draw attention.
It's reverse psychology.
Dom will never see it coming.
It's neon orange,
The international space station would see it coming.
Go choose anything less inspeculous.
No no.
This is ridiculous.
Hey my man, you can put that down right there.
This is a gift.
A real gift.
I know what you're doing.
I like your beard.
You're blanta.
Black santa?
No, I'm serious.
Put it down right here..
What are you doing?
Engine's mis-firing, I gotta check it out.
No.
That's not part of the plan, Dom.
Clearly..
But unless you want the engine to cease on the job,
You have five minutes.
I want another visual.
I got an ATM
I don't like this.
I want to see Toretto.
There are no more cameras.
Then find something.
Punch in on something reflective A car mirror, anything..
- You know who I am?
- That's why I'm here.
You know what I'm capable of.
It's why I'm here.
I'll give you until I finish my cup up.
And I'm fucking thirsty.
I got limited time.
So won't take up too much of yours.
Oh no.
No, you've already taken everything I have of value, Mr. Toretto,
What more could you possibly want?
To give you something back.
Talk to me.
Something's not right here.
First time I saw my son... was behind a bulletproof glass.
When he reached me, I couldn't hold on.
It's the worst pain I ever felt..
I know you know exactly how that feels.
Maybe we could change that..
I think..
You are about to suggest something really dodgy Mr Toretto.
It's why I'm here.
Just punch in on something, I'm not liking this.
Something is not right.
- Rhodes, you close?
- Yeah.
- Go.
- The delivery truck's moving.
Captain Deckard Shaw, distinguished himself by acts of gallantry of the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.
His bold actions saved the lives of hostages and his team mates.
Recommendation:
Victoria Cross.
Highest honor the British Government has ever given.
To a traitor.
Some about this old thing just doesn't add up to me.
Well then don't do the same kind of funny math,
It says a DSS agent who has a soul to stop a valid stolen EMP.
Sound familiar huh?
Wanna give me a hand?
- On three?
- Yeah.
One two..
You know, you can tell this in another letter..
But maybe we could've caused some serious damage.
- Yes, we could have.
- Yeah.
Shame I'll have to punch you, head of defend, when this is all over.
Ah well.
With all due respect, Captain,
When this whole thing is over we're gonna find a location and I'm gonna knock your teeth so far down your throat.
You're gonna stick a toothbrush right up in your ass to brush up.
Give me God's eyes.
- God's eye active.
- Thanks.
Let's find us some Russian.
That spy with my little lie...
Minister of defense.
We land back in Moscow by nine.
Here's the latest defense report, All the items in yesterday's meet.
Upload this coordinates to Dom's nav.
Copy that.
He's in the third car.
It's a guard class limousine.
Where's my team?
- Where's his team?
- There's no sign of 'em yet.
They are off the grid.
Probably just bunker down somewhere.
Closing in on him.
You guys ready?
One thing I can guarantee you Dom.
No one's ready for this.
I want every with chip with the GEODIE exploits in a two mile radius around that motorcade now.
There's over a thousands of them.
Hack 'em all.
It's zombie time.
I'd buckle up if I were you.
AUTO-DRIVE ACTIVATED.
Hey...!
Target the motorcade.
And here they come.
What is going on?
Ouch.
Drive fast!
Police escort down..
Take out the lead and follow cars.
Drive!
Drive!
- Two more down.
- Still a new warranty.
There's more cars ahead of us.
Shoot their engines.
Oh God!
We got an army of cars driving themselves.
Send backup!
Send S.W.A.T!
I don't care if you send the goddamn boy scout...
- Just send up some help!
- Now that's Dom.
Faster, faster!
The motorcade just turned on 7th.
Perfect.
Make it rain.
Target immobilized.
You are up Dom.
- Who the hell is that?
- What is he doing?
What the hell are you waiting for?
Shoot him!
Come on, come on!
I'm out.
Shit.
Don't worry sir.
This car is bulletproof.
You'll be safe in here.
- Give me the case.
- Give him the case.
These are nuclear launch codes.
We cannot give it to him.
What is he doing now?
He just cut a hole in our gas tank.
Good work, Dom.
Meet you at the pick-up.
I think I know where my team's at.
- Where?
- Right in front of me.
This is on you.
Get out of there, Dom.
Guys, I know why Dom's here.
Police scanners are saying he's stolen Nuclear Football.
It's over, Toretto.
Get your ass out of the car now.
That's how you wanna play this?
Let's play.
Don't do this, Dom.
- What're you doing?
- It's a trap!
Now I know what it feels like be every cop ever chasing us.
I'm gonna get a little close and I ped him.
Oh, so you just gonna take Dom?
Little Nobody has clearly lost his little mind.
I'm on him.
Easy, work together.
- Look out!
- Wait, wait, wait!
Oh shit.
I will take the short cut.
Look out!
Watch these people.
Big Sexy coming through!
Not this time, Dom.
Stretch him out.
Hold them.
He gotta have about 2000 Horse Power in that thing.
Try 3000..
Try Five.
Get out of there.
I'm working on it.
Stop working on it, and do it..
No, no no...
It's my Bentley.
No!
Get that case and run!
Move!
They thought...
this was gonna be a streetfight.
You wait for it..
No!
Letty, stop!
What are you gonna do?
I don't know why you're doing this, but I know one thing.
You love me.
And you're not gonna to shoot me.
You should've given him the case, cause I won't chase you.
Okay.
I will just take it from a dead girl.
You willing to die for it?
Let's go then.
Anything?
They're gone.
And D.O.D confirmed it was a nuclear football.
He's got an EMP and nuclear launch codes.
I don't know what it is, but they're building towards something.
Deckard?
He didn't make it.
I'm disappointed in you, Dom.
You're gonna Letty just walk away with the codes.
- You've got the codes!
- Rhodes got the codes.
You made the choice to let her go.
And now I have to make one on my own.
They are adorable little things, aren't they?
I hope I don't hurt him.
Look, Cipher, I did exactly what you asked me to do.
Don't do this.
- This is your doing.
- My doing?
Please don't hurt him.
I'm begging you.
I don't want you to beg.
- I want you to learn.
- Learn what?
I understand why you did what you did.
I really do.
But it was the wrong choice.
This is a consequence, Dom.
No!
No!
No...
Wait.
Wait.
No!
Can you pull up the footage from the guy in the ally.
- Traffic cams.
- I got you.
I knew it.
I recognize that guy.
That's Connor Rhodes.
I met him when I was working with Shaw's brother.
He wanted us to get the Nightshade device him.
Connor Rhodes.
He's also linked to somebody who I like to forget.
Mose Jakande.
Warlord who tried to get God's eye.
Which means that's twice that Dom has messed up Cipher's business.
Everything you're feeling right now, that's rage, sense of loss.
It's not real.
It's a survival instinct wired deep into our brains.
To ensure continuation of species.
When early men went visit a watering hole...
If they didn't watch their child, they got snatched by a crocodile.
Their brains would create a painful but a structural memory.
So it will never happen again.
This idea of family that is so core with you, that rules your world...
It's a biological lie.
You don't have to accept it.
I don't!
Did you really could think you could destroy two of my teams.
Without any repercussions?
I wouldn't have even looked your way..
If you hadn't done that.
You didn't even know you had a kid.
You can thank me for that.
And start doing the job I'm asking you to do.
Help you start a war.
Is that what you think I want.
That's so limited.
I didn't take that football to start a war..
Anymore than I took your son to start a family.
Taking your son got me the codes..
The codes will get me the nukes, and the nukes will get me what I want...
Today, tomorrow...
and every day after that.
What's that?
Accountability.
The second I fire off one of those nukes..
I put the superpowers of this world on notice that... when they cross the line,
I'm gonna be there to hold the responsible..
Because the truth is, Dom...
To the world out there...
I'm the crocodile at the watering hole.
You've got one last job to do.
Cipher..
If I were you, I would kiss my son.
Because whether you value it or not, all of this...
Your plane, your security and you... are still on this earth because of him.
The problem we have with tracking Cipher is there's nothing to trace then.
Now we have Rhodes' information.
And we're getting snapshots of this data before it's scrubbed off the net.
That looks like somebody's bank accounts?
Always just...
The Longitude.
Given the fact that Dom hit the Russian Motorcade safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead, bring up the map.
Great, let's start here run the possibilities.
Yalta, Poltava.
Looks like they just threw letters together.
- Konyert.
- It's Vladupi.
What are you doing here?
Thought I was gonna check in on you from time to time,
To see you how you're doing.
By the way, not so hot.
But there's nothing in Vladiven.
It's just ice..
That funny...
Could've sworn there was a secret Russian naval base with the retrophilic cold war Submarines.
Well, technically, it's not Russian anymore.
Base was take by a terror grope of military separatists about a month ago.
And the Russians haven't taken it back yet.
So there is a little window of opportunity here.
Russian submarines, nuclear football, it sounds like everything we do our legs gonna be bombed off.
Sounds like you're still a No. 11 on the list.
It sounds like you've changed since you look punk ass.
Facial hairs and camen.
Guys... guys.
Hey.
We gotta call this in all the way up the chain.
That's good thinking champ.
Except... unfortunately the Russian Minister of Defense.
Got himself involved in little incident on US territory and two governments aren't talking to each other for a while.
By the time they do...
It will be too late.
So, any other suggestions?
Yeah, I got one.
How about we just stop them ourselves?
You're talking about a Russian Military Base.
Separatists.
Whatever.
It's suicide.
It's stopping world war 3.
What's it gonna be rook?
You're gonna close your eyes on this one too?
Pray that the apocalypse doesn't come knocking on your mama's front door?
Or are you're gonna saddle up, be a man and save the entire goddamn world.
You know, thank god they read it out.
What's that?
- Rule number three.
- Which is?
There are no rules.
What did I told you, Luke?
I knew he'd get in three.
Areal transport leaves in an hour.
Take whatever vehicle you want.
- All bets are off.
- All bets are off.
Bets are off?
See you later...
Letty I don't like telling you this one thing,
The game's changed.
Before we were trying just to catch Dom, but now after all of this...
I want you to know, if I have to...
I'm gonna put him down..
Then you might have to take us both down.
I'm freezing man.
This ain't for me.
I come from a different kind of lifestyle brah.
Ladies know me.
They know where I'm at with.
I try to take a piss, I ain't even recognize myself.
Now that's entirely too much information.
I'm just saying.
Well, one thing is for sure.
Dom's gotta be either working with them or making a train cause no one will be this insane to hit this place without a damn army.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Speak of the Devil.
Alright, Dom, you're one step closer to that family reunion.
400 meters to base.
Prep the EMP.
Let's take these defenses down.
We have a possible threat incoming.
Raise the barricade, As soon as possible.
We've lost power, get to your positions now.
Gates are open.
Let's get this party started.
- EMP's are charging.
- How long?
60 seconds.
Alright, Dom, You've one pulse left in that EMP.
That sub is heavily insulated.
You're gonna need to be right underneath it, for this thing to work.
Come on.
Engaging target.
He's beneath the Sub.
I'm loosing control, mayday, mayday.
I'm going down.
Yes, two birds with one stone.
We've got control of the sub.
Dom, we are good.
Head over to the Rendezvous.
Ok Matty...
Let's take this baby for a spin.
Damn!
I think Cipher just rebooted that Sub's command system.
What the hell is he talking about?
In Leyman's terms...
She just carjacked a submarine.
We can't let it get away.
There's the control room.
If you can get me into that warehouse
I can tap with network and counter hack Cipher.
Keep it from flowing into water.
No, what we need to do is get me on that sub.
I find the weapon's room and I can pull the lunch chip before she can fire any of those nukes.
That is too crazy.
- Just saying it's too dangerous.
- We'll do both.
Knock, knock!
Five vehicles just reached the base.
They just don't give up, do they..
A'right.
Let's haul ass team.
Double time, double time.
Letty, let's roll.
Go, go, go, go.
Change of plans, Dom.
I'm sending you the co-ordinates, head there immediately.
- I'm done.
I want my son.
- I'll tell you when you're done.
Your team is in play, now meet Rhodes and follow my instruction.
I got you covered, go.
Move, move!
Get out of here, go go!
Ok, how do you like this?
- Remote link has been separated.
- I'll take care of this.
Hi Ramsey.
She's regaining control.
Damn it, she's good.
They are entering the Weapon's room.
Oh that's cute.
Go, pull pull!
Roman, guard up by the chip, go.
Oh she's slick.
Gonna have to do better in that way.
Ok, now you're starting to piss me off.
Ramsey, how much time we talking to you?
You're smart, but no smart enough.
She's locked me out.
Tez, I can't stop.
Now you're gonna have to pull that chip.
I can't.
This thing's going into attack mode.
The door's not gonna open until you pull the chip.
Tez we got no idea what the hell we are looking for.
I got it.
What in the hell are you guys doing?
It wasn't me, okay?
It will be labeled "Guidance Go".
- Ok.
I got something.
- What?
It says haha.. slack slack back smoke, dear jack n jack.
Do you understand that?
Well, nasty.
Quite a show.
Arming the nuke..
Nuke's going hot, she's trying to fire this thing.
- Roger that, we're moving out.
- Disable the nukes.
Roman, what are you seeing?
- Come on, Talk to me.
- I don't see shit.
I'm holding on.
Now we have a countdown.
What the hell is going on man?
We are about to launch a nuclear missile, what the hell is going on.
Pull the damn chip.
Countdown.
Countdown.
Look for a countdown.
What countdown?
The missile needs to activate for launch.
The countdown timer won't be in Russian.
The countdown.
Let's show the world what we've got.
No.
No.
No.
Don't press that.
I got it.
Something is wrong.
It won't launch.
Get that sub out of there.
Now!
Move your ass Roman.
You alright?
There's nothing alright about any of this.
Let's go.
What about the missiles?
We got the chip, no nukes for her.
Hell yeah.
Let's roll.
Guys we got company.
A lot of company.
Alright team, here is the plan.
There is a Sea lock at the opening of the bay,
We get there first, and close it, we can stop the submarine from escaping into open water.
And disappearing forever.
I've got the location.
It's 10 miles south west.
10 miles?
Like I make it in 10 seconds.
What's the matter Roman, you forgot the snow tyre?
Loving that Lambo now?
Alright everyone, hold you with that launch trip later.
Right now I want that sub, in deep water, where no one can find it.
Find me the fastest route out of that bay.
Copy that.
Why are they shooting at me?
I think off you're in that orange Lamborghini I don't know.
Shut up Tez.
Dom.
Do you really wanna put that car in gear?
Do you?
I don't think so.
They're heading for the sea lock.
They're trying to trap the sub in the bay.
I should have taken care of this a long time ago.
Rhodes, check his team out.
I'm on it.
Roman, get in front of me.
Ok, y'all wanna play it rough?
Now it's my turn.
Yeah, baby!
Guys, we got snow mobile on the right.
They're going to flank us.
No they ain't!
Oh shit!
Tez!
Roman hold tight.
I'm on the way.
I don't wanna go swimming.
No!
Really Tez?
Oh, No.
No.
No.
Oh shit.
Roman, grab your door.
Tez!
Grab the door Roman.
It's all gone.
Oh Shit.
Roman, hang on.
Tej!
Get me off this thing.
Tez.
Come on!
Alright, I've had enough of this shit!
Number 11 my Ass.
Don't shrink it.
We got a sub to catch, get in.
What?
The pressure is on alert in the cargo hold.
Drop it to 10 thousand feet.
I know how much these people mean to you.
So I'll let you pick the first target.
I'm not picking target from a mile away.
I'd stand face to face, and look 'em dead in the eye.
Ok.
The wife it is.
Nice plane.
I'm gonna enjoy her remains.
You don't go get any ideas.
You and planes don't have a good history.
No shit.
Let's go scarface.
The arseholes ain't gonna kill themselves.
Pull up surveillance, right now.
Surprise.
Pierce must be dead.
You're driving.
I said it from the beginning.
No way, I'm not driving.
We have a security breach in the cargo hold.
Take care of it now.
Jesus Mum, you should pose to avoid the nerves.
Oh, shut up, don't be such a baby.
Get to the pilot, he's got the second key.
Wait for my signal.
Give Cipher my regards.
Did Torretto hold up his end of the deal?
He gave us this little thing here.
No, don't touch.
You can track Cipher with this, but you can't do this on your own.
There's gotta be two of you.
Fine, I got contacts.
Now you're gonna take your brother.
- No.
- Yes.
Torretto knows where he is...
He's got this thing.
He can see everything it's like it's called the devil's bumhole or something?
- It's called the God's eyes.
- Yeah, well.
Whatever.
There's no way I'm using Owen, alright?
He's a lost cause.
He's your brother, Deck.
He's my son.
He's our family.
And our family that died...
Bloody shit happening.
You lied about, I mean, I can't believe you.
You've gotten upset, you really upset your mother.
Call yourself a brother?
Look, I'm in, mum.
Ok.
Every time!
- Owen.
- In position.
Go.
I'm in.
I've got the package to lay on.
Whole pounds of him..
You made me miss my son?
What do you think you're doing?
Looking at you dead in the eye.
That was for Letty.
- Rhodes.
- He is no longer with us.
Rhodes picked the wrong target.
Congratulations Dom.
You just killed your son.
You are wrong.
I just saved him.
And you just took your foot off the tiger's neck.
You're welcome.
It's gonna get noisy.
This is for your relief.
Good?
Let's go.
Go stop him, do not let him get off this plane.
That truck's got enough munition to take us all out.
We don't give 'em a target.
Everybody get in front of us, line up
- we will take the hit.
- What?
I need to switch cars, right now.
- Roman, here comes the bad part.
- What?
Hang in there guys!
We're almost through the lock.
It's easy for you to say, when your ass ain't on fire.
Alright little mate.
It's might be a little scary,
It's gonna be a lot of fun.
The music good?
They're locking on.
Sorry guys, I got no trick for us..
- What do we do now?
- We start praying.
Hell yeah!
That's Dom!
- This guy in our side now?
- Who the hell cares?
He just saved our asses.
Good to be riding with you again man.
Torretto just cleared the way for them.
Someone give me something.
- Torpedoes are ready.
- Then launch them.
- Take the wheel.
- I ain't taking shit.
- Take the wheel!
- Where are you doing?
- This is crazy!
- Speed up,
- Left and back!
- What?
Turn the goddamn wheel to the left, really quickly.
Boom, baby!
That's alright!
Back in the sink.
Where is that smile?
There it is!
You're gonna shoot a baby You shoud bust it...
You aren't gonna wanna see this?
Is that you or him?
Him.
Good.
The torpedo's missed, they are gonna reach lock before the sub does.
The hell they are.
Get ready for this.
Oh shit!
We're going to need a bigger truck.
- Get us out of here.
- Why are you always yelling?
- This bitch is crazy!
- Look out!
That's not good.
That's not good.
We got this.
That's my girl.
The sub's too close.
We ain't making it to the gate in time.
We just gonna let it get away?
Not if I know Dom.
You loose.
Dom.
I destroyed two of your teams
I killed your red headed boyfriend.
And I put two killers on you untraceable plane.
You lost the minute you interrupted my honeymoon.
Put a heat-seeker on him now.
Now!
That's a goddamn heat seeker coming at us.
Oh my...
come and get it.
Guys!
Dive..
This...
This is for my son!
Dom!
You are out of bullets Deckard.
Like I'm need a gun to take care of you,
How did you find me?
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch!
Resourceful.
You have a lot to answer Cipher.
You pulled my family through.
A mother.
I'm gonna make sure that never happens again.
To anyone.
There is only one flaw in your plan.
What's that?
Only one of us has a parachute!
Told you this would be fun!
Time to land, Boys!
You know I've never left you, Letty?
I know.
And you know I never will..
I know.
I've so much to tell you.
Yeah you do, and you can start with that bitch!
Now, that's...
Dominic Toretto.
Hey Dom!
I'm just towing it out there?
We need to get up out of here.
Cause this all kinda neuclearism happening under this ice.
Relax!
Without the trigger chips, those nukes are harmless.
Ok.
So we good then.
Lemme go and get my young selfie levels up.
You realize this is classified, right?
Not today.
We have to get up out of here man.
I'm freezing.
It's Okay.
Don't worry, he's gonna be here soon.
I get it, y'all got a lot in common.
Computer hacks, god's eyes, geeks, nerd.
You know, but we got a lot in common too!
Alright?
- Like what?
- We walk in the room, and we are oozing sex appeal.
Me and you?
There's a problem.
I am asking the real question right now.
Is it gonna be... the Nerd or...
the dark knight?
To be honest I like both of you.
A'rigt!
Yeah..yea!
But just before we get into all of that,
Let me ask you one question.
- You can ask me anything.
- Anything.
What's my last name?
When you guys pick around with then I guess you can let me know.
It's gonna be a Parker.
That's all that really matters.
Jones, Miss Parker.
Hey Miss Parker.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I wanted to thank you.
No need.
Cipher's still on the loose.
There's been some reports she's in Athens.
But she won't be nuking any city anytime soon.
Thanks to you guys.
- So, I got you a parting favor.
- This can't be good...
Your record's been clreared.
Full re-instatement.
You got you job back.
That is if you want it.
If I want?
You know after 16 years.
I figured it's time for a little break.
Wow.
Daddy's stayin' home.
- Nobody.
- Get in touch!
Ah, hang on a second.
This could be interesting.
What made you think I would do it?
Brother-hood.
I saw that look you gave Cipher.
I knew you wanted revenge.
Glad I did it.
Can't believe you went to see my Mother.
Come on.
All this fuss of you.
Yes.
Alena, I promise to keep our son safe.
And now.. he always will be.
I want to introduce you to the most important person in my universe.
Who will never give up on me.
You've heard me say.
"That you never turn your back on family."
And I wanna thank you all for never turning your back on me.
You wanna meet them?
Alright!
Everyone...
Meet Bryan.
Hey Bryan.
Okay, I guess he's my turning secret.
Thank you for giving us family.
Thank you for giving us the strength.
- No way!
- Yeah.
This is the Cuban spirit.
Dom.
Dom.
You know I can't make a living without my car.
Not my problem, bro.
Dominic Toretto, I heard about you.
Welcome to my island.
Why you hooking' up my cousin's car?
He needed money, I gave it to him.
He can't pay, I take the car.
I just need a few more days.
"Few more days" wasn't part of the deal.
Come on.
You make a deal, you gotta live up to it.
You make a deal, you gonna live up to it.
"Gonna" live up to it?
Oh, so you're one of those types.
You take everyone's ride, and then ship it back to the States?
You watch your mouth.
Now you got a problem.
I'm gonna keep it about the cars.
You want a car, get it the right way.
How?
Race for it.
I already own it, bro.
Not that car.
Mine.
Dom, his car is the fastest car on the island.
Do you know what he has under that hood?
He knows it doesn't matter what's under a hood.
The only thing that matters is who's behind the wheel.
You think so?
I know so.
Then race his car.
And we ain't racing no quarter-mile, here.
We race the Cuban mile.
Done.
I appreciate what you're trying to do, but my car is the slowest car on the island.
Was.
Pull the seats, the doors, the battery...
If it ain't the motor, take it off.
Laughing gas?
Nah, Fed.
This is Cuban NOS.
You guys are crazy.
What are you doing?
Poor man's turbo.
Pull the vacuum line and hold on.
Old trick that Buster used to play, in case of emergencies.
You know that's way too much boost for that engine.
It's gonna be fast.
It's gonna be a bomb.
Only needs to go a mile.
Vámonos!
That car belongs in the trash, bro!
Where are they going?
I don't know.
Let's go!
Ghost him.
Sí.
Adiós, Toretto!
Okay, Buster.
Let's see if this works.
That's impossible.
Look out!
A deal's a deal.
You won my car.
And you earned my respect.
Keep your car.
Your respect is good enough for me.
Yo, cousin...
Sorry about your car.
Yours was too slow for a Toretto, anyway.
Your Impala?
Are you serious?
Look at that smile.
I love it when you smile.
You make me happy.
Mmm, I think this place makes you happy.
It's like it speaks to you.
You remember that guy, the racer and his dad?
The one with the boat engine under the hood?
Yeah!
Yes.
Of course.
I was looking at them, and I...
And I couldn't help but to imagine what you'd be like if you were a dad.
No, no, no!
I'm not pregnant.
Is that what you want?
It's not about what I want or what you want.
It's about why we haven't asked the question.
What?
You need a hand?
Yeah, I think I do.
Sounds like you're not getting any fuel.
Yeah?
Probably the shut-off solenoid.
Let's see if we can get some power to it.
What brings you to Cuba?
The same thing that brings everyone else to Cuba.
Culture, people, the beauty.
What brings you to Cuba?
Work.
Must be casual Friday.
How's that honeymoon going, Dom?
Your fuel relay is missing.
I know.
I love to play games.
I've beaten the best of 'em.
But I'm kind of in a rush, so if you've got something to say to me...
Oh, this is a very different game, that I can assure you.
This...
There's something much greater at work here.
This is fate.
I choose to make my own fate.
Not today.
Is this the road you take to your apartment every morning?
What else is different, Dom?
Was Santiago's closed?
Did you have to cross two blocks to go get your Cuban coffees?
What is it, black, no sugar?
Yeah.
I put a lot of work into getting you here today.
Well, now that I'm here, what do you want?
I want you to work for me.
Work for you?
Oh, I could've saved you a lot of time, then.
See, I don't work for anyone.
You can't walk away from this, Dom.
We're gonna have this conversation, one way or the other.
You see, that's the funny thing about fate.
It's cunning.
It can bring you beautiful things, and it can also bring you moments like this.
Oh, you're gonna want to work for me.
You're gonna betray your brothers, abandon your code, and shatter your family.
You see, your team is about to go up against the only thing they can't handle.
What's that?
You.
Oh, and, Dom, I wouldn't mention this to anyone.
They are gonna be hitting us with everything they got.
So we wanna engage with maximum speed.
Neutralize their shooters, and then move on to our objective.
There's two things I want you to keep in mind.
Number one, I chose you for this squad because you are the most fearsome warriors on the planet.
And number two, you go out there, you do your job, and you take 'em down.
Everyone.
And I mean everyone.
Mani's and pedi's at the mall later on today.
Huh?
Monarchs!
What?
I don't wanna play anymore.
All right, let's go, girls.
Let's go, let's go!
Final two minutes.
Quite the cheering section.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it's the moms.
They come out to support the kids.
Except there seem to be more moms than kids.
Way more moms.
Yeah.
It's a big soccer town.
Let's go, girls!
So, your intel was spot-on.
That Damocles 7 EMP weapon that went missing in the Gulf?
Arms dealers from the Liberation Front have it in Berlin.
Shit!
This thing can wipe out an entire electrical grid in a major city.
No lights, no power.
Instant Stone Age.
Chloe, Maya, you can't let her run by you like that.
Let's go, let's go!
Cross!
Agent Hobbs, this is a Class Four WMD.
Do you have any idea what's at stake here?
Yes, I know exactly what is at stake here, okay?
If the Pink Butterflies beat my Red Dragons, that means we lose the championship.
Which means I have 20 little girls who are crying, and that's not a good thing.
Which then means I have to spend a lot of time in ice-cream shops and a lot of time at Tay Tay concerts.
Tay Tay?
Taylor Swift.
Gotta be shittin' me.
Get it together, okay?
Let's go, girls!
We need you to do this.
It's a lot of lives at stake.
All right, but I need to be clear here.
The US government cannot sanction this operation in any way.
You're on your own.
Hey.
If this thing goes sideways, you don't just get burned.
You go to prison.
And there's nothing we can do to get you out.
Let me tell you something.
The only thing that I love more than saving lives is my daughter.
So, if you don't shut up with this government bullshit right now, and start showing some team spirit and respect for the Red Dragons,
I'm gonna have all 20 of them line up and kick you right in the tay-tay.
Go Dragons!
Say it again.
Go Dragons!
Attaboy.
Go Dragons.
Go Dragons.
I'm open.
She's open!
Go, go!
Yes!
That is my daughter right there.
Yes.
Yes, come here.
How did I do?
Awesome.
Nice job, kid.
Daddy's gotta go to work?
Uh, yeah.
Daddy's gotta go to work.
Now, you're gonna need to get a team you can trust.
Oh, I already got one.
Hey, Dom.
Hey, Hobbs.
I got a job in Berlin and I need a favor, brother.
No problem.
I'll grab the team and meet you in Berlin.
Thanks, man.
I'll see you soon.
You were only supposed to create a diversion, Roman.
That was a diversion!
How many of the damn explosives did you use?
I don't know, Tej.
All of it?
Wait, all of it?
Roman, Jesus Christ.
We got more of your fan club ahead.
They're still on us!
These guys are taking this personal.
Roman, we just blew up their facility and stole their EMP.
Other than your doctor's cold finger,
I'd say it's about as personal as it can get.
Phase Two!
Phase Two?
So you just gonna keep that to yourself?
What happened to Phase One?
What about that part?
Yeah.
Remember the airplane?
Everyone drove their cars out but you?
I told you, my engine seized up.
It's your balls that seized up.
Just follow my lead, okay?
And, Roman, whatever you do, don't think.
Huh?
Tej, drop it!
Bombs away.
Split, now!
Holy...
Great plan, Tej.
But just so you know, you missed some.
Oh, just wait for it.
Oh, shit!
I hate you, Tej!
Got your ass.
You good?
I'll see you when it's done.
All right, great job, team.
Let's break off and meet me at the safe house.
A hell of a job, brother.
When we get back to the base, the beer's on me.
You lost your goddamn mind, Toretto?
Toretto, you put hands on that thing, you're gonna have the whole world gunning for you, including me.
I don't know what you're doing, but you better think about this, Toretto.
It ain't too late to stop this.
It is now.
That sumbitch just crossed us.
What?
Wait a second, what are you talking about?
Dom took the EMP.
Bullshit.
Where are you?
It's too late for me.
Get outta here.
Saw that look in his eye, and I've seen that look before.
Dominic Toretto just went rogue.
All right, I got his phone records, y'all.
It's a whole bunch of calls to untraceable numbers.
Burner phones, right?
Nah, scrambler.
Same number, but they got some sort of micro-router to bury the signal path, which means Dom is clearly communicating with somebody that's above our pay grade.
Look, I don't know Dom as well as you, but if we just look at the facts,
Dom's been having highly encrypted conversations with some mysterious person.
He took out Hobbs.
He stole an EMP.
Now he's disappeared.
So, what are you saying?
Maybe we should consider the fact that Hobbs is right.
Dom did go rogue.
Letty.
Before you judge the man, remember, you're breathing right now because he saved your life.
You just gonna let her bump your shoulder like that?
I'm just saying, that was a little aggressive.
What you gonna do, email her?
Check.
Moment, will you, fellas?
Thank you.
Well, this is an exciting new look.
It's a little tight in the crotch, as always.
What boy-band bus did she fall out of?
It's my new junior associate.
He's working with me on this.
All yours.
Mr. Nobody and I have been given the authority to get you out of this.
All you have to do is agree to the terms and you're free.
What's training wheels talking about?
What terms?
Confess to your crimes in Berlin.
Treason, international espionage, massive destruction of civic property.
You do that, we close the case.
And?
And the DSS blacklists you.
Germany loves that.
Officially, you will be a criminal.
Wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You need to work on your delivery, all right?
Unofficially...
You're off the books.
You come work with me.
I'm not a criminal.
Luke, come on.
Labels.
There is no confession.
There are no backroom deals.
I got myself into this, I'm gonna get myself out of it.
You know that.
I do, and that's what I told him.
Well, there you have it.
Good luck in the courts, man.
What about your daughter?
You know, if you're not gonna do it for your country, at least do it for your kid.
Big mistake, kid.
Hold on.
Luke, Luke.
He's still working from the manual.
I mean, he doesn't even really know the rules.
Now, come on, give him a break.
Give me a break.
Luke.
Appreciate it.
It's good to see you, Nobody.
You, too.
Rule number one...
Know your audience.
I gave you your shot.
You shit the bed.
Now I'm gonna show you how to get this done.
You're dead, cop.
Dead!
I'm gonna slice some bacon off your back, pig.
Well, well, well...
Luke Hobbs behind bars.
Would you look at that.
The bent cop got his day.
You know, that color looks good on you.
Yeah, it'll look a whole hell of a lot better with your blood on it.
Yeah, good luck with that, Hercules.
Lawman gone bad, huh?
Such a cliché.
Oh, well, welcome to the club.
I wouldn't get that twisted, son.
We ain't in no club, we got nothing in common.
And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.
What, you bring a shovel, did you?
Because it's 38 feet of steel and concrete.
Or so I've been told.
Better get to digging.
Wanker.
Yeah.
Move.
Say that again.
If I say it again, it'll be to a corpse.
I'm gonna enjoy this.
Welcome back, Dom.
Nice job out there.
You excited about tonight?
You're going on this?
You're with me, Dom.
Showing me your shoe collection?
Yep.
A pair for every occasion.
You have enough guns in here to outfit a small army, huh?
Oh, this is just the tip of the iceberg.
You know what I like about you, Dom?
You're a genuine outlaw.
I mean, you're a man who lives by his own rules.
Which is surprising, because when I saw you in Cuba,
I heard about a guy who almost killed you with a motorcycle, and you let him keep his car?
Oh, that confused you?
Hmm.
'Course I could've taken his car.
But it's about something bigger.
This way...
I changed him.
That's not your responsibility.
But it's who I am.
Is it?
Let me ask you something, Dom.
What's the best thing in your life?
Family.
No, it's not.
Not if you're being honest.
It's the 10 seconds between start and finish, when you're not thinking about anything.
No family, no obligations.
Just you.
Being free.
I gotta tell you, this whole saving-the-world, Robin Hood nonsense you've been doing recently?
It's bullshit.
It's not you.
Be who you are.
Why live only a quarter mile at a time when you can live your whole life that way?
Is that it?
Is that all those bloated-out muscles will give ya?
All show and no go.
Oh, I got plenty of go.
You must've misplaced that when I kicked your arse up and down that office of yours.
Yeah.
Just like you Brits, rewriting history, huh?
All I know is, it wasn't me that was thrown out of a four-story window.
Jumped.
I jumped out of a four-story window, saving my partner's life.
'Cause where I'm from, we don't settle fights by throwing bombs.
Well, that's funny, because where I'm from, we don't need women to run to our rescue.
I mean, do you really believe you can stand in front of me and beat me in a straight-up, old-fashioned fist fight?
Let me tell you something.
Me and you, one-on-one, no one else around.
I will beat your ass like a Cherokee drum.
Maybe one day we'll find out.
Oh, you better hope that day never comes.
I said no, Mr. Nobody.
I'm not leaving this cell.
I'll get out my way.
The right way!
Hey!
Why's the door open?
Get back in your cell!
Relax.
It's just a malfunction.
- Get back!
- Just a malfunction.
Stop him!
Don't let him get away!
Hobbs!
I've been waiting a long time for this.
Keep waiting, bitch.
Rubber bullets.
Big mistake.
Well, that took longer than I expected.
- Two questions.
- Yeah.
My daughter?
With your sister.
Toretto?
It's interesting you ask.
This is my new base.
Welcome to nowhere.
It's a little sterile for you.
Listen, there's something I wanna talk to you about after.
Hey, listen, guys.
Thanks...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What?
Handcuffs?
What is this?
It's called abuse of power.
You told me to round them up.
I didn't tell you to hand...
Cut 'em loose.
Oh, man.
This is embarrassing.
I'm sorry, guys, really, I...
So, this is how you treat old friends?
Friends?
We don't even really know who the hell this guy is.
Doesn't matter who I am, Tej.
I'm, like, nobody, okay?
Nobody.
So, then, who is he?
Him?
He's nothing.
He's, like, less than me.
Clearly, we're getting nowhere with nobody.
I've been in here for four hours, and my ribs are showing.
I don't know about y'all, but I'm out.
I wouldn't recommend that.
What?
Well, thanks to your botched Berlin job, you all made Interpol's Top 10 Most Wanted list.
- Top 10.
- Mmm-hmm.
That's all right.
Well, not you, Roman.
What do you mean?
You just missed the cut.
You're number 11, so...
I'm...
I missed?
Yeah.
That's impossible!
What number did they come in at?
Six, eight, nine, ten.
She's 10?
Mmm-hmm.
That's impossible.
There's no way she's a 10.
Oh, she's definitely a 10.
How about we focus on someone who we're not gonna find on anybody's list.
We're awaiting hard confirmation, but I believe that's the cyber terrorist known as Cipher.
Wait, no.
Cipher's an organization.
Not a person.
Not according to our sources.
What does she want?
No one knows.
Cipher is like a digital act of God.
They...
Well, she can manipulate world systems from the shadows.
Anything that can be hacked is hers to play with.
And here's the kicker.
You'll never find her linked to any of it.
Her digital identity is scrubbed every few seconds, worldwide.
So, basically, she's the bogeyman.
Damn, she's one of the hottest bogeymans I've ever seen.
I mean, if y'all know her, tell her to get at your boy.
- What are you, 12?
- That was my shin, mother...
Let's just say, people are scared of the hacker group Anonymous.
But even Anonymous won't mess with her.
What the hell does any of this have to do with us?
Probably nothing, Letty, but I do find it interesting that, apparently, for some reason, she's now working with this guy.
He's already delivered a fully operational EMP into her hands.
Detonate that, they can turn any city in the world into a war zone.
So, then, what is it you're suggesting we do?
Maybe we find Dom, huh?
Well, first, let's catch him, and then figure out why he's turned.
So, y'all want us to track Dom.
Yeah, I know, Roman, it's kind of a big job.
It's impossible.
Which is why I'm bringing in an extra pair of hands.
Ah, my day just got a whole hell of a lot better.
Mr. Nobody, you wanna tell me why you just put me in a room with this tea-and-crumpets eating, criminal sumbitch?
What a big mouth on a small head, coming from Prisoner 6753.
Don't think we've forgotten everything that you've done.
We are not teaming up with this guy.
Let's get one thing clear.
I ain't on your team.
I don't care about you, your crew, or your little family.
I'm here for Cipher.
What are you gonna do, apply for a job?
Head Asshole?
You know, I think that tight T-shirt's cutting off the circulation to your brain.
You should get a bigger size.
Cipher came to me first.
Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.
When I said no, she went after my brother.
Ah, yes, brother Owen.
Who could forget him, huh?
Former hell-raiser and current guest at a nasty little black site prison.
Cipher corrupted him and left him for dead.
So, if I get a shot to take her down, believe me, Flex, I'm taking it.
You're taking my boot right up your ass, is what you're taking.
Guys, guys.
The fastest way to find Cipher is through Toretto.
Now, aside from myself, there's only two men in the world that have ever managed to actually track him down with any success.
And guess what.
They're both standing in front of me right now.
So, like it or not, you two are gonna work together.
You got that?
I'm gonna take that as a yes.
Am I the only one seeing this?
Oh, this ought to be good.
Use God's Eye.
We put our lives on the line, running around the world trying to figure this thing out.
It can find anybody, right?
Let's use it to find Dom.
Roman, that is a great idea.
Did you hear that?
"Great idea."
No, no, no, don't tune it out.
Huh?
Mr. Nobody, let's fire it up, huh?
Got him.
He's in London.
Yeah.
Wait.
We've got a second match in Hong Kong.
Beijing and Seoul.
And Tokyo.
And just about every other major city on the planet.
And so, God's Eye was where we started.
But Cipher's already created an evasion that masks their location by pinging random spots all over the globe, but it was a good thought, Roman.
So, she's made my program obsolete.
And that, Ramsey, is why you're here.
See, simple solutions aren't gonna cut it here, slick.
Why you look at me when you say that?
Wait a second.
Wait, wait.
Simple solutions might just cut it.
You see, in order for God's Eye to give off all these false pings, means they have to be using a FLEA relay.
Watch these two.
Which means it has a decaying sync randomizer.
Which we can reverse...
And track it back to the originating source and find Dom's true location.
I'm telling you, they got skills.
That was my idea.
That's what I was saying.
Remember in there?
All right, let's try this.
It's working.
Time you wanna check your manual and start organizing a force response.
Let's get a hold of our international assets...
He's still green.
Yeah, like fresh baby shit.
As soon as we have Toretto's location, I want to mobilize.
Let's get a hold of a better asshole.
- No one respects you...
- Cover.
Get away from me.
All right, they're not in China.
Or Russia.
Europe's clear.
But this one's not going away.
This is interesting.
Why?
Because that's here.
Did you all enjoy that?
Next-generation concussion grenade.
It scrambles your senses.
Don't worry, it'll wear off in an hour.
Probably.
Hello, Deckard.
Nice to see you again.
Look at this, body's not even cold, Dom.
Your family's already replacing you.
You chose the losing team.
I guess your brother is smarter than you.
Smart move, embedding God's Eye into the mainframe.
Irritating to make me have to come all the way down here to get it, but...
Let's go.
Dom!
You're gonna turn your back on family?
Just like that?
Let's go.
You okay?
That wasn't him.
I don't know what she's got on him, but that wasn't Dom.
Brian would know what to do.
No!
We can't bring Brian and Mia into this.
We agreed on that.
I know.
Back there, was that for her, for me, or you?
And was it even necessary?
Necessary?
Nothing is necessary.
Everything is a choice.
And I simply made one.
But so did you.
You could've stopped me, but you chose not to.
I wonder what Letty thought about that.
The problem with putting your foot on a tiger's neck is you can never let it up.
I think I need to remind you why you chose to be here.
Elena.
Dom?
I'm sorry.
You shouldn't have come.
Nothing could have kept me away.
Now she has the three of us.
Do you wanna see him?
See Papa?
See Papa.
Papa.
When I realized I was pregnant, you had just found out Letty was alive.
So I decided when Letty and you got back from your honeymoon,
I was going to tell you.
But then she took us before I had the chance.
His name?
I call him Marcos.
But that's his middle name.
I thought his father should give him his first name.
I'm sorry, Dom.
There's nothing to be sorry for.
Whatever happens, just save our son.
Your son.
Good visit?
I know.
I know what you're thinking.
I just let the guards go, so there's only two opponents in the room.
Rhodes has the gun, so you'll take him out first.
I know you.
And then you're thinking, Elena's a cop.
Maybe the two of you can fight your way out of here.
So much to think about.
Let me make it easier for you.
Do with it as you wish.
Have you heard of Choice Theory, Dom?
There is a bunch of axioms, but only two you really need to concern yourself with.
One, the only person's behavior we can control is our own.
And, two, the only thing we can truly give another person is information.
So, let me give you some.
You see these cameras in here?
The moment you make a move, highly-paid men with weapons will make their way into this room with one very specific instruction.
It's not to save me.
It's to kill your son.
Now, that's a lot of bullets, and it only takes one for you to lose everything.
So, I have to ask you, because I know family is so important to you.
Is that really a choice you want to make?
Because I'm ready if you are.
If I pull this trigger, and God knows I want to, if I killed everyone on this plane,
I still couldn't get in there.
'Cause of your two-man fail-safe system.
Since I'm alone,
I got no choice!
I didn't think so.
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch.
Bitch.
Don't, don't.
Sweet dreams.
Please!
Damn it.
She wiped it all.
Took God's Eye.
That was the one thing we could use to find them.
We lost everything.
What do you got, Princess?
Finding Toretto.
But I got a couple of minutes to spare, if you want me to send you to the hospital.
Again.
Yo, Rules.
First off, that's not my name.
Little Nobody.
Don't call me that.
Oh, that's definitely sticking.
Great.
Do me a favor and tell Your Majesty over there that we're gonna find Toretto.
We find Toretto together as a team.
And when this is all over with,
I'm happy to slap that whisker biscuit right off his face.
Wait a minute, guys, I think Deckard's actually onto something.
How do you think Dom and Cipher got into the country without us knowing?
Ghost flights.
I thought untraceable aircraft was all Internet conspiracy stuff.
It's not.
Satellites and radar grids all across the globe shift like an ocean.
They've got channels that open and close.
And theoretically, if you know the right people who know the right patterns...
You can fly right through the blind spots completely undetected.
So you know where Dom is headed?
Yeah.
New York.
You see there, Luke?
You guys are gonna get along just great.
Which proves rule number two, you never lose everything.
Fire up the chopper.
Well, guys, have a ball in the Big Apple.
And why are we traveling like this again?
Because Dom took God's Eye, so we need to stay off the grid.
But like this?
Look here, man.
Before I throw up in my mouth, let me ask you, what are we doing here?
That's a good question, Roman.
Let me show you.
Welcome to our new base of operations.
No, seriously.
What is this place?
This is heaven.
It's the agency garage.
They call it the Toy Shop.
This is where we house every vehicle seized from drug dealers on the East Coast.
Now, Mr. Nobody said that if we're gonna have a chance at catching Dom,
we're gonna have to be damn fast.
Figured this would help.
We got a tank.
750 horsepower, 6.6 liter, V8 Duramax engine with an M153 CROWS remotely operated weapon station on top.
You didn't get this from drug dealers.
No.
No, that, uh, the United States Army lent me.
See, the Army's developing machines like this that soldiers can drive from a mile away, so they can stay safe and alive.
But, luckily, there's a backup driver's seat for those of us that like to get more "hands on."
I'm sitting here wondering this whole time, will this thing fit in valet at Cheesecake Factory?
No one is getting "hands on."
She doesn't go on city streets.
Wow.
I'm in love.
Again, no, no.
That's a million-dollar show car.
The point is to not draw attention.
It's reverse psychology.
Dom would never see it coming.
It's neon orange.
The International Space Station would see it coming.
Go choose anything less conspicuous.
No, no, no.
Calipers are my...
This is ridiculous.
Not happening.
Hey, my man, you can put that down right there.
This is a gift, a real gift.
I know what you're doing.
I like your beard.
You're Blanta.
Black Santa?
No, I'm serious.
Put it down right there.
What are you doing?
Engine's misfiring.
I gotta check it out.
No, that's not part of the plan, Dom.
Clearly.
But unless you want the engine to seize on the job...
You have five minutes.
Five minutes.
I want another visual.
I got an ATM.
I don't like this.
I want to see Toretto.
There are no more cameras.
Then find something!
Punch in on something reflective.
A car mirror, anything.
Do you know who I am?
It's why I'm here.
Do you know what I'm capable of?
It's why I'm here.
I'll give you until I finish me cuppa.
And I'm fucking thirsty.
I've got limited time, so I won't take up too much of yours.
Oh, no.
No, you've already taken everything I have of value, Mr. Toretto.
What more could you possibly want?
To give you something back.
Talk to me.
Something's not right here.
First time I saw my son was behind a bulletproof glass.
When he reached for me, I couldn't hold him.
It's the worst pain I ever felt.
I know you know exactly how that feels.
Maybe we could change that.
Now, why do I think you're about to suggest something really dodgy, Mr. Toretto?
It's why I'm here.
Jesus, punch in on something.
I'm not liking this.
Something's not right.
- Rhodes, you close?
- Yeah.
Go.
The delivery truck's moving.
I know.
"Captain Deckard Shaw
"distinguished himself by acts of gallantry
"at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.
"His bold actions saved the lives of hostages and his teammates.
"Recommendation:
Victoria Cross."
Highest honor the British government has ever given to a traitor.
Something about this whole thing that just doesn't add up to me.
Well, that would be the same kind of funny math that says a DSS agent who has a Silver Star for valor stole an EMP.
Sound familiar, huh?
You want to give me a hand?
On three?
Yeah.
One, two, three.
You know what, Twinkle Toes?
In another life, I bet me and you could've done some serious damage.
Yeah, we could've.
Yeah.
Shame I'm gonna have to bounce your head off the fender when this is all over.
Ah, well, with all due respect, Captain, when this whole thing is over, we're gonna find a location, and I'm gonna knock your teeth so far down your throat, you're gonna stick a toothbrush right up your ass to brush them.
Give me God's Eye.
God's Eye, active.
Good.
Let's find us a Russian.
I spy with my little eye, a Minister of Defense.
Upload those coordinates to Dom's nav.
Copy that.
He's in the third car.
It's a Guard Class limousine.
Where's my team?
Where's his team?
There's no sign of them yet.
They're off the grid.
They're probably just bunkered down somewhere.
We're closing in on 'em.
You guys ready?
One thing I can guarantee, Dom, no one's ready for this.
I want every chip with a zero-day exploit in a two-mile radius around that motorcade now.
There's over a thousand of them.
Hack 'em all.
It's zombie time.
I'd buckle up if I were you.
Hmm?
What are you doing?
Ah!
Safety sensors overridden.
Thank you.
Whoa.
Hey!
Target the motorcade.
And here they come.
Ouch.
Police escort down.
Take out the lead and follow cars.
Two more down.
They're still under warranty.
We got an army of cars driving themselves!
Send backup, send SWAT!
I don't care if you send the goddamn Boy Scouts, just send 'em some help!
Now, that's Dom.
The motorcade just turned on Seventh.
Perfect.
Make it rain.
Ah!
Target immobilized.
You're up, Dom.
Give me the case.
Good work, Dom.
Meet you at the pickup.
I think I know where my team's at.
Where?
Right in front of me.
This is on you.
Get out of there, Dom.
Guys, I know why Dom's here.
Police scanners are saying he stole a nuclear football.
It's over, Toretto.
Get your ass outta the car now.
So, that's how you wanna play this?
Let's play.
Don't do this, Dom.
He's going for it!
What are you doing?
It's a trap!
Damn it!
Now I know what it feels like to be every cop ever chasing us!
I'm gonna get a little closer.
I'm gonna PIT him.
Oh, so, you just gonna PIT Dom?
Little Nobody has clearly lost his little mind.
I'm on him.
Easy.
Work together.
Wait, wait, wait!
Oh, sh...
I'll take the shortcut!
Look out!
Watch those people!
Big Sexy coming' through!
Not this time, Dom.
Watch the drag or the line will snap!
Stretch him out!
Hold him!
He's gotta have about 2,000 horsepower in that thing.
Try 3,000!
Try five.
Get out of there.
I'm working on it.
Stop working on it and do it.
No, no, no, this my Bentley!
No!
No!
Get that case and run.
Move.
They thought this was gonna be a street fight.
What are you waiting for, Toretto?
No!
Letty, stop!
What are you gonna do?
I don't know why you're doing this, but I know one thing.
You love me.
And you are not gonna shoot me.
You should've given him the case, 'cause I won't chase you.
Okay.
I will just take it from a dead girl.
You willing to die for it?
Let's go, then.
Anything?
They're gone.
And DOD confirmed it was a nuclear football.
He's got an EMP and nuclear launch codes.
I don't know what it is, but they're building towards something.
Deckard?
He didn't make it.
I'm disappointed in you, Dom.
When push came to shove, you were gonna let Letty just walk away with the codes.
You got the codes!
Rhodes got the codes.
You made the choice to let her go.
And now I have to make one of my own.
They are adorable little things, aren't they?
God, I hope I don't hurt him.
Look, psychotic, I did exactly what you asked me to do.
Don't do this.
This is your doing.
My doing?
Da-dada.
Dada.
Da-da.
Please don't hurt him, I'm begging you.
I don't want you to beg.
I want you to learn.
Learn what?
I understand why you did what you did.
I really do.
Da-da.
But it was the wrong choice.
This is the consequence of that.
No!
No!
No!
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait.
Save your son!
No!
Can you pull up the footage from the guy in the alley?
Traffic cams.
I got you.
I knew it.
I recognize that guy.
That's Connor Rhodes.
I met him when I was working with Shaw's brother.
He wanted us to get the Nightshade device for him.
Connor Rhodes.
He's also linked to somebody I'd quite like to forget.
It's Mose Jakande.
Warlord who tried to get God's Eye.
Which means that's twice that Dom has messed up Cipher's business.
Everything you're feeling right now, this rage, a sense of loss, it's not real.
It's a survival instinct wired deep into our brains to ensure continuation of the species.
When early man would visit a watering hole, if they didn't watch their child, and it got snatched by a crocodile,
our brains would create a painful but instructional memory, so it would never happen again.
This idea of "family" that is so core with you, that rules your world,
it's a biological lie.
You don't have to accept it.
I don't.
Did you really think you could destroy two of my teams without any repercussions?
I wouldn't have even looked your way if you hadn't done that.
You didn't even know you had a kid.
You can thank me for that and start doing the job I'm asking you to do.
Help you start a war.
Is that what you think I want?
That's so limited.
I didn't take that football to start a war any more than I took your son to start a family.
Taking your son got me the codes.
The codes will get me the nukes and the nukes will get me what I want today, tomorrow, and every day after that.
And what's that?
Accountability.
The second I fire off one of those nukes,
I put the superpowers of this world on notice that, when they cross the line,
I'm gonna be there to hold them responsible.
Because the truth is, Dom, to the world out there,
I am the crocodile at the watering hole.
We've got one last job to do.
Cipher.
If I were you, I'd kiss my son.
Because whether you value it or not, all of this, your plane, your security, and you,
are still on this earth because of him.
The problem we've had with tracking Cipher is there's nothing to trace.
But now, we have Rhodes' information.
And we're getting snapshots of his data before it's scrubbed off the net.
That looks like somebody's bank account, so why don't we just go ahead...
It's a longitude.
Given the fact that Dom hit a Russian motorcade, it's safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead and bring up the map.
Good.
Let's start here and run the possibilities.
Yalta, Poltava...
It's like they just threw letters together.
Kronyurt.
It's "Vladovin."
What are you doing here?
What?
Told you I was gonna check in on you from time to time to see how you were doin'.
By the way, not so hot.
But there's nothing in Vladovin.
It's just ice.
That's funny.
Could've sworn there was a secret Russian naval base where they retrofitted Cold War submarines.
Well, technically, it's not Russian anymore.
The base was taken over by a terror group of military separatists about a month ago, and the Russians haven't taken it back yet, so there is a little window of opportunity here.
Russian submarines.
Nuclear football.
It sounds like everything we do, our legs gonna be blown off.
It sounds like you still number 11 on the list.
It sounds like you've changed since your little punk-ass facial hairs done came in.
Guys, guys.
Hey, we gotta call this in.
All the way up the chain.
That's good thinking, champ, except unfortunately, the Russian Minister of Defense got himself involved in a little incident on US territory, and the two governments aren't talking to each other for a while.
By the time they do, it'll be too late.
So, any other suggestions?
Yeah.
I got one.
How about we just stop them ourselves?
You're talking about a Russian military base.
Separatist.
Whatever.
It's suicide.
It's stopping World War III.
What's it gonna be, rook?
You gonna close your eyes on this one, too?
Pray that the apocalypse doesn't come knocking on your mama's front door?
Or, are you gonna saddle up, be a man, and save the entire goddamn world?
You know, I think I figured it out.
What's that?
Rule number three.
Which is?
There are no rules.
What'd I tell you, Luke?
I knew he'd get it in three.
Aerial transport leaves in an hour.
Take whatever vehicle you want.
All bets are off.
All bets are off?
Bets are off?
Do svidanya!
Letty, I don't like telling you this one bit.
But the game's changed.
Before, we were just trying to catch Dom, but now, after all this,
I want you to know, if I have to,
I'm gonna put him down.
Then you might have to take us both down.
I'm freezing, man.
This ain't for me.
I come from a different kind of lifestyle, brah.
Ladies know me.
They know where I'm at with it.
I tried to take a piss, I didn't even recognize myself.
Man, that's entirely too much information.
I'm just sayin'.
Well, one thing's for sure.
Dom's gotta be either working with them or making a trade, because no one would be this insane to hit this place without a damn army.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Speak of the devil.
All right, Dom, you're one step closer to that family reunion.
400 meters to base.
Prep the EMP.
Let's take these defenses down.
Gates are open.
Let's get this party started.
EMP is recharging.
How long?
Sixty seconds.
All right, Dom, you have one pulse left in that EMP.
That sub is heavily insulated.
You're gonna need to be right underneath it for this thing to work.
Come on.
Yes!
Two birds with one stone.
We've got control of the sub.
Dom, we are good.
Head over to the rendezvous.
Okay, Matty, let's take this baby for a spin.
Damn!
I think Cipher just rebooted that sub to slave its command system.
What the hell is he talking about?
In layman's terms, she just carjacked a submarine.
We can't let it get away.
There's the control room.
If you can get me into that wheelhouse,
I can tap the network and counter-hack Cipher.
Keep it from lowering into the water.
No, what we need to do is get me on that sub.
I find the weapons room and I can pull the launch chip before she can fire any of those nukes.
That is too crazy.
What you're saying is too dangerous.
We'll do both.
Knock, knock.
Five vehicles just breached the base.
They just don't give up, do they?
All right, let's haul ass, team.
Double time, double time!
Letty, let's roll!
Go!
Go, go, go!
Change of plans, Dom.
I'm sending you new coordinates.
Head there immediately.
I'm done.
I want my son.
I'll tell you when you're done.
Your team is in play.
Now, meet Rhodes and follow my instruction.
I've got you covered!
Go!
Move, move!
Get outta here!
Go, go, go!
Okay.
How do you like this?
Remote link has been severed.
I'll take care of this.
Hi, Ramsey.
She's regained control.
Damn it.
She's good.
They're entering the weapons room.
Oh, that's cute.
Pull!
Pull!
Roman, Roman!
We gotta find the chip, go!
Oh, she's slick.
Gonna have to do better than that, though.
Okay, now you're starting to piss me off.
Ramsey, how much time we talkin' here?
You're smart, but not smart enough.
She's locked me out.
Tej, I can't stop her.
You're gonna have to pull that chip.
I can't!
This thing's gone into attack mode!
The door's not gonna open until you pull the chip!
Tej, we got no idea what the hell we're looking for.
I got it!
What in the hell are you guys doin'?
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me, okay?
It'll be labeled "Guidance Go."
Guidance Go, Guidance Go...
Okay, I got somethin'.
What?
It says...
Do you understand that?
Wow.
Nasty.
Hmm.
Quite a show.
We're arming the nuke.
Nuke's going hot!
She's tryin' to fire this thing!
Roger that.
We're moving out.
Disable the nukes!
Roman, what are you seeing?
Come on, talk to me.
I don't see shit.
I'm holding on!
And we have a countdown.
What the hell is goin' on, man?
We're about to launch a nuclear missile, is what the hell is goin' on!
Pull the damn chip!
Countdown, countdown!
Look for a countdown!
What countdown?
The missiles need to activate to launch.
The countdown timer won't be in Russian.
The countdown...
Let's show the world what we've got.
No, no, no!
Don't press that!
I got it.
Something's wrong.
It won't launch.
Get that sub outta there.
Now!
Move your ass, Roman!
You all right?
There's nothing all right about any of this!
Let's go!
What about the missiles?
We got the chip.
No nukes for her.
Hell, yeah.
Let's roll.
Guys, we got company.
A lot of company!
All right, team, here's the plan.
There's a sea lock at the opening of the bay.
We get there first and close it, we can stop the submarine from escaping into open water and disappearing forever.
I've got the location.
It's 10 miles southwest.
Ten miles?
We're not gonna make it ten seconds!
Ah!
No, no, no!
This is not good!
What's the matter, Roman?
Forgot your snow tires?
Whoa!
You lovin' that Lambo now?
Whoa!
Ah!
All right, everyone.
We'll deal with that launch chip later.
Right now, I want that sub in deep water where no one can find it.
Find me the fastest route out of that bay.
Copy that.
Why are they shootin' at me?
Maybe 'cause you're in an orange Lamborghini, I don't know.
Shut up, Tej!
Dom...
Do you really wanna put that car in gear?
Do it.
Huh?
I didn't think so.
They're heading for the sea lock.
They're trying to trap the sub in the bay.
I should have taken care of this a long time ago.
Rhodes, take his team out.
I'm on it.
Roman, get in front of me!
Okay, y'all wanna play rough?
Now it's my turn.
Yeah, baby!
Guys, we got snowmobiles on the right.
They're gonna flank us!
No, they ain't!
Oh, shit!
Tej!
Roman, hold tight, I'm on the way!
I don't wanna go swimmin'!
No!
Really, Tej?
Oh, no, no, no!
Oh, shit!
Roman, grab your door!
Tej!
Grab the door, Roman!
It's so cold!
Shit!
Oh, shit!
Whoa!
Whoo!
Yeah!
What is going on?
Roman, hang on!
Tej!
Get me off of this thing!
Tej!
Come on!
Argh!
All right.
I've had enough of this shit!
Number 11, my ass!
Yo, shrinkage!
We got a sub to catch.
Get in!
What?
Depressurization alert in the cargo hold.
Drop it to 10,000 feet.
I know how much these people mean to you.
So I will let you pick the first target.
I don't pick a target from a mile away.
I stand face to face and look 'em dead in the eye.
Okay.
The wife it is.
Nice plane.
I'm gonna enjoy having this.
Hey, don't go gettin' any ideas.
You and planes don't have a good history.
No shit.
Okay, let's go, Scarface.
These assholes ain't gonna kill themselves.
Pull up surveillance right now.
Surprise.
You're supposed to be dead.
We have a security breach in the cargo hold.
Take care of it now.
Jesus, Mum.
You're supposed to avoid the nerves.
Oh, shut up.
Don't be such a baby.
Get to the pilot.
He's got the second key.
Wait for my signal.
Give Cipher my regards.
Did Toretto hold up his end of the deal?
He gave us this little thing here.
No, no, no.
Don't touch.
You can track Cipher with this, but you can't do this on your own.
There's gotta be two of ya.
Fine.
I've got contacts.
No, you're gonna take your brother.
Oh, dear...
Yes.
Toretto knows where he is.
He's got this thing.
It can see everything.
It's like...
It's called the Devil's Bum Hole or something.
It's called the God's Eye.
Yeah, well, whatever.
There's no way I'm using Owen, all right?
He's a lost cause.
He's your brother, Decks.
He's my son.
He's our family.
And our family don't die in bloody cages.
How can you talk like that about Owen?
I can't believe you.
You've gone and upset me.
You've really upset your mother.
Call yourself a brother?
You're...
Look, come here...
Mum.
Okay, okay.
Every time.
Owen.
In position.
Go.
I'm in.
I've got the package, Toretto.
All 12 pounds of him.
Ah.
Dada.
Dada.
You made me miss my shot.
What you think you're doing?
Looking at you dead in the eye.
That was for Elena.
Rhodes.
He's no longer with us.
Rhodes picked the wrong target.
Congratulations, Dom.
You just killed your son.
You're wrong.
I just saved him.
And you just took your foot off the tiger's neck.
All right, governor, it's gonna get noisy.
This is for your ears.
Good?
Let's go.
No!
Stop him!
Do not let him get off this plane!
We got another problem.
That truck's got enough missiles to take us all out.
Then don't give 'em a target.
Everybody, get in front of us, line up, and we'll take the hit.
What?
I need to switch cars right now!
Roman, here comes the bad part.
What?
Hang in there, guys.
We're almost to the lock.
It's easy for you to say when your ass ain't on fire.
All right, little man, this might be a little scary, but it's gonna be a lot of fun.
How's the music, good?
Ah.
They're locking on.
Sorry, guys, I got no tricks left.
What do we do now?
We start prayin'!
Hell, yeah!
There's Dom!
What, is this guy on our side now?
Who the hell cares?
He just saved our ass!
Good to be riding with you again, man.
Toretto just cleared the way for them.
Someone, give me something!
Torpedoes are ready.
Then launch them!
Shit.
Take the wheel!
I ain't taking' shit!
Take the wheel!
Where you goin'?
This is crazy!
Speed up!
Left and back!
What?
Turn the goddamn wheel to the left really quickly!
Boom, baby!
Goin' for a ride.
Back in a sec.
Where's that smile?
Ah.
There it is.
You were gonna shoot a baby?
You sick bastard.
You're not gonna wanna see this.
Is that you or him?
Him.
Good.
The torpedoes missed.
They're gonna reach the lock before the sub does.
The hell they are.
Get ready for this.
Oh, shit!
We're gonna need a bigger truck.
It's right under us!
Get out the way!
Get us out of here!
Why are you always yelling?
This bitch is crazy!
Look out!
That's not good.
That's not good.
Please tell me there's nothing to worry about!
We got this.
That's my girl.
The sub's too close.
We ain't making it to the gate in time.
We're just going to let it get away?
Not if I know Dom.
You lose, Dom.
I destroyed two of your teams.
I killed your red-headed boyfriend.
And I put two killers on your untraceable plane.
You lost the minute you interrupted my honeymoon.
Now guess who I'm coming for.
Put a heatseeker on him now.
Now!
Fire!
That's a goddamn heatseeker coming at us!
Peel off!
Head to the shore!
All right.
Come and get it.
No, no, no.
Dive!
Dive!
This...
This is for my son.
Dom!
You're out of bullets, Deckard.
Not like I'm gonna need a gun to take care of you.
How did you find me?
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch.
Resourceful.
You have a lot to answer for, Cipher.
What you've put my family through.
My mother.
I'm gonna make sure that never happens again.
To anyone.
There is only one flaw in your plan.
What's that?
Only one of us has a parachute.
Told you this would be fun.
Time to land, boys.
You know I never left you, Letty.
I know.
And you know I never will.
I know.
I have so much to tell you.
Yeah, you do.
And you can start with that bitch.
Now, that's Dominic Toretto.
Hey, Dom!
I'm just throwin' it out there, we need to get up outta here 'cause there's all kinda nuclearism happening under this ice.
Relax.
Without the trigger chips, those nukes are harmless.
Okay.
So we good, then.
Let me go on and get my young selfie levels up.
You realize this is classified, right?
Not today.
Unbelievable.
All right, can we get up outta here, now?
I'm freezin'!
It's okay.
Don't worry.
He's gonna be here soon.
I get it.
Y'all got a lot in common.
Computer hacks, God's Eye, geeks, nerd...
You know.
But we got a lot in common, too, right?
Like what?
We walk in the room and we're oozing' sex appeal.
Me and you, hip to hip, is a problem.
I'm askin' a real question right now.
Is it gonna be Revenge of the Nerds or The Dark Knight?
Huh?
To be honest, I like both of you.
But just before we get into all of that, let me ask you one question.
You can ask me anything.
Anything.
What's my last name?
When you guys figure it out, then, I guess you can let me know.
It's gonna be Parker.
That's all that really matters.
- Jones.
- Mrs. Parker.
Right?
Hey, Mrs. Parker...
Hey.
Letty.
I wanted to thank you.
No need.
Well...
Cipher's still on the loose.
There's been some reports she's in Athens, but she won't be nuking any cities anytime soon.
Thanks to you guys.
So, I got you a party favor.
This can't be good.
Your record's been cleared.
Full reinstatement.
You've got your job back.
That is, if you want it.
If I want?
Mmm-hmm.
You know, after 16 years, I figure it's time for a little break.
Wow.
Daddy's stayin' home.
Nobody.
Keep in touch.
Ah.
Hang on a second.
This could be interesting.
What made you think I'd do it?
Brotherhood.
I saw that look you gave Cipher, knew you wanted revenge.
Glad I did it.
I can't believe you went to see my mother.
All this fuss over you.
Yes.
Elena, I promised to keep our son safe.
And now, he always will be.
I wanna introduce you to the most important person in my universe.
One who never gave up on me.
He's beautiful.
You've heard me say that you never turn your back on family,
and I wanna thank you all for never turning your back on me.
You wanna meet them?
All right.
Everyone, meet Brian.
To Brian!
Welcome to the family, Brian.
Okay, I guess it's my turn to say grace.
We thank you for giving us family.
We sit here in praise.
Thank you for giving us the strength...
HAVANA, CUBA
We swap in parts from Ford Plymouths and Cadillac.
My grandfather bought it in 1957.
When he died it passed to my father.
Then my brother and now to me.
Look at this, this is an engine from a boat.
- No way.
- Yeah!
Whatever it takes to keep it running!
This is a cuban spirit.
Your spirit, keep it up.
Never ever lose that.
Dom..
It's your cousin..
He's in trouble, come quickly!
Come on, come on.
Please don't do this, Understand my problem.
You should show your people some respect.
I am really scared.
Are you ready for this, family?
This is Havana!
Be fast!
Be safe!
But don't be last.
Racers ready...?
Go...!
Stop.
Can I help you with that?
Look out...!

We got an army of cars driving themselves.
Send backup!
Send S.W.A.T!
I don't care if you send the goddamn boy scout...
- Just send up some help!
- Now that's Dom.
Faster, faster!
The motorcade just turned on 7th.
Perfect.
Make it rain.
Target immobilized.
You are up Dom.
- Who the hell is that?
- What is he doing?
What the hell are you waiting for?
Shoot him!
Come on, come on!
I'm out.
Shit.
Don't worry sir.
This car is bulletproof.
You'll be safe in here.
- Give me the case.
- Give him the case.
These are nuclear launch codes.
We cannot give it to him.
What is he doing now?
He just cut a hole in our gas tank.
- Look out!
- Wait, wait, wait!
See you later...
We have a possible threat incoming.
Raise the barricade, As soon as possible.
We've lost power, get to your positions now.
Engaging target.
He's beneath the Sub.
I'm loosing control, mayday, mayday.
I'm going down.
You're driving.
I said it from the beginning.
No way, I'm not driving.
Thank you for giving us family.
Thank you for giving us the strength.
HAVANA, CUBA

Dom..
It's your cousin..
He's in trouble, come quickly!
Come on, come on.
Please don't do this, Understand my problem.
You know I can't make living without my car.
Isn't my problem bro.
Dominic Toretto..
I heard about you.
Welcome to my island.
Why he hooking up my cousin's car?
In the morning, I gave it to him..
He can't pay..
I take the car.
I just need a few more days.
Few more days isn't part of the deal.
Come on..
You make a deal you gotta live up to it.
You make a deal You gonna live up to it.
Gonna live up to it?
So you are one of those types..
You take everyone's ride and then ship it back to the states.
You should show your people some respect.
You watch your mouth.
Now you got a problem.
I'm gonna keep it about the cars.
I am really scared.
You want a car?
Get it the right way.
- How?
- Race war.
I already own it, bro.
Not that car.
Mine.
Dom, his car is the fastest car in the Island.
Do you know what he has under the hood?
Do you know, it doesn't matter what's under a hood?
The only thing that matters is who's behind the wheel.
- You think so?
- I know so.
Then race his car.
We ain't racing a quarter mile here.
We race the cuban mile.
Done!
I appreciate you what you're trying to do.
My car is the slowest car on the Island.
Was...!
Pull the seats the doors the battery..
It ain't the motor, take it off.
- Laughing gas?
- Nah, Fed.
This is cuban NOS.
You guys are crazy.
- What are you doing?
- Warm as turbo.
Pull that back in line..
Hold on!
Old trick used to play.
In case of emergencies.
You know that's way too much booze for that engine.
- It's going to be fast.
- It's gonna be a bomb.
Only needs to go a mile.
Are you ready for this, family?
This is Havana!
Be fast!
Be safe!
But don't be last.
Racers ready...?
Go...!
Stop.
That car belongs in the trash bro.
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.
Let's go.
- Go steer.
- Si.
Adios, Toretto.
Ok, buster...
Let's see if this works.
That's impossible..
Look out.
A deal's a deal.
You own my car.
And you earn my respect.
Keep your car.
Your respect is good enough for me.
Yo Cousin.
Sorry 'bout your car,
Your's was too slow for a Torreto anyway.
Your Impala.
Are you serious?
Look at that smile
I love it when you smile.
Make me happy.
I think this place makes you happy.
It's like it speaks to you.
You remember that guy?
The Racer and his dad.
- The one with the boat engine.
- Yeah!
- Yeah.
- Of course.
I was looking at them, and I..
And I couldn't help but too imagine what you'd be like, if you were dad.
No, no, no...
I'm not pregnant.
Is that what you want?
It's not about what I want or what you want..
It's about why we haven't asked the question.
Can I help you with that?
- What?
- You need a hand?
Yeah, I think I do.
Sounds like you're not getting any fuel.
Yeah.
See if we can get some power into it.
What brings you to Cuba?
The same thing that brings everyone else to Cuba.
Culture.
People.
Beauty.
What brings you to Cuba?
- Work!
- Must be casual Friday.
How is that honeymoon going Dom?
Your fuel relay is missing.
I know.
I'd love to play games.
Beaten the bests alone.
I'm kinda in a rush, so if you got something to say...
Oh this is a very different game that I can assure you.
This...?
There is something much greater at work here.
This is fate.
- I choose to make my own fate.
- Not today.
This is the road you take to your apartment every morning.
What else is different, Dom?
The Santiago's closed?
Did you have to cross two blocks to go get your cuban coffee?
So, what is it?
Black, no sugar?
Yeah..
I've put a lot of work into getting you here in today.
Now that I'm here, what do you want?
I want you to work for me.
Work for you?
Well, I could have saved you a lot of time then.
See, I don't work for anyone.
You can't walk away from this Dom.
We're gonna have this conversation one way or the other.
See that's the funny thing about fate.
It's cunning.
It can bring you beautiful things, and it can also bring you moments like this.
I will hear that you want to work for me.
You're gonna betray your brothers, abandon your code, shatter your family.
See, your team..
Is about to go up against the only thing they can't handle.
What's that?
You.
Oh, and Dom, I wouldn't mention this to anyone.
They are gonna be hitting us with everything they've got.
So, we wanna engage with maximum speed.
Neutralize the shooters and then move on to our objective.
There are two things I want you to keep in mind,
Number one,
I choose you for this squad because you are the most fearsome warriors on the planet.
And number two,
You go out there, you do your job.
And you take 'em down.
Everyone...
And I mean everyone..
Manice and pedice at the mall.
Later on today.
I don't wanna play anymore.
Alright, let's go, girls.
Let's go, let's go.
- Final 2 minutes.
- Quite the cheering section.
Oh yeah.
That's moms they come out to sport the kids.
Except there seems to be more moms than kids,
Way more like moms and..
Yeah, it's a big soccer job.
Let's go girls.
So your intel was spot on...
A democly 7 EMP weapon that went missing in the gulf.
Arms dealer from the Liberation front have it in Berlin.
- Shit.
- This thing can wipe out..
An entire electrical grid in a major city.
No lights, no power, instant stone age.
Chloe, Maya...
You can't let her run by you like that.
- Let's go, let's go.
- Hey, Hobbs.
This is a class 4 WMD.
Do you have any idea what's at stake here...?
Yes...!
I know exactly what is at stake here, okay?
If Pink Butterflies beat my Red Dragon that means we lose the championship.
Which means I have 20 little girls who are crying..
And that's not a good thing.
Which then means I have to spend a lot of time in ice cream shops and lot of time in Tay-Tay concerts.
- Tay-Tay?
- Yep?
Taylor Swift.
You gotta be shitting me Get it together.
Let's go girls.
We need you to do this,
Lot of lives are at stake.
I need to be clear here.
US Government can not sanction this operation in anyway.
You're on your own.
This thing goes sideways you don't just get burned, you go to prison.
And there's nothing we can do to get you out.
Let me tell you something.
The only thing that I love more than saving lives..
Is my daughter.
So you don't shut up with this government bullshit right now and start showing some team spirit and respect for the Red Dragons.
I'm gonna have all 20 of them lined up kick you right in the Tay-Tay.
Go, Dragons!
Say it again.
- Go, Dragons!
- Good boy.
Go Dragons..
Go Dragons..
Go, he's open...
Go, Yup!
Yes!
That is my daughter right there!
Yes!
Ah, yes, come here.
- Awesome.
- Nice job.
Daddy's gotta go to work?
Oh yeah, daddy's gotta go to work.
Now, you gonna need to get a team that you can trust.
Oh, I already got one.
- Hey, Dom.
- Hey, Hobbs.
We got a job in Berlin, and I need a favor, brother.
No problem.
I grab the team and meet you in Berlin.
Thanks man.
I'll see you soon.
You were only to supposed to create a diversion, Roman.
That was a diversion.
How many of the damn explosives did you use?
I do not know, Tez.
All of it?
- Wait, all of it?
- Roman, Jesus!
- Christ!
- You have more of your fan club ahead.
They're still on us.
These guys are taking this personal.
Roman, we just blown up their facility and stole their EMP.
Other than your doctor's cold fingers,
I'd say it's about as personal as it can get.
- Phase 2.
- Phase 2?
So you just gonna keep that to yourself?
What happen to Phase 1?
What about that part?
Yeah, remember the airplane?
Everyone drove their cars out but you.
I told you my engine seized up.
It's your balls that seized up?
Just follow my lead, okay?
And Roman, whatever you do.
Don't think.
Tez, drop it.
Bomb's away.
Split now!
Holy shit!
Look out...!
- Great plan Tez.
- Just so you know.
You miss some.
I'll just wait for it.
Oh...
Shit!
I hate you, Tez!
Got your ass.
You good?
I'll see you when it's done.
Alright.
Great job, team.
Let's break up and meet me at the safe house.
Hell of a job, brother.
When we can get back to the base.
Beers on me.
You lost your god damn mind, Toretto!
Toretto you put hands on that thing, you're gonna have the whole world coming for you including me.
I don't know what you're doing but you better think about this, Toretto.
It ain't too late to stop this.
It is now.
That some bitch just crossed us..
What?
Wait a second, what are you talking about?
- Dom took the EMP.
- Bullshit.
Where are you?
It's too late for me.
Get out of here.
Saw that look in his eyes.
I've seen that look before.
Dominic Toretto just went rogue.
Alright, I got his phone records, y'all.
It's a whole bunch of calls to untraceable numbers.
Burner phone, right?
Nah.
Scrambled.
Same number but they got some sort of micro-router..
To bury the signal path which means Dom is clearly..
Communicating with somebody that is above our pay grade.
Look, I do not know Dom as well as you, but if we just look at the facts.
Dom's been having highly encrypted conversation with some mysterious person.
He took out Hobbs.
He stole the EMP, now he's disappeared.
So what're you saying?
Maybe we should consider the fact that..
Hobb's right.
Dom did go rogue.
- Letty.
- Before you judge the man,
Remember you're breathing now because he saved your life.
You just gonna let her bump your shoulder like that
I'm just saying it out..
That was a little aggressive.
What're you gonna do.
Email her?
Chick..
No no, wait, fellas.
Thank you.
Well, this is an exciting new look.
That's a little tight on the crotch as always.
What boyband bus did she fallen off?
My new junior associate.
He's working with me on this.
All yours.
Mr Nobody and I have been given the authority to get you out of this.
All you have to do is agree to the terms and you're free.
Restraining wills, talking about, what terms?
Confess to your crimes in Berlin.
Treason, international espionage.
Massive destruction of civic property.
You do that, we close the case.
And?
And the DSS blacklist.
Sure Germany loves that.
Officially you'll be a criminal.
Woah, woah, woah.
You need to work on your delivery alright.
Unofficially.
You're off the books.
Come work with me.
- I'm not a criminal.
- Luke Come on.
Labels.
There is no confession.
There are no back room deals.
Got myself into this, I'm gonna get myself out of it.
You know that.
I do and that's what I told them.
Well, there you have it.
Good luck in the course, man!
What about your daughter?
You know, if you're not gonna do it your country, at least do it for your kid.
Big mistake kid.
Hold on.
Look, look.
He's still working from the manual.
I mean, he doesn't even really know the rules.
Oh come on.
Give him a break.
Get a break.
Luke?
I appreciate that.
- It's good to see you, Nobody.
- You too.
Rule No.1, know your audience.
I gave you your shot, you shit the bed.
Now I'm gonna show you how to get this done.
- You're dead cop!
- Dead!
Well, well, well...
Luke Hobbs behind bars.
Would you look at that?
The band cop got it's day.
You know, that color looks good on you.
Yeah.
Look a whole hell of a lot better with your blood on it.
Yeah.
Good luck with that, Hercules.
Gone bad.
Huh?
Such a cliche.
Ah well.
Welcome to the club.
I wouldn't get that twisted son.
We ain't in no club.
We got nothing in common.
And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.
You bring the shovel did you?
Cause it's 38 feet of steel and concrete.
What's up big dog?
Better get to dig in.
You wanker.
Move..
Say that again.
If I say it again, It will be to acorpse.
I'm going to enjoy this.
Welcome back, Dom.
Nice job out there.
Excited about tonight?
You're going on this?
You're with me Dom.
- Showing me your shoe collection?
- Yup.
A pair for every occasion.
There's enough guns here to outfit a small army.
Huh?
Oh this is just the tip of the iceberg.
You know what I like about you, Dom.
You're a genuine outlaw.
I mean, you're a man who lives by his own rules.
Which was surprising because when I saw you in Cuba, I heard about a guy who almost killed you with a motorcycle and you..
let him keep his car?
- Oh, that confused you?
- Hmm.
Of course I could've taken his car.
But it's about something bigger.
This way...
I changed them.
That's not your responsibility.
- That's who I am.
- Is it?
Let me ask you something Dom, what's the best thing in your life?
- Family.
- No, it's not.
But if you're being honest?
It's the 10 seconds between start and finish, when you're not thinking about anything.
No family, not obligations, just you.
Being free.
I gotta tell you.
This whole saving the world...
Robin Hood nonsense you've been doing recently...
It's bullshit.
It's not you.
Be who you are.
Why live only a quarter mile at a time, when you can live your whole life that way?
See all those blow that muscles will give you.
All show and no..
Well I got plenty of goal.
You must have misplaced that.
When I kicked your ass up in down that office of yours.
Yeah.
Just like you Brits, rewriting History, huh?
All I know.
It was not me who was thrown out of a 4 storey window.
Jumped.
I jumped out of a 4 storey window.
Saving my partner's life.
Because where I'm from, we don't settle fight by throwing bombs.
Well, that's funny, because where I'm from, we don't need women to run to our rescue.
I mean, do you really believe you could stand in front of me?
And beat me in a straight up old fashioned fist fight?
Let me tell you something.
Me and you...
One on one, no one else around.
I will beat your ass like a Cherokee drum.
Maybe one day we will find that out.
Oh, you better hope that day never comes.
I said no, Mr. Nobody.
I'm not leaving this cell.
I'll get out my way.
The right way.
- Get back to your cell.
- It's just a malfunction.
- Get back!
- Just a malfunction.
Don't let him get away.
Hobbs!
I've been waiting a long time for this.
Keep waiting bitch!
Rubber bullets, big mistake.
Ah, took longer than I expected.
- 2 questions.
- Yeah.
- My daughter?
- With your sister.
- Toretto?
- That's interesting you ask.
This is my new base, welcome to Nowhere.
Nice little stair for you.
Listen, It's something I don't wanna talk to you about...
Hey, listen guys.
Thanks..
Whoa, whoa, what handcuff.
What is this?
It's called the abuse of power.
You told me to round 'em up.
I told you that...
hand..
Cut 'em loose.
Oh man, this is embarrassing.
I'm sorry guys, what do I have?
This is how you treat old friends?
Friend?
We don't even really know who the hell this guys is.
It does not matter who I am, Tez I'm like Nobody ok?
Nobody, then who is he?
He's nothing he's like less than me.
Clearly we're getting nowhere, with nobody.
I've been in here for 4 hours, my ribs are sore.
I don't know about y'all, but I'm out.
- I wouldn't recommend that.
- What?
Well, thanks to your bust Berlin job.
You all made interpol's top 10 most wanted list.
Top 10?
Uh-huh.
That's alright.
Well, not you.
What do you mean?
You just missed the cut, you're number 11.
- So.
- I missed it?
- Yeah.
- That's impossible.
What number did they come in at?
Six, eight, nine...
Ten.
She's Ten?
That's impossible, there is no way she's at 10.
Oh, She's definitely at 10.
How about we focus on someone who we're not gonna find out in anybody's list?
We are awaiting hard confirmation, but...
I believe that's the cyber terrorist known as Cipher.
Wait, no, Cipher's an organization.
Not a person.
Not according to our sources.
- What does she want?
- I don't know.
Cipher is like a digital active God.
They, she, can manipulate world systems under shadows.
Anything that can be hacked..
And here is the kicker.
You will never find her linked to any other.
Her digital identity is scrubbed every few seconds worldwide.
So basically, she is the boogeyman.
Yeah, she is.
One of the hottest boogeyman I have ever seen, I mean...
If y'all know her, tell her to get extra boy.
- What are you, 12?
- That was my scene.
Let's just say.
People are scared of the hacker group Anonymous.
But even anonymous won't mess with her.
What the hell does any of this have to do with us?
Probably nothing, Letty.
But...
I do find it interesting, apparently for some reason.
She's now working with this guy.
He's already delivered a fully operational EMP into her hands.
Detonate that, they can turn any city in the world into a war zone.
So then what is it that you're suggesting?
Maybe we find Dom huh?
Well, first let's catch him and then figure out
- why he's turned.
- So y'all want us...
To track Dom.
And I know Roman, it's kinda a big job.
- It's impossible.
- Which is why...
I'm bringing in an extra pair of hands.
Ah.
My day just got a whole hell of a lot better.
Mr. Nobody you want to tell me why you just put me in a room with this teen crumpeting criminal, some bitch.
You got a big mouth on a small head.
Coming from prisoner 6753.
Don't think we've forgotten everything that you've done.
We're not...
teaming up with this guy.
Let's get one thing clear.
I ain't on your team.
I don't care about you, you crew...
Your little family.
I'm here for Cipher.
You gonna do apply for a job, Head-asshole?
You don't think that tight t-shirt is cutting off the circulation to your brain.
You should get bigger size.
Cipher came to me first.
Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.
When I said no, she went off to my brother.
Oh Yes.
Brother Owen who could forget him?
Former hell-raiser and current guest, at a nasty little black site prison.
Cipher corrupted him left him for dead.
So if I get a shot to take her down, believe me, flicks I'm taking it.
You're taking my boot right up your ass.
Guys, guys, guys.
The fastest way to find Cipher is through Toretto.
Now aside from myself, there's only two men in the world, that have ever managed to actually track him..
Down with any success.
And guess what.
They're both standing in front of me right now.
So like it or not, you two are gonna work together.
You got that?
I'm gonna take that as a yes.
Am I the only one seeing this?
Oh, this oughtta be good.
Use God's eye.
We put our lives on the line..
Running around the world trying to figure this thing out.
It can find anybody, right?
Let's use it to find Dom.
Roman, that is a great idea.
Did you hear that?
Great idea.
- And no, no!
No pointing out.
- Mr. Nobody.
Let's fire it up.. huh?
Got him.
He's in London.
Wait, we have got a 2nd match in Hong Kong.
- Bejing and Seole.
- And Tokyo.
And just about every other major city on the planet.
And so...
God's eye was where we start.
Cipher's already created an evasion that masked her location by..
Pinging random spots all over the globe.
But it was a good thought Roman.
So she's made my programme obsolete.
And that Ramsey..
- Is why are you here.
- See, simple solutions... aren't gonna cut it here slick.
Why are you looking at me when you're saying that?
Wait a second, wait, wait.
Simple solutions might just cut it.
In order for God's eyes to give up all this false pings,
Means they have to be using a free relay.
Watch these two.
Which means it has a decaying sync quantanizer.
Which we can reverse.
And track it back to the originating source and find Dom's true location.
Telling you, they got skills.
That was my idea.
That's what I was saying, remember in there?
Alright.
Let's try this.
It's working..
Time you wanna take your manual and start organizing first response...
Let's get a hold of our internatio...
He's still..
Yes, like first baby shit.
Yes, we've tried those location... wanna mobilize.
Let's get a hold of a, better asshole.
No one respects you, over.
Get away from me.
Alright they are not in China..
Or Russia.
Europe's clear.
But this one's not going away.
This is interesting.
Why?
Because that's here.
Did you all enjoy that?
Next generation concussion grenade.
It scrambles your senses.
Don't worry, It'll wear off in an hour.
Probably.
Hello, Deckard.
Nice to see you again.
Look at this, bodies not even cold Dom.
Your family's already replacing you.
You chose the loosing team.
I guess your brother is smarter than you.
Smart move embedding God's eye into the mainframe.
Irritating to make me have to come all the way down here to get it, but.
Let's go.
Dom!
You're gonna turn your back on family?
Just like that?
Let's go.
You okay?
That wasn't him.
I don't know what she's got on him.
But that wasn't Dom.
- Bryan would know what to do.
- No.
We can't bring Bryan and Mia into this.
We agreed on that.
I know.
Back there was that for her, for me, or you?
Or was it either necessary?
Necessary?
Nothing is necessary.
Everything is a choice.
I simply made one but so did you.
You could have stopped me, but you chose not to do.
I wonder what Letty thought about that.
The problem of putting your foot on a Tiger's neck... is you can never let it up.
I think I need to remind you why you chose to be here.
Dom.
Sorry.
You shoudn't have come.
Nothing's gonna get me away.
Now she has the three of us.
You wanna see him?
See papa.
Papa.
When I realized I was pregnant.
You had just find out Letty was alive.
So I decided when Letty and you go back from your honeymoon.
I was going to tell you.
And then she took us before I had the chance.
I call him Michaels.
That his middle name.
I thought his father should give him first name.
I'm sorry, Dom.
There is nothing to be sorry for.
Whatever happens...
Just save our son.
Your son.
-
Good visit?
I know.
I know what you're thinking.
I just let the guards go, so there is only two opponents in the room.
Rhodes has the gun, so you'll take him out first, I know you.
And then you're thinking.
Elena is a cop, maybe the two of you can fight your way out of here.
So much to think about.
Let me make it easier for you.
Do with it as you wish.
Have you heard of choice theory Dom?
There's a bunch of axiems but only two you really need to concern yourself with,
One.
The only person's behavior we can control is our own.
And two, the only thing we can truly give another person is information, so let me give you some.
You see this cameras in here?
The moment you make a move, highly paid men with weapons, will make there way into this room.
With one very...
specific instruction.
It's not to save me.
It's to kill your son.
And that's a lot of bullets.
And it only takes one for you to loose everything.
So, I have to ask you, because...
I know family is so important to you.
Is that really a choice you wanna make?
Because I'm ready as you are.
I pull this trigger, and God knows I wanna..
I'll kill everyone on this plane...
I still couldn't get in there.
Cause you here manipulate this system.
Since I'm alone!
I got no choice!
I don't think so.
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch.
Damn it..
She wiped it off.
Took God's eye.
That was the one thing we could use to find him.
We lost everything.
- Yeah, princess?
- Find it to rail.
But I've got couple of minutes to spare.
If you want me to send you to the hospital again.
- Yo Rules!
- First off,
- That's not my name.
- Little nobody.
- Don't call me that.
- Oh that's definitely stinky.
Great do me a favor, and tell your majesty over there, that we're gonna find Toretto.
We find Toretto together as a team.
When this is all over, you have me to slap that whickest biscuit right off his face.
Wait a minute, guys.
I think Decker's actually onto something.
How do you think Dom and Cipher got into the country without us knowing?
- Ghost flights.
- That untraceable aircraft it was all internet conspiracy stuff.
It's not.
Satellites and radar grids...
All across the globe shift.
Like an ocean.
And they've got channels that open and close.
And theoretically, if you know the right people who...
Know the right patterns.
You can fly right through the blind's box... can't be intercepted.
So you know where Dom is headed?
Yeah, New York.
You see there Luke..
You guys...
are gonna get along just great.
Which proves, rule number two, you never lose everything.
Fire up the chopper.
Guys, have a bowl and a Big Apple.
Are we travelling like this again?
Because Dom took God's Eye, so we need to stay off the grid.
But like this?
Look here man.
Before I throw up in my mouth...
Let me ask you what are we doing here?
That's a good question, Roman.
Let me show you.
Welcome to our new base of operations.
Now seriously, what is this place?
This... is heaven.
The agency garage.
We call it the toy shop.
This is where we house every vehicles seized from drug dealers of East coast.
Now.
Mr nobody said..
If we're gonna have a chance of catching Dom..
We're gonna have to be damn fast.
Maybe this could help.
We got a tank.
750 horsepower.
6.6 liter V8 Duramax engine.
With the M153 probe remotely operated weapon station on top.
You didn't get this from drug dealers.
No.
No that...
United State's army weaponry.
See the army developing machines like this the soldiers could drive from a mile way so they can stay safe.
And alive.
But luckily..
There is a back up driver seat for those of us who like to get more..
Hands on.
I'm sitting there wondering this whole time when this thing feeling badly and she's getting fact.
No one is getting hands on it.
She doesn't go on some streets.
I'm in love.
Again?
No.
No...
That's a million dollar show car.
The point is to not draw attention.
It's reverse psychology.
Dom will never see it coming.
It's neon orange,
The international space station would see it coming.
Go choose anything less inspeculous.
No no.
This is ridiculous.
Hey my man, you can put that down right there.
This is a gift.
A real gift.
I know what you're doing.
I like your beard.
You're blanta.
Black santa?
No, I'm serious.
Put it down right here..
What are you doing?
Engine's mis-firing, I gotta check it out.
No.
That's not part of the plan, Dom.
Clearly..
But unless you want the engine to cease on the job,
You have five minutes.
I want another visual.
I got an ATM
I don't like this.
I want to see Toretto.
There are no more cameras.
Then find something.
Punch in on something reflective A car mirror, anything..
- You know who I am?
- That's why I'm here.
You know what I'm capable of.
It's why I'm here.
I'll give you until I finish my cup up.
And I'm fucking thirsty.
I got limited time.
So won't take up too much of yours.
Oh no.
No, you've already taken everything I have of value, Mr. Toretto,
What more could you possibly want?
To give you something back.
Talk to me.
Something's not right here.
First time I saw my son... was behind a bulletproof glass.
When he reached me, I couldn't hold on.
It's the worst pain I ever felt..
I know you know exactly how that feels.
Maybe we could change that..
I think..
You are about to suggest something really dodgy Mr Toretto.
It's why I'm here.
Just punch in on something, I'm not liking this.
Something is not right.
- Rhodes, you close?
- Yeah.
- Go.
- The delivery truck's moving.
Captain Deckard Shaw, distinguished himself by acts of gallantry of the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.
His bold actions saved the lives of hostages and his team mates.
Recommendation:
Victoria Cross.
Highest honor the British Government has ever given.
To a traitor.
Some about this old thing just doesn't add up to me.
Well then don't do the same kind of funny math,
It says a DSS agent who has a soul to stop a valid stolen EMP.
Sound familiar huh?
Wanna give me a hand?
- On three?
- Yeah.
One two..
You know, you can tell this in another letter..
But maybe we could've caused some serious damage.
- Yes, we could have.
- Yeah.
Shame I'll have to punch you, head of defend, when this is all over.
Ah well.
With all due respect, Captain,
When this whole thing is over we're gonna find a location and I'm gonna knock your teeth so far down your throat.
You're gonna stick a toothbrush right up in your ass to brush up.
Give me God's eyes.
- God's eye active.
- Thanks.
Let's find us some Russian.
That spy with my little lie...
Minister of defense.
We land back in Moscow by nine.
Here's the latest defense report, All the items in yesterday's meet.
Upload this coordinates to Dom's nav.
Copy that.
He's in the third car.
It's a guard class limousine.
Where's my team?
- Where's his team?
- There's no sign of 'em yet.
They are off the grid.
Probably just bunker down somewhere.
Closing in on him.
You guys ready?
One thing I can guarantee you Dom.
No one's ready for this.
I want every with chip with the GEODIE exploits in a two mile radius around that motorcade now.
There's over a thousands of them.
Hack 'em all.
It's zombie time.
I'd buckle up if I were you.
AUTO-DRIVE ACTIVATED.
Hey...!
Target the motorcade.
And here they come.
What is going on?
Ouch.
Drive fast!
Police escort down..
Take out the lead and follow cars.
Drive!
Drive!
- Two more down.
- Still a new warranty.
There's more cars ahead of us.
Shoot their engines.
Oh God!
We got an army of cars driving themselves.
Send backup!
Send S.W.A.T!
I don't care if you send the goddamn boy scout...
- Just send up some help!
- Now that's Dom.
Faster, faster!
The motorcade just turned on 7th.
Perfect.
Make it rain.
Target immobilized.
You are up Dom.
- Who the hell is that?
- What is he doing?
What the hell are you waiting for?
Shoot him!
Come on, come on!
I'm out.
Shit.
Don't worry sir.
This car is bulletproof.
You'll be safe in here.
- Give me the case.
- Give him the case.
These are nuclear launch codes.
We cannot give it to him.
What is he doing now?
He just cut a hole in our gas tank.
Good work, Dom.
Meet you at the pick-up.
I think I know where my team's at.
- Where?
- Right in front of me.
This is on you.
Get out of there, Dom.
Guys, I know why Dom's here.
Police scanners are saying he's stolen Nuclear Football.
It's over, Toretto.
Get your ass out of the car now.
That's how you wanna play this?
Let's play.
Don't do this, Dom.
- What're you doing?
- It's a trap!
Now I know what it feels like be every cop ever chasing us.
I'm gonna get a little close and I ped him.
Oh, so you just gonna take Dom?
Little Nobody has clearly lost his little mind.
I'm on him.
Easy, work together.
- Look out!
- Wait, wait, wait!
Oh shit.
I will take the short cut.
Look out!
Watch these people.
Big Sexy coming through!
Not this time, Dom.
Stretch him out.
Hold them.
He gotta have about 2000 Horse Power in that thing.
Try 3000..
Try Five.
Get out of there.
I'm working on it.
Stop working on it, and do it..
No, no no...
It's my Bentley.
No!
Get that case and run!
Move!
They thought...
this was gonna be a streetfight.
You wait for it..
No!
Letty, stop!
What are you gonna do?
I don't know why you're doing this, but I know one thing.
You love me.
And you're not gonna to shoot me.
You should've given him the case, cause I won't chase you.
Okay.
I will just take it from a dead girl.
You willing to die for it?
Let's go then.
Anything?
They're gone.
And D.O.D confirmed it was a nuclear football.
He's got an EMP and nuclear launch codes.
I don't know what it is, but they're building towards something.
Deckard?
He didn't make it.
I'm disappointed in you, Dom.
You're gonna Letty just walk away with the codes.
- You've got the codes!
- Rhodes got the codes.
You made the choice to let her go.
And now I have to make one on my own.
They are adorable little things, aren't they?
I hope I don't hurt him.
Look, Cipher, I did exactly what you asked me to do.
Don't do this.
- This is your doing.
- My doing?
Please don't hurt him.
I'm begging you.
I don't want you to beg.
- I want you to learn.
- Learn what?
I understand why you did what you did.
I really do.
But it was the wrong choice.
This is a consequence, Dom.
No!
No!
No...
Wait.
Wait.
No!
Can you pull up the footage from the guy in the ally.
- Traffic cams.
- I got you.
I knew it.
I recognize that guy.
That's Connor Rhodes.
I met him when I was working with Shaw's brother.
He wanted us to get the Nightshade device him.
Connor Rhodes.
He's also linked to somebody who I like to forget.
Mose Jakande.
Warlord who tried to get God's eye.
Which means that's twice that Dom has messed up Cipher's business.
Everything you're feeling right now, that's rage, sense of loss.
It's not real.
It's a survival instinct wired deep into our brains.
To ensure continuation of species.
When early men went visit a watering hole...
If they didn't watch their child, they got snatched by a crocodile.
Their brains would create a painful but a structural memory.
So it will never happen again.
This idea of family that is so core with you, that rules your world...
It's a biological lie.
You don't have to accept it.
I don't!
Did you really could think you could destroy two of my teams.
Without any repercussions?
I wouldn't have even looked your way..
If you hadn't done that.
You didn't even know you had a kid.
You can thank me for that.
And start doing the job I'm asking you to do.
Help you start a war.
Is that what you think I want.
That's so limited.
I didn't take that football to start a war..
Anymore than I took your son to start a family.
Taking your son got me the codes..
The codes will get me the nukes, and the nukes will get me what I want...
Today, tomorrow...
and every day after that.
What's that?
Accountability.
The second I fire off one of those nukes..
I put the superpowers of this world on notice that... when they cross the line,
I'm gonna be there to hold the responsible..
Because the truth is, Dom...
To the world out there...
I'm the crocodile at the watering hole.
You've got one last job to do.
Cipher..
If I were you, I would kiss my son.
Because whether you value it or not, all of this...
Your plane, your security and you... are still on this earth because of him.
The problem we have with tracking Cipher is there's nothing to trace then.
Now we have Rhodes' information.
And we're getting snapshots of this data before it's scrubbed off the net.
That looks like somebody's bank accounts?
Always just...
The Longitude.
Given the fact that Dom hit the Russian Motorcade safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead, bring up the map.
Great, let's start here run the possibilities.
Yalta, Poltava.
Looks like they just threw letters together.
- Konyert.
- It's Vladupi.
What are you doing here?
Thought I was gonna check in on you from time to time,
To see you how you're doing.
By the way, not so hot.
But there's nothing in Vladiven.
It's just ice..
That funny...
Could've sworn there was a secret Russian naval base with the retrophilic cold war Submarines.
Well, technically, it's not Russian anymore.
Base was take by a terror grope of military separatists about a month ago.
And the Russians haven't taken it back yet.
So there is a little window of opportunity here.
Russian submarines, nuclear football, it sounds like everything we do our legs gonna be bombed off.
Sounds like you're still a No. 11 on the list.
It sounds like you've changed since you look punk ass.
Facial hairs and camen.
Guys... guys.
Hey.
We gotta call this in all the way up the chain.
That's good thinking champ.
Except... unfortunately the Russian Minister of Defense.
Got himself involved in little incident on US territory and two governments aren't talking to each other for a while.
By the time they do...
It will be too late.
So, any other suggestions?
Yeah, I got one.
How about we just stop them ourselves?
You're talking about a Russian Military Base.
Separatists.
Whatever.
It's suicide.
It's stopping world war 3.
What's it gonna be rook?
You're gonna close your eyes on this one too?
Pray that the apocalypse doesn't come knocking on your mama's front door?
Or are you're gonna saddle up, be a man and save the entire goddamn world.
You know, thank god they read it out.
What's that?
- Rule number three.
- Which is?
There are no rules.
What did I told you, Luke?
I knew he'd get in three.
Areal transport leaves in an hour.
Take whatever vehicle you want.
- All bets are off.
- All bets are off.
Bets are off?
See you later...
Letty I don't like telling you this one thing,
The game's changed.
Before we were trying just to catch Dom, but now after all of this...
I want you to know, if I have to...
I'm gonna put him down..
Then you might have to take us both down.
I'm freezing man.
This ain't for me.
I come from a different kind of lifestyle brah.
Ladies know me.
They know where I'm at with.
I try to take a piss, I ain't even recognize myself.
Now that's entirely too much information.
I'm just saying.
Well, one thing is for sure.
Dom's gotta be either working with them or making a train cause no one will be this insane to hit this place without a damn army.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Speak of the Devil.
Alright, Dom, you're one step closer to that family reunion.
400 meters to base.
Prep the EMP.
Let's take these defenses down.
We have a possible threat incoming.
Raise the barricade, As soon as possible.
We've lost power, get to your positions now.
Gates are open.
Let's get this party started.
- EMP's are charging.
- How long?
60 seconds.
Alright, Dom, You've one pulse left in that EMP.
That sub is heavily insulated.
You're gonna need to be right underneath it, for this thing to work.
Come on.
Engaging target.
He's beneath the Sub.
I'm loosing control, mayday, mayday.
I'm going down.
Yes, two birds with one stone.
We've got control of the sub.
Dom, we are good.
Head over to the Rendezvous.
Ok Matty...
Let's take this baby for a spin.
Damn!
I think Cipher just rebooted that Sub's command system.
What the hell is he talking about?
In Leyman's terms...
She just carjacked a submarine.
We can't let it get away.
There's the control room.
If you can get me into that warehouse
I can tap with network and counter hack Cipher.
Keep it from flowing into water.
No, what we need to do is get me on that sub.
I find the weapon's room and I can pull the lunch chip before she can fire any of those nukes.
That is too crazy.
- Just saying it's too dangerous.
- We'll do both.
Knock, knock!
Five vehicles just reached the base.
They just don't give up, do they..
A'right.
Let's haul ass team.
Double time, double time.
Letty, let's roll.
Go, go, go, go.
Change of plans, Dom.
I'm sending you the co-ordinates, head there immediately.
- I'm done.
I want my son.
- I'll tell you when you're done.
Your team is in play, now meet Rhodes and follow my instruction.
I got you covered, go.
Move, move!
Get out of here, go go!
Ok, how do you like this?
- Remote link has been separated.
- I'll take care of this.
Hi Ramsey.
She's regaining control.
Damn it, she's good.
They are entering the Weapon's room.
Oh that's cute.
Go, pull pull!
Roman, guard up by the chip, go.
Oh she's slick.
Gonna have to do better in that way.
Ok, now you're starting to piss me off.
Ramsey, how much time we talking to you?
You're smart, but no smart enough.
She's locked me out.
Tez, I can't stop.
Now you're gonna have to pull that chip.
I can't.
This thing's going into attack mode.
The door's not gonna open until you pull the chip.
Tez we got no idea what the hell we are looking for.
I got it.
What in the hell are you guys doing?
It wasn't me, okay?
It will be labeled "Guidance Go".
- Ok.
I got something.
- What?
It says haha.. slack slack back smoke, dear jack n jack.
Do you understand that?
Well, nasty.
Quite a show.
Arming the nuke..
Nuke's going hot, she's trying to fire this thing.
- Roger that, we're moving out.
- Disable the nukes.
Roman, what are you seeing?
- Come on, Talk to me.
- I don't see shit.
I'm holding on.
Now we have a countdown.
What the hell is going on man?
We are about to launch a nuclear missile, what the hell is going on.
Pull the damn chip.
Countdown.
Countdown.
Look for a countdown.
What countdown?
The missile needs to activate for launch.
The countdown timer won't be in Russian.
The countdown.
Let's show the world what we've got.
No.
No.
No.
Don't press that.
I got it.
Something is wrong.
It won't launch.
Get that sub out of there.
Now!
Move your ass Roman.
You alright?
There's nothing alright about any of this.
Let's go.
What about the missiles?
We got the chip, no nukes for her.
Hell yeah.
Let's roll.
Guys we got company.
A lot of company.
Alright team, here is the plan.
There is a Sea lock at the opening of the bay,
We get there first, and close it, we can stop the submarine from escaping into open water.
And disappearing forever.
I've got the location.
It's 10 miles south west.
10 miles?
Like I make it in 10 seconds.
What's the matter Roman, you forgot the snow tyre?
Loving that Lambo now?
Alright everyone, hold you with that launch trip later.
Right now I want that sub, in deep water, where no one can find it.
Find me the fastest route out of that bay.
Copy that.
Why are they shooting at me?
I think off you're in that orange Lamborghini I don't know.
Shut up Tez.
Dom.
Do you really wanna put that car in gear?
Do you?
I don't think so.
They're heading for the sea lock.
They're trying to trap the sub in the bay.
I should have taken care of this a long time ago.
Rhodes, check his team out.
I'm on it.
Roman, get in front of me.
Ok, y'all wanna play it rough?
Now it's my turn.
Yeah, baby!
Guys, we got snow mobile on the right.
They're going to flank us.
No they ain't!
Oh shit!
Tez!
Roman hold tight.
I'm on the way.
I don't wanna go swimming.
No!
Really Tez?
Oh, No.
No.
No.
Oh shit.
Roman, grab your door.
Tez!
Grab the door Roman.
It's all gone.
Oh Shit.
Roman, hang on.
Tej!
Get me off this thing.
Tez.
Come on!
Alright, I've had enough of this shit!
Number 11 my Ass.
Don't shrink it.
We got a sub to catch, get in.
What?
The pressure is on alert in the cargo hold.
Drop it to 10 thousand feet.
I know how much these people mean to you.
So I'll let you pick the first target.
I'm not picking target from a mile away.
I'd stand face to face, and look 'em dead in the eye.
Ok.
The wife it is.
Nice plane.
I'm gonna enjoy her remains.
You don't go get any ideas.
You and planes don't have a good history.
No shit.
Let's go scarface.
The arseholes ain't gonna kill themselves.
Pull up surveillance, right now.
Surprise.
Pierce must be dead.
You're driving.
I said it from the beginning.
No way, I'm not driving.
We have a security breach in the cargo hold.
Take care of it now.
Jesus Mum, you should pose to avoid the nerves.
Oh, shut up, don't be such a baby.
Get to the pilot, he's got the second key.
Wait for my signal.
Give Cipher my regards.
Did Torretto hold up his end of the deal?
He gave us this little thing here.
No, don't touch.
You can track Cipher with this, but you can't do this on your own.
There's gotta be two of you.
Fine, I got contacts.
Now you're gonna take your brother.
- No.
- Yes.
Torretto knows where he is...
He's got this thing.
He can see everything it's like it's called the devil's bumhole or something?
- It's called the God's eyes.
- Yeah, well.
Whatever.
There's no way I'm using Owen, alright?
He's a lost cause.
He's your brother, Deck.
He's my son.
He's our family.
And our family that died...
Bloody shit happening.
You lied about, I mean, I can't believe you.
You've gotten upset, you really upset your mother.
Call yourself a brother?
Look, I'm in, mum.
Ok.
Every time!
- Owen.
- In position.
Go.
I'm in.
I've got the package to lay on.
Whole pounds of him..
You made me miss my son?
What do you think you're doing?
Looking at you dead in the eye.
That was for Letty.
- Rhodes.
- He is no longer with us.
Rhodes picked the wrong target.
Congratulations Dom.
You just killed your son.
You are wrong.
I just saved him.
And you just took your foot off the tiger's neck.
You're welcome.
It's gonna get noisy.
This is for your relief.
Good?
Let's go.
Go stop him, do not let him get off this plane.
That truck's got enough munition to take us all out.
We don't give 'em a target.
Everybody get in front of us, line up
- we will take the hit.
- What?
I need to switch cars, right now.
- Roman, here comes the bad part.
- What?
Hang in there guys!
We're almost through the lock.
It's easy for you to say, when your ass ain't on fire.
Alright little mate.
It's might be a little scary,
It's gonna be a lot of fun.
The music good?
They're locking on.
Sorry guys, I got no trick for us..
- What do we do now?
- We start praying.
Hell yeah!
That's Dom!
- This guy in our side now?
- Who the hell cares?
He just saved our asses.
Good to be riding with you again man.
Torretto just cleared the way for them.
Someone give me something.
- Torpedoes are ready.
- Then launch them.
- Take the wheel.
- I ain't taking shit.
- Take the wheel!
- Where are you doing?
- This is crazy!
- Speed up,
- Left and back!
- What?
Turn the goddamn wheel to the left, really quickly.
Boom, baby!
That's alright!
Back in the sink.
Where is that smile?
There it is!
You're gonna shoot a baby You shoud bust it...
You aren't gonna wanna see this?
Is that you or him?
Him.
Good.
The torpedo's missed, they are gonna reach lock before the sub does.
The hell they are.
Get ready for this.
Oh shit!
We're going to need a bigger truck.
- Get us out of here.
- Why are you always yelling?
- This bitch is crazy!
- Look out!
That's not good.
That's not good.
We got this.
That's my girl.
The sub's too close.
We ain't making it to the gate in time.
We just gonna let it get away?
Not if I know Dom.
You loose.
Dom.
I destroyed two of your teams
I killed your red headed boyfriend.
And I put two killers on you untraceable plane.
You lost the minute you interrupted my honeymoon.
Put a heat-seeker on him now.
Now!
That's a goddamn heat seeker coming at us.
Oh my...
come and get it.
Guys!
Dive..
This...
This is for my son!
Dom!
You are out of bullets Deckard.
Like I'm need a gun to take care of you,
How did you find me?
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch!
Resourceful.
You have a lot to answer Cipher.
You pulled my family through.
A mother.
I'm gonna make sure that never happens again.
To anyone.
There is only one flaw in your plan.
What's that?
Only one of us has a parachute!
Told you this would be fun!
Time to land, Boys!
You know I've never left you, Letty?
I know.
And you know I never will..
I know.
I've so much to tell you.
Yeah you do, and you can start with that bitch!
Now, that's...
Dominic Toretto.
Hey Dom!
I'm just towing it out there?
We need to get up out of here.
Cause this all kinda neuclearism happening under this ice.
Relax!
Without the trigger chips, those nukes are harmless.
Ok.
So we good then.
Lemme go and get my young selfie levels up.
You realize this is classified, right?
Not today.
We have to get up out of here man.
I'm freezing.
It's Okay.
Don't worry, he's gonna be here soon.
I get it, y'all got a lot in common.
Computer hacks, god's eyes, geeks, nerd.
You know, but we got a lot in common too!
Alright?
- Like what?
- We walk in the room, and we are oozing sex appeal.
Me and you?
There's a problem.
I am asking the real question right now.
Is it gonna be... the Nerd or...
the dark knight?
To be honest I like both of you.
A'rigt!
Yeah..yea!
But just before we get into all of that,
Let me ask you one question.
- You can ask me anything.
- Anything.
What's my last name?
When you guys pick around with then I guess you can let me know.
It's gonna be a Parker.
That's all that really matters.
Jones, Miss Parker.
Hey Miss Parker.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I wanted to thank you.
No need.
Cipher's still on the loose.
There's been some reports she's in Athens.
But she won't be nuking any city anytime soon.
Thanks to you guys.
- So, I got you a parting favor.
- This can't be good...
Your record's been clreared.
Full re-instatement.
You got you job back.
That is if you want it.
If I want?
You know after 16 years.
I figured it's time for a little break.
Wow.
Daddy's stayin' home.
- Nobody.
- Get in touch!
Ah, hang on a second.
This could be interesting.
What made you think I would do it?
Brother-hood.
I saw that look you gave Cipher.
I knew you wanted revenge.
Glad I did it.
Can't believe you went to see my Mother.
Come on.
All this fuss of you.
Yes.
Alena, I promise to keep our son safe.
And now.. he always will be.
I want to introduce you to the most important person in my universe.
Who will never give up on me.
You've heard me say.
"That you never turn your back on family."
And I wanna thank you all for never turning your back on me.
You wanna meet them?
Alright!
Everyone...
Meet Bryan.
Hey Bryan.
Okay, I guess he's my turning secret.
Thank you for giving us family.
Thank you for giving us the strength.
(MAN SPEAKING SPANISH)
We swap in parts from Fords Plymouths and Cadillacs.
My grandfather bought it in 1957.
When he died, it passed to my father.
Then my brother, and now to me.
Look at this.
This is an engine from a boat.
- (IN ENGLISH) No way!
- MAN:
Yeah. (CONTINUING IN SPANISH)
Whatever it takes to keep it running.
(IN ENGLISH) This is the Cuban spirit.
(CONTINUING IN SPANISH)
Your spirit.
Don't ever lose that.
Dom.
Dom. (IN SPANISH)
It's your cousin.
He's in trouble.
Come on!
(ENGINE REVVING)
(ALL CHEERING)
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
(IN ENGLISH) You know I can't make a living without my car.
Not my problem, bro.
Dominic Toretto, I heard about you.
Welcome to my island.
Why you hooking' up my cousin's car?
He needed money, I gave it to him.
He can't pay, I take the car.
I just need a few more days.
"Few more days" wasn't part of the deal.
Come on.
You make a deal, you gotta live up to it.
You make a deal, you gonna live up to it.
"Gonna" live up to it?
Oh, so you're one of those types.
You take everyone's ride, and then ship it back to the States?
(IN SPANISH)
You should show your people some respect.
(IN ENGLISH) You watch your mouth.
(CHUCKLES)
Now you got a problem.
- I'm gonna keep it about the cars.
- (IN SPANISH)
I'm really scared.
(IN ENGLISH) You want a car, get it the right way.
How?
Race for it.
I already own it, bro.
Not that car.
Mine.
(CROWD EXCLAIMING)
Dom, his car is the fastest car on the island.
Do you know what he has under that hood?
He knows it doesn't matter what's under a hood.
The only thing that matters is who's behind the wheel.
You think so?
I know so.
Then race his car.
And we ain't racing no quarter-mile, here.
We race the Cuban mile.
Done.
(CROWD CHEERING)
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
I appreciate what you're trying to do, but my car is the slowest car on the island.
Was.
Pull the seats, the doors, the battery...
If it ain't the motor, take it off.
Laughing gas?
Nah, Fed.
This is Cuban NOS.
You guys are crazy.
What are you doing?
DOM:
Poor man's turbo.
Pull the vacuum line and hold on.
Old trick that Buster used to play, in case of emergencies.
You know that's way too much boost for that engine.
DOM:
It's gonna be fast.
It's gonna be a bomb.
Only needs to go a mile.
(CROWD CHEERING)
(ENGINES REVVING)
(IN SPANISH)
Are you ready for this, my family?
This is Havana!
Be fast.
Be safe.
But don't be last.

A deal's a deal.
You won my car.
And you earned my respect.
Keep your car.
Your respect is good enough for me.
DOM:
Yo, cousin...
Sorry about your car.
Yours was too slow for a Toretto, anyway.
Your Impala?
Are you serious?
(ALL CHEERING)
Look at that smile.
I love it when you smile.
You make me happy.
Mmm, I think this place makes you happy.
It's like it speaks to you.
You remember that guy, the racer and his dad?
The one with the boat engine under the hood?
Yeah!
- Yes.
- Of course.
I was looking at them, and I...
And I couldn't help but to imagine what you'd be like if you were a dad.
No, no, no!
I'm not pregnant.
Is that what you want?
It's not about what I want or what you want.
It's about why we haven't asked the question.
(ENGINE CRANKS SLOWLY)
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
- (IN ENGLISH) What?
- You need a hand?
Yeah, I think I do.
- Sounds like you're not getting any fuel.
- Yeah?
Probably the shut-off solenoid.
Let's see if we can get some power to it.
What brings you to Cuba?
The same thing that brings everyone else to Cuba.
Culture, people, the beauty.
What brings you to Cuba?
- Work.
- Must be casual Friday.
How's that honeymoon going, Dom?
Your fuel relay is missing.
I know.
I love to play games.
I've beaten the best of 'em.
But I'm kind of in a rush, so if you've got something to say to me...
Oh, this is a very different game, that I can assure you.
This...
There's something much greater at work here.
This is fate.
I choose to make my own fate.
Not today.
Is this the road you take to your apartment every morning?
What else is different, Dom?
Was Santiago's closed?
Did you have to cross two blocks to go get your Cuban coffees?
What is it, black, no sugar?
Yeah.
I put a lot of work into getting you here today.
Well, now that I'm here, what do you want?
I want you to work for me.
Work for you?
Oh, I could've saved you a lot of time, then.
See, I don't work for anyone.
You can't walk away from this, Dom.
We're gonna have this conversation, one way or the other.
You see, that's the funny thing about fate.
It's cunning.
It can bring you beautiful things, and it can also bring you moments like this.
Oh, you're gonna want to work for me.
You're gonna betray your brothers, abandon your code, and shatter your family.
You see, your team is about to go up against the only thing they can't handle.
What's that?
You.
Oh, and, Dom, I wouldn't mention this to anyone.
(ENGINE STARTS)
HOBBS:
They are gonna be hitting us with everything they got.
So we wanna engage with maximum speed.
Neutralize their shooters, and then move on to our objective.
There's two things I want you to keep in mind.
Number one, I chose you for this squad because you are the most fearsome warriors on the planet.
And number two, you go out there, you do your job, and you take 'em down.
Everyone.
And I mean everyone.
Mani's and pedi's at the mall later on today.

(WHISPERS) What?
(WHISTLE BLOWS)
I don't wanna play anymore.
All right, let's go, girls.
Let's go, let's go!
Final two minutes.
DS ALLAN:
Quite the cheering section.
HOBBS:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it's the moms.
They come out to support the kids.
Except there seem to be more moms than kids.
Way more moms.
(WOMEN GIGGLING)
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
It's a big soccer town.
Let's go, girls!
So, your intel was spot-on.
That Damocles 7 EMP weapon that went missing in the Gulf?
Arms dealers from the Liberation Front have it in Berlin.
HOBBS:
Shit!
This thing can wipe out an entire electrical grid in a major city.
No lights, no power.
Instant Stone Age.
Chloe, Maya, you can't let her run by you like that.
- Let's go, let's go!
Cross!
- Agent Hobbs, this is a Class Four WMD.
Do you have any idea what's at stake here?
Yes, I know exactly what is at stake here, okay?
If the Pink Butterflies beat my Red Dragons, that means we lose the championship.
Which means I have 20 little girls who are crying, and that's not a good thing.
Which then means I have to spend a lot of time in ice-cream shops and a lot of time at Tay Tay concerts.
Tay Tay?
Taylor Swift.
Gotta be shittin' me.
Get it together, okay?
Let's go, girls!
We need you to do this.
It's a lot of lives at stake.
All right, but I need to be clear here.
The US government cannot sanction this operation in any way.
- You're on your own.
- Hey.
If this thing goes sideways, you don't just get burned.
You go to prison.
And there's nothing we can do to get you out.
Let me tell you something.
The only thing that I love more than saving lives is my daughter.
So, if you don't shut up with this government bullshit right now, and start showing some team spirit and respect for the Red Dragons,
I'm gonna have all 20 of them line up and kick you right in the tay-tay.
Go Dragons!
Say it again.
Go Dragons!
Attaboy.
Go Dragons.
- Go Dragons.
- (CROWD EXCLAIMS)
- SAM:
I'm open.
- She's open!
Go, go!
Yes!
(LAUGHING)
(WHISTLE BLOWS)
That is my daughter right there.
Yes.
Yes, come here.
How did I do?
Awesome.
Nice job, kid.
- (HOBBS SIGHS)
- Daddy's gotta go to work?
Uh, yeah.
Daddy's gotta go to work.
Now, you're gonna need to get a team you can trust.
Oh, I already got one.
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
(SIGHS)
HOBBS:
Hey, Dom.
Hey, Hobbs.
I got a job in Berlin and I need a favor, brother.
No problem.
I'll grab the team and meet you in Berlin.
Thanks, man.
I'll see you soon.
(GRUNTS)
You were only supposed to create a diversion, Roman.
That was a diversion!
How many of the damn explosives did you use?
ROMAN:
I don't know, Tej.
- All of it?
- Wait, all of it?
Roman, Jesus Christ.
We got more of your fan club ahead.
They're still on us!
These guys are taking this personal.
Roman, we just blew up their facility and stole their EMP.
Other than your doctor's cold finger, I'd say it's about as personal as it can get.
Phase Two!
Phase Two?
So you just gonna keep that to yourself?
What happened to Phase One?
What about that part?
Yeah.
Remember the airplane?
Everyone drove their cars out but you?
I told you, my engine seized up.
It's your balls that seized up.
Just follow my lead, okay?
And, Roman, whatever you do, don't think.
Huh?
Tej, drop it!
Bombs away.
(BEEPS)
Split, now!
ROMAN:
Holy... (CURSES IN GERMAN)
ROMAN: (OVER RADIO) Great plan, Tej.
But just so you know, you missed some.
Oh, just wait for it.
ROMAN:
Oh, shit!
I hate you, Tej!
(LAUGHS)
Got your ass.
You good?
I'll see you when it's done.
All right, great job, team.
Let's break off and meet me at the safe house.
(ENGINE REVVING)
A hell of a job, brother.
When we get back to the base, the beer's on me.
(GASPING)
(GRUNTS)
You lost your goddamn mind, Toretto?
Toretto, you put hands on that thing, you're gonna have the whole world gunning for you, including me.
(DOM GRUNTS)
I don't know what you're doing, but you better think about this, Toretto.
It ain't too late to stop this.
It is now.
(TIRES SQUEALING)
(SIRENS BLARING)
That sumbitch just crossed us.
- What?
- Wait a second, what are you talking about?
Dom took the EMP.
Bullshit.
Where are you?
HOBBS:
It's too late for me.
Get outta here.
Saw that look in his eye, and I've seen that look before.
Dominic Toretto just went rogue.
TEJ:
All right, I got his phone records, y'all.
It's a whole bunch of calls to untraceable numbers.
ROMAN:
Burner phones, right?
TEJ:
Nah, scrambler.
Same number, but they got some sort of micro-router to bury the signal path, which means Dom is clearly communicating with somebody that's above our pay grade.
Look, I don't know Dom as well as you, but if we just look at the facts,
Dom's been having highly encrypted conversations with some mysterious person.
He took out Hobbs.
He stole an EMP.
Now he's disappeared.
So, what are you saying?
Maybe we should consider the fact that Hobbs is right.
Dom did go rogue.
(CAR DOOR SLAMS)
ROMAN:
Letty.
LETTY:
Before you judge the man, remember, you're breathing right now because he saved your life.
You just gonna let her bump your shoulder like that?
I'm just saying, that was a little aggressive.
What you gonna do, email her?
(SIGHS)
(WHISPERS) Check.
(CELL DOOR BUZZING)
Moment, will you, fellas?
Thank you.
Well, this is an exciting new look.
It's a little tight in the crotch, as always.
(CHUCKLES)
What boy-band bus did she fall out of?
It's my new junior associate.
He's working with me on this.
All yours.
Mr. Nobody and I have been given the authority to get you out of this.
All you have to do is agree to the terms and you're free.
What's training wheels talking about?
What terms?
Confess to your crimes in Berlin.
Treason, international espionage, massive destruction of civic property.
You do that, we close the case.
- And?
- And the DSS blacklists you.
Germany loves that.
LITTLE NOBODY:
Officially, you will be a criminal.
MR. NOBODY:
Wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You need to work on your delivery, all right?
Unofficially...
You're off the books.
You come work with me.
I'm not a criminal.
MR. NOBODY:
Luke, come on.
Labels.
There is no confession.
There are no backroom deals.
I got myself into this, I'm gonna get myself out of it.
- You know that.
- I do, and that's what I told him. (SIGHS)
Well, there you have it.
Good luck in the courts, man.
What about your daughter?
You know, if you're not gonna do it for your country, at least do it for your kid.
(CHUCKLES) Big mistake, kid.
(EXCLAIMS)
Hold on.
Luke, Luke.
He's still working from the manual.
I mean, he doesn't even really know the rules.
Now, come on, give him a break.
(STRAINED) Give me a break.
Luke.
(GRUNTING)
Appreciate it.
(COUGHING)
It's good to see you, Nobody.
You, too.
Rule number one...
Know your audience.
I gave you your shot.
You shit the bed.
Now I'm gonna show you how to get this done.
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
You're dead, cop.
Dead!

I'm gonna slice some bacon off your back, pig.

(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
(CELL DOOR BUZZING)
You know, that color looks good on you.
Yeah, it'll look a whole hell of a lot better with your blood on it.
Yeah, good luck with that, Hercules.
Lawman gone bad, huh?
Such a cliche.
Oh, well, welcome to the club.
I wouldn't get that twisted, son.
We ain't in no club, we got nothing in common.
And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.
What, you bring a shovel, did you?
Because it's 38 feet of steel and concrete.
Or so I've been told.
(DECKARD CHUCKLES)
Better get to digging.
Wanker.
Yeah.
Move.
Say that again.
If I say it again, it'll be to a corpse.
(CHUCKLES)
I'm gonna enjoy this.
CIPHER:
Welcome back, Dom.
Nice job out there.
You excited about tonight?
You're going on this?
You're with me, Dom.
Showing me your shoe collection?
Yep.
A pair for every occasion.
You have enough guns in here to outfit a small army, huh?
Oh, this is just the tip of the iceberg.
You know what I like about you, Dom?
You're a genuine outlaw.
I mean, you're a man who lives by his own rules.
Which is surprising, because when I saw you in Cuba,
I heard about a guy who almost killed you with a motorcycle, and you let him keep his car?
Oh, that confused you?
Hmm.
'Course I could've taken his car.
But it's about something bigger.
This way...
I changed him.
That's not your responsibility.
- But it's who I am.
- Is it?
Let me ask you something, Dom.
What's the best thing in your life?
- Family.
- No, it's not.
Not if you're being honest.
It's the 10 seconds between start and finish, when you're not thinking about anything.
No family, no obligations.
Just you.
Being free.
I gotta tell you, this whole saving-the-world, Robin Hood nonsense you've been doing recently?
It's bullshit.
It's not you.
Be who you are.
Why live only a quarter mile at a time when you can live your whole life that way?
(PANTING)
Is that it?
Is that all those bloated-out muscles will give ya?
All show and no go.
(GRUNTS)
(GRUNTING)
Oh, I got plenty of go.
You must've misplaced that when I kicked your arse up and down that office of yours.
Yeah.
Just like you Brits, rewriting history, huh?
All I know is, it wasn't me that was thrown out of a four-story window.
Jumped.
I jumped out of a four-story window, saving my partner's life.
'Cause where I'm from, we don't settle fights by throwing bombs.
Well, that's funny, because where I'm from, we don't need women to run to our rescue.
I mean, do you really believe you can stand in front of me and beat me in a straight-up, old-fashioned fist fight?
Let me tell you something.
Me and you, one-on-one, no one else around.
I will beat your ass like a Cherokee drum.
Maybe one day we'll find out.
Oh, you better hope that day never comes.
(DOOR BUZZES)
I said no, Mr. Nobody.
I'm not leaving this cell.
I'll get out my way.
(ALARM BLARING)
The right way!
Hey!

This is my new base.
Welcome to nowhere.
It's a little sterile for you.
(CHUCKLES)
Listen, there's something I wanna talk to you about after.
Hey, listen, guys.
Thanks...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What?
Handcuffs?
What is this?
It's called abuse of power.
You told me to round them up.
I didn't tell you to hand...
Cut 'em loose.
Oh, man.
This is embarrassing.
I'm sorry, guys, really, I...
So, this is how you treat old friends?
TEJ:
Friends?
We don't even really know who the hell this guy is.
Doesn't matter who I am, Tej.
I'm, like, nobody, okay?
Nobody.
So, then, who is he?
Him?
He's nothing.
He's, like, less than me.
Clearly, we're getting nowhere with nobody.
I've been in here for four hours, and my ribs are showing.
I don't know about y'all, but I'm out.
- I wouldn't recommend that.
- What?
Well, thanks to your botched Berlin job, you all made Interpol's Top 10 Most Wanted list.
- Top 10.
- MR. NOBODY:
Mmm-hmm.
That's all right.
- Well, not you, Roman.
- What do you mean?
You just missed the cut.
You're number 11, so...
- I'm...
I missed?
- Yeah.
ROMAN:
That's impossible!
What number did they come in at?
Six, eight, nine, ten.
- She's 10?
- Mmm-hmm.
That's impossible.
There's no way she's a 10.
Oh, she's definitely a 10. (SCOFFS)
How about we focus on someone who we're not gonna find on anybody's list.
We're awaiting hard confirmation, but I believe that's the cyber terrorist known as Cipher.
Wait, no.
Cipher's an organization.
Not a person.
Not according to our sources.
What does she want?
No one knows.
Cipher is like a digital act of God.
They...
Well, she can manipulate world systems from the shadows.
Anything that can be hacked is hers to play with.
And here's the kicker.
You'll never find her linked to any of it.
Her digital identity is scrubbed every few seconds, worldwide.
So, basically, she's the bogeyman.
Damn, she's one of the hottest bogeymans I've ever seen.
I mean, if y'all know her, tell her to get at your boy.
- (ROMAN CHUCKLES) - (CLEARS THROAT)
- What are you, 12?
- ROMAN:
That was my shin, mother...
Let's just say, people are scared of the hacker group Anonymous.
But even Anonymous won't mess with her.
What the hell does any of this have to do with us?
Probably nothing, Letty, but I do find it interesting that, apparently, for some reason, she's now working with this guy.
(SIGHS)
He's already delivered a fully operational EMP into her hands.
Detonate that, they can turn any city in the world into a war zone.
So, then, what is it you're suggesting we do?
MR. NOBODY:
Maybe we find Dom, huh?
Well, first, let's catch him, and then figure out why he's turned.
So, y'all want us to track Dom.
Yeah, I know, Roman, it's kind of a big job.
It's impossible.
Which is why I'm bringing in an extra pair of hands.
Ah, my day just got a whole hell of a lot better.
Mr. Nobody, you wanna tell me why you just put me in a room with this tea-and-crumpets eating, criminal sumbitch?
What a big mouth on a small head, coming from Prisoner 6753.
Don't think we've forgotten everything that you've done.
We are not teaming up with this guy.
Let's get one thing clear.
I ain't on your team.
I don't care about you, your crew, or your little family.
I'm here for Cipher.
What are you gonna do, apply for a job?
Head Asshole?
You know, I think that tight T-shirt's cutting off the circulation to your brain.
You should get a bigger size.
Cipher came to me first.
Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.
When I said no, she went after my brother.
Ah, yes, brother Owen.
Who could forget him, huh?
Former hell-raiser and current guest at a nasty little black site prison.
Cipher corrupted him and left him for dead.
So, if I get a shot to take her down, believe me, Flex, I'm taking it.
You're taking my boot right up your ass, is what you're taking.
Guys, guys.
The fastest way to find Cipher is through Toretto.
Now, aside from myself, there's only two men in the world that have ever managed to actually track him down with any success.
And guess what.
They're both standing in front of me right now.
So, like it or not, you two are gonna work together.
You got that?
I'm gonna take that as a yes.
Am I the only one seeing this?
Oh, this ought to be good.
(MUMBLES)
Use God's Eye.
We put our lives on the line, running around the world trying to figure this thing out.
It can find anybody, right?
Let's use it to find Dom.
Roman, that is a great idea.
Did you hear that? "Great idea."
No, no, no, don't tune it out.
Huh?
Mr. Nobody, let's fire it up, huh?
TEJ:
Got him.
He's in London.
Yeah.
(BEEPING)
RAMSEY:
Wait.
We've got a second match in Hong Kong.
ROMAN:
Beijing and Seoul.
TEJ:
And Tokyo.
RAMSEY:
And just about every other major city on the planet.
MR. NOBODY:
And so, God's Eye was where we started.
But Cipher's already created an evasion that masks their location by pinging random spots all over the globe, but it was a good thought, Roman.
So, she's made my program obsolete.
And that, Ramsey, is why you're here.
See, simple solutions aren't gonna cut it here, slick.
Why you look at me when you say that?
Wait a second.
Wait, wait.
Simple solutions might just cut it.
You see, in order for God's Eye to give off all these false pings, means they have to be using a FLEA relay.
Watch these two.
Which means it has a decaying sync randomizer.
Which we can reverse...
And track it back to the originating source and find Dom's true location.
I'm telling you, they got skills.
That was my idea.
That's what I was saying.
Remember in there?
All right, let's try this.
It's working.
Time you wanna check your manual and start organizing a force response.
Let's get a hold of our international assets...
He's still green.
Yeah, like fresh baby shit.
As soon as we have Toretto's location, I want to mobilize.
Let's get a hold of a better asshole.
No one respects you...
(IMITATES RADIO STATIC) Cover.
Get away from me.
All right, they're not in China.
Or Russia.
Europe's clear.
But this one's not going away.
(BEEPING)
This is interesting.
Why?
(BEEPING RAPIDLY)
Because that's here.
(GRUNTING)

(EXCLAIMS)
(MAN COUGHING)
CIPHER: (ECHOING) Did you all enjoy that?
Next-generation concussion grenade.
It scrambles your senses.
Don't worry, it'll wear off in an hour.
- (GROANING)
- Probably.
Hello, Deckard.
Nice to see you again.
(LAUGHING) Look at this, body's not even cold, Dom.
Your family's already replacing you.
You chose the losing team.
I guess your brother is smarter than you.
(DECKARD GRUNTING)
(BEEPING)
Smart move, embedding God's Eye into the mainframe.
Irritating to make me have to come all the way down here to get it, but...
Let's go.
(ALL GROANING)
Dom!
You're gonna turn your back on family?
Just like that?
Let's go.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
HOBBS:
You okay?
That wasn't him.
I don't know what she's got on him, but that wasn't Dom.
Brian would know what to do.
No!
We can't bring Brian and Mia into this.
We agreed on that.
ROMAN:
I know.
DOM:
Back there, was that for her, for me, or you?
And was it even necessary?
Necessary?
Nothing is necessary.
Everything is a choice.
And I simply made one.
But so did you.
You could've stopped me, but you chose not to.
I wonder what Letty thought about that.
The problem with putting your foot on a tiger's neck is you can never let it up.
I think I need to remind you why you chose to be here.
(GASPS)
Elena.
ELENA:
Dom?
I'm sorry.
You shouldn't have come.
Nothing could have kept me away.
Now she has the three of us.
(BABY COOING)
Do you wanna see him?
See Papa?
(BABY GURGLING)
See Papa.
Papa.
(COOING)
When I realized I was pregnant, you had just found out Letty was alive.
So I decided when Letty and you got back from your honeymoon,
I was going to tell you.
But then she took us before I had the chance.
(COOS)
His name?
(CONTINUES COOING)
I call him Marcos.
But that's his middle name.
I thought his father should give him his first name.
I'm sorry, Dom.
There's nothing to be sorry for.
ELENA:
Whatever happens, just save our son.
Your son.
CIPHER:
Good visit?
I know.
I know what you're thinking.
I just let the guards go, so there's only two opponents in the room.
Rhodes has the gun, so you'll take him out first.
I know you.
And then you're thinking, Elena's a cop.
Maybe the two of you can fight your way out of here.
(WHISPERS) So much to think about.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
Let me make it easier for you.
Do with it as you wish.
Have you heard of Choice Theory, Dom?
There is a bunch of axioms, but only two you really need to concern yourself with.
One, the only person's behavior we can control is our own.
And, two, the only thing we can truly give another person is information.
So, let me give you some.
You see these cameras in here?
The moment you make a move, highly-paid men with weapons will make their way into this room with one very specific instruction.
It's not to save me.
It's to kill your son.
Now, that's a lot of bullets, and it only takes one for you to lose everything.
So, I have to ask you, because I know family is so important to you.
Is that really a choice you want to make?
Because I'm ready if you are.
If I pull this trigger, and God knows I want to, if I killed everyone on this plane, I still couldn't get in there.
'Cause of your two-man fail-safe system.
Since I'm alone,
I got no choice!
I didn't think so.
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch.
(SOBBING)
Bitch.
- Don't, don't.
- Sweet dreams.
Please!
LITTLE NOBODY:
Damn it.
She wiped it all.
Took God's Eye.
That was the one thing we could use to find them.
We lost everything.
What do you got, Princess?
Finding Toretto.
But I got a couple of minutes to spare, if you want me to send you to the hospital.
Again.
(CHUCKLES) Yo, Rules.
First off, that's not my name.
- Little Nobody.
- Don't call me that.
Oh, that's definitely sticking.
Great.
Do me a favor and tell Your Majesty over there that we're gonna find Toretto.
We find Toretto together as a team.
And when this is all over with,
I'm happy to slap that whisker biscuit right off his face.
Wait a minute, guys, I think Deckard's actually onto something.
How do you think Dom and Cipher got into the country without us knowing?
Ghost flights.
I thought untraceable aircraft was all Internet conspiracy stuff.
MR. NOBODY:
It's not.
Satellites and radar grids all across the globe shift like an ocean.
They've got channels that open and close.
And theoretically, if you know the right people who know the right patterns...
You can fly right through the blind spots completely undetected.
So you know where Dom is headed?
(LAPTOP BEEPS)
Yeah.
New York.
(CHUCKLES)
You see there, Luke?
You guys are gonna get along just great.
Which proves rule number two, you never lose everything.
Fire up the chopper.
Well, guys, have a ball in the Big Apple.
ROMAN:
And why are we traveling like this again?
TEJ:
Because Dom took God's Eye, so we need to stay off the grid.
ROMAN:
But like this?
(ALL GRUNTING)
ROMAN:
Look here, man.
Before I throw up in my mouth, let me ask you, what are we doing here?
That's a good question, Roman.
Let me show you.
Welcome to our new base of operations.
No, seriously.
What is this place?
This is heaven.
It's the agency garage.
They call it the Toy Shop.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
LITTLE NOBODY:
This is where we house every vehicle seized from drug dealers on the East Coast.
Now, Mr. Nobody said that if we're gonna have a chance at catching Dom, we're gonna have to be damn fast.
Figured this would help.
We got a tank.
750 horsepower, 6.6 liter, V8 Duramax engine with an M153 CROWS remotely operated weapon station on top.
You didn't get this from drug dealers.
LITTLE NOBODY:
No.
No, that, uh, the United States Army lent me.
See, the Army's developing machines like this that soldiers can drive from a mile away, so they can stay safe and alive.
But, luckily, there's a backup driver's seat for those of us that like to get more "hands on."
ROMAN:
I'm sitting here wondering this whole time, will this thing fit in valet at Cheesecake Factory?
No one is getting "hands on."
She doesn't go on city streets.
Wow.
I'm in love.
Again, no, no.
That's a million-dollar show car.
The point is to not draw attention.
It's reverse psychology.
Dom would never see it coming.
It's neon orange.
The International Space Station would see it coming.
Go choose anything less conspicuous.
ROMAN:
No, no, no.
Calipers are my...
- This is ridiculous.
- Not happening.
Hey, my man, you can put that down right there.
This is a gift, a real gift.
I know what you're doing.
(LAUGHS) I like your beard.
You're Blanta.
Black Santa?
No, I'm serious.
Put it down right there.
What are you doing?
Engine's misfiring.
I gotta check it out.
No, that's not part of the plan, Dom.
DOM:
Clearly.
But unless you want the engine to seize on the job...
You have five minutes.
(MOUTHING) Five minutes.
I want another visual.
I got an ATM.
I don't like this.
I want to see Toretto.
- There are no more cameras.
- Then find something!
Punch in on something reflective.
A car mirror, anything.
Do you know who I am?
It's why I'm here.
Do you know what I'm capable of?
It's why I'm here.
I'll give you until I finish me cuppa.
And I'm fucking thirsty.
I've got limited time, so I won't take up too much of yours.
Oh, no.
No, you've already taken everything I have of value, Mr. Toretto.
What more could you possibly want?
To give you something back.
Talk to me.
Something's not right here.
First time I saw my son was behind a bulletproof glass.
When he reached for me, I couldn't hold him.
It's the worst pain I ever felt.
I know you know exactly how that feels.
Maybe we could change that.
Now, why do I think you're about to suggest something really dodgy, Mr. Toretto?
It's why I'm here.
Jesus, punch in on something.
I'm not liking this.
Something's not right.
- Rhodes, you close?
- RHODES:
Yeah.
CIPHER:
Go.
The delivery truck's moving.
(MOUTHING) I know.

"His bold actions saved the lives of hostages and his teammates.

Something about this whole thing that just doesn't add up to me.
Well, that would be the same kind of funny math that says a DSS agent who has a Silver Star for valor stole an EMP.

They're off the grid.
They're probably just bunkered down somewhere.
DOM:
We're closing in on 'em.
You guys ready?
CIPHER:
One thing I can guarantee, Dom, no one's ready for this.
I want every chip with a zero-day exploit in a two-mile radius around that motorcade now.

And now I have to make one of my own.

Please don't hurt him, I'm begging you.
I don't want you to beg.
I want you to learn.

I understand why you did what you did.
I really do.
Da-da.
But it was the wrong choice.
This is the consequence of that.
(MUFFLED SCREAMING) No!

Wait, wait, wait.
Wait.
Save your son!
No!
(GUNSHOTS)
(CRYING)
(SHUSHING)
(EXHALES)
Can you pull up the footage from the guy in the alley?
Traffic cams.
I got you.
I knew it.
I recognize that guy.
That's Connor Rhodes.
I met him when I was working with Shaw's brother.
He wanted us to get the Nightshade device for him.
Connor Rhodes.
He's also linked to somebody I'd quite like to forget.
It's Mose Jakande.
Warlord who tried to get God's Eye.
Which means that's twice that Dom has messed up Cipher's business.
Everything you're feeling right now, this rage, a sense of loss, it's not real.
It's a survival instinct wired deep into our brains to ensure continuation of the species.
When early man would visit a watering hole, if they didn't watch their child, and it got snatched by a crocodile,
our brains would create a painful but instructional memory, so it would never happen again.
This idea of "family" that is so core with you, that rules your world,
it's a biological lie.
You don't have to accept it.
I don't.
Did you really think you could destroy two of my teams without any repercussions?
I wouldn't have even looked your way if you hadn't done that.
You didn't even know you had a kid.
You can thank me for that and start doing the job I'm asking you to do.
Help you start a war.
Is that what you think I want?
That's so limited.
I didn't take that football to start a war any more than I took your son to start a family.
Taking your son got me the codes.
The codes will get me the nukes and the nukes will get me what I want today, tomorrow, and every day after that.
And what's that?
Accountability.
The second I fire off one of those nukes,
I put the superpowers of this world on notice that, when they cross the line,
I'm gonna be there to hold them responsible.
Because the truth is, Dom, to the world out there,
I am the crocodile at the watering hole.
We've got one last job to do.
DOM:
Cipher.
If I were you, I'd kiss my son.
Because whether you value it or not, all of this, your plane, your security, and you,
are still on this earth because of him.
RAMSEY:
The problem we've had with tracking Cipher is there's nothing to trace.
But now, we have Rhodes' information.
And we're getting snapshots of his data before it's scrubbed off the net.
That looks like somebody's bank account, so why don't we just go ahead...
It's a longitude.
Given the fact that Dom hit a Russian motorcade, it's safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead and bring up the map.
Good.
Let's start here and run the possibilities.
Yalta, Poltava...
It's like they just threw letters together.
Kronyurt.
MR. NOBODY:
It's "Vladovin."
- What are you doing here?
- What?
Told you I was gonna check in on you from time to time to see how you were doin'.
By the way, not so hot.
But there's nothing in Vladovin.
It's just ice.
That's funny.
Could've sworn there was a secret Russian naval base where they retrofitted Cold War submarines.
Well, technically, it's not Russian anymore.
The base was taken over by a terror group of military separatists about a month ago, and the Russians haven't taken it back yet, so there is a little window of opportunity here.
Russian submarines.
Nuclear football.
It sounds like everything we do, our legs gonna be blown off.
It sounds like you still number 11 on the list. (CHUCKLES)
It sounds like you've changed since your little punk-ass facial hairs done came in.
Guys, guys.
Hey, we gotta call this in.
All the way up the chain.
That's good thinking, champ, except unfortunately, the Russian Minister of Defense got himself involved in a little incident on US territory, and the two governments aren't talking to each other for a while.
By the time they do, it'll be too late.
So, any other suggestions?
HOBBS:
Yeah.
I got one.
How about we just stop them ourselves?
You're talking about a Russian military base.
Separatist.
Whatever.
It's suicide.
It's stopping World War III.
What's it gonna be, rook?
You gonna close your eyes on this one, too?
Pray that the apocalypse doesn't come knocking on your mama's front door?
Or, are you gonna saddle up, be a man, and save the entire goddamn world?
You know, I think I figured it out.
What's that?
- Rule number three.
- Which is?
There are no rules.
(MR. NOBODY LAUGHS)
What'd I tell you, Luke?
I knew he'd get it in three.
LITTLE NOBODY:
Aerial transport leaves in an hour.
Take whatever vehicle you want.
All bets are off.
- All bets are off?
- Bets are off?
Do svidanya!
Letty, I don't like telling you this one bit.
But the game's changed.
Before, we were just trying to catch Dom, but now, after all this,
I want you to know, if I have to,
I'm gonna put him down.
Then you might have to take us both down.
ROMAN:
I'm freezing, man.
(BREATHING HEAVILY) This ain't for me.
I come from a different kind of lifestyle, brah.
Ladies know me.
They know where I'm at with it.
I tried to take a piss, I didn't even recognize myself.
Man, that's entirely too much information.
I'm just sayin'.
Well, one thing's for sure.
Dom's gotta be either working with them or making a trade, because no one would be this insane to hit this place without a damn army.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
HOBBS:
Speak of the devil.
All right, Dom, you're one step closer to that family reunion.
400 meters to base.
Prep the EMP.
Let's take these defenses down.
(ENGINE REVVING)
(MAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
We have a possible threat approaching.
Raise the barricade.
We've lost power, defensive positions now.
(CLAPS) (IN ENGLISH) Gates are open.

(SOLDIERS YELLING IN RUSSIAN)
- EMP is recharging.
- How long?

All right, Dom, you have one pulse left in that EMP.
That sub is heavily insulated.
You're gonna need to be right underneath it for this thing to work.
(TIRES SQUEALING)
(GRUNTING)
- Come on.
- (SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
Engaging target.
He's beneath the sub.
(ALARMS BLARING)
Mayday!
Mayday!
I've lost all power.
I'm going down.
CIPHER:
Yes!
Two birds with one stone.
SUPER JET TECH:
We've got control of the sub.
Dom, we are good.
Head over to the rendezvous.
Okay, Matty, let's take this baby for a spin.
TEJ:
Damn!
I think Cipher just rebooted that sub to slave its command system.
What the hell is he talking about?
In layman's terms, she just carjacked a submarine.
We can't let it get away.
There's the control room.
If you can get me into that wheelhouse,
I can tap the network and counter-hack Cipher.
Keep it from lowering into the water.
No, what we need to do is get me on that sub.
I find the weapons room and I can pull the launch chip before she can fire any of those nukes.
That is too crazy.
What you're saying is too dangerous.
We'll do both.
Knock, knock.
(SOLDIERS YELLING IN RUSSIAN)
(IN ENGLISH) Five vehicles just breached the base.
They just don't give up, do they?
HOBBS:
All right, let's haul ass, team.
Double time, double time!
(SOLDIERS YELLING IN RUSSIAN)
(YELLING)
Letty, let's roll!
(GROANS)
Go!
Go, go, go!
CIPHER:
Change of plans, Dom.
I'm sending you new coordinates.
Head there immediately.
I'm done.
I want my son.
I'll tell you when you're done.
Your team is in play.
Now, meet Rhodes and follow my instruction.
(PANTING)
I've got you covered!
Go!
Move, move!
Get outta here!
Go, go, go!
(PANTING)
Okay.
How do you like this?
(ENGINE POWERING DOWN)
- JET TECH:
Remote link has been severed.
- CIPHER:
I'll take care of this.
Hi, Ramsey.
(ENGINE POWERING UP)
RAMSEY:
She's regained control.
Damn it.
She's good.

They're entering the weapons room.
Oh, that's cute.
LITTLE NOBODY: (EXCLAIMS) Pull!
Pull!
Roman, Roman!
We gotta find the chip, go!
Oh, she's slick.
Gonna have to do better than that, though.
Okay, now you're starting to piss me off.
(GRUNTING)
(MAN YELLING)
Ramsey, how much time we talkin' here?
You're smart, but not smart enough.
(ENGINE POWERING UP)
She's locked me out.
(GRUNTING)
Tej, I can't stop her.
You're gonna have to pull that chip.
I can't!
This thing's gone into attack mode!
The door's not gonna open until you pull the chip!
Tej, we got no idea what the hell we're looking for.
I got it!
(ALARM BLARING)
What in the hell are you guys doin'?
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me, okay?
It'll be labeled "Guidance Go."
- Guidance Go, Guidance Go...
- Okay, I got somethin'.
- What?
- It says... (SPEAKING GIBBERISH)
Do you understand that?

- (YELLING) - (SPLATTERING)
(PANTING)
Wow.
Nasty.
Hmm.
Quite a show.
We're arming the nuke.
(POWERING UP)
TEJ: (OVER RADIO) Nuke's going hot!
She's tryin' to fire this thing!
Roger that.
We're moving out.
(OVER RADIO) Disable the nukes!
Roman, what are you seeing?
Come on, talk to me.
I don't see shit.
I'm holding on!
(RUMBLING)
And we have a countdown.
(ALARM BLARING)
What the hell is goin' on, man?
We're about to launch a nuclear missile, is what the hell is goin' on!
Pull the damn chip!
(PANTING)
Countdown, countdown!
Look for a countdown!
What countdown?
The missiles need to activate to launch.
The countdown timer won't be in Russian.
The countdown...
Let's show the world what we've got.
ROMAN:
No, no, no!
Don't press that!
I got it.
Something's wrong.
It won't launch.
Get that sub outta there.
Now!
LITTLE NOBODY:
Move your ass, Roman!
(PANTING)
You all right?
There's nothing all right about any of this!
- Let's go!
- What about the missiles?
We got the chip.
No nukes for her.
Hell, yeah.
Let's roll.
Guys, we got company.
A lot of company!
All right, team, here's the plan.
There's a sea lock at the opening of the bay.
We get there first and close it, we can stop the submarine from escaping into open water and disappearing forever.
I've got the location.
It's 10 miles southwest.
Ten miles?
We're not gonna make it ten seconds!
(GUNFIRE)
Ah!
No, no, no!
This is not good!
What's the matter, Roman?
Forgot your snow tires?
ROMAN:
Whoa!
You lovin' that Lambo now?
ROMAN:
Whoa!
Ah!
(ROMAN EXCLAIMS)
(SCREAMING)
CIPHER:
All right, everyone.
We'll deal with that launch chip later.
Right now, I want that sub in deep water where no one can find it.
Find me the fastest route out of that bay.
Copy that.
Why are they shootin' at me?
Maybe 'cause you're in an orange Lamborghini, I don't know.
Shut up, Tej!
Dom... (OVER EARPIECE) Do you really wanna put that car in gear?
Do it.
Huh?
I didn't think so.
They're heading for the sea lock.
They're trying to trap the sub in the bay.
I should have taken care of this a long time ago.
Rhodes, take his team out.
I'm on it.
Roman, get in front of me!
Okay, y'all wanna play rough?
Now it's my turn.
Yeah, baby!
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)
Guys, we got snowmobiles on the right.
They're gonna flank us!
No, they ain't!
Oh, shit!
(BEEPING)
Tej!
Roman, hold tight, I'm on the way!
I don't wanna go swimmin'!
No!
Really, Tej?
Oh, no, no, no!
Oh, shit!
Roman, grab your door!

What is going on?

Yo, shrinkage!
We got a sub to catch.
Get in!
What?
Depressurization alert in the cargo hold.
Drop it to 10,000 feet.
I know how much these people mean to you.
So I will let you pick the first target.
I don't pick a target from a mile away.
I stand face to face and look 'em dead in the eye.
(CHUCKLES)
Okay.
The wife it is.
(BOTH GRUNTING)
Nice plane.
I'm gonna enjoy having this.
Hey, don't go gettin' any ideas.
You and planes don't have a good history.
No shit.
Okay, let's go, Scarface.
These assholes ain't gonna kill themselves.
Pull up surveillance right now.
(COMPUTER TRILLS)
Surprise.
You're supposed to be dead.
(IN SPANISH)
You're driving.
- I said from the beginning...
- No way.
- I am not going to drive.
- I'm not driving.
We have a security breach in the cargo hold.
Take care of it now.
(GASPS)
Jesus, Mum.
You're supposed to avoid the nerves.
Oh, shut up.
Don't be such a baby.
Get to the pilot.
He's got the second key.
Wait for my signal.
Give Cipher my regards.
Did Toretto hold up his end of the deal?
MRS. SHAW:
He gave us this little thing here.
No, no, no.
Don't touch.
You can track Cipher with this, but you can't do this on your own.
There's gotta be two of ya.
Fine.
I've got contacts.
No, you're gonna take your brother.
- Oh, dear...
- Yes.
(ALL GRUNTING)
Toretto knows where he is.
He's got this thing.
It can see everything.
It's like...
It's called the Devil's Bum Hole or something.
It's called the God's Eye.
Yeah, well, whatever.
(GRUNTING)
There's no way I'm using Owen, all right?
He's a lost cause.
He's your brother, Decks.
He's my son.
He's our family.
And our family don't die in bloody cages.
(CRYING)
How can you talk like that about Owen?
I can't believe you.
You've gone and upset me.
You've really upset your mother.
Call yourself a brother?
You're...

Okay, okay.

Congratulations, Dom.
You just killed your son.
You're wrong.
I just saved him.
And you just took your foot off the tiger's neck.
All right, governor, it's gonna get noisy.
This is for your ears.

(MUSIC PLAYING OVER HEADPHONES)
Good?

Let's go.
No!
Stop him!
Do not let him get off this plane!
LITTLE NOBODY:
We got another problem.
That truck's got enough missiles to take us all out.
Then don't give 'em a target.
Everybody, get in front of us, line up, and we'll take the hit.
What?
I need to switch cars right now!
(IN RUSSIAN)
Target acquired.
- Roman, here comes the bad part.
- What?
(BOTH GRUNTING)
(WHOOPS)
Hang in there, guys.
We're almost to the lock.
It's easy for you to say when your ass ain't on fire.
All right, little man, this might be a little scary, but it's gonna be a lot of fun.
(BOTH GRUNTING)
How's the music, good?
Ah.
(ALL GROANING)
They're locking on.
Sorry, guys, I got no tricks left.
What do we do now?

We start prayin'!
Hell, yeah!
There's Dom!
What, is this guy on our side now?
Who the hell cares?
He just saved our ass!
Good to be riding with you again, man.

Toretto just cleared the way for them.
Someone, give me something!
Torpedoes are ready.
Then launch them!
Shit.
- Take the wheel!
- I ain't taking' shit!
Take the wheel!
Where you goin'?
(GROANS)
This is crazy!

They're gonna reach the lock before the sub does.

Oh, shit!
We're gonna need a bigger truck.

The sub's too close.
We ain't making it to the gate in time.
We're just going to let it get away?
Not if I know Dom.
You lose, Dom.
I destroyed two of your teams.
I killed your red-headed boyfriend.
And I put two killers on your untraceable plane.
You lost the minute you interrupted my honeymoon.
Now guess who I'm coming for.
Put a heatseeker on him now.
(SHOUTS) Now!
Fire!
That's a goddamn heatseeker coming at us!
Peel off!
Head to the shore!

- (BEEPING)
- Watch.
Resourceful.
You have a lot to answer for, Cipher.
What you've put my family through.
My mother.
I'm gonna make sure that never happens again.

There is only one flaw in your plan.
What's that?
Only one of us has a parachute.

I have so much to tell you.
Yeah, you do.
And you can start with that bitch.
Now, that's Dominic Toretto.
Hey, Dom!
I'm just throwin' it out there, we need to get up outta here 'cause there's all kinda nuclearism happening under this ice.
Relax.
Without the trigger chips, those nukes are harmless.
Okay.
So we good, then.
Let me go on and get my young selfie levels up.
You realize this is classified, right?
Not today.
(CAMERA CLICKS)
Unbelievable.
All right, can we get up outta here, now?
I'm freezin'!
It's okay.
Don't worry.
He's gonna be here soon.
ROMAN:
I get it.
Y'all got a lot in common.
Computer hacks, God's Eye, geeks, nerd...
You know.
But we got a lot in common, too, right?
Like what?
We walk in the room and we're oozing' sex appeal.
Me and you, hip to hip, is a problem.
I'm askin' a real question right now.
Is it gonna be Revenge of the Nerds or The Dark Knight?
Huh?
To be honest, I like both of you.
(ROMAN AND TEJ EXCLAIMING)
But just before we get into all of that, let me ask you one question.
You can ask me anything.
Anything.
What's my last name?
When you guys figure it out, then, I guess you can let me know.
It's gonna be Parker.
That's all that really matters.
- ROMAN:
Jones.
- TEJ:
Mrs. Parker.
- Right?
- Hey, Mrs. Parker...
LETTY:
Hey.
Letty.
I wanted to thank you.
No need.
Well...
Cipher's still on the loose.
There's been some reports she's in Athens, but she won't be nuking any cities anytime soon.
Thanks to you guys.
So, I got you a party favor.

This can't be good.

You know, after 16 years, I figure it's time for a little break.
Wow.
Daddy's stayin' home.
(LAUGHS)
Nobody.
Keep in touch.
Ah.
Hang on a second.
This could be interesting.
(SIGHS) What made you think I'd do it?
Brotherhood.
I saw that look you gave Cipher, knew you wanted revenge.
Glad I did it.
I can't believe you went to see my mother.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
All this fuss over you.

Yes.
Elena, I promised to keep our son safe.
And now, he always will be.
I wanna introduce you to the most important person in my universe.
One who never gave up on me.
He's beautiful.
DOM:
You've heard me say that you never turn your back on family, and I wanna thank you all for never turning your back on me.
You wanna meet them?
All right.
Everyone, meet Brian.

HOBBS:

Welcome to the family, Brian.
Okay, I guess it's my turn to say grace.
We thank you for giving us family.
We sit here in praise.
Thank you for giving us the strength...
HAVANA, CUBA
-
We swap in parts from Ford Plymouths and Cadillac.
My grandfather bought it in 1957.
When he died it passed to my father.
Then my brother and now to me.
Look at this, this is an engine from a boat.
- No way.
- Yeah!
Whatever it takes to keep it running!
This is a cuban spirit.
Your spirit, keep it up.
Never ever lose that.
Dom..
It's your cousin..
He's in trouble, come quickly!
Come on, come on.
Please don't do this, Understand my problem.
You know I can't make living without my car.
Isn't my problem bro.
Dominic Toretto..
I heard about you.
Welcome to my island.
Why he hooking up my cousin's car?
In the morning, I gave it to him..
He can't pay..
I take the car.
I just need a few more days.
Few more days isn't part of the deal.
Come on..
You make a deal you gotta live up to it.
You make a deal You gonna live up to it.
Gonna live up to it?
So you are one of those types..
You take everyone's ride and then ship it back to the states.
You should show your people some respect.
You watch your mouth.
Now you got a problem.
I'm gonna keep it about the cars.
I am really scared.
You want a car?
Get it the right way.
- How?
- Race war.
I already own it, bro.
Not that car.
Mine.
Dom, his car is the fastest car in the Island.
Do you know what he has under the hood?
Do you know, it doesn't matter what's under a hood?
The only thing that matters is who's behind the wheel.
- You think so?
- I know so.
Then race his car.
We ain't racing a quarter mile here.
We race the cuban mile.
Done!
I appreciate you what you're trying to do.
My car is the slowest car on the Island.
Was..!
Pull the seats the doors the battery..
It ain't the motor, take it off.
- Laughing gas?
- Nah, Fed.
This is cuban NOS.
You guys are crazy.
- What are you doing?
- Warm as turbo.
Pull that back in line..
Hold on!
Old trick used to play.
In case of emergencies.
You know that's way too much booze for that engine.
- It's going to be fast.
- It's gonna be a bomb.
Only needs to go a mile.
Are you ready for this, family?
This is Havana!
Be fast!
Be safe!
But don't be last.
Racers ready..?
Go..!
Stop.
That car belongs in the trash bro.
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.
Let's go.
- Go steer.
- Si.
Adios, Toretto.
Ok, buster...
Let's see if this works.
That's impossible..
Look out.
A deal's a deal.
You own my car.
And you earn my respect.
Keep your car.
Your respect is good enough for me.
Yo Cousin.
Sorry 'bout your car,
Your's was too slow for a Torreto anyway.
Your Impala.
Are you serious?
Look at that smile
I love it when you smile.
Make me happy.
I think this place makes you happy.
It's like it speaks to you.
You remember that guy?
The Racer and his dad.
- The one with the boat engine.
- Yeah!
- Yeah.
- Of course.
I was looking at them, and I..
And I couldn't help but too imagine what you'd be like, if you were dad.
No, no, no...
I'm not pregnant.
Is that what you want?
It's not about what I want or what you want..
It's about why we haven't asked the question.
Can I help you with that?
- What?
- You need a hand?
Yeah, I think I do.
Sounds like you're not getting any fuel.
Yeah.
See if we can get some power into it.
What brings you to Cuba?
The same thing that brings everyone else to Cuba.
Culture.
People.
Beauty.
What brings you to Cuba?
- Work!
- Must be casual Friday.
How is that honeymoon going Dom?
Your fuel relay is missing.
I know.
I'd love to play games.
Beaten the bests alone.
I'm kinda in a rush, so if you got something to say...
Oh this is a very different game that I can assure you.
This..?
There is something much greater at work here.
This is fate.
- I choose to make my own fate.
- Not today.
This is the road you take to your apartment every morning.
What else is different, Dom?
The Santiago's closed?
Did you have to cross two blocks to go get your cuban coffee?
So, what is it?
Black, no sugar?
Yeah..
I've put a lot of work into getting you here in today.
Now that I'm here, what do you want?
I want you to work for me.
Work for you?
Well, I could have saved you a lot of time then.
See, I don't work for anyone.
You can't walk away from this Dom.
We're gonna have this conversation one way or the other.
See that's the funny thing about fate.
It's cunning.
It can bring you beautiful things, and it can also bring you moments like this.
I will hear that you want to work for me.
You're gonna betray your brothers, abandon your code, shatter your family.
See, your team..
Is about to go up against the only thing they can't handle.
What's that?
You.
Oh, and Dom, I wouldn't mention this to anyone.
They are gonna be hitting us with everything they've got.
So, we wanna engage with maximum speed.
Neutralize the shooters and then move on to our objective.
There are two things I want you to keep in mind,
Number one,
I choose you for this squad because you are the most fearsome warriors on the planet.
And number two,
You go out there, you do your job.
And you take 'em down.
Everyone...
And I mean everyone..
Manice and pedice at the mall.
Later on today.
I don't wanna play anymore.
Alright, let's go, girls.
Let's go, let's go.
- Final 2 minutes.
- Quite the cheering section.
Oh yeah.
That's moms they come out to sport the kids.
Except there seems to be more moms than kids,
Way more like moms and..
Yeah, it's a big soccer job.
Let's go girls.
So your intel was spot on...
A democly 7 EMP weapon that went missing in the gulf.
Arms dealer from the Liberation front have it in Berlin.
- Shit.
- This thing can wipe out..
An entire electrical grid in a major city.
No lights, no power, instant stone age.
Chloe, Maya...
You can't let her run by you like that.
- Let's go, let's go.
- Hey, Hobbs.
This is a class 4 WMD.
Do you have any idea what's at stake here...?
Yes..!
I know exactly what is at stake here, okay?
If Pink Butterflies beat my Red Dragon that means we lose the championship.
Which means I have 20 little girls who are crying..
And that's not a good thing.
Which then means I have to spend a lot of time in ice cream shops and lot of time in Tay-Tay concerts.
- Tay-Tay?
- Yep?
Taylor Swift.
You gotta be shitting me Get it together.
Let's go girls.
We need you to do this,
Lot of lives are at stake.
I need to be clear here.
US Government can not sanction this operation in anyway.
You're on your own.
This thing goes sideways you don't just get burned, you go to prison.
And there's nothing we can do to get you out.
Let me tell you something.
The only thing that I love more than saving lives..
Is my daughter.
So you don't shut up with this government bullshit right now and start showing some team spirit and respect for the Red Dragons.
I'm gonna have all 20 of them lined up kick you right in the Tay-Tay.
Go, Dragons!
Say it again.
- Go, Dragons!
- Good boy.
Go Dragons..
Go Dragons..
Go, he's open...
Go, Yup!
Yes!
That is my daughter right there!
Yes!
Ah, yes, come here.
- Awesome.
- Nice job.
Daddy's gotta go to work?
Oh yeah, daddy's gotta go to work.
Now, you gonna need to get a team that you can trust.
Oh, I already got one.
- Hey, Dom.
- Hey, Hobbs.
We got a job in Berlin, and I need a favor, brother.
No problem.
I grab the team and meet you in Berlin.
Thanks man.
I'll see you soon.
You were only to supposed to create a diversion, Roman.
That was a diversion.
How many of the damn explosives did you use?
I do not know, Tez.
All of it?
- Wait, all of it?
- Roman, Jesus!
- Christ!
- You have more of your fan club ahead.
They're still on us.
These guys are taking this personal.
Roman, we just blown up their facility and stole their EMP.
Other than your doctor's cold fingers,
I'd say it's about as personal as it can get.
- Phase 2.
- Phase 2?
So you just gonna keep that to yourself?
What happen to Phase 1?
What about that part?
Yeah, remember the airplane?
Everyone drove their cars out but you.
I told you my engine seized up.
It's your balls that seized up?
Just follow my lead, okay?
And Roman, whatever you do.
Don't think.
Tez, drop it.
Bomb's away.
Split now!
Holy shit!
Look out..!
- Great plan Tez.
- Just so you know.
You miss some.
I'll just wait for it.
Oh...
Shit!
I hate you, Tez!
Got your ass.
You good?
I'll see you when it's done.
Alright.
Great job, team.
Let's break up and meet me at the safe house.
Hell of a job, brother.
When we can get back to the base.
Beers on me.
You lost your god damn mind, Toretto!
Toretto you put hands on that thing, you're gonna have the whole world coming for you including me.
I don't know what you're doing but you better think about this, Toretto.
It ain't too late to stop this.
It is now.
That some bitch just crossed us..
What?
Wait a second, what are you talking about?
- Dom took the EMP.
- Bullshit.
Where are you?
It's too late for me.
Get out of here.
Saw that look in his eyes.
I've seen that look before.
Dominic Toretto just went rogue.
Alright, I got his phone records, y'all.
It's a whole bunch of calls to untraceable numbers.
Burner phone, right?
Nah.
Scrambled.
Same number but they got some sort of micro-router..
..to bury the signal path which means Dom is clearly..
Look, I do not know Dom as well as you, but if we just look at the facts.
Dom's been having highly encrypted conversation with some mysterious person.
He took out Hobbs.
He stole the EMP, now he's disappeared.
So what're you saying?
Maybe we should consider the fact that..
Hobb's right.
Dom did go rogue.
- Letty.
- Before you judge the man,
Remember you're breathing now because he saved your life.
You just gonna let her bump your shoulder like that
I'm just saying it out..
That was a little aggressive.
What're you gonna do.
Email her?
Chick..
No no, wait, fellas.
Thank you.
Well, this is an exciting new look.
That's a little tight on the crotch as always.
What boyband bus did she fallen off?
My new junior associate.
He's working with me on this.
All yours.
Mr Nobody and I have been given the authority to get you out of this.
All you have to do is agree to the terms and you're free.
Restraining wills, talking about, what terms?
Confess to your crimes in Berlin.
Treason, international espionage.
Massive destruction of civic property.
You do that, we close the case.
And?
And the DSS blacklist.
Sure Germany loves that.
Officially you'll be a criminal.
Woah, woah, woah.
You need to work on your delivery alright.
Unofficially.
You're off the books.
Come work with me.
- I'm not a criminal.
- Luke Come on.
Labels.
There is no confession.
There are no back room deals.
Got myself into this, I'm gonna get myself out of it.
You know that.
I do and that's what I told them.
Well, there you have it.
Good luck in the course, man!
What about your daughter?
You know, if you're not gonna do it your country, at least do it for your kid.
Big mistake kid.
Hold on.
Look, look.
He's still working from the manual.
I mean, he doesn't even really know the rules.
Oh come on.
Give him a break.
Get a break.
Luke?
I appreciate that.
- It's good to see you, Nobody.
- You too.
Rule No.1, know your audience.
I gave you your shot, you shit the bed.
Now I'm gonna show you how to get this done.
- You're dead cop!
- Dead!
Well, well, well...
Luke Hobbs behind bars.
Would you look at that?
The band cop got it's day.
You know, that color looks good on you.
Yeah.
Look a whole hell of a lot better with your blood on it.
Yeah.
Good luck with that, Hercules.
.. gone bad.
Huh?
Such a cliche.
Ah well.
Welcome to the club.
I wouldn't get that twisted son.
We ain't in no club.
We got nothing in common.
And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.
You bring the shovel did you?
Cause it's 38 feet of steel and concrete.
What's up big dog?
Better get to dig in.
You wanker.
Move..
Say that again.
If I say it again, It will be to acorpse.
I'm going to enjoy this.
Welcome back, Dom.
Nice job out there.
Excited about tonight?
You're going on this?
You're with me Dom.
- Showing me your shoe collection?
- Yup.
A pair for every occasion.
There's enough guns here to outfit a small army.
Huh?
Oh this is just the tip of the iceberg.
You know what I like about you, Dom.
You're a genuine outlaw.
I mean, you're a man who lives by his own rules.
Which was surprising because when I saw you in Cuba, I heard about a guy who almost killed you with a motorcycle and you..
let him keep his car?
- Oh, that confused you?
- Hmm.
Of course I could've taken his car.
But it's about something bigger.
This way...
I changed them.
That's not your responsibility.
- That's who I am.
- Is it?
Let me ask you something Dom, what's the best thing in your life?
- Family.
- No, it's not.
But if you're being honest?
It's the 10 seconds between start and finish, when you're not thinking about anything.
No family, not obligations, just you.
Being free.
I gotta tell you.
This whole saving the world...
Robin Hood nonsense you've been doing recently...
It's bullshit.
It's not you.
Be who you are.
Why live only a quarter mile at a time, when you can live your whole life that way?
See all those blow that muscles will give you.
All show and no..
Well I got plenty of goal.
You must have misplaced that.
When I kicked your ass up in down that office of yours.
Yeah.
Just like you Brits, rewriting History, huh?
All I know.
It was not me who was thrown out of a 4 storey window.
Jumped.
I jumped out of a 4 storey window.
Saving my partner's life.
Because where I'm from, we don't settle fight by throwing bombs.
Well, that's funny, because where I'm from, we don't need women to run to our rescue.
I mean, do you really believe you could stand in front of me?
And beat me in a straight up old fashioned fist fight?
Let me tell you something.
Me and you...
One on one, no one else around.
I will beat your ass like a Cherokee drum.
Maybe one day we will find that out.
Oh, you better hope that day never comes.
I said no, Mr. Nobody.
I'm not leaving this cell.
I'll get out my way.
The right way.
- Get back to your cell.
- It's just a malfunction.
- Get back!
- Just a malfunction.
Don't let him get away.
Hobbs!
I've been waiting a long time for this.
Keep waiting bitch!
Rubber bullets, big mistake.
Ah, took longer than I expected.
- 2 questions.
- Yeah.
- My daughter?
- With your sister.
- Toretto?
- That's interesting you ask.
This is my new base, welcome to Nowhere.
Nice little stair for you.
Listen, It's something I don't wanna talk to you about...
Hey, listen guys.
Thanks..
Whoa, whoa, what handcuff.
What is this?
It's called the abuse of power.
You told me to round 'em up.
I told you that...
hand..
Cut 'em loose.
Oh man, this is embarrassing.
I'm sorry guys, what do I have?
This is how you treat old friends?
Friend?
We don't even really know who the hell this guys is.
It does not matter who I am, Tez I'm like Nobody ok?
Nobody, then who is he?
He's nothing he's like less than me.
Clearly we're getting nowhere, with nobody.
I've been in here for 4 hours, my ribs are sore.
I don't know about y'all, but I'm out.
- I wouldn't recommend that.
- What?
Well, thanks to your bust Berlin job.
You all made interpol's top 10 most wanted list.
Top 10?
Uh-huh.
That's alright.
Well, not you.
What do you mean?
You just missed the cut, you're number 11.
- So.
- I missed it?
- Yeah.
- That's impossible.
What number did they come in at?
Six, eight, nine...
Ten.
She's Ten?
That's impossible, there is no way she's at 10.
Oh, She's definitely at 10.
How about we focus on someone who we're not gonna find out in anybody's list?
We are awaiting hard confirmation, but...
I believe that's the cyber terrorist known as Cipher.
Wait, no, Cipher's an organization.
Not a person.
Not according to our sources.
- What does she want?
- I don't know.
Cipher is like a digital active God.
They, she, can manipulate world systems under shadows.
Anything that can be hacked..
And here is the kicker.
You will never find her linked to any other.
Her digital identity is scrubbed every few seconds worldwide.
So basically, she is the boogeyman.
Yeah, she is.
One of the hottest boogeyman I have ever seen, I mean...
If y'all know her, tell her to get extra boy.
- What are you, 12?
- That was my scene.
Let's just say.
People are scared of the hacker group Anonymous.
But even anonymous won't mess with her.
What the hell does any of this have to do with us?
Probably nothing, Letty.
But...
I do find it interesting, apparently for some reason.
She's now working with this guy.
He's already delivered a fully operational EMP into her hands.
Detonate that, they can turn any city in the world into a war zone.
So then what is it that you're suggesting?
Maybe we find Dom huh?
Well, first let's catch him and then figure out
- why he's turned.
- So y'all want us...
To track Dom.
And I know Roman, it's kinda a big job.
- It's impossible.
- Which is why...
I'm bringing in an extra pair of hands.
Ah.
My day just got a whole hell of a lot better.
Mr. Nobody you want to tell me why you just put me in a room with this teen crumpeting criminal, some bitch.
You got a big mouth on a small head.
Coming from prisoner 6753.
Don't think we've forgotten everything that you've done.
We're not...
teaming up with this guy.
Let's get one thing clear.
I ain't on your team.
I don't care about you, you crew...
Your little family.
I'm here for Cipher.
You gonna do apply for a job, Head-asshole?
You don't think that tight t-shirt is cutting off the circulation to your brain.
You should get bigger size.
Cipher came to me first.
Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.
When I said no, she went off to my brother.
Oh Yes.
Brother Owen who could forget him?
Former hell-raiser and current guest, at a nasty little black site prison.
Cipher corrupted him left him for dead.
So if I get a shot to take her down, believe me, flicks I'm taking it.
You're taking my boot right up your ass.
Guys, guys, guys.
The fastest way to find Cipher is through Toretto.
Now aside from myself, there's only two men in the world, that have ever managed to actually track him..
Down with any success.
And guess what.
They're both standing in front of me right now.
So like it or not, you two are gonna work together.
You got that?
I'm gonna take that as a yes.
Am I the only one seeing this?
Oh, this oughtta be good.
Use God's eye.
We put our lives on the line..
Running around the world trying to figure this thing out.
It can find anybody, right?
Let's use it to find Dom.
Roman, that is a great idea.
Did you hear that?
Great idea.
- And no, no!
No pointing out.
- Mr. Nobody.
Let's fire it up.. huh?
Got him.
He's in London.
Wait, we have got a 2nd match in Hong Kong.
- Bejing and Seole.
- And Tokyo.
And just about every other major city on the planet.
And so...
God's eye was where we start.
Cipher's already created an evasion that masked her location by..
Pinging random spots all over the globe.
But it was a good thought Roman.
So she's made my programme obsolete.
And that Ramsey..
- is why are you here.
- See, simple solutions... aren't gonna cut it here slick.
Why are you looking at me when you're saying that?
Wait a second, wait, wait.
Simple solutions might just cut it.
In order for God's eyes to give up all this false pings,
Means they have to be using a free relay.
Watch these two.
Which means it has a decaying sync quantanizer.
Which we can reverse.
And track it back to the originating source and find Dom's true location.
Telling you, they got skills.
That was my idea.
That's what I was saying, remember in there?
Alright.
Let's try this.
It's working..
Time you wanna take your manual and start organizing first response...
Let's get a hold of our internatio...
He's still..
Yes, like first baby shit.
Yes, we've tried those location... ..wanna mobilize.
Let's get a hold of a, better asshole.
No one respects you, over.
Get away from me.
Alright they are not in China..
Or Russia.
Europe's clear.
But this one's not going away.
This is interesting.
Why?
Because that's here.
Did you all enjoy that?
Next generation concussion grenade.
It scrambles your senses.
Don't worry, It'll wear off in an hour.
Probably.
Hello, Deckard.
Nice to see you again.
Look at this, bodies not even cold Dom.
Your family's already replacing you.
You chose the loosing team.
I guess your brother is smarter than you.
Smart move embedding God's eye into the mainframe.
Irritating to make me have to come all the way down here to get it, but.
Let's go.
Dom!
You're gonna turn your back on family?
Just like that?
Let's go.
You okay?
That wasn't him.
I don't know what she's got on him.
But that wasn't Dom.
- Bryan would know what to do.
- No.
We can't bring Bryan and Mia into this.
We agreed on that.
I know.
Back there was that for her, for me, or you?
Or was it either necessary?
Necessary?
Nothing is necessary.
Everything is a choice.
I simply made one but so did you.
You could have stopped me, but you chose not to do.
I wonder what Letty thought about that.
The problem of putting your foot on a Tiger's neck... is you can never let it up.
I think I need to remind you why you chose to be here.
Dom.
Sorry.
You shoudn't have come.
Nothing's gonna get me away.
Now she has the three of us.
You wanna see him?
See papa.
Papa.
When I realized I was pregnant.
You had just find out Letty was alive.
So I decided when Letty and you go back from your honeymoon.
I was going to tell you.
And then she took us before I had the chance.
I call him Michaels.
That his middle name.
I thought his father should give him first name.
I'm sorry, Dom.
There is nothing to be sorry for.
Whatever happens...
Just save our son.
Your son.
-
Good visit?
I know.
I know what you're thinking.
I just let the guards go, so there is only two opponents in the room.
Rhodes has the gun, so you'll take him out first, I know you.
And then you're thinking.
Elena is a cop, maybe the two of you can fight your way out of here.
So much to think about.
Let me make it easier for you.
Do with it as you wish.
Have you heard of choice theory Dom?
There's a bunch of axiems but only two you really need to concern yourself with,
One.
The only person's behavior we can control is our own.
And two, the only thing we can truly give another person is information, so let me give you some.
You see this cameras in here?
The moment you make a move, highly paid men with weapons, will make there way into this room.
With one very...
specific instruction.
It's not to save me.
It's to kill your son.
And that's a lot of bullets.
And it only takes one for you to loose everything.
So, I have to ask you, because...
I know family is so important to you.
Is that really a choice you wanna make?
Because I'm ready as you are.
I pull this trigger, and God knows I wanna..
I'll kill everyone on this plane...
I still couldn't get in there.
Cause you here manipulate this system.
Since I'm alone!
I got no choice!
I don't think so.
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch.
Damn it..
She wiped it off.
Took God's eye.
That was the one thing we could use to find him.
We lost everything.
- Yeah, princess?
- Find it to rail.
But I've got couple of minutes to spare.
If you want me to send you to the hospital again.
- Yo Rules!
- First off,
- That's not my name.
- Little nobody.
- Don't call me that.
- Oh that's definitely stinky.
Great do me a favor, and tell your majesty over there, that we're gonna find Toretto.
We find Toretto together as a team.
When this is all over, you have me to slap that whickest biscuit right off his face.
Wait a minute, guys.
I think Decker's actually onto something.
How do you think Dom and Cipher got into the country without us knowing?
- Ghost flights.
- That untraceable aircraft it was all internet conspiracy stuff.
It's not.
Satellites and radar grids...
All across the globe shift.
Like an ocean.
And they've got channels that open and close.
And theoretically, if you know the right people who...
Know the right patterns.
You can fly right through the blind's box... can't be intercepted.
So you know where Dom is headed?
Yeah, New York.
You see there Luke..
You guys...
are gonna get along just great.
Which proves, rule number two, you never lose everything.
Fire up the chopper.
Guys, have a bowl and a Big Apple.
Are we travelling like this again?
Because Dom took God's Eye, so we need to stay off the grid.
But like this?
Look here man.
Before I throw up in my mouth...
Let me ask you what are we doing here?
That's a good question, Roman.
Let me show you.
Welcome to our new base of operations.
Now seriously, what is this place?
This... is heaven.
The agency garage.
We call it the toy shop.
This is where we house every vehicles seized from drug dealers of East coast.
Now.
Mr nobody said..
If we're gonna have a chance of catching Dom..
We're gonna have to be damn fast.
Maybe this could help.
We got a tank.
750 horsepower.
6.6 liter V8 Duramax engine.
With the M153 probe remotely operated weapon station on top.
You didn't get this from drug dealers.
No.
No that...
United State's army weaponry.
See the army developing machines like this the soldiers could drive from a mile way so they can stay safe.
And alive.
But luckily..
There is a back up driver seat for those of us who like to get more..
Hands on.
I'm sitting there wondering this whole time when this thing feeling badly and she's getting fact.
No one is getting hands on it.
She doesn't go on some streets.
I'm in love.
Again?
No.
No...
That's a million dollar show car.
The point is to not draw attention.
It's reverse psychology.
Dom will never see it coming.
It's neon orange,
The international space station would see it coming.
Go choose anything less inspeculous.
No no.
This is ridiculous.
Hey my man, you can put that down right there.
This is a gift.
A real gift.
I know what you're doing.
I like your beard.
You're blanta.
Black santa?
No, I'm serious.
Put it down right here..
What are you doing?
Engine's mis-firing, I gotta check it out.
No.
That's not part of the plan, Dom.
Clearly..
But unless you want the engine to cease on the job,
You have five minutes.
I want another visual.
I got an ATM
I don't like this.
I want to see Toretto.
There are no more cameras.
Then find something.
Punch in on something reflective A car mirror, anything..
- You know who I am?
- That's why I'm here.
You know what I'm capable of.
It's why I'm here.
I'll give you until I finish my cup up.
And I'm fucking thirsty.
I got limited time.
So won't take up too much of yours.
Oh no.
No, you've already taken everything I have of value, Mr. Toretto,
What more could you possibly want?
To give you something back.
Talk to me.
Something's not right here.
First time I saw my son... was behind a bulletproof glass.
When he reached me, I couldn't hold on.
It's the worst pain I ever felt..
I know you know exactly how that feels.
Maybe we could change that..
I think..
You are about to suggest something really dodgy Mr Toretto.
It's why I'm here.
Just punch in on something, I'm not liking this.
Something is not right.
- Rhodes, you close?
- Yeah.
- Go.
- The delivery truck's moving.
Captain Deckard Shaw, distinguished himself by acts of gallantry of the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.
His bold actions saved the lives of hostages and his team mates.
Recommendation:
Victoria Cross.
Highest honor the British Government has ever given.
To a traitor.
Some about this old thing just doesn't add up to me.
Well then don't do the same kind of funny math,
It says a DSS agent who has a soul to stop a valid stolen EMP.
Sound familiar huh?
Wanna give me a hand?
- On three?
- Yeah.
One two..
You know, you can tell this in another letter..
But maybe we could've caused some serious damage.
- Yes, we could have.
- Yeah.
Shame I'll have to punch you, head of defend, when this is all over.
Ah well.
With all due respect, Captain,
When this whole thing is over we're gonna find a location and I'm gonna knock your teeth so far down your throat.
You're gonna stick a toothbrush right up in your ass to brush up.
Give me God's eyes.
- God's eye active.
- Thanks.
Let's find us some Russian.
That spy with my little lie...
Minister of defense.
We land back in Moscow by nine.
Here's the latest defense report, All the items in yesterday's meet.
Upload this coordinates to Dom's nav.
Copy that.
He's in the third car.
It's a guard class limousine.
Where's my team?
- Where's his team?
- There's no sign of 'em yet.
They are off the grid.
Probably just bunker down somewhere.
Closing in on him.
You guys ready?
One thing I can guarantee you Dom.
No one's ready for this.
I want every with chip with the GEODIE exploits in a two mile radius around that motorcade now.
There's over a thousands of them.
Hack 'em all.
It's zombie time.
I'd buckle up if I were you.
AUTO-DRIVE ACTIVATED.
Hey..!
Target the motorcade.
And here they come.
What is going on?
Ouch.
Drive fast!
Police escort down..
Take out the lead and follow cars.
Drive!
Drive!
- Two more down.
- Still a new warranty.
There's more cars ahead of us.
Shoot their engines.
Oh God!
We got an army of cars driving themselves.
Send backup!
Send S.W.A.T!
I don't care if you send the goddamn boy scout...
- Just send up some help!
- Now that's Dom.
Faster, faster!
The motorcade just turned on 7th.
Perfect.
Make it rain.
Target immobilized.
You are up Dom.
- Who the hell is that?
- What is he doing?
What the hell are you waiting for?
Shoot him!
Come on, come on!
I'm out.
Shit.
Don't worry sir.
This car is bulletproof.
You'll be safe in here.
- Give me the case.
- Give him the case.
These are nuclear launch codes.
We cannot give it to him.
What is he doing now?
He just cut a hole in our gas tank.
Good work, Dom.
Meet you at the pick-up.
I think I know where my team's at.
- Where?
- Right in front of me.
This is on you.
Get out of there, Dom.
Guys, I know why Dom's here.
Police scanners are saying he's stolen Nuclear Football.
It's over, Toretto.
Get your ass out of the car now.
That's how you wanna play this?
Let's play.
Don't do this, Dom.
- What're you doing?
- It's a trap!
Now I know what it feels like be every cop ever chasing us.
I'm gonna get a little close and I ped him.
Oh, so you just gonna take Dom?
Little Nobody has clearly lost his little mind.
I'm on him.
Easy, work together.
- Look out!
- Wait, wait, wait!
Oh shit.
I will take the short cut.
Look out!
Watch these people.
Big Sexy coming through!
Not this time, Dom.
Stretch him out.
Hold them.
He gotta have about 2000 Horse Power in that thing.
Try 3000..
Try Five.
Get out of there.
I'm working on it.
Stop working on it, and do it..
No, no no...
It's my Bentley.
No!
Get that case and run!
Move!
They thought...
this was gonna be a streetfight.
You wait for it..
No!
Letty, stop!
What are you gonna do?
I don't know why you're doing this, but I know one thing.
You love me.
And you're not gonna to shoot me.
You should've given him the case, cause I won't chase you.
Okay.
I will just take it from a dead girl.
You willing to die for it?
Let's go then.
Anything?
They're gone.
And D.O.D confirmed it was a nuclear football.
He's got an EMP and nuclear launch codes.
I don't know what it is, but they're building towards something.
Deckard?
He didn't make it.
I'm disappointed in you, Dom.
You're gonna Letty just walk away with the codes.
- You've got the codes!
- Rhodes got the codes.
You made the choice to let her go.
And now I have to make one on my own.
They are adorable little things, aren't they?
I hope I don't hurt him.
Look, Cipher, I did exactly what you asked me to do.
Don't do this.
- This is your doing.
- My doing?
Please don't hurt him.
I'm begging you.
I don't want you to beg.
- I want you to learn.
- Learn what?
I understand why you did what you did.
I really do.
But it was the wrong choice.
This is a consequence, Dom.
No!
No!
No...
Wait.
Wait.
No!
Can you pull up the footage from the guy in the ally.
- Traffic cams.
- I got you.
I knew it.
I recognize that guy.
That's Connor Rhodes.
I met him when I was working with Shaw's brother.
He wanted us to get the Nightshade device him.
Connor Rhodes.
He's also linked to somebody who I like to forget.
Mose Jakande.
Warlord who tried to get God's eye.
Which means that's twice that Dom has messed up Cipher's business.
Everything you're feeling right now, that's rage, sense of loss.
It's not real.
It's a survival instinct wired deep into our brains.
To ensure continuation of species.
When early men went visit a watering hole...
If they didn't watch their child, they got snatched by a crocodile.
Their brains would create a painful but a structural memory.
So it will never happen again.
This idea of family that is so core with you, that rules your world...
It's a biological lie.
You don't have to accept it.
I don't!
Did you really could think you could destroy two of my teams.
Without any repercussions?
I wouldn't have even looked your way..
If you hadn't done that.
You didn't even know you had a kid.
You can thank me for that.
And start doing the job I'm asking you to do.
Help you start a war.
Is that what you think I want.
That's so limited.
I didn't take that football to start a war..
Anymore than I took your son to start a family.
Taking your son got me the codes..
The codes will get me the nukes, and the nukes will get me what I want...
Today, tomorrow...
and every day after that.
What's that?
Accountability.
The second I fire off one of those nukes..
I put the superpowers of this world on notice that when they cross the line,
...I'm gonna be there to hold the responsible..
Because the truth is, Dom To the world out there I'm the crocodile at the watering hole.
You've got one last job to do.
Cipher..
If I were you, I would kiss my son.
Because whether you value it or not, all of this...
Your plane, your security and you are still on this earth because of him.
The problem we have with tracking Cipher is there's nothing to trace then.
Now we have Rhodes' information.
And we're getting snapshots of this data before it's scrubbed off the net.
That looks like somebody's bank accounts?
Always just...
The Longitude.
Given the fact that Dom hit the Russian Motorcade safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead, bring up the map.
Great, let's start here run the possibilities.
Yalta, Poltava.
Looks like they just threw letters together.
- Konyert.
- It's Vladupi.
What are you doing here?
Thought I was gonna check in on you from time to time,
To see you how you're doing.
By the way, not so hot.
But there's nothing in Vladiven.
It's just ice..
That funny...
Could've sworn there was a secret Russian naval base with the retrophilic cold war Submarines.
Well, technically, it's not Russian anymore.
Base was take by a terror grope of military separatists about a month ago.
And the Russians haven't taken it back yet.
So there is a little window of opportunity here.
Russian submarines, nuclear football, it sounds like everything we do our legs gonna be bombed off.
Sounds like you're still a No. 11 on the list.
It sounds like you've changed since you look punk ass.
Facial hairs and camen.
Guys... guys.
Hey.
We gotta call this in all the way up the chain.
That's good thinking champ.
Except... unfortunately the Russian Minister of Defense.
Got himself involved in little incident on US territory and two governments aren't talking to each other for a while.
By the time they do...
It will be too late.
So, any other suggestions?
Yeah, I got one.
How about we just stop them ourselves?
You're talking about a Russian Military Base.
Separatists.
Whatever.
It's suicide.
It's stopping world war 3.
What's it gonna be rook?
You're gonna close your eyes on this one too?
Pray that the apocalypse doesn't come knocking on your mama's front door?
Or are you're gonna saddle up, be a man and save the entire goddamn world.
You know, thank god they read it out.
What's that?
- Rule number three.
- Which is?
There are no rules.
What did I told you, Luke?
I knew he'd get in three.
Areal transport leaves in an hour.
Take whatever vehicle you want.
- All bets are off.
- All bets are off.
Bets are off?
See you later...
Letty I don't like telling you this one thing,
The game's changed.
Before we were trying just to catch Dom, but now after all of this...
I want you to know, if I have to...
I'm gonna put him down..
Then you might have to take us both down.
I'm freezing man.
This ain't for me.
I come from a different kind of lifestyle brah.
Ladies know me.
They know where I'm at with.
I try to take a piss, I ain't even recognize myself.
Now that's entirely too much information.
I'm just saying.
Well, one thing is for sure.
Dom's gotta be either working with them or making a train cause no one will be this insane to hit this place without a damn army.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Speak of the Devil.
Alright, Dom, you're one step closer to that family reunion.
400 meters to base.
Prep the EMP.
Let's take these defenses down.
We have a possible threat incoming.
Raise the barricade, As soon as possible.
We've lost power, get to your positions now.
Gates are open.
Let's get this party started.
- EMP's are charging.
- How long?
60 seconds.
Alright, Dom, You've one pulse left in that EMP.
That sub is heavily insulated.
You're gonna need to be right underneath it, for this thing to work.
Come on.
Engaging target.
He's beneath the Sub.
I'm loosing control, mayday, mayday.
I'm going down.
Yes, two birds with one stone.
We've got control of the sub.
Dom, we are good.
Head over to the Rendezvous.
Ok Matty Let's take this baby for a spin.
Damn!
I think Cipher just rebooted that Sub's command system.
What the hell is he talking about?
In Leyman's terms...
She just carjacked a submarine.
We can't let it get away.
There's the control room.
If you can get me into that warehouse
I can tap with network and counter hack Cipher.
Keep it from flowing into water.
No, what we need to do is get me on that sub.
I find the weapon's room and I can pull the lunch chip before she can fire any of those nukes.
That is too crazy.
- Just saying it's too dangerous.
- We'll do both.
Knock, knock!
Five vehicles just reached the base.
They just don't give up, do they..
A'right.
Let's haul ass team.
Double time, double time.
Letty, let's roll.
Go, go, go, go.
Change of plans, Dom.
I'm sending you the co-ordinates, head there immediately.
- I'm done.
I want my son.
- I'll tell you when you're done.
Your team is in play, now meet Rhodes and follow my instruction.
I got you covered, go.
Move, move!
Get out of here, go go!
Ok, how do you like this?
- Remote link has been separated.
- I'll take care of this.
Hi Ramsey.
She's regaining control.
Damn it, she's good.
They are entering the Weapon's room.
Oh that's cute.
Go, pull pull!
Roman, guard up by the chip, go.
Oh she's slick.
Gonna have to do better in that way.
Ok, now you're starting to piss me off.
Ramsey, how much time we talking to you?
You're smart, but no smart enough.
She's locked me out.
Tez, I can't stop.
Now you're gonna have to pull that chip.
I can't.
This thing's going into attack mode.
The door's not gonna open until you pull the chip.
Tez we got no idea what the hell we are looking for.
I got it.
What in the hell are you guys doing?
It wasn't me, okay?
It will be labeled "Guidance Go".
- Ok.
I got something.
- What?
It says haha.. slack slack back ...smoke, dear jack na jack.
Do you understand that?
Well, nasty.
Quite a show.
Arming the nuke..
Nuke's going hot, she's trying to fire this thing.
- Roger that, we're moving out.
- Disable the nukes.
Roman, what are you seeing?
- Come on, Talk to me.
- I don't see shit.
I'm holding on.
Now we have a countdown.
What the hell is going on man?
We are about to launch a nuclear missile, what the hell is going on.
Pull the damn chip.
Countdown.
Countdown.
Look for a countdown.
What countdown?
The missile needs to activate for launch.
The countdown timer won't be in Russian.
The countdown.
Let's show the world what we've got.
No.
No.
No.
Don't press that.
I got it.
Something is wrong.
It won't launch.
Get that sub out of there.
Now!
Move your ass Roman.
You alright?
There's nothing alright about any of this.
Let's go.
What about the missiles?
We got the chip, no nukes for her.
Hell yeah.
Let's roll.
Guys we got company.
A lot of company.
Alright team, here is the plan.
There is a Sea lock at the opening of the bay,
We get there first, and close it, we can stop the submarine from escaping into open water.
And disappearing forever.
I've got the location.
It's 10 miles south west.
10 miles?
Like I make it in 10 seconds.
What's the matter Roman, you forgot the snow tyre?
Loving that Lambo now?
Alright everyone, hold you with that launch trip later.
Right now I want that sub, in deep water, where no one can find it.
Find me the fastest route out of that bay.
Copy that.
Why are they shooting at me?
I think off you're in that orange Lamborghini I don't know.
Shut up Tez.
Dom.
Do you really wanna put that car in gear?
Do you?
I don't think so.
They're heading for the sea lock.
They're trying to trap the sub in the bay.
I should have taken care of this a long time ago.
Rhodes, check his team out.
I'm on it.
Roman, get in front of me.
Ok, y'all wanna play it rough?
Now it's my turn.
Yeah, baby!
Guys, we got snow mobile on the right.
They're going to flank us.
No they ain't!
Oh shit!
Tez!
Roman hold tight.
I'm on the way.
I don't wanna go swimming.
No!
Really Tez?
Oh, No.
No.
No.
Oh shit.
Roman, grab your door.
Tez!
Grab the door Roman.
It's all gone.
Oh Shit.
Roman, hang on.
Tej!
Get me off this thing.
Tez.
Come on!
Alright, I've had enough of this shit!
Number 11 my Ass.
Don't shrink it.
We got a sub to catch, get in.
What?
The pressure is on alert in the cargo hold.
Drop it to 10 thousand feet.
I know how much these people mean to you.
So I'll let you pick the first target.
I'm not picking target from a mile away.
I'd stand face to face, and look 'em dead in the eye.
Ok.
The wife it is.
Nice plane.
I'm gonna enjoy her remains.
You don't go get any ideas.
You and planes don't have a good history.
No shit.
Let's go scarface.
The arseholes ain't gonna kill themselves.
Pull up surveillance, right now.
Surprise.
Pierce must be dead.
You're driving.
I said it from the beginning.
No way, I'm not driving.
We have a security breach in the cargo hold.
Take care of it now.
Jesus Mum, you should pose to avoid the nerves.
Oh, shut up, don't be such a baby.
Get to the pilot, he's got the second key.
Wait for my signal.
Give Cipher my regards.
Did Torretto hold up his end of the deal?
He gave us this little thing here.
No, don't touch.
You can track Cipher with this, but you can't do this on your own.
There's gotta be two of you.
Fine, I got contacts.
Now you're gonna take your brother.
- No.
- Yes.
Torretto knows where he is...
He's got this thing.
He can see everything it's like it's called the devil's bumhole or something?
- It's called the God's eyes.
- Yeah, well.
Whatever.
There's no way I'm using Owen, alright?
He's a lost cause.
He's your brother, Deck.
He's my son.
He's our family.
And our family that died...
Bloody shit happening.
You lied about, I mean, I can't believe you.
You've gotten upset, you really upset your mother.
Call yourself a brother?
Look, I'm in, mum.
Ok.
Every time!
- Owen.
- In position.
Go.
I'm in.
I've got the package to lay on.
Whole pounds of him..
You made me miss my son?
What do you think you're doing?
Looking at you dead in the eye.
That was for Letty.
- Rhodes.
- He is no longer with us.
Rhodes picked the wrong target.
Congratulations Dom.
You just killed your son.
You are wrong.
I just saved him.
And you just took your foot off the tiger's neck.
You're welcome.
It's gonna get noisy.
This is for your relief.
Good?
Let's go.
Go stop him, do not let him get off this plane.
That truck's got enough munition to take us all out.
We don't give 'em a target.
Everybody get in front of us, line up
- we will take the hit.
- What?
I need to switch cars, right now.
- Roman, here comes the bad part.
- What?
Hang in there guys!
We're almost through the lock.
It's easy for you to say, when your ass ain't on fire.
Alright little mate.
It's might be a little scary,
It's gonna be a lot of fun.
..the music good?
They're locking on.
Sorry guys, I got no trick for us..
- What do we do now?
- We start praying.
Hell yeah!
That's Dom!
- This guy in our side now?
- Who the hell cares?
He just saved our asses.
Good to be riding with you again man.
Torretto just cleared the way for them.
Someone give me something.
- Torpedoes are ready.
- Then launch them.
- Take the wheel.
- I ain't taking shit.
- Take the wheel!
- Where are you doing?
- This is crazy!
- Speed up,
- Left and back!
- What?
Turn the goddamn wheel to the left, really quickly.
Boom, baby!
That's alright!
Back in the sink.
Where is that smile?
There it is!
You're gonna shoot a baby You shoud bust it...
You aren't gonna wanna see this?
Is that you or him?
Him.
Good.
The torpedo's missed, they are gonna reach lock before the sub does.
The hell they are.
Get ready for this.
Oh shit!
We're going to need a bigger truck.
- Get us out of here.
- Why are you always yelling?
- This bitch is crazy!
- Look out!
That's not good.
That's not good.
We got this.
That's my girl.
The sub's too close.
We ain't making it to the gate in time.
We just gonna let it get away?
Not if I know Dom.
You loose.
Dom.
I destroyed two of your teams
I killed your red headed boyfriend.
And I put two killers on you untraceable plane.
You lost the minute you interrupted my honeymoon.
Put a heat-seeker on him now.
Now!
That's a goddamn heat seeker coming at us.
Oh my...
come and get it.
Guys!
Dive..
This...
This is for my son!
Dom!
You are out of bullets Deckard.
Like I'm need a gun to take care of you,
How did you find me?
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch!
Resourceful.
You have a lot to answer Cipher.
You pulled my family through.
A mother.
I'm gonna make sure that never happens again.
To anyone.
There is only one flaw in your plan.
What's that?
Only one of us has a parachute!
Told you this would be fun!
Time to land, Boys!
You know I've never left you, Letty?
I know.
And you know I never will..
I know.
I've so much to tell you.
Yeah you do, and you can start with that bitch!
Now, that's...
Dominic Toretto.
Hey Dom!
I'm just towing it out there?
We need to get up out of here.
Cause this all kinda neuclearism happening under this ice.
Relax!
Without the trigger chips, those nukes are harmless.
Ok.
So we good then.
Lemme go and get my young selfie levels up.
You realize this is classified, right?
Not today.
We have to get up out of here man.
I'm freezing.
It's Okay.
Don't worry, he's gonna be here soon.
I get it, y'all got a lot in common.
Computer hacks, god's eyes, geeks, nerd.
..you know, but we got a lot in common too!
Alright?
- Like what?
- We walk in the room, and we are oozing sex appeal.
Me and you?
There's a problem.
I am asking the real question right now.
Is it gonna be... the Nerd or...
the dark knight?
To be honest I like both of you.
A'rigt!
Yeah..yea!
But just before we get into all of that,
Let me ask you one question.
- You can ask me anything.
- Anything.
What's my last name?
When you guys pick around with then I guess you can let me know.
It's gonna be a Parker.
That's all that really matters.
Jones, Miss Parker.
Hey Miss Parker.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I wanted to thank you.
No need.
Cipher's still on the loose.
There's been some reports she's in Athens.
But she won't be nuking any city anytime soon.
Thanks to you guys.
- So, I got you a parting favor.
- This can't be good...
Your record's been clreared.
Full re-instatement.
You got you job back.
That is if you want it.
If I want?
You know after 16 years.
I figured it's time for a little break.
Wow.
Daddy's stayin' home.
- Nobody.
- Get in touch!
Ah, hang on a second.
This could be interesting.
What made you think I would do it?
Brother-hood.
I saw that look you gave Cipher.
I knew you wanted revenge.
Glad I did it.
Can't believe you went to see my Mother.
Come on.
All this fuss of you.
Yes.
Alena, I promise to keep our son safe.
And now.. he always will be.
I want to introduce you to the most important person in my universe.
Who will never give up on me.
You've heard me say.
"That you never turn your back on family."
And I wanna thank you all for never turning your back on me.
You wanna meet them?
Alright!
Everyone...
Meet Bryan.
Hey Bryan.
Okay, I guess he's my turning secret.
Thank you for giving us family.
Thank you for giving us the strength.
- No way.
- Yeah.
This is the Cuban spirit.
Dom!
Dom!
Raldo, you said I...
You know I can't make a living without my car.
It's not my problem, bro.
Dominic Toretto, I heard about you.
Welcome to my island.
Why you hooking up my cousin's car?
Cousin's car.
Not anymore.
He needed money.
I gave it to him.
He can't pay.
I take the car.
I-I just need a few more days.
"Few more days" wasn't part of the deal.
Come on.
You make a deal, you gotta live up to it.
You make a deal...
you going to live up to it.
"Going to live up to it"?
Oh, so you one of those types.
You take everyone's ride and then ship it back to the States?
You know what I respect?
Money.
You watch your mouth.
Now you got a problem.
I'm gonna keep it about the cars.
- You want a car, get it the right way.
- How?
Race for it.
I already own it, bro.
Not that car.
Mine.
Dom...
His-his car is the fastest car on the island.
Do you know what he has under that hood?
He knows it doesn't matter what's under a hood.
The only thing that matters is who's behind the wheel.
You think so?
I know so.
Then race his car.
And we ain't racing no quarter-mile here.
We race the Cuban mile.
Done.
Listen, I-I appreciate what you're trying to do, but... my car is the slowest car on the island.
Was.
Pull the seats, the doors, the battery.
If it ain't the motor, take it off.
Laughing gas?
Nah, Fed.
This is Cuban NOS.
You guys are crazy.
- What are you doing?
- Poor man's turbo.
Pull the vacuum line and hold on.
Old trick the Buster used to play, in case of emergencies.
You know that's way too much boost
- for that engine.
- It's gonna be fast.
It's gonna be a bomb.
Only needs to go a mile.
That car belongs in the trash, bro.
Where are they going?
I don't know.
Let's go.
Ghost him.
Sí.
Adios, Toretto.
Okay, Buster.
Let's see if this works.
That's impossible.
Look out!
Hold on.
Hold on.
A deal's a deal.
You won my car.
And you earned my respect.
Keep your car.
Your respect is good enough for me.
Yo, cousin.
Sorry about your car.
Yours was too slow for a Toretto anyway.
Your Impala?
Are you serious?
Look at that smile.
I love it when you smile.
You make me happy.
Mmm, I think this place makes you happy.
It's like it speaks to you.
You remember that guy...
the racer and his dad?
The one with the boat engine under the hood?
Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Of course.
I was...
I was looking at them, and I... and I couldn't help but to imagine what you'd be like if you were a dad.
No, no, no, no!
I'm not pregnant.
Is that what you want?
It's not about what I want or what you want.
It's about why we haven't asked the question.
And do you have enough faith in the world?
I'll always ride for us.
Yeah, but would you ride for the world?
You hungry?
Mm-hmm.
- Same thing?
- Mm-hmm.
Two minutes.
What?
You need a hand?
Yeah, I think I do.
Thank you.
Sounds like you're not getting any fuel.
- Yeah?
- Probably the shutoff solenoid.
Let's see if we can get some power to it.
What brings you to Cuba?
Same thing that brings everyone else to Cuba.
Culture, people, beauty.
What brings you to Cuba?
Work.
Must be casual Friday.
How's that honeymoon going, Dom?
Your fuel relay is missing.
I know.
I love to play games...
beaten the best of 'em... but I'm kind of in a rush, so if you've got something to say to me...
Oh, this is a very different game.
That I can assure you.
This...
There is something much greater at work here.
This is fate.
I choose to make my own fate.
Not today.
Is this the road you take to your apartment every morning?
What else is different, Dom?
Was Santiago's closed?
Did you have to cross two blocks to go get your Cuban coffees?
What is it, black, no sugar?
Yeah.
I put a lot of work into getting you here today.
Well, now that I'm here, what do you want?
I want you to work for me.
Work for you?
Oh, I could have saved you a lot of time, then.
See, I don't work for anyone.
You can't walk away from this, Dom.
We're gonna have this conversation, one way or the other.
You see, that's the funny thing about fate.
It's cunning.
It can bring you beautiful things, and it can also bring you moments like this.
Oh, you're gonna want to work for me.
You're gonna betray your brothers, abandon your code and shatter your family.
You see, your team is about to go up against the only thing they can't handle.
And what's that?
You.
Oh, and, Dom,
I wouldn't mention this to anyone.
They are gonna be hitting us with everything they got.
So we want to engage with maximum speed.
Neutralize their shooters, and then move on to our objective.
There's two things I want you to keep in mind.
Number one...
I chose you for this squad because you are the most fearsome warriors on the planet.
And number two...
You go out there, you do your job, and you take 'em down.
Everyone... and I mean everyone... manis and pedis at the mall later on today.
Huh?
One, two three!
Monarchs!
Yah!
What?
I don't want to play anymore.
All right, let's go, girls.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Final two minutes.
Quite the cheering section.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, it's the moms, they come out to support the kids.
Except there seem to be more moms than kids.
Way more moms.
Yeah.
It's a big soccer town.
Let's go, girls!
So, your intel was spot-on.
That Damocles 7 EMP weapon that went missing in the Gulf... arms dealers from the Liberation Front
- have it in Berlin.
- Shit.
This thing can wipe out an entire electrical grid in a major city.
No lights, no power...
instant Stone Age.
Chloe, Maya, you can't let her run by you like that.
- Let's go, let's go!
Cross!
- Agent Hobbs, this is a Class 4 WMD.
Do you have any idea
- what's at stake here?
- That's it.
Go, go, go, go!
Yes, I know exactly what is at stake here, okay?
If the Pink Butterflies beat my Red Dragons, that means we lose the championship...
which means I have 20 little girls who are crying, and that's not a good thing.
Which then means I have to spend a lot of time in ice cream shops and spend a lot of time at Tay Tay concerts.
Tay Tay?
Come...
Taylor Swift.
Gotta be shittin' me.
Get it together, okay?
- Let's go, girls.
- Go, go, go!
We need you to do this.
It's a lot of lives at stake.
- All right, but I need to be clear here.
- Ah, ah!
The U.S. government cannot sanction this operation in any way.
- You're on your own.
- Hey...
This thing goes sideways, you don't just get burned, you go to prison.
And there's nothing we can do to get you out.
Let me tell you something.
The only thing that I love more than saving lives is my daughter.
So, if you don't shut up with this government bullshit right now and start showing some team spirit and respect for the Red Dragons,
I'm gonna have all 20 of them line up and kick you right in the tay-tay.
Go, Dragons.
Say it again.
- Go, Dragons!
- Attaboy.
Go, Dragons.
Go, Dragons.
Go.
She's open!
Go, go!
Yes!
That is my daughter right there.
Yes.
Yes, come here.
- How did I do?
- Awesome.
Nice job, kid.
Daddy's gotta go to work?
Uh, yeah.
Daddy's gotta go to work.
Now, you're gonna need to get a team you can trust.
Oh, I already got one.
- Hey, Dom.
- Hey, Hobbs.
I got a job in Berlin, and I need a favor, brother.
No problem.
I'll grab the team and meet you in Berlin.
Thanks, man.
I'll see you soon.
You were only supposed to create a diversion, Roman.
That was a diversion!
How many of the damn explosives did you use?
I don't know, Tej.
All of it?
- Wait, all of it?
- Roman, Jesus Christ.
You got more of your fan club ahead.
They're still on us.
These guys are taking this personal.
Roman, we just blew up their facility and stole their EMP.
Other than your doctor's cold finger,
I'd say it's about as personal as it can get.
Phase two.
Phase two?
So, you just gonna keep that to yourself?
What happened to phase one?
What about that part?
Yeah.
Remember the airplane?
Everyone drove their cars out but you?
I told you my engine seized up.
It's your balls that seized up.
Just follow my lead, okay?
And, Roman, whatever you do... don't think.
What?
Tej, drop it.
Bombs away.
Split now.
Holy...!
Great plan, Tej.
But just so you know, you missed some.
Oh, just wait for it.
Oh, shit!
I hate you, Tej!
Got your ass.
You good?
I'll see you when it's done.
All right, great job, team.
Let's break off, and meet me at the safe house.
A hell of a job, brother.
When we get back to the base, beer's on me.
You lost your goddamn mind, Toretto?
Toretto, you put hands on that thing, you're gonna have the whole world gunning for you, including me.
I don't know what you're doing, but you better think about this, Toretto.
It ain't too late to stop this.
It is now.
That sumbitch just crossed us.
- What?
- Wait a second.
What are you talking about?
Dom took the EMP.
Bullshit.
Where are you?
It's too late for me.
Get out of here.
He wrecked my truck and he took it.
I saw that look in his eye, and I've seen that look before.
Dominic Toretto just went rogue.
All right, I got his phone records, y'all.
It's a whole bunch of calls to untraceable numbers.
Burner phones, right?
Nah.
Scrambler.
Same number, but they got some sort of micro-router to bury the signal path, which means Dom is clearly communicating with somebody that's above our pay grade.
Look, I don't know Dom as well as you, but if we just look at the facts...
Dom's been having highly encrypted conversations with some mysterious person.
He took out Hobbs.
He stole an EMP.
Now he's disappeared.
So, what are you saying?
Maybe we should consider the fact that Hobbs is right.
Dom did go rogue.
Letty.
We're all in this trying to figure it out, okay?
We're on the side.
You sure about that, Roman?
Before you judge the man, remember, you're breathing right now because he saved your life.
You just gonna let her bump your shoulder like that?
I'm-I'm just saying, that...
that was a little aggressive.
What you gonna do, e-mail her?
Check.
Moment, will you, fellas?
Thank you.
Well, this is an exciting new look.
It's a little tight in the crotch, as always.
What boy-band bus did she fall out of?
It's my new junior associate.
He's working with me on this.
- All yours.
- Agent Hobbs,
Mr. Nobody and I have been given the authority to get you out of this.
All you have to do is agree to the terms, and you're free.
What's Training Wheels talking about?
What terms?
Confess to your crimes in Berlin.
Treason, international espionage, massive destruction of civic property.
You do that, we close the case.
- And?
- And the DSS blacklists you.
- Germany loves that.
- Officially,
- you will be a criminal.
- Wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You need to work on your delivery, all right?
Unofficially... you're off the books.
You come work with me.
I'm not a criminal.
Luke, come on.
Labels.
There is no confession.
There are no backroom deals.
Got myself into this, I'm gonna get myself out of it.
- You know that.
- I do, and that's what I told him.
Well, there you have it.
Good luck in the courts, man.
What about your daughter?
You know, if you're not gonna do it for your country, at least do it for your kid.
Big mistake, kid.
Hold on.
Look, Luke.
He's still working from the manual.
I mean, he doesn't even really know the rules.
Now, come on, give him a break.
Give me a break.
Luke.
Appreciate it.
It's good to see you, Nobody.
You, too.
Rule number one...
Know your audience.
I gave you your shot.
You shit the bed.
Now I'm gonna show you how to get this done.
You're mine now, copper!
Yeah, that badge don't go far in here!
You're dead, cop.
Dead!
I'm gonna slice some bacon off your back, pig!
Well, well, well.
Luke Hobbs behind bars.
Would you look at that.
The bent cop got his day.
You know, that color looks good on you.
Yeah, it'd look a whole hell of a lot better with your blood on it.
Yeah, good luck with that, Hercules.
Lawman gone bad, huh?
Such a cliché.
Oh, well, welcome to the club.
I wouldn't get that twisted, son.
We ain't in no club.
We got nothing in common.
And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.
So why don't you get your candy-ass back out there and toss some more salads, boy.
What, you bring a shovel, did you?
Because it's 38 feet of steel and concrete.
Or so I've been told.
Better get to digging.
You wanker.
Yeah.
Move.
Say that again.
If I say it again, it'll be to a corpse.
I'm going to enjoy this.
Welcome back, Dom.
Nice job out there.
You excited about tonight?
You're going on this?
You're with me, Dom.
I am impressed.
That job went down exactly like we planned.
It is something to watch somebody at the top of their game.
It must've been a real thrill from 30,000 feet.
Oh, come on, there has to be a small part in you that enjoyed what you just did back there.
No?
Hmm?
Showing me your shoe collection?
Yep.
A pair for every occasion.
You have enough guns in here to outfit a small army, huh?
This?
Oh, this is just the tip of the iceberg.
You know what I like about you, Dom?
You're a genuine outlaw.
I mean, you're a man who lives by his own rules.
Which is surprising because, when I saw you in Cuba,
I heard about a guy who almost killed you with a motorcycle, and you let him keep his car?
Oh, that confused you?
Hmm.
Of course I could have taken his car.
Of course I could have beaten him down.
But it's about something bigger.
This way...
I changed him.
That's not your responsibility.
But it's who I am.
Let me ask you something, Dom.
What's the best thing in your life?
Family.
No, it's not.
Not if you're being honest.
It's the ten seconds between start and finish when you're not thinking about anything.
No family.
No obligations.
Just you... that engine... that open road... being free.
I gotta tell you, this whole saving-the-world,
Robin Hood nonsense you've been doing recently... it's bullshit.
It's not you.
Be who you are.
Why live only a quarter mile at a time when you can live your whole life that way?
Is that it?
Is that all those bloated-out muscles will give you?
All show and no go.
Oh, I got plenty of go.
Yeah?
You must have misplaced that when I kicked your arse up and down that office of yours.
Yeah.
Just like you Brits...
rewriting history, huh?
All I know is it wasn't me that was thrown out of a four-story window.
Jumped.
I jumped out of a four-story window saving my partner's life.
'Cause where I'm from, we don't settle fights by throwing bombs.
Well, that's funny, because where I'm from, we don't need women to run to our rescue.
I mean, do you really believe you can stand in front of me and beat me in a straight-up, old-fashioned fistfight?
Let me tell you something.
Me and you, one on one, no one else around...
I will beat your ass like a Cherokee drum.
Maybe one day we'll find out.
Oh, you better hope that day never comes.
I said no, Mr. Nobody.
I'm not leaving this cell.
I'll get out my way.
The right way!
Hey!
Why is the door open?
Get back in your cell!
Relax.
It's just a malfunction.
- Get back!
- Just a malfunction.

- Two questions.
- Yeah.
- My daughter?
- With your sister.
Toretto?
It's interesting you ask.
This is my new base.
Welcome to nowhere.
It's a little sterile for you.
Listen, there's something
I want to talk to you about after.
Hey, listen, guys, thanks...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
Handcuffs?
What is this?
It's called abuse of power.
You told me to round them up.
I didn't tell you to hand...
Cut 'em loose.
Oh, man.
This is embarrassing.
I'm sorry, guys.
Really, I...
So, this is how you treat old friends?
Friends?
We don't even really know
- who the hell this guy is.
- Doesn't matter who I am, Tej.
- I'm, like, nobody, okay?
- Nobody.
So, then, who is he?
Him?
He's nothing.
He's, like, less than me.
Tej, trust me, brother, that's a maze you don't want to get lost in.
Clearly, we're getting nowhere with nobody.
I've been in here for four hours, and my ribs are showing.
I don't know about y'all, but I'm out.
- I wouldn't recommend that.
- What?
Well, thanks to your botched Berlin job, you all made Interpol's top ten most wanted list.
- Top ten.
- Mm-hmm.
That's all right.
Yeah.
Well, uh... not you, Roman.
- What do you mean?
- You just missed the cut.
You're number 11, so...
- I...
I missed?
What are you...
- Yeah.
That's impossible.
What number did they come in at?
Six, eight, nine, ten.
- She's ten?
- Mm-hmm.
She just got here.
That's impossible.
There's no way she's a ten.
Oh, she's definitely a ten.
What?
How about we focus on someone who we're not gonna find on anybody's list.
We're awaiting hard confirmation, but I believe that's the cyber terrorist known as Cipher.
Wait, no.
Cipher's an organization, not... not a person.
Not according to our sources.
- What does she want?
- No one knows.
Cipher is like a digital act of God.
They...
well, she can manipulate world systems from the shadows...
governments, global markets.
Anything that can be hacked is hers to play with.
And here's the kicker...
you'll never find her linked to any of it.
Her digital identity is scrubbed every few seconds worldwide.
Six years of the intelligence community's coordinated efforts have turned up nothing but this single photo.
So, basically, she's the bogeyman.
Damn, she's... one of the hottest bogeymans I've ever seen.
I mean, if y'all know her, tell her to get at your boy.
- What are you, 12?
- That was my shin, mother...
Let's just say, people are scared of the hacker group Anonymous.
But even Anonymous won't mess with her.
What the hell does any of this have to do with us?
Probably nothing, Letty, but I do find it interesting that, apparently, for some reason, she's now working with this guy.
Do you know why?
Gee, no, Letty, I don't.
He's already delivered a fully operational EMP into her hands.
Detonate that, they can turn any city in the world into a war zone.
So, then, what is it you're suggesting we do?
Maybe we find Dom, huh?
Well, first, let's catch him and then figure out why he's turned.
And we put a stop to whatever bullshit they got planned.
So, y'all want us to track Dom.
Yeah, I know, Roman, it's kind of a big job.
It's impossible.
Which is why I'm bringing in an extra pair of hands.
Ah, my day just got a whole hell of a lot better.
Mr. Nobody, you want to tell me why you just put me in a room with this tea and crumpets eating, criminal sumbitch?
What a big mouth on a small head, coming from prisoner 6753.
Don't think we've forgotten everything that you've done.
We are not teaming up with this guy.
Let's get one thing clear...
I ain't on your team.
I don't care about you, your crew or your little family.
- I'm here for Cipher.
- What are you gonna do, apply for a job?
Head asshole?
You know, I think that tight T-shirt's cutting off the circulation to your brain.
You should get a bigger size.
Cipher came to me first.
Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.
When I said no, she went after my brother.
Ah, yes, brother Owen.
Who could forget him, huh?
Former hell-raiser and current guest at a nasty little black-site prison.
Cipher corrupted him and left him for dead.
So, if I get a shot to take her down, believe me, Flex, I'm taking it.
You're taking my boot right up your ass
- is what you're taking.
- Guys, guys, guys, guys.
The fastest way to find Cipher is through Toretto.
Now, aside from myself, there's only two men in the world that have ever managed to actually track him down with any success.
And guess what... they're both standing in front of me right now.
So, like it or not, you two are gonna work together.
You got that?
I'm gonna take that as a yes.
Am I the only one seeing this?
Oh, this ought to be good.
Use God's Eye.
We put our lives on the line, running around the world trying to figure this thing out.
It can find anybody, right?
Let's use it to find Dom.
It's that easy.
Done.
Roman, that is a great idea.
Did you hear that?
"Great idea"?
No, no, no, no, no, don't tune it out, huh?
Uh-huh.
Huh.
See, you and this guy, right here.
Stay out of my lane, dude.
It's all me right here, you know what I mean?
It's crazy.
Mr. Nobody, let's fire it up, huh?
Got him.
He's in London.
Yeah.
Wait.
We've got a second match in Hong Kong.
Beijing and Seoul.
And Tokyo.
And just about every other major city
- on the planet.
- And so...
God's Eye was where we started.
But Cipher's already created an evasion that masks their location by pinging random spots all over the globe, but it was a good thought, Roman.
So, she's made my program obsolete.
And that, Ramsey, is why you're here.
See, simple solutions aren't gonna cut it here, slick.
Why you look at me when you say that?
Wait a second.
Wait, wait.
Simple solutions might just cut it.
You see, in order for God's Eye to give off all these false pings, means they have to be using a FLEA relay.
Watch these two.
Which means it has a decaying sync randomizer.
Which we can reverse...
And track it back to the originating source and find Dom's true location.
I'm telling you, they got skills.
That was my idea.
That's what I was saying.
- Remember in there?
- All right.
Let's try this.
It's working.
Time you want to check your manual and start organizing a force response.
Let's get a hold of our international assets...
He's still green.
Yeah, like fresh baby shit.
Soon as we have Toretto's location, I want to mobilize.
Let's get a hold of a better asshole.
Uh, no one respects you, uh...
- Cover.
- Get away from me.
No problem.
Bad breath.
Mm...
All right, they're not in China.
Or Russia.
Europe's clear.
But this one's not going away.
This is interesting.
Why?
Because that's here.
Pull up all security monitors on this building, now.
Surprise.
Did you all enjoy that?
Next-generation concussion grenade.
It scrambles your senses.
Don't worry, it will wear off in an hour.
Probably.
Hello, Deckard.
Nice to see you again.
Look at this.
Body's not even cold, Dom.
Your family's already replacing you.
You chose the losing team.
I guess your brother is smarter than you.
Smart move embedding God's Eye into the mainframe.
Irritating to make me have to come all the way down here to get it, but...
Let's go.
Dom!
You gonna turn your back on family?
Just like that?
Let's go.
You okay?
That wasn't him.
I don't know what she's got on him, but that wasn't Dom.
Brian would know what to do.
No!
We can't bring Brian and Mia into this.
We agreed on that.
I know.
You saved me.
I'm...
I'm not really sure how to thank you.
No need.
You got a computer I can use?
That I do.
Psst, yo.
What, man?
You see this?
Like, they really going at it over there.
Must be the accent.
Bro... he ain't got no accent to her.
They're from the same place.
- Uh, yeah, I was...
I was just joking.
- Yeah, okay.
I got the accent.
Exotic.
Exotic?
Barstow?
Ghetto?
Barstow is exotic to her.
Back there, was that for her, for me or you?
And was it even necessary?
Necessary?
Nothing is necessary.
Everything is a choice.
And I simply made one, but so did you.
You could have stopped me, but you chose not to.
Wonder what Letty thought about that.
The problem with putting your foot on a tiger's neck is you can never let it up.
I think I need to remind you why you chose to be here.
Elena.
Dom.
I'm sorry.
You shouldn't have come.
Nothing could have kept me away.
Now she has the three of us.
Do you want to see him?
See Papa?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Come and see Papa.
Papa.
When I realized I was pregnant, you had just found out Letty was alive.
So I decided, when Letty and you got back from your honeymoon,
I was going to tell you.
And then she took us before I had the chance.
His name?
I call him Marcos.
But that's his middle name.
I thought his father should give him his first name.
I'm sorry, Dom.
There's nothing to be sorry for.
Whatever happens just save our son.
Your son.
Good visit?
I know.
I know what you're thinking.
I just let the guards go, so there's only two opponents in the room.
Rhodes has the gun, so you'll take him out first.
I know you.
You have the will so you'll find the way.
Once you've got it, you'll take him out.
Maybe even me.
And then you're thinking...
Elena's a cop.
Maybe the two of you can fight your way out of here.
It's so much to think about.
Let me make it easier for you.
Do with it as you wish.
Have you heard of choice theory, Dom?
There is a bunch of axioms, but only two you really need to concern yourself with.
One...
The only person's behavior we can control is our own.
And two...
The only thing we can truly give another person is information.
So let me give you some.
You see these cameras in here?
The moment you make a move, highly paid men with weapons will make their way into this room with one very specific instruction.
It's not to save me.
It's to kill your son.
Now, that's a lot of bullets, and it only takes one for you to lose everything.
So I have to ask you because...
I know family is so important to you.
Is that really a choice you want to make?
Because I'm ready if you are.
If I pull this trigger...
and God knows I want to... if I killed everyone on this plane,
I still couldn't get in there.
'Cause of your two-man fail-safe system.
Since I'm alone!
I got no choice!
I didn't think so.
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch.
Bitch.
- Don't... don't...
- Sweet dreams.
Please!
Damn it.
She wiped it all.
Took God's Eye.
That was the one thing we could use to find them.
We lost everything.
What you got, princess?
Finding Toretto.
But I got a couple of minutes to spare, if you want me to send you to the hospital... again.
Yo, Rules.
- First off, that's not my name.
- Little Nobody.
- Don't call me that.
- Oh, that's definitely sticking.
Great.
Do me a favor and tell Your Majesty over there that we're gonna find Toretto.
We find Toretto together as a team.
And when all this is said and done, I'll be happy to slap that dick garage right off his face.
Wait a minute, guys.
I think Deckard's actually onto something.
How do you think Dom and Cipher got into the country without us knowing?
Ghost flights.
I thought untraceable aircraft was all
- Internet conspiracy stuff.
- It's not.
Satellites and radar grids all across the globe shift like an ocean.
And they've got channels that open and close.
And theoretically, if you know the right people who know the right patterns...
You can fly right through the blind spots completely undetected.
So, you know where Dom is headed?
Yeah.
New York.
You see there, Luke?
What did I tell you?
You guys are gonna get along just great.
Which proves rule number two...
you never lose everything.
Fire up the chopper.
Well, guys, have a ball in the Big Apple.
♪ I'm with the gang, gang, gang ♪
♪ And we 'bout to go up ♪
♪ Switching lanes, it's a thang every time we show up ♪
♪ You lame, lame, lame, and you so below us ♪
♪ Bet your ho she know us ♪
♪ 'Cause you know we blowed up ♪
♪ We stay down... ♪
And why are we traveling like this again?
Because Dom took God's Eye.
So we need to stay off the grid.
But like this?
Look here, man.
Before I throw up in my mouth, let me ask you...
what are we doing here?
That's a good question, Roman.
Let me show you.
Welcome to our new base of operations.
No, seriously, what is this place?
This... is heaven.
It's the agency garage.
They call it the Toy Shop.
This is where we house every vehicle seized from drug dealers on the East Coast.
Now, Mr. Nobody said,
"If we're gonna have a chance at catching Dom we're gonna have to be damn fast."
Figured this would help.
You got anything American?
What's the matter with you, huh?
Miss America.
What, are you allergic to quality?
This is the most durable British vehicle ever built.
Oops.
I peed in your tea.
You're gonna fix that.
We got a tank.
750-horsepower, 6.6-liter V-8 Duramax engine with an M153 CROWS remotely operated weapons station on top.
You didn't get this from drug dealers.
No.
No, that, uh... that, the United States Army lent me.
It's a Ripsaw unmanned combat vehicle.
Did you hear something?
See, the Army's developing machines like this that soldiers can drive from a mile away so they can stay safe and alive.
But luckily, there's a backup driver's seat for those of us that like to get more... hands-on.
I'm sitting there wondering this whole time...
Oh, whoa.
...will this thing feel like valet
- at Cheesecake Factory.
- Whoa.
No one is getting hands-on.
She doesn't go on city streets.
Wow.
I'm in love.
Again... no, no.
That's a million-dollar show car.
The point is to not draw attention.
It's reverse psychology.
Dom will never see it coming.
It's neon orange.
The International Space Station would see it coming.
Go choose anything less conspicuous.
No, no, no.
Calipers are my...
This is ridiculous.
- Not happening.
- Hey, my man, you can put that down right there.
This is a gift, a real gift.
I know what you're doing.
I like your beard.
You're Blanta.
Black Santa?
No, I'm serious.
Put it down right there.
What are you doing?
Engine's misfiring.
I gotta check it out.
No, that's not part of the plan, Dom.
Clearly.
But unless you want the engine to seize on the job...
You have five minutes.
I want another visual.
I got an ATM.
I don't like this.
I want to see Toretto.
- There are no more cameras.
- Then find something.
Punch in on something reflective.
A car mirror, anything.
Do you know who I am?
It's why I'm here.
Do you know what I'm capable of?
It's why I'm here.
I'll give you until I finish me cuppa.
And I'm fucking thirsty.
I've got limited time, so I won't take up too much of yours.
Oh, no.
No, you've already taken everything I have of value, Mr. Toretto.
What more could you possibly want?
To give you something back.
Talk to me.
Something is not right here.
First time I saw my son was behind a bulletproof glass.
When he heard my voice I could see in his eyes he knew I was his father.
When he reached for me,
I couldn't hold him.
It's the worst pain I ever felt.
I know you know exactly how that feels.
Maybe we could change that.
And, now, why do I think you're about to suggest something really dodgy, Mr. Toretto?
It's why I'm here.
Jesus, punch in on something.
I'm not liking this.
Something's not right.
Rhodes, you close?
Yeah.
Go.
The delivery truck's moving.
"Captain Deckard Shaw.
"Distinguished himself by acts of gallantry
"at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.
"His bold actions saved the lives
"of hostages and his teammates.
Recommendation... the Victoria Cross."
The highest honor the British government has ever given... to a traitor.
Something about this whole thing that just doesn't add up to me.
Well, that would be the same kind of funny math that says a DSS agent who has a Silver Star for valor stole an EMP.
Sound familiar, huh?
You want to give me a hand?
- On three?
- Yeah.
One, two, three.
You know what, Twinkle Toes?
In another life, I bet me and you could have done some serious damage.
- Yeah, we could've.
- Yeah.
Shame I'm gonna have to bounce your head off the fender when this is all over.
Ah, well, with all due respect, Captain, when this whole thing is over, we're gonna find a location, and I'm gonna knock your teeth so far down your throat, you're gonna stick a toothbrush right up your ass to brush 'em.
Get me God's Eye.
God's Eye active.
Good.
Let's find us a Russian.
I spy with my little eye a Minister of Defense.
Upload those coordinates to Dom's nav.
Copy that.
He's in the third car.
It's a Guard Class limousine.
Where's my team?
- Where's his team?
- There's no sign of them yet.
They're off the grid.
They're probably just bunkered down somewhere.
I'm closing in on 'em.
You guys ready?
One thing I can guarantee, Dom... no one's ready for this.
I want every chip with a zero-day exploit in a two-mile radius around that motorcade now.
There's over a thousand of them.
Hack 'em all.
It's zombie time.
I'd buckle up if I were you.
Safety sensors overridden.
Thank you.
Whoa, whoa!
Hey!
Target the motorcade.
And here they come.
Ouch.
Police escort down.
Take out the lead and follow cars.
Two more down.
They're still under warranty.
We got an army of cars driving themselves!
Send backup!
Send SWAT!
I don't care if you send the goddamn Boy Scouts!
Just send them some help!
Now, that's Dom.
The motorcade just turned on Seventh.
Perfect.
Make it rain.
Target immobilized.
You're up, Dom.
Give me the case.
Good work, Dom.
Meet you at the pickup.
I think I know where my team's at.
Where?
Right in front of me.
This is on you.
Get out of there, Dom.
Guys, I know why Dom's here.
Police scanners are saying he stole a nuclear football.
It's over, Toretto.
Get your ass out of the car now.
So, that's how you want to play this?
Let's play.
Don't do this, Dom.
He's going for it.
- What are you doing?
- It's a trap.
Damn it!
Now I know what it feels like to be every cop ever chasing us.
I'm gonna get a little closer.
I'm gonna pit him.
Oh, so you just gonna pit Dom?
Little Nobody has clearly lost his little mind.
I'm on him.
Easy.
Work together.
- Look out!
- Wait, wait, wait!
Oh, sh...
I'll take the shortcut.
Look out!
Watch those people!
Big Sexy coming through!
Not this time, Dom.
Watch the drag, or the line will snap!
Stretch him out.
Hold him.
He's gotta have about 2,000 horsepower in that thing.
Try 3,000.
Try five.
Get out of there.
I'm working on it.
Stop working on it, and do it.
No, no, no, no.
This is my Bentley!
No!
No!
Get that case and run.
Move.
They thought this was gonna be a street fight.
What are you waiting for, Toretto?
No!
Let's get out of here!
Letty, stop!
What are you gonna do?
I don't know why you're doing this, but I know one thing...
You love me.
And you are not gonna shoot me.
You should have given him the case, 'cause I won't chase you.
Okay.
I will just take it from a dead girl.
You willing to die for it?
Let's go, then.
Anything?
They're gone.
And DOD confirmed it was a nuclear football.
He's got an EMP and nuclear launch codes.
I don't know what it is, but... but they're building towards something.
Deckard?
He didn't make it.
I'm disappointed in you, Dom.
When push came to shove, you were gonna let Letty just walk away with the codes.
- You got the codes!
- Rhodes got the codes.
You made the choice to let her go.
And now I have to make one of my own.
They are adorable little things, aren't they?
God, I hope I don't hurt him.
They're just designed to be so cute.
Look, psychotic, I did exactly what you asked me to do.
Don't do this.
This is your doing.
My doing?
!
Da-da-da.
Dada.
Dada.
Please don't hurt him, I'm begging you.
I don't want you to beg.
I want you to learn.
Learn what?
!
Everyone knows family is the most important thing in your life, so I understand why you did what you did.
I really do.
Dada.
But it was the wrong choice.
This is the consequence of that.
No.
No!
No!
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
W-Wait.
- Save your son!
- No!
No!
Shh...
Can you pull up the footage from the guy in the alley?
Traffic cams.
I got you.
I knew it.
I recognize that guy.
That's Connor Rhodes.
I met him when I was working with Shaw's brother.
He wanted us to get the Nightshade device for him.
He must've been working with that bitch the whole time.
Connor Rhodes.
He's also linked to somebody I'd quite like to forget.
Mose Jakande.
Warlord who tried to get God's Eye.
Which means that's twice that Dom has messed up Cipher's business.
Everything you're feeling right now... this rage, this sense of loss...
it's not real.
It's an adaptive, evolutionary response.
It's a survival instinct wired deep into our brains to ensure continuation of the species.
When early man would visit a watering hole, if they didn't watch their child and it got snatched by a crocodile our brains would create a painful but instructional memory so it would never happen again.
This idea of family that is so core with you, that rules your world, it's a biological lie.
You don't have to accept it.
I don't.
Did you really think you could destroy two of my teams without any repercussions?
I wouldn't have even looked your way if you hadn't done that.
You didn't even know you had a kid.
You can thank me for that and start doing the job I'm asking you to do.
Help you start a war.
Is that what you think I want?
That's so limited.
I didn't take that football to start a war any more than I took your son to start a family.
Taking your son got me the codes.
The codes will get me the nukes, and the nukes will get me what I want today, tomorrow and every day after that.
And what's that?
Accountability.
The second I fire off one of those nukes,
I put the superpowers of this world on notice that when they cross the line,
I'm gonna be there to hold them responsible.
Because the truth is, Dom, to the world out there I am the crocodile at the watering hole.
We've got one last job to do.
I have known one thing about you, Cipher.
Behind those contacts, your eyes are brown.
Beneath that dye, your hair is black.
There was probably beauty inside you once, but somehow you let it all die away.
You're so wrapped up in being a mystery, you don't know who the hell you are anymore.
You're lost... you're alone... and you're scared.
If I were you, I'd kiss my son.
Because, whether you value it or not, all of this... your plane, your security and you... are still on this Earth because of him.
The problem we've had with tracking Cipher is there's nothing to trace.
But now we have Rhodes' information.
And we're getting snapshots of his data before it's scrubbed off the Net.
That look like somebody's bank account, so why don't we just go ahead...
It's a longitude.
Given the fact that Dom hit a Russian motorcade, safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead and bring up the map.
Good.
Let's start here and run the possibilities.
Yalta, Poltava...
It's like they just threw letters together.
- Kronyurt...
- It's Vladovin.
What are you doing here?
What?
Told you I was gonna check in on you from time to time to see how you were doing.
By the way, not so hot.
But there's nothing in Vladovin.
- It's just ice.
- That's funny.
Could've sworn there was a secret Russian naval base where they retrofitted Cold War submarines.
Well, technically, it's not Russian anymore.
Base was taken over by a terror group of military separatists about a month ago, and the Russians haven't taken it back yet, so there is a little window of opportunity here.
Russian submarines.
Nuclear football.
It sounds like, everything we do, our legs gonna be blown off.
It sounds like you still number 11 on the list.
It sounds like you've changed since your little punk-ass facial hairs done came in.
Like a fake-ass Barry White looking...
Guys, guys.
Hey, we gotta call this in.
All the way up the chain.
That's good thinking, champ, except, unfortunately, the Russian Minister of Defense got himself involved in a little incident on U.S. territory and... two governments aren't talking to each other for a while.
By the time they do, it'll be too late.
So, any other suggestions?
Yeah.
I got one.
How about we just stop 'em ourselves?
You're talking about a Russian military base.
- Separatist.
- Whatever.
It's suicide.
It's stopping World War Three.
What's it gonna be, rook?
You gonna close your eyes on this one, too?
Pray that the apocalypse doesn't come knocking on your mama's front door?
Or you gonna saddle up, be a man and save the entire goddamn world?
You know, I think I figured it out.
What's that?
Rule number three.
Which is?
There are no rules.
What'd I tell you, Luke?
I knew he'd get it in three.
Aerial transport leaves in an hour.
Take whatever vehicle you want.
All bets are off.
- All bets are off?
- Bets are off?
Letty, I don't like telling you this one bit, but the game's changed.
Before, we were just trying to catch Dom, but now, after all this,
I want you to know, if I have to,
I'm gonna put him down.
Then you might have to take us both down.
I'm freezing, man.
This ain't for me.
I come from a different kind of lifestyle, brah.
Ladies know me.
They know where I'm at with it.
I tried to take a piss...
I didn't even recognize myself.
Man, that's entirely too much information.
I'm just saying.
Well, one thing's for sure.
Dom's gotta be either working with them or making a trade, because no one would be this insane to hit this place without a damn army.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Speak of the devil.
All right, Dom, you're one step closer to that family reunion.
400 meters to base.
Prep the EMP.
Let's take these defenses down.
Gates are open.
Let's get this party started.
EMP is recharging.
- How long?
- 60 seconds.
All right, Dom, you have one pulse left in that EMP.
That sub is heavily insulated.
You're gonna need to be right underneath it for this thing to work.
Come on.
Yes!
Two birds with one stone.
We've got control of the sub.
Dom, we are good.
Head over to the rendezvous.
Okay, Matty... let's take this baby for a spin.
Damn.
I think Cipher just rebooted that sub to slave its command system.
What the hell is he talking about?
In layman's terms, she just carjacked a submarine.
We can't let it get away.
There's the control room.
If you can get me into that wheelhouse,
I can tap the network and counter-hack Cipher.
Keep it from lowering into the water.
No, what we need to do is get me on that sub.
I find the weapons room, and I can pull the launch chip before she can fire any of those nukes.
- That is too crazy.
- What you're saying is too dangerous.
We'll do both.
Knock, knock.
Five vehicles just breached the base.
They just don't give up, do they?
All right, let's haul ass, team.
Double time, double time.
Letty, let's roll.
Go!
Go, go, go!
Change of plans, Dom.
I'm sending you new coordinates.
Head there immediately.
I'm done.
I want my son.
I'll tell you when you're done.
Your team is in play.
Now, meet Rhodes and follow my instruction.
I got you covered!
Go!
Move, move!
Get out of here!
Go, go, go!
Okay.
How do you like this?
Remote link has been severed.
I'll take care of this.
Hi, Ramsey.
She's regained control.
Damn it, she's good.
They're entering the weapons room.
Oh, that's cute.
Yo!
Pull, pull!
Roman, Roman, we gotta find the chip.
Go!
Oh, she's slick.
You're gonna have to do better than that, though.
Okay, now you're starting to piss me off.
Ramsey, how much time we talking here?
You're smart... but not smart enough.
She's locked me out.
Tej, I can't stop her.
You're gonna have to pull that chip.
I can't.
This thing's gone into attack mode.
The door's not gonna open until you pull the chip.
Tej, we got no idea what the hell we're looking for.
I got it.
What in the hell are you guys doing?
It wasn't me.
It-it wasn't me, okay?
It'll be labeled "guidance go."
Guidance go, guidance...
Okay, I got something.
- What?
- It says...
H-Hakslak... s-slak-lak... smok... belzak... marak...
Do you understand that?
Wow, nasty.
Hmm.
Quite a show.
We're arming the nuke.
Nuke's going hot.
She's trying to fire this thing.
Roger that.
We're moving out.
- Disable that chip, now!
- Roman, what are you seeing?
Come on, talk to me.
I don't see shit.
I'm holding on.
And we have a countdown.
What the hell is going on, man?
We're about to launch a nuclear missile is what the hell is going on.
Pull the damn chip!
Countdown.
Countdown!
- Look for a countdown!
- What countdown?
The missiles need to activate to launch.
The countdown timer won't be in Russian.
The countdown...
Let's show the world what we've got.
No, no, no, don't press that!
I got it.
Something's wrong.
It won't launch.
Get that sub out of there.
Now!
Move your ass, Roman!
- You all right?
- There's nothing all right about any of this!
Let's go!
What about the missiles?
We got the chip.
No nukes for her.
Hell yeah.
Let's roll.
Oh, shit!
The other way!
What?
Go the other way!
The ice.
Everybody out on the ice.
Guys, we got company.
A lot of company.
All right, team, here's the plan.
There's a sea lock at the opening of the bay.
We get there first and close it, we can stop the submarine from escaping into open water and disappearing forever.
I've got the location.
It's ten miles southwest.
Ten miles?
We're not gonna make it ten seconds!
No, no, no, no, no!
This is not good!
Aah!
What's the matter, Roman?
Forgot your snow tires?
You loving that Lambo now?
Oh, sh...
Oh!
All right, everyone.
We'll deal with that launch chip later.
Right now I want that sub in deep water where no one can find it.
Find me the fastest route out of that bay.
Copy that.
Why are they shooting at me?
!
Maybe 'cause you're in an orange Lamborghini.
I don't know.
Shut up, Tej!
Dom, do you really want to put that car in gear?
Do it, huh?
- I didn't think so.
- They're heading for the sea lock.
They're trying to trap the sub in the bay.
I should have taken care of this a long time ago.
Rhodes, take his team out.
I'm on it.
Roman, get in front of me.
Okay, y'all want to play rough?
Now it's my turn.
Yeah, baby!
Guys, we got snowmobiles on the right.
They're gonna flank us!
No, they ain't.
Oh, shit!
Tej!
Roman, hold tight.
I'm on the way.
I don't want to go swimming!
No!
Really, Tej?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Oh, shit!
Roman, grab your door.
Tej!
Grab the door, Roman!
- It's so cold!
- Shit.
Oh, shit!
Whoa!
- Whoo!
- Yeah!
What is going on?
!
Roman, hang on.
Tej!
Get me off of this thing!
Tej!
Come on!
All right.
I've had enough of this shit!
Number 11, my ass.
Yo, Shrinkage.
We got a sub to catch.
Get in.
What?
Depressurization alert in the cargo hold.
Drop it to 10,000 feet.
I know how much these people mean to you.
So I will let you pick the first target.
I don't pick a target from a mile away.
I stand face to face and look 'em dead in the eye.
Okay.
The wife it is.
Nice plane.
I'm going to enjoy having this.
Hey, don't go getting any ideas.
You and planes don't have a good history.
No shit.
Okay...
let's go, Scarface.
These assholes ain't gonna kill themselves.
Pull up surveillance right now.
Surprise.
You're supposed to be dead.
We have a security breach in the cargo hold.
Take care of it now.
Jesus, Mum.
You're supposed to avoid the nerves.
Oh, shut up.
Don't be such a baby.
Get to the pilot.
He's got the second key.
- Wait for my signal.
- Give Cipher my regards.
Did Toretto hold up his end of the deal?
He gave us this little thing here.
No, no, no, no.
Don't touch.
You can track Cipher with this, but you can't do this on your own.
It's gotta be two of you.
Fine.
I've got contacts.
No, you're gonna take your brother.
- No.
Damn.
- Yes.
Toretto knows where he is.
He's got this thing.
It can see everything.
It's like... it's called the Devil's Bumhole or something.
- It's called the God's Eye.
- Yeah, well, whatever.
There's no way I'm using Owen, all right?
He's a lost cause.
He's your brother, Decks.
He's my son.
He's our family.
And our family don't die in bloody cages.
How can you talk like that about Owen?
I can't believe you.
You've gone and upset me.
You've really upset your mother.
Call yourself a brother?
- Look, look, come here.
- You're...
Mum.
Okay, okay.
Every time.
Owen.
In position.
Go.
I'm in.
I've got the package, Toretto.
All 12 pounds of him.
Yeah!
Dada.
Dada.
You made me miss my shot.
What you think you're doing?
Looking at you dead in the eye.
That was for Elena.
Rhodes.
He's no longer with us.
Rhodes picked the wrong target.
Congratulations, Dom.
You just killed your son.
You're wrong.
I just saved him.
And you just took your foot off the tiger's neck.
All right, governor, it's gonna get noisy.
This is for your ears.
Good?
Let's go.
No.
Stop him!
Do not let him get off this plane.
We got another problem.
That truck's got enough missiles to take us all out.
Then don't give 'em a target.
Everybody, get in front of us, line up,
- and we'll take the hit.
- What?
I need to switch cars right now.
- Roman, here comes the bad part.
- What?
Whoa!
Whoo!
Hang in there, guys.
We're almost to the lock.
It's easy for you to say when your ass ain't on fire.
All right, little man.
This might be a little scary, but it's gonna be a lot of fun.
Ready?
How's the music?
Good?
They're locking on.
Sorry, guys, I got no tricks left.
What do we do now?
We start praying.
Hell yeah!
There's Dom.
What, is this guy on our side now?
Who the hell cares?
He just saved our ass.
Good to be riding with you again, man.
Toretto just cleared the way for them.
- Someone, give me something.
- Torpedoes are ready.
Then launch them!
Shit.
Take the wheel.
I ain't taking shit!
Take the wheel!
Where are you going?
- This is crazy!
- Speed up!
- Left and back!
- What?
Turn the goddamn wheel to the left really quickly.
Oh, got it.
Boom, baby.
Going for a ride.
Back in a sec.
Where's that smile?
There it is.
You were gonna shoot a baby?
You sick bastard.
You're not gonna want to see this.
♪ We've been good ♪
♪ But we can't last ♪
♪ Hurry, Christmas ♪
♪ Hurry fast... ♪
Is that you or him?
Him.
Good.
The torpedoes missed.
They're gonna reach the lock before the sub does.
The hell they are.
Get ready for this.
Oh, shit!
We're gonna need a bigger truck.
It's right under us.
Get out the way!
I'm not going back in that water!
Get us out of here!
Why are you always yelling?
- This bitch is crazy.
- Look out!
Yeah, that's not good.
That's not good.
Please tell me there's nothing to worry about.
Relax.
We got this.
That's my girl.
The sub's too close.
We ain't making it to the gate in time.
We're just gonna let it get away?
Not if I know Dom.
You lose, Dom.
I destroyed two of your teams,
I killed your redheaded boyfriend, and I put two killers on your untraceable plane.
You lost the minute you interrupted my honeymoon.
Now guess who I'm coming for.
Put a heat-seeker on him now.
Now!
Fire!
That's a goddamn heat-seeker coming at us!
Peel off!
Head to the shore!
All right.
Come and get it.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no.
Dive!
Dive!
This...
This is for my son.
Dom!
You're out of bullets, Deckard.
Not like I'm gonna need a gun to take care of you.
How did you find me?
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch.
Resourceful.
You have a lot to answer for, Cipher.
What you put my family through.
My mother.
I'm gonna make sure that never happens again.
To anyone.
There is only one flaw in your plan.
What's that?
Only one of us has a parachute.
Told you this would be fun.
Time to land, boys.
You know I never left you, Letty.
I know.
And you know I never will.
I know.
I have so much to tell you.
Yeah, you do.
And you can start with that bitch.
Now, that's Dominic Toretto.
Hey, Dom.
I'm just throwing it out there.
We need to get up out of here 'cause there's all kind of nuclearism
- happening under this ice.
- Relax.
Without the trigger chips, those nukes are harmless.
Okay, so we good, then.
Let me go and get my young selfie levels up.
You realize this is classified, right?
Not today.
Unbelievable.
All right, can we get up out of here now?
I'm freezing.

Don't worry.

Y'all got a lot in common.
Computer hacks, God's Eye, geeks, nerd, the...
You know.
But we got a lot in common, too, right?
- Like what?
- We walk in the room, and we're oozing sex appeal.
We steal the show.
Me and you, hip to hip, is a problem.
That's us.
I'm asking a real question right now.
Is it gonna be Revenge of the Nerds...
Or...
The Dark Knight?
Huh?
To be honest, I like both of you.
Yeah, baby.
You know what I mean?
All right, all right, baby...
But just before we get into all of that, let me ask you one question.
You can ask me anything.
Anything.
What's my last name?
When you guys figure it out, then...
- I guess you can let me know.
- It's gonna be Parker.
That's... that's all that really matters.
- Jones.
Uh...
- Mrs. Parker.
- Right?
- Hey, Mrs. Parker.
- Hey.
- Letty.
I wanted to thank you.
No need.
Cipher is still on the loose.
There's been some reports she's in Athens, but matter of time before we find her, thanks to you guys.
So, I got you a party favor.
This can't be good.
Your record's been cleared.
Full reinstatement.
You got your job back.
That is, if you want it.
- If I want.
- Mm-hmm.
You know, after 16 years,
I figure it's time for a little break.
Wow.
Daddy's staying home.
Mmm... mwah.
Nobody.
Keep in touch.
Ah, hang on a second.
This could be interesting.
What made you think I'd do it?
Brotherhood.
I saw that look you gave Cipher.
Knew you wanted revenge.
Glad I did it.
Can't believe you went to see my mother.
Hey.
Hey, you know my son is only American muscle.
Hey, look, had to give him something.
Look how I tested the little guy.
Come on, Roman.
Get to cooking, buddy.
We all love you.
Come on, now.
All this fuss over you.
Yes.
Elena, I promise to keep our son safe.
And now he always will be.
I want to introduce you to the most important person in my universe.
One who never gave up on me.
He's beautiful.
You've heard me say that you never turn your back on family.
And I want to thank you all for never turning your back on me.
You want to meet them?
All right.
Everyone... meet Brian.
- Oh, man.
- Yes.
Yeah!
I love it.
- Go, Brian.
- That's right.
Welcome to the family, Brian.
Okay, I guess it's my turn to say grace.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)
(IN ENGLISH) You know I can't make a living without my car.
Not my problem, bro.
Dominic Toretto, I heard about you.
Welcome to my island.
Why you hooking' up my cousin's car?
He needed money, I gave it to him.
He can't pay, I take the car.
I just need a few more days.
"Few more days" wasn't part of the deal.
Come on.
You make a deal, you gotta live up to it.
You make a deal, you gonna live up to it.
"Gonna" live up to it?
Oh, so you're one of those types.
You take everyone's ride, and then ship it back to the States?
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
(IN ENGLISH) You watch your mouth.
(CHUCKLES)
Now you got a problem.
I'm gonna keep it about the cars.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
(IN ENGLISH) You want a car, get it the right way.
How?
Race for it.
I already own it, bro.
Not that car.
Mine.
(CROWD EXCLAIMING)
Dom, his car is the fastest car on the island.
Do you know what he has under that hood?
He knows it doesn't matter what's under a hood.
The only thing that matters is who's behind the wheel.
You think so?
I know so.
Then race his car.
And we ain't racing no quarter-mile, here.
We race the Cuban mile.
Done.
(CROWD CHEERING)
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
I appreciate what you're trying to do, but my car is the slowest car on the island.
Was.
Pull the seats, the doors, the battery...
If it ain't the motor, take it off.
Laughing gas?
Nah, Fed.
This is Cuban NOS.
You guys are crazy.
What are you doing?
DOM:
Poor man's turbo.
Pull the vacuum line and hold on.
Old trick that Buster used to play, in case of emergencies.
You know that's way too much boost for that engine.
DOM:
It's gonna be fast.
It's gonna be a bomb.
Only needs to go a mile.

Yo, cousin...
Sorry about your car.
Yours was too slow for a Toretto, anyway.
Your Impala?
Are you serious?
(ALL CHEERING)
Look at that smile.
I love it when you smile.
You make me happy.
Mmm, I think this place makes you happy.
It's like it speaks to you.
You remember that guy, the racer and his dad?
The one with the boat engine under the hood?
Yeah!
- Yes.
- Of course.
I was looking at them, and I...
And I couldn't help but to imagine what you'd be like if you were a dad.
No, no, no!
I'm not pregnant.
Is that what you want?
It's not about what I want or what you want.
It's about why we haven't asked the question.
(ENGINE CRANKS SLOWLY)
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
- (IN ENGLISH)What?
- You need a hand?
Yeah, I think I do.
- Sounds like you're not getting any fuel.
- Yeah?
Probably the shut-off solenoid.
Let's see if we can get some power to it.
What brings you to Cuba?
The same thing that brings everyone else to Cuba.
Culture, people, the beauty.
What brings you to Cuba?
- Work.
- Must be casual Friday.
How's that honeymoon going, Dom?
Your fuel relay is missing.
I know.
I love to play games.
I've beaten the best of 'em.
But I'm kind of in a rush, so if you've got something to say to me...
Oh, this is a very different game, that I can assure you.
This...
There's something much greater at work here.
This is fate.
I choose to make my own fate.
Not today.
Is this the road you take to your apartment every morning?
What else is different, Dom?
Was Santiago's closed?
Did you have to cross two blocks to go get your Cuban coffees?
What is it, black, no sugar?
Yeah.
I put a lot of work into getting you here today.
Well, now that I'm here, what do you want?
I want you to work for me.
Work for you?
Oh, I could've saved you a lot of time, then.
See, I don't work for anyone.
You can't walk away from this, Dom.
We're gonna have this conversation, one way or the other.
You see, that's the funny thing about fate.
It's cunning.
It can bring you beautiful things, and it can also bring you moments like this.
Oh, you're gonna want to work for me.
You're gonna betray your brothers, abandon your code, and shatter your family.
You see, your team is about to go up against the only thing they can't handle.
What's that?
You.
Oh, and, Dom, I wouldn't mention this to anyone.
(ENGINE STARTS)
HOBBS:
They are gonna be hitting us with everything they got.
So we wanna engage with maximum speed.
Neutralize their shooters, and then move on to our objective.
There's two things I want you to keep in mind.
Number one, I chose you for this squad because you are the most fearsome warriors on the planet.
And number two, you go out there, you do your job, and you take 'em down.
Everyone.
And I mean everyone.
Mani's and pedi's at the mall later on today.

Final two minutes.
DS ALLAN:
Quite the cheering section.
HOBBS:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it's the moms.
They come out to support the kids.
Except there seem to be more moms than kids.
Way more moms.
(WOMEN GIGGLING)
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
It's a big soccer town.
Let's go, girls!
So, your intel was spot-on.
That Damocles 7 EMP weapon that went missing in the Gulf?
Arms dealers from the Liberation Front have it in Berlin.
HOBBS:
Shit!
This thing can wipe out an entire electrical grid in a major city.
No lights, no power.
Instant Stone Age.
Chloe, Maya, you can't let her run by you like that.
- Let's go, let's go!
Cross!
- Agent Hobbs, this is a Class Four WMD.
Do you have any idea what's at stake here?
Yes, I know exactly what is at stake here, okay?
If the Pink Butterflies beat my Red Dragons, that means we lose the championship.
Which means I have 20 little girls who are crying, and that's not a good thing.
Which then means I have to spend a lot of time in ice-cream shops and a lot of time at Tay Tay concerts.
Tay Tay?
Taylor Swift.
Gotta be shittin' me.
Get it together, okay?
Let's go, girls!
We need you to do this.
It's a lot of lives at stake.
All right, but I need to be clear here.
The US government cannot sanction this operation in any way.
- You're on your own.
- Hey.
If this thing goes sideways, you don't just get burned.
You go to prison.
And there's nothing we can do to get you out.
Let me tell you something.
The only thing that I love more than saving lives is my daughter.
So, if you don't shut up with this government bullshit right now, and start showing some team spirit and respect for the Red Dragons,
I'm gonna have all 20 of them line up and kick you right in the tay-tay.
Go Dragons!
Say it again.
Go Dragons!

Go Dragons.

How did I do?
Awesome.
Nice job, kid.
(HOBBS SIGHS) Daddy's gotta go to work?
Uh, yeah.
Daddy's gotta go to work.
Now, you're gonna need to get a team you can trust.
Oh, I already got one.

HOBBS:
Hey, Dom.
Hey, Hobbs.
I got a job in Berlin and I need a favor, brother.
No problem.
I'll grab the team and meet you in Berlin.
Thanks, man.
I'll see you soon.
(GRUNTS)
You were only supposed to create a diversion, Roman.
That was a diversion!
How many of the damn explosives did you use?
ROMAN:
I don't know, Tej.
- All of it?
- Wait, all of it?
Roman, Jesus Christ.
We got more of your fan club ahead.
They're still on us!
These guys are taking this personal.
Roman, we just blew up their facility and stole their EMP.
Other than your doctor's cold finger,
I'd say it's about as personal as it can get.
Phase Two!
Phase Two?
So you just gonna keep that to yourself?
What happened to Phase One?
What about that part?
Yeah.
Remember the airplane?
Everyone drove their cars out but you?
I told you, my engine seized up.
It's your balls that seized up.
Just follow my lead, okay?
And, Roman, whatever you do, don't think.
Huh?
Tej, drop it!
Bombs away.
(BEEPS)
Split, now!
ROMAN:
Holy... (CURSES IN GERMAN)
ROMAN: (OVER RADIO) Great plan, Tej.
But just so you know, you missed some.
Oh, just wait for it.
ROMAN:
Oh, shit!
I hate you, Tej!
(LAUGHS)
Got your ass.
You good?
I'll see you when it's done.
All right, great job, team.
Let's break off and meet me at the safe house.
(ENGINE REVVING)
A hell of a job, brother.
When we get back to the base, the beer's on me.
(GASPING)
(GRUNTS)
You lost your goddamn mind, Toretto?
Toretto, you put hands on that thing, you're gonna have the whole world gunning for you, including me.
(DOM GRUNTS)
I don't know what you're doing, but you better think about this, Toretto.
It ain't too late to stop this.
It is now.
(TIRES SQUEALING)
(SIRENS BLARING)
That sumbitch just crossed us.
- What?
- Wait a second, what are you talking about?
Dom took the EMP.
Bullshit.
Where are you?
HOBBS:
It's too late for me.
Get outta here.
Saw that look in his eye, and I've seen that look before.
Dominic Toretto just went rogue.
TEJ:
All right, I got his phone records, y'all.
It's a whole bunch of calls to untraceable numbers.
ROMAN:
Burner phones, right?
TEJ:
Nah, scrambler.
Same number, but they got some sort of micro-router to bury the signal path, which means Dom is clearly communicating with somebody that's above our pay grade.
Look, I don't know Dom as well as you, but if we just look at the facts,
Dom's been having highly encrypted conversations with some mysterious person.
He took out Hobbs.
He stole an EMP.
Now he's disappeared.
So, what are you saying?
Maybe we should consider the fact that Hobbs is right.
Dom did go rogue.
(CAR DOOR SLAMS)
ROMAN:
Letty.
LETTY:
Before you judge the man, remember, you're breathing right now because he saved your life.
You just gonna let her bump your shoulder like that?
I'm just saying, that was a little aggressive.
What you gonna do, email her?
(SIGHS)
(WHISPERS) Check.
(CELL DOOR BUZZING)
Moment, will you, fellas?
Thank you.
Well, this is an exciting new look.
It's a little tight in the crotch, as always.

What boy-band bus did she fall out of?
It's my new junior associate.
He's working with me on this.
All yours.
Mr. Nobody and I have been given the authority to get you out of this.
All you have to do is agree to the terms and you're free.
What's training wheels talking about?
What terms?
Confess to your crimes in Berlin.
Treason, international espionage, massive destruction of civic property.
You do that, we close the case.
- And?
- And the DSS blacklists you.
Germany loves that.
LITTLE NOBODY:
Officially, you will be a criminal.
MR. NOBODY:
Wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You need to work on your delivery, all right?
Unofficially...
You're off the books.
You come work with me.
I'm not a criminal.
MR. NOBODY:
Luke, come on.
Labels.
There is no confession.
There are no backroom deals.
I got myself into this, I'm gonna get myself out of it.
- You know that.
- I do, and that's what I told him. (SIGHS)
Well, there you have it.
Good luck in the courts, man.
What about your daughter?
You know, if you're not gonna do it for your country, at least do it for your kid.
(CHUCKLES) Big mistake, kid.
(EXCLAIMS)

He's still working from the manual.
I mean, he doesn't even really know the rules.
Now, come on, give him a break.

Luke.
(GRUNTING)
Appreciate it.
(COUGHING)
It's good to see you, Nobody.
You, too.

Such a cliché.
Oh, well, welcome to the club.
I wouldn't get that twisted, son.
We ain't in no club, we got nothing in common.
And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.
What, you bring a shovel, did you?
Because it's 38 feet of steel and concrete.
Or so I've been told.
(DECKARD CHUCKLES)
Better get to digging.
Wanker.
Yeah.

If I say it again, it'll be to a corpse.

I'm gonna enjoy this.
CIPHER:
Welcome back, Dom.
Nice job out there.
You excited about tonight?
You're going on this?
You're with me, Dom.
Showing me your shoe collection?
Yep.
A pair for every occasion.
You have enough guns in here to outfit a small army, huh?
Oh, this is just the tip of the iceberg.
You know what I like about you, Dom?
You're a genuine outlaw.
I mean, you're a man who lives by his own rules.
Which is surprising, because when I saw you in Cuba,
I heard about a guy who almost killed you with a motorcycle, and you let him keep his car?
Oh, that confused you?
Hmm.
'Course I could've taken his car.
But it's about something bigger.
This way...
I changed him.
That's not your responsibility.
- But it's who I am.
- Is it?
Let me ask you something, Dom.
What's the best thing in your life?
- Family.
- No, it's not.
Not if you're being honest.
It's the 10 seconds between start and finish, when you're not thinking about anything.
No family, no obligations.
Just you.
Being free.
I gotta tell you, this whole saving-the-world, Robin Hood nonsense you've been doing recently?
It's bullshit.
It's not you.
Be who you are.
Why live only a quarter mile at a time when you can live your whole life that way?
(PANTING)
Is that it?
Is that all those bloated-out muscles will give ya?
All show and no go.
(GRUNTS)
(GRUNTING)
Oh, I got plenty of go.
You must've misplaced that when I kicked your arse up and down that office of yours.
Yeah.
Just like you Brits, rewriting history, huh?
All I know is, it wasn't me that was thrown out of a four-story window.
Jumped.
I jumped out of a four-story window, saving my partner's life.
'Cause where I'm from, we don't settle fights by throwing bombs.
Well, that's funny, because where I'm from, we don't need women to run to our rescue.
I mean, do you really believe you can stand in front of me and beat me in a straight-up, old-fashioned fist fight?
Let me tell you something.
Me and you, one-on-one, no one else around.
I will beat your ass like a Cherokee drum.
Maybe one day we'll find out.
Oh, you better hope that day never comes.
(DOOR BUZZES)
I said no, Mr. Nobody.
I'm not leaving this cell.
I'll get out my way.
(ALARM BLARING)

Hey, listen, guys.

It's called abuse of power.
You told me to round them up.
I didn't tell you to hand...

Oh, man.
This is embarrassing.
I'm sorry, guys, really, I...
So, this is how you treat old friends?

Doesn't matter who I am, Tej.

He's nothing.
He's, like, less than me.
Clearly, we're getting nowhere with nobody.
I've been in here for four hours, and my ribs are showing.
I don't know about y'all, but I'm out.

- Yeah.
ROMAN:
That's impossible!
What number did they come in at?
Six, eight, nine, ten.
- She's 10?
- Mmm-hmm.
That's impossible.
There's no way she's a 10.
Oh, she's definitely a 10.
(SCOFFS)
How about we focus on someone who we're not gonna find on anybody's list.
We're awaiting hard confirmation, but I believe that's the cyber terrorist known as Cipher.
Wait, no.
Cipher's an organization.
Not a person.
Not according to our sources.
What does she want?
No one knows.
Cipher is like a digital act of God.
They...
Well, she can manipulate world systems from the shadows.
Anything that can be hacked is hers to play with.
And here's the kicker.
You'll never find her linked to any of it.
Her digital identity is scrubbed every few seconds, worldwide.
So, basically, she's the bogeyman.
Damn, she's one of the hottest bogeymans I've ever seen.
I mean, if y'all know her, tell her to get at your boy.
(ROMAN CHUCKLES) (CLEARS THROAT)
What are you, 12?
ROMAN:
That was my shin, mother...
Let's just say, people are scared of the hacker group Anonymous.
But even Anonymous won't mess with her.
What the hell does any of this have to do with us?
Probably nothing, Letty, but I do find it interesting that, apparently, for some reason, she's now working with this guy.
(SIGHS)
He's already delivered a fully operational EMP into her hands.
Detonate that, they can turn any city in the world into a war zone.
So, then, what is it you're suggesting we do?
MR. NOBODY:
Maybe we find Dom, huh?
Well, first, let's catch him, and then figure out why he's turned.
So, y'all want us to track Dom.
Yeah, I know, Roman, it's kind of a big job.
It's impossible.
Which is why I'm bringing in an extra pair of hands.
Ah, my day just got a whole hell of a lot better.
Mr. Nobody, you wanna tell me why you just put me in a room with this tea-and-crumpets eating, criminal sumbitch?
What a big mouth on a small head, coming from Prisoner 6753.
Don't think we've forgotten everything that you've done.
We are not teaming up with this guy.
Let's get one thing clear.
I ain't on your team.
I don't care about you, your crew, or your little family.
I'm here for Cipher.
What are you gonna do, apply for a job?
Head Asshole?
You know, I think that tight T-shirt's cutting off the circulation to your brain.
You should get a bigger size.
Cipher came to me first.
Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.
When I said no, she went after my brother.
Ah, yes, brother Owen.
Who could forget him, huh?
Former hell-raiser and current guest at a nasty little black site prison.
Cipher corrupted him and left him for dead.
So, if I get a shot to take her down, believe me, Flex, I'm taking it.
You're taking my boot right up your ass, is what you're taking.
Guys, guys.
The fastest way to find Cipher is through Toretto.
Now, aside from myself, there's only two men in the world that have ever managed to actually track him down with any success.
And guess what.
They're both standing in front of me right now.
So, like it or not, you two are gonna work together.
You got that?
I'm gonna take that as a yes.
Am I the only one seeing this?
Oh, this ought to be good.
(MUMBLES)
Use God's Eye.
We put our lives on the line, running around the world trying to figure this thing out.
It can find anybody, right?
Let's use it to find Dom.
Roman, that is a great idea.
Did you hear that?
"Great idea."
No, no, no, don't tune it out.
Huh?
Mr. Nobody, let's fire it up, huh?
TEJ:
Got him.
He's in London.
Yeah.
(BEEPING)
RAMSEY:
Wait.
We've got a second match in Hong Kong.
ROMAN:
Beijing and Seoul.
TEJ:
And Tokyo.
RAMSEY:
And just about every other major city on the planet.
MR. NOBODY:
And so, God's Eye was where we started.
But Cipher's already created an evasion that masks their location by pinging random spots all over the globe, but it was a good thought, Roman.
So, she's made my program obsolete.
And that, Ramsey, is why you're here.
See, simple solutions aren't gonna cut it here, slick.
Why you look at me when you say that?
Wait a second.
Wait, wait.
Simple solutions might just cut it.
You see, in order for God's Eye to give off all these false pings, means they have to be using a FLEA relay.
Watch these two.
Which means it has a decaying sync randomizer.
Which we can reverse...
And track it back to the originating source and find Dom's true location.
I'm telling you, they got skills.
That was my idea.
That's what I was saying.
Remember in there?
All right, let's try this.
It's working.
Time you wanna check your manual and start organizing a force response.
Let's get a hold of our international assets...
He's still green.
Yeah, like fresh baby shit.
As soon as we have Toretto's location, I want to mobilize.
Let's get a hold of a better asshole.
No one respects you...
(IMITATES RADIO STATIC) Cover.
Get away from me.
All right, they're not in China.
Or Russia.
Europe's clear.
But this one's not going away.
(BEEPING)
This is interesting.
Why?
(BEEPING RAPIDLY)
Because that's here.
(GRUNTING)

CIPHER: (ECHOING) Did you all enjoy that?
Next-generation concussion grenade.
It scrambles your senses.
Don't worry, it'll wear off in an hour.
(GROANING) Probably.
Hello, Deckard.
Nice to see you again.
(LAUGHING) Look at this, body's not even cold, Dom.
Your family's already replacing you.
You chose the losing team.
I guess your brother is smarter than you.
(DECKARD GRUNTING)
(BEEPING)
Smart move, embedding God's Eye into the mainframe.
Irritating to make me have to come all the way down here to get it, but...
Let's go.
(ALL GROANING)
Dom!
You're gonna turn your back on family?
Just like that?
Let's go.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
HOBBS:
You okay?
That wasn't him.
I don't know what she's got on him, but that wasn't Dom.
Brian would know what to do.
No!
We can't bring Brian and Mia into this.
We agreed on that.
ROMAN:
I know.
DOM:
Back there, was that for her, for me, or you?
And was it even necessary?
Necessary?
Nothing is necessary.
Everything is a choice.
And I simply made one.
But so did you.
You could've stopped me, but you chose not to.
I wonder what Letty thought about that.
The problem with putting your foot on a tiger's neck is you can never let it up.
I think I need to remind you why you chose to be here.
(GASPS)
Elena.
ELENA:
Dom?
I'm sorry.
You shouldn't have come.
Nothing could have kept me away.
Now she has the three of us.
(BABY COOING)
Do you wanna see him?
See Papa?
(BABY GURGLING)
See Papa.
Papa.
(COOING)
When I realized I was pregnant, you had just found out Letty was alive.
So I decided when Letty and you got back from your honeymoon,
I was going to tell you.
But then she took us before I had the chance.
(COOS)
His name?
(CONTINUES COOING)
I call him Marcos.
But that's his middle name.
I thought his father should give him his first name.
I'm sorry, Dom.
There's nothing to be sorry for.
ELENA:
Whatever happens, just save our son.
Your son.
CIPHER:
Good visit?
I know.
I know what you're thinking.
I just let the guards go, so there's only two opponents in the room.
Rhodes has the gun, so you'll take him out first.
I know you.
And then you're thinking, Elena's a cop.
Maybe the two of you can fight your way out of here.
(WHISPERS) So much to think about.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
Let me make it easier for you.
Do with it as you wish.
Have you heard of Choice Theory, Dom?
There is a bunch of axioms, but only two you really need to concern yourself with.
One, the only person's behavior we can control is our own.
And, two, the only thing we can truly give another person is information.
So, let me give you some.
You see these cameras in here?
The moment you make a move, highly-paid men with weapons will make their way into this room with one very specific instruction.
It's not to save me.
It's to kill your son.
Now, that's a lot of bullets, and it only takes one for you to lose everything.
So, I have to ask you, because I know family is so important to you.
Is that really a choice you want to make?
Because I'm ready if you are.
If I pull this trigger, and God knows I want to, if I killed everyone on this plane,
I still couldn't get in there.
'Cause of your two-man fail-safe system.
Since I'm alone,
I got no choice!
I didn't think so.
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch.
(SOBBING)
Bitch.
- Don't, don't.
- Sweet dreams.
Please!
LITTLE NOBODY:
Damn it.
She wiped it all.
Took God's Eye.
That was the one thing we could use to find them.
We lost everything.
What do you got, Princess?
Finding Toretto.
But I got a couple of minutes to spare, if you want me to send you to the hospital.
Again.
(CHUCKLES) Yo, Rules.
First off, that's not my name.
- Little Nobody.
- Don't call me that.
Oh, that's definitely sticking.
Great.
Do me a favor and tell Your Majesty over there that we're gonna find Toretto.
We find Toretto together as a team.
And when this is all over with,
I'm happy to slap that whisker biscuit right off his face.
Wait a minute, guys, I think Deckard's actually onto something.
How do you think Dom and Cipher got into the country without us knowing?
Ghost flights.
I thought untraceable aircraft was all Internet conspiracy stuff.
MR. NOBODY:
It's not.
Satellites and radar grids all across the globe shift like an ocean.
They've got channels that open and close.
And theoretically, if you know the right people who know the right patterns...
You can fly right through the blind spots completely undetected.
So you know where Dom is headed?
(LAPTOP BEEPS)
Yeah.
New York.
(CHUCKLES)
You see there, Luke?
You guys are gonna get along just great.
Which proves rule number two, you never lose everything.
Fire up the chopper.
Well, guys, have a ball in the Big Apple.
ROMAN:
And why are we traveling like this again?
TEJ:
Because Dom took God's Eye, so we need to stay off the grid.
ROMAN:
But like this?
(ALL GRUNTING)
ROMAN:
Look here, man.
Before I throw up in my mouth, let me ask you, what are we doing here?
That's a good question, Roman.
Let me show you.
Welcome to our new base of operations.
No, seriously.
What is this place?
This is heaven.
It's the agency garage.
They call it the Toy Shop.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
LITTLE NOBODY:
This is where we house every vehicle seized from drug dealers on the East Coast.
Now, Mr. Nobody said that if we're gonna have a chance at catching Dom,
we're gonna have to be damn fast.
Figured this would help.
We got a tank.
750 horsepower, 6.6 liter, V8 Duramax engine with an M153 CROWS remotely operated weapon station on top.
You didn't get this from drug dealers.
LITTLE NOBODY:
No.
No, that, uh, the United States Army lent me.
See, the Army's developing machines like this that soldiers can drive from a mile away, so they can stay safe and alive.
But, luckily, there's a backup driver's seat for those of us that like to get more "hands on."
ROMAN:
I'm sitting here wondering this whole time, will this thing fit in valet at Cheesecake Factory?
No one is getting "hands on."
She doesn't go on city streets.
Wow.
I'm in love.
Again, no, no.
That's a million-dollar show car.
The point is to not draw attention.
It's reverse psychology.
Dom would never see it coming.
It's neon orange.
The International Space Station would see it coming.
Go choose anything less conspicuous.
ROMAN:
No, no, no.
Calipers are my...
- This is ridiculous.
- Not happening.
Hey, my man, you can put that down right there.
This is a gift, a real gift.
I know what you're doing.
(LAUGHS) I like your beard.
You're Blanta.
Black Santa?
No, I'm serious.
Put it down right there.
What are you doing?
Engine's misfiring.
I gotta check it out.
No, that's not part of the plan, Dom.
DOM:
Clearly.
But unless you want the engine to seize on the job...
You have five minutes.
(MOUTHING) Five minutes.
I want another visual.
I got an ATM.
I don't like this.
I want to see Toretto.
- There are no more cameras.
- Then find something!
Punch in on something reflective.
A car mirror, anything.
Do you know who I am?
It's why I'm here.
Do you know what I'm capable of?
It's why I'm here.
I'll give you until I finish me cuppa.
And I'm fucking thirsty.
I've got limited time, so I won't take up too much of yours.
Oh, no.
No, you've already taken everything I have of value, Mr. Toretto.
What more could you possibly want?
To give you something back.
Talk to me.
Something's not right here.
First time I saw my son was behind a bulletproof glass.
When he reached for me, I couldn't hold him.
It's the worst pain I ever felt.
I know you know exactly how that feels.
Maybe we could change that.
Now, why do I think you're about to suggest something really dodgy, Mr. Toretto?
It's why I'm here.
Jesus, punch in on something.
I'm not liking this.
Something's not right.
Rhodes, you close?
RHODES:
Yeah.
CIPHER:
Go.
The delivery truck's moving.

Something about this whole thing that just doesn't add up to me.

They're probably just bunkered down somewhere.

We're closing in on 'em.
You guys ready?

One thing I can guarantee, Dom, no one's ready for this.
I want every chip with a zero-day exploit in a two-mile radius around that motorcade now.

Can you pull up the footage from the guy in the alley?
Traffic cams.
I got you.
I knew it.
I recognize that guy.
That's Connor Rhodes.
I met him when I was working with Shaw's brother.
He wanted us to get the Nightshade device for him.
Connor Rhodes.
He's also linked to somebody I'd quite like to forget.
It's Mose Jakande.
Warlord who tried to get God's Eye.
Which means that's twice that Dom has messed up Cipher's business.
Everything you're feeling right now, this rage, a sense of loss, it's not real.
It's a survival instinct wired deep into our brains to ensure continuation of the species.
When early man would visit a watering hole, if they didn't watch their child, and it got snatched by a crocodile,
our brains would create a painful but instructional memory, so it would never happen again.
This idea of "family" that is so core with you, that rules your world,
it's a biological lie.
You don't have to accept it.
I don't.
Did you really think you could destroy two of my teams without any repercussions?
I wouldn't have even looked your way if you hadn't done that.
You didn't even know you had a kid.
You can thank me for that and start doing the job I'm asking you to do.
Help you start a war.
Is that what you think I want?
That's so limited.
I didn't take that football to start a war any more than I took your son to start a family.
Taking your son got me the codes.
The codes will get me the nukes and the nukes will get me what I want today, tomorrow, and every day after that.
And what's that?
Accountability.
The second I fire off one of those nukes,
I put the superpowers of this world on notice that, when they cross the line,
I'm gonna be there to hold them responsible.
Because the truth is, Dom, to the world out there,
I am the crocodile at the watering hole.
We've got one last job to do.
DOM:
Cipher.
If I were you, I'd kiss my son.
Because whether you value it or not, all of this, your plane, your security, and you, are still on this earth because of him.
RAMSEY:
The problem we've had with tracking Cipher is there's nothing to trace.
But now, we have Rhodes' information.
And we're getting snapshots of his data before it's scrubbed off the net.
That looks like somebody's bank account, so why don't we just go ahead...
It's a longitude.
Given the fact that Dom hit a Russian motorcade, it's safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead and bring up the map.
Good.
Let's start here and run the possibilities.
Yalta, Poltava...
It's like they just threw letters together.
Kronyurt.
MR. NOBODY:
It's "Vladovin."
- What are you doing here?
- What?
Told you I was gonna check in on you from time to time to see how you were doin'.
By the way, not so hot.
But there's nothing in Vladovin.
It's just ice.
That's funny.
Could've sworn there was a secret Russian naval base where they retrofitted Cold War submarines.
Well, technically, it's not Russian anymore.
The base was taken over by a terror group of military separatists about a month ago, and the Russians haven't taken it back yet, so there is a little window of opportunity here.
Russian submarines.
Nuclear football.
It sounds like everything we do, our legs gonna be blown off.
It sounds like you still number 11 on the list. (CHUCKLES)
It sounds like you've changed since your little punk-ass facial hairs done came in.
Guys, guys.
Hey, we gotta call this in.
All the way up the chain.
That's good thinking, champ, except unfortunately, the Russian Minister of Defense got himself involved in a little incident on US territory, and the two governments aren't talking to each other for a while.
By the time they do, it'll be too late.
So, any other suggestions?
HOBBS:
Yeah.
I got one.
How about we just stop them ourselves?
You're talking about a Russian military base.
Separatist.
Whatever.
It's suicide.
It's stopping World War III.
What's it gonna be, rook?
You gonna close your eyes on this one, too?
Pray that the apocalypse doesn't come knocking on your mama's front door?
Or, are you gonna saddle up, be a man, and save the entire goddamn world?
You know, I think I figured it out.
What's that?
Rule number three.
Which is?
There are no rules.
(MR. NOBODY LAUGHS)
What'd I tell you, Luke?
I knew he'd get it in three.

Letty, I don't like telling you this one bit.
But the game's changed.
Before, we were just trying to catch Dom, but now, after all this,
I want you to know, if I have to,
I'm gonna put him down.
Then you might have to take us both down.
ROMAN:
I'm freezing, man.
(BREATHING HEAVILY) This ain't for me.

They know where I'm at with it.
I tried to take a piss, I didn't even recognize myself.
Man, that's entirely too much information.
I'm just sayin'.
Well, one thing's for sure.
Dom's gotta be either working with them or making a trade, because no one would be this insane to hit this place without a damn army.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

You're gonna need to be right underneath it for this thing to work.
(TIRES SQUEALING)
(GRUNTING)
Come on.
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
(ALARMS BLARING)
CIPHER:
Yes!
Two birds with one stone.
SUPER JET TECH:
We've got control of the sub.
Dom, we are good.
Head over to the rendezvous.
Okay, Matty, let's take this baby for a spin.
TEJ:
Damn!
I think Cipher just rebooted that sub to slave its command system.
What the hell is he talking about?
In layman's terms, she just carjacked a submarine.
We can't let it get away.
There's the control room.
If you can get me into that wheelhouse,
I can tap the network and counter-hack Cipher.
Keep it from lowering into the water.
No, what we need to do is get me on that sub.
I find the weapons room and I can pull the launch chip before she can fire any of those nukes.
That is too crazy.
What you're saying is too dangerous.
We'll do both.
Knock, knock.
(SOLDIERS YELLING IN RUSSIAN)
(IN ENGLISH) Five vehicles just breached the base.
They just don't give up, do they?

Letty, let's roll!
(GROANS)
Go!
Go, go, go!
CIPHER:
Change of plans, Dom.
I'm sending you new coordinates.
Head there immediately.
I'm done.
I want my son.
I'll tell you when you're done.
Your team is in play.
Now, meet Rhodes and follow my instruction.
(PANTING)
I've got you covered!
Go!
Move, move!
Get outta here!
Go, go, go!
(PANTING)
Okay.
How do you like this?
(ENGINE POWERING DOWN)
SUPER JET TECH:
Remote link has been severed.
CIPHER:
I'll take care of this.
Hi, Ramsey.

She's good.

They're entering the weapons room.
Oh, that's cute.
LITTLE NOBODY:
(EXCLAIMS) Pull!
Pull!
Roman, Roman!
We gotta find the chip, go!
Oh, she's slick.
Gonna have to do better than that, though.
Okay, now you're starting to piss me off.
(GRUNTING)
(MAN YELLING)
Ramsey, how much time we talkin' here?
You're smart, but not smart enough.
(ENGINE POWERING UP)
She's locked me out.
(GRUNTING)
Tej, I can't stop her.
You're gonna have to pull that chip.
I can't!
This thing's gone into attack mode!
The door's not gonna open until you pull the chip!
Tej, we got no idea what the hell we're looking for.
I got it!
(ALARM BLARING)
What in the hell are you guys doin'?
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me, okay?
It'll be labeled "Guidance Go."
- Guidance Go, Guidance Go...
- Okay, I got somethin'.
- What?
- It says... (SPEAKING GIBBERISH)

Hmm.
Quite a show.
We're arming the nuke.

She's tryin' to fire this thing!
Roger that.
We're moving out.
HOBBS: (OVER RADIO) Disable the nukes!
Roman, what are you seeing?
Come on, talk to me.
I don't see shit.
I'm holding on!
(RUMBLING)
And we have a countdown.
(ALARM BLARING)
What the hell is goin' on, man?
We're about to launch a nuclear missile, is what the hell is goin' on!
Pull the damn chip!
(PANTING)
Countdown, countdown!
Look for a countdown!
What countdown?
The missiles need to activate to launch.
The countdown timer won't be in Russian.
The countdown...
Let's show the world what we've got.
ROMAN:
No, no, no!
Don't press that!
I got it.
Something's wrong.
It won't launch.
Get that sub outta there.
Now!
LITTLE NOBODY:
Move your ass, Roman!
(PANTING)
You all right?
There's nothing all right about any of this!
- Let's go!
- What about the missiles?
We got the chip.
No nukes for her.
Hell, yeah.
Let's roll.
Guys, we got company.
A lot of company!
All right, team, here's the plan.
There's a sea lock at the opening of the bay.
We get there first and close it, we can stop the submarine from escaping into open water and disappearing forever.
I've got the location.
It's 10 miles southwest.
Ten miles?
We're not gonna make it ten seconds!
(GUNFIRE)
Ah!
No, no, no!
This is not good!
What's the matter, Roman?
Forgot your snow tires?
ROMAN:
Whoa!
You lovin' that Lambo now?
ROMAN:
Whoa!
Ah!
(ROMAN EXCLAIMS)
(SCREAMING)
CIPHER:
All right, everyone.
We'll deal with that launch chip later.
Right now, I want that sub in deep water where no one can find it.
Find me the fastest route out of that bay.
Copy that.
Why are they shootin' at me?
Maybe 'cause you're in an orange Lamborghini, I don't know.
Shut up, Tej!
Dom... (OVER EARPIECE) Do you really wanna put that car in gear?
Do it.
Huh?
I didn't think so.
They're heading for the sea lock.
They're trying to trap the sub in the bay.
I should have taken care of this a long time ago.
Rhodes, take his team out.
I'm on it.
Roman, get in front of me!
Okay, y'all wanna play rough?
Now it's my turn.
Yeah, baby!
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)
Guys, we got snowmobiles on the right.
They're gonna flank us!
No, they ain't!
Oh, shit!

Roman, hold tight, I'm on the way!
I don't wanna go swimmin'!
No!

Oh, no, no, no!

We got a sub to catch.
Get in!
What?
Depressurization alert in the cargo hold.
Drop it to 10,000 feet.
I know how much these people mean to you.
So I will let you pick the first target.
I don't pick a target from a mile away.
I stand face to face and look 'em dead in the eye.
(CHUCKLES)
Okay.
The wife it is.
(BOTH GRUNTING)
Nice plane.
I'm gonna enjoy having this.
Hey, don't go gettin' any ideas.
You and planes don't have a good history.
No shit.
Okay, let's go, Scarface.
These assholes ain't gonna kill themselves.
Pull up surveillance right now.
(COMPUTER TRILLS)
Surprise.
You're supposed to be dead.

We have a security breach in the cargo hold.
Take care of it now.

Jesus, Mum.
You're supposed to avoid the nerves.
Oh, shut up.
Don't be such a baby.
Get to the pilot.
He's got the second key.
Wait for my signal.
Give Cipher my regards.
Did Toretto hold up his end of the deal?
MRS. SHAW:
He gave us this little thing here.
No, no, no.
Don't touch.
You can track Cipher with this, but you can't do this on your own.
There's gotta be two of ya.
Fine.
I've got contacts.
No, you're gonna take your brother.
- Oh, dear...
- Yes.
(ALL GRUNTING)
Toretto knows where he is.
He's got this thing.
It can see everything.
It's like...
It's called the Devil's Bum Hole or something.
It's called the God's Eye.
Yeah, well, whatever.
(GRUNTING)
There's no way I'm using Owen, all right?
He's a lost cause.
He's your brother, Decks.
He's my son.
He's our family.
And our family don't die in bloody cages. (CRYING)
How can you talk like that about Owen?
I can't believe you.
You've gone and upset me.
You've really upset your mother.

I just saved him.
And you just took your foot off the tiger's neck.

This is for your ears.

Then don't give 'em a target.
Everybody, get in front of us, line up, and we'll take the hit.

I need to switch cars right now!
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
- Roman, here comes the bad part.
- What?

Hang in there, guys.
We're almost to the lock.
It's easy for you to say when your ass ain't on fire.
All right, little man, this might be a little scary, but it's gonna be a lot of fun.

Who the hell cares?
He just saved our ass!
Good to be riding with you again, man.

Toretto just cleared the way for them.
Someone, give me something!
Torpedoes are ready.
Then launch them!

We're just going to let it get away?
Not if I know Dom.
You lose, Dom.
I destroyed two of your teams.
I killed your red-headed boyfriend.
And I put two killers on your untraceable plane.
You lost the minute you interrupted my honeymoon.
Now guess who I'm coming for.
Put a heatseeker on him now.
(SHOUTS) Now!

You have a lot to answer for, Cipher.
What you've put my family through.

There is only one flaw in your plan.
What's that?
Only one of us has a parachute.

I have so much to tell you.
Yeah, you do.
And you can start with that bitch.
Now, that's Dominic Toretto.
Hey, Dom!
I'm just throwin' it out there, we need to get up outta here 'cause there's all kinda nuclearism happening under this ice.
Relax.
Without the trigger chips, those nukes are harmless.
Okay.
So we good, then.
Let me go on and get my young selfie levels up.
You realize this is classified, right?
Not today.

Unbelievable.
All right, can we get up outta here, now?
I'm freezin'!
It's okay.
Don't worry.
He's gonna be here soon.
ROMAN:
I get it.
Y'all got a lot in common.
Computer hacks, God's Eye, geeks, nerd...
You know.
But we got a lot in common, too, right?
Like what?
We walk in the room and we're oozing' sex appeal.
Me and you, hip to hip, is a problem.
I'm askin' a real question right now.
Is it gonna be Revenge of the Nerds or The Dark Knight?
Huh?
To be honest, I like both of you.
(ROMAN AND TEJ EXCLAIMING)
But just before we get into all of that, let me ask you one question.
You can ask me anything.
Anything.
What's my last name?
When you guys figure it out, then, I guess you can let me know.
It's gonna be Parker.
That's all that really matters.
ROMAN:
Jones.
TEJ:
Mrs. Parker.
- Right?
- Hey, Mrs. Parker...
LETTY:
Hey.
Letty.
I wanted to thank you.
No need.
Well...
Cipher's still on the loose.
There's been some reports she's in Athens, but she won't be nuking any cities anytime soon.
Thanks to you guys.
So, I got you a party favor.
(MR. NOBODY LAUGHS) HOBBS:

Wow.
Daddy's stayin' home.

Nobody.
Keep in touch.
Ah.
Hang on a second.
This could be interesting.
(SIGHS) What made you think I'd do it?
Brotherhood.
I saw that look you gave Cipher, knew you wanted revenge.
Glad I did it.
I can't believe you went to see my mother.

All this fuss over you.

Elena, I promised to keep our son safe.
And now, he always will be.
I wanna introduce you to the most important person in my universe.
One who never gave up on me.
He's beautiful.

You've heard me say that you never turn your back on family, and I wanna thank you all for never turning your back on me.
You wanna meet them?
All right.
Everyone, meet Brian.

HOBBS:

Welcome to the family, Brian.
Okay, I guess it's my turn to say grace.
We thank you for giving us family.
We sit here in praise.
Thank you for giving us the strength...
Fixed Synced by bozxphd.
Enjoy The Flick.
- No way!
- Yeah.
This is the Cuban spirit.
Dom.
Dom.
You know I can't make a living without my car.
Not my problem, bro.
Dominic Toretto, I heard about you.
Welcome to my island.
Why you hooking' up my cousin's car?
He needed money, I gave it to him.
He can't pay, I take the car.
I just need a few more days.
"Few more days" wasn't part of the deal.
Come on.
You make a deal, you gotta live up to it.
You make a deal, you gonna live up to it.
"Gonna" live up to it?
Oh, so you're one of those types.
You take everyone's ride, and then ship it back to the States?
You watch your mouth.
Now you got a problem.
I'm gonna keep it about the cars.
You want a car, get it the right way.
How?
Race for it.
I already own it, bro.
Not that car.
Mine.
Dom, his car is the fastest car on the island.
Do you know what he has under that hood?
He knows it doesn't matter what's under a hood.
The only thing that matters is who's behind the wheel.
You think so?
I know so.
Then race his car.
And we ain't racing no quarter-mile, here.
We race the Cuban mile.
Done.
I appreciate what you're trying to do, but my car is the slowest car on the island.
Was.
Pull the seats, the doors, the battery...
If it ain't the motor, take it off.
Laughing gas?
Nah, Fed.
This is Cuban NOS.
You guys are crazy.
What are you doing?
Poor man's turbo.
Pull the vacuum line and hold on.
Old trick that Buster used to play, in case of emergencies.
You know that's way too much boost for that engine.
It's gonna be fast.
It's gonna be a bomb.
Only needs to go a mile.
Vámonos!
That car belongs in the trash, bro!
Where are they going?
I don't know.
Let's go!
Ghost him.
Sí.
Adiós, Toretto!
Okay, Buster.
Let's see if this works.
That's impossible.
Look out!
A deal's a deal.
You won my car.
And you earned my respect.
Keep your car.
Your respect is good enough for me.
Yo, cousin...
Sorry about your car.
Yours was too slow for a Toretto, anyway.
Your Impala?
Are you serious?
Look at that smile.
I love it when you smile.
You make me happy.
Mmm, I think this place makes you happy.
It's like it speaks to you.
You remember that guy, the racer and his dad?
The one with the boat engine under the hood?
Yeah!
Yes.
Of course.
I was looking at them, and I...
And I couldn't help but to imagine what you'd be like if you were a dad.
No, no, no!
I'm not pregnant.
Is that what you want?
It's not about what I want or what you want.
It's about why we haven't asked the question.
What?
You need a hand?
Yeah, I think I do.
Sounds like you're not getting any fuel.
Yeah?
Probably the shut-off solenoid.
Let's see if we can get some power to it.
What brings you to Cuba?
The same thing that brings everyone else to Cuba.
Culture, people, the beauty.
What brings you to Cuba?
Work.
Must be casual Friday.
How's that honeymoon going, Dom?
Your fuel relay is missing.
I know.
I love to play games.
I've beaten the best of 'em.
But I'm kind of in a rush, so if you've got something to say to me...
Oh, this is a very different game, that I can assure you.
This...
There's something much greater at work here.
This is fate.
I choose to make my own fate.
Not today.
Is this the road you take to your apartment every morning?
What else is different, Dom?
Was Santiago's closed?
Did you have to cross two blocks to go get your Cuban coffees?
What is it, black, no sugar?
Yeah.
I put a lot of work into getting you here today.
Well, now that I'm here, what do you want?
I want you to work for me.
Work for you?
Oh, I could've saved you a lot of time, then.
See, I don't work for anyone.
You can't walk away from this, Dom.
We're gonna have this conversation, one way or the other.
You see, that's the funny thing about fate.
It's cunning.
It can bring you beautiful things, and it can also bring you moments like this.
Oh, you're gonna want to work for me.
You're gonna betray your brothers, abandon your code, and shatter your family.
You see, your team is about to go up against the only thing they can't handle.
What's that?
You.
Oh, and, Dom, I wouldn't mention this to anyone.
They are gonna be hitting us with everything they got.
So we wanna engage with maximum speed.
Neutralize their shooters, and then move on to our objective.
There's two things I want you to keep in mind.
Number one, I chose you for this squad because you are the most fearsome warriors on the planet.
And number two, you go out there, you do your job, and you take 'em down.
Everyone.
And I mean everyone.
Mani's and pedi's at the mall later on today.
Huh?
Monarchs!
What?
I don't wanna play anymore.
All right, let's go, girls.
Let's go, let's go!
Final two minutes.
Quite the cheering section.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it's the moms.
They come out to support the kids.
Except there seem to be more moms than kids.
Way more moms.
Yeah.
It's a big soccer town.
Let's go, girls!
So, your intel was spot-on.
That Damocles 7 EMP weapon that went missing in the Gulf?
Arms dealers from the Liberation Front have it in Berlin.
Shit!
This thing can wipe out an entire electrical grid in a major city.
No lights, no power.
Instant Stone Age.
Chloe, Maya, you can't let her run by you like that.
Let's go, let's go!
Cross!
Agent Hobbs, this is a Class Four WMD.
Do you have any idea what's at stake here?
Yes, I know exactly what is at stake here, okay?
If the Pink Butterflies beat my Red Dragons, that means we lose the championship.
Which means I have 20 little girls who are crying, and that's not a good thing.
Which then means I have to spend a lot of time in ice-cream shops and a lot of time at Tay Tay concerts.
Tay Tay?
Taylor Swift.
Gotta be shittin' me.
Get it together, okay?
Let's go, girls!
We need you to do this.
It's a lot of lives at stake.
All right, but I need to be clear here.
The US government cannot sanction this operation in any way.
You're on your own.
Hey.
If this thing goes sideways, you don't just get burned.
You go to prison.
And there's nothing we can do to get you out.
Let me tell you something.
The only thing that I love more than saving lives is my daughter.
So, if you don't shut up with this government bullshit right now, and start showing some team spirit and respect for the Red Dragons,
I'm gonna have all 20 of them line up and kick you right in the tay-tay.
Go Dragons!
Say it again.
Go Dragons!
Attaboy.
Go Dragons.
Go Dragons.
I'm open.
She's open!
Go, go!
Yes!
That is my daughter right there.
Yes.
Yes, come here.
How did I do?
Awesome.
Nice job, kid.
Daddy's gotta go to work?
Uh, yeah.
Daddy's gotta go to work.
Now, you're gonna need to get a team you can trust.
Oh, I already got one.
Hey, Dom.
Hey, Hobbs.
I got a job in Berlin and I need a favor, brother.
No problem.
I'll grab the team and meet you in Berlin.
Thanks, man.
I'll see you soon.
You were only supposed to create a diversion, Roman.
That was a diversion!
How many of the damn explosives did you use?
I don't know, Tej.
All of it?
Wait, all of it?
Roman, Jesus Christ.
We got more of your fan club ahead.
They're still on us!
These guys are taking this personal.
Roman, we just blew up their facility and stole their EMP.
Other than your doctor's cold finger,
I'd say it's about as personal as it can get.
Phase Two!
Phase Two?
So you just gonna keep that to yourself?
What happened to Phase One?
What about that part?
Yeah.
Remember the airplane?
Everyone drove their cars out but you?
I told you, my engine seized up.
It's your balls that seized up.
Just follow my lead, okay?
And, Roman, whatever you do, don't think.
Huh?
Tej, drop it!
Bombs away.
Split, now!
Holy...
Great plan, Tej.
But just so you know, you missed some.
Oh, just wait for it.
Oh, shit!
I hate you, Tej!
Got your ass.
You good?
I'll see you when it's done.
All right, great job, team.
Let's break off and meet me at the safe house.
A hell of a job, brother.
When we get back to the base, the beer's on me.
You lost your goddamn mind, Toretto?
Toretto, you put hands on that thing, you're gonna have the whole world gunning for you, including me.
I don't know what you're doing, but you better think about this, Toretto.
It ain't too late to stop this.
It is now.
That sumbitch just crossed us.
What?
Wait a second, what are you talking about?
Dom took the EMP.
Bullshit.
Where are you?
It's too late for me.
Get outta here.
Saw that look in his eye, and I've seen that look before.
Dominic Toretto just went rogue.
All right, I got his phone records, y'all.
It's a whole bunch of calls to untraceable numbers.
Burner phones, right?
Nah, scrambler.
Same number, but they got some sort of micro-router to bury the signal path, which means Dom is clearly communicating with somebody that's above our pay grade.
Look, I don't know Dom as well as you, but if we just look at the facts,
Dom's been having highly encrypted conversations with some mysterious person.
He took out Hobbs.
He stole an EMP.
Now he's disappeared.
So, what are you saying?
Maybe we should consider the fact that Hobbs is right.
Dom did go rogue.
Letty.
Before you judge the man, remember, you're breathing right now because he saved your life.
You just gonna let her bump your shoulder like that?
I'm just saying, that was a little aggressive.
What you gonna do, email her?
Check.
Moment, will you, fellas?
Thank you.
Well, this is an exciting new look.
It's a little tight in the crotch, as always.
What boy-band bus did she fall out of?
It's my new junior associate.
He's working with me on this.
All yours.
Mr. Nobody and I have been given the authority to get you out of this.
All you have to do is agree to the terms and you're free.
What's training wheels talking about?
What terms?
Confess to your crimes in Berlin.
Treason, international espionage, massive destruction of civic property.
You do that, we close the case.
And?
And the DSS blacklists you.
Germany loves that.
Officially, you will be a criminal.
Wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You need to work on your delivery, all right?
Unofficially...
You're off the books.
You come work with me.
I'm not a criminal.
Luke, come on.
Labels.
There is no confession.
There are no backroom deals.
I got myself into this, I'm gonna get myself out of it.
You know that.
I do, and that's what I told him.
Well, there you have it.
Good luck in the courts, man.
What about your daughter?
You know, if you're not gonna do it for your country, at least do it for your kid.
Big mistake, kid.
Hold on.
Luke, Luke.
He's still working from the manual.
I mean, he doesn't even really know the rules.
Now, come on, give him a break.
Give me a break.
Luke.
Appreciate it.
It's good to see you, Nobody.
You, too.
Rule number one...
Know your audience.
I gave you your shot.
You shit the bed.
Now I'm gonna show you how to get this done.
You're dead, cop.
Dead!
I'm gonna slice some bacon off your back, pig.
Well, well, well...
Luke Hobbs behind bars.
Would you look at that.
The bent cop got his day.
You know, that color looks good on you.
Yeah, it'll look a whole hell of a lot better with your blood on it.
Yeah, good luck with that, Hercules.
Lawman gone bad, huh?
Such a cliché.
Oh, well, welcome to the club.
I wouldn't get that twisted, son.
We ain't in no club, we got nothing in common.
And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.
What, you bring a shovel, did you?
Because it's 38 feet of steel and concrete.
Or so I've been told.
Better get to digging.
Wanker.
Yeah.
Move.
Say that again.
If I say it again, it'll be to a corpse.
I'm gonna enjoy this.
Welcome back, Dom.
Nice job out there.
You excited about tonight?
You're going on this?
You're with me, Dom.
Showing me your shoe collection?
Yep.
A pair for every occasion.
You have enough guns in here to outfit a small army, huh?
Oh, this is just the tip of the iceberg.
You know what I like about you, Dom?
You're a genuine outlaw.
I mean, you're a man who lives by his own rules.
Which is surprising, because when I saw you in Cuba,
I heard about a guy who almost killed you with a motorcycle, and you let him keep his car?
Oh, that confused you?
Hmm.
'Course I could've taken his car.
But it's about something bigger.
This way...
I changed him.
That's not your responsibility.
But it's who I am.
Is it?
Let me ask you something, Dom.
What's the best thing in your life?
Family.
No, it's not.
Not if you're being honest.
It's the 10 seconds between start and finish, when you're not thinking about anything.
No family, no obligations.
Just you.
Being free.
I gotta tell you, this whole saving-the-world, Robin Hood nonsense you've been doing recently?
It's bullshit.
It's not you.
Be who you are.
Why live only a quarter mile at a time when you can live your whole life that way?
Is that it?
Is that all those bloated-out muscles will give ya?
All show and no go.
Oh, I got plenty of go.
You must've misplaced that when I kicked your arse up and down that office of yours.
Yeah.
Just like you Brits, rewriting history, huh?
All I know is, it wasn't me that was thrown out of a four-story window.
Jumped.
I jumped out of a four-story window, saving my partner's life.
'Cause where I'm from, we don't settle fights by throwing bombs.
Well, that's funny, because where I'm from, we don't need women to run to our rescue.
I mean, do you really believe you can stand in front of me and beat me in a straight-up, old-fashioned fist fight?
Let me tell you something.
Me and you, one-on-one, no one else around.
I will beat your ass like a Cherokee drum.
Maybe one day we'll find out.
Oh, you better hope that day never comes.
I said no, Mr. Nobody.
I'm not leaving this cell.
I'll get out my way.
The right way!
Hey!
Why's the door open?
Get back in your cell!
Relax.
It's just a malfunction.
- Get back!
- Just a malfunction.
Stop him!
Don't let him get away!
Hobbs!
I've been waiting a long time for this.
Keep waiting, bitch.
Rubber bullets.
Big mistake.
Well, that took longer than I expected.
- Two questions.
- Yeah.
My daughter?
With your sister.
Toretto?
It's interesting you ask.
This is my new base.
Welcome to nowhere.
It's a little sterile for you.
Listen, there's something I wanna talk to you about after.
Hey, listen, guys.
Thanks...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What?
Handcuffs?
What is this?
It's called abuse of power.
You told me to round them up.
I didn't tell you to hand...
Cut 'em loose.
Oh, man.
This is embarrassing.
I'm sorry, guys, really, I...
So, this is how you treat old friends?
Friends?
We don't even really know who the hell this guy is.
Doesn't matter who I am, Tej.
I'm, like, nobody, okay?
Nobody.
So, then, who is he?
Him?
He's nothing.
He's, like, less than me.
Clearly, we're getting nowhere with nobody.
I've been in here for four hours, and my ribs are showing.
I don't know about y'all, but I'm out.
I wouldn't recommend that.
What?
Well, thanks to your botched Berlin job, you all made Interpol's Top 10 Most Wanted list.
- Top 10.
- Mmm-hmm.
That's all right.
Well, not you, Roman.
What do you mean?
You just missed the cut.
You're number 11, so...
I'm...
I missed?
Yeah.
That's impossible!
What number did they come in at?
Six, eight, nine, ten.
She's 10?
Mmm-hmm.
That's impossible.
There's no way she's a 10.
Oh, she's definitely a 10.
How about we focus on someone who we're not gonna find on anybody's list.
We're awaiting hard confirmation, but I believe that's the cyber terrorist known as Cipher.
Wait, no.
Cipher's an organization.
Not a person.
Not according to our sources.
What does she want?
No one knows.
Cipher is like a digital act of God.
They...
Well, she can manipulate world systems from the shadows.
Anything that can be hacked is hers to play with.
And here's the kicker.
You'll never find her linked to any of it.
Her digital identity is scrubbed every few seconds, worldwide.
So, basically, she's the bogeyman.
Damn, she's one of the hottest bogeymans I've ever seen.
I mean, if y'all know her, tell her to get at your boy.
- What are you, 12?
- That was my shin, mother...
Let's just say, people are scared of the hacker group Anonymous.
But even Anonymous won't mess with her.
What the hell does any of this have to do with us?
Probably nothing, Letty, but I do find it interesting that, apparently, for some reason, she's now working with this guy.
He's already delivered a fully operational EMP into her hands.
Detonate that, they can turn any city in the world into a war zone.
So, then, what is it you're suggesting we do?
Maybe we find Dom, huh?
Well, first, let's catch him, and then figure out why he's turned.
So, y'all want us to track Dom.
Yeah, I know, Roman, it's kind of a big job.
It's impossible.
Which is why I'm bringing in an extra pair of hands.
Ah, my day just got a whole hell of a lot better.
Mr. Nobody, you wanna tell me why you just put me in a room with this tea-and-crumpets eating, criminal sumbitch?
What a big mouth on a small head, coming from Prisoner 6753.
Don't think we've forgotten everything that you've done.
We are not teaming up with this guy.
Let's get one thing clear.
I ain't on your team.
I don't care about you, your crew, or your little family.
I'm here for Cipher.
What are you gonna do, apply for a job?
Head Asshole?
You know, I think that tight T-shirt's cutting off the circulation to your brain.
You should get a bigger size.
Cipher came to me first.
Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.
When I said no, she went after my brother.
Ah, yes, brother Owen.
Who could forget him, huh?
Former hell-raiser and current guest at a nasty little black site prison.
Cipher corrupted him and left him for dead.
So, if I get a shot to take her down, believe me, Flex, I'm taking it.
You're taking my boot right up your ass, is what you're taking.
Guys, guys.
The fastest way to find Cipher is through Toretto.
Now, aside from myself, there's only two men in the world that have ever managed to actually track him down with any success.
And guess what.
They're both standing in front of me right now.
So, like it or not, you two are gonna work together.
You got that?
I'm gonna take that as a yes.
Am I the only one seeing this?
Oh, this ought to be good.
Use God's Eye.
We put our lives on the line, running around the world trying to figure this thing out.
It can find anybody, right?
Let's use it to find Dom.
Roman, that is a great idea.
Did you hear that?
"Great idea."
No, no, no, don't tune it out.
Huh?
Mr. Nobody, let's fire it up, huh?
Got him.
He's in London.
Yeah.
Wait.
We've got a second match in Hong Kong.
Beijing and Seoul.
And Tokyo.
And just about every other major city on the planet.
And so, God's Eye was where we started.
But Cipher's already created an evasion that masks their location by pinging random spots all over the globe, but it was a good thought, Roman.
So, she's made my program obsolete.
And that, Ramsey, is why you're here.
See, simple solutions aren't gonna cut it here, slick.
Why you look at me when you say that?
Wait a second.
Wait, wait.
Simple solutions might just cut it.
You see, in order for God's Eye to give off all these false pings, means they have to be using a FLEA relay.
Watch these two.
Which means it has a decaying sync randomizer.
Which we can reverse...
And track it back to the originating source and find Dom's true location.
I'm telling you, they got skills.
That was my idea.
That's what I was saying.
Remember in there?
All right, let's try this.
It's working.
Time you wanna check your manual and start organizing a force response.
Let's get a hold of our international assets...
He's still green.
Yeah, like fresh baby shit.
As soon as we have Toretto's location, I want to mobilize.
Let's get a hold of a better asshole.
- No one respects you...
- Cover.
Get away from me.
All right, they're not in China.
Or Russia.
Europe's clear.
But this one's not going away.
This is interesting.
Why?
Because that's here.
Did you all enjoy that?
Next-generation concussion grenade.
It scrambles your senses.
Don't worry, it'll wear off in an hour.
Probably.
Hello, Deckard.
Nice to see you again.
Look at this, body's not even cold, Dom.
Your family's already replacing you.
You chose the losing team.
I guess your brother is smarter than you.
Smart move, embedding God's Eye into the mainframe.
Irritating to make me have to come all the way down here to get it, but...
Let's go.
Dom!
You're gonna turn your back on family?
Just like that?
Let's go.
You okay?
That wasn't him.
I don't know what she's got on him, but that wasn't Dom.
Brian would know what to do.
No!
We can't bring Brian and Mia into this.
We agreed on that.
I know.
Back there, was that for her, for me, or you?
And was it even necessary?
Necessary?
Nothing is necessary.
Everything is a choice.
And I simply made one.
But so did you.
You could've stopped me, but you chose not to.
I wonder what Letty thought about that.
The problem with putting your foot on a tiger's neck is you can never let it up.
I think I need to remind you why you chose to be here.
Elena.
Dom?
I'm sorry.
You shouldn't have come.
Nothing could have kept me away.
Now she has the three of us.
Do you wanna see him?
See Papa?
See Papa.
Papa.
When I realized I was pregnant, you had just found out Letty was alive.
So I decided when Letty and you got back from your honeymoon,
I was going to tell you.
But then she took us before I had the chance.
His name?
I call him Marcos.
But that's his middle name.
I thought his father should give him his first name.
I'm sorry, Dom.
There's nothing to be sorry for.
Whatever happens, just save our son.
Your son.
Good visit?
I know.
I know what you're thinking.
I just let the guards go, so there's only two opponents in the room.
Rhodes has the gun, so you'll take him out first.
I know you.
And then you're thinking, Elena's a cop.
Maybe the two of you can fight your way out of here.
So much to think about.
Let me make it easier for you.
Do with it as you wish.
Have you heard of Choice Theory, Dom?
There is a bunch of axioms, but only two you really need to concern yourself with.
One, the only person's behavior we can control is our own.
And, two, the only thing we can truly give another person is information.
So, let me give you some.
You see these cameras in here?
The moment you make a move, highly-paid men with weapons will make their way into this room with one very specific instruction.
It's not to save me.
It's to kill your son.
Now, that's a lot of bullets, and it only takes one for you to lose everything.
So, I have to ask you, because I know family is so important to you.
Is that really a choice you want to make?
Because I'm ready if you are.
If I pull this trigger, and God knows I want to, if I killed everyone on this plane,
I still couldn't get in there.
'Cause of your two-man fail-safe system.
Since I'm alone,
I got no choice!
I didn't think so.
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch.
Bitch.
Don't, don't.
Sweet dreams.
Please!
Damn it.
She wiped it all.
Took God's Eye.
That was the one thing we could use to find them.
We lost everything.
What do you got, Princess?
Finding Toretto.
But I got a couple of minutes to spare, if you want me to send you to the hospital.
Again.
Yo, Rules.
First off, that's not my name.
Little Nobody.
Don't call me that.
Oh, that's definitely sticking.
Great.
Do me a favor and tell Your Majesty over there that we're gonna find Toretto.
We find Toretto together as a team.
And when this is all over with,
I'm happy to slap that whisker biscuit right off his face.
Wait a minute, guys, I think Deckard's actually onto something.
How do you think Dom and Cipher got into the country without us knowing?
Ghost flights.
I thought untraceable aircraft was all Internet conspiracy stuff.
It's not.
Satellites and radar grids all across the globe shift like an ocean.
They've got channels that open and close.
And theoretically, if you know the right people who know the right patterns...
You can fly right through the blind spots completely undetected.
So you know where Dom is headed?
Yeah.
New York.
You see there, Luke?
You guys are gonna get along just great.
Which proves rule number two, you never lose everything.
Fire up the chopper.
Well, guys, have a ball in the Big Apple.
And why are we traveling like this again?
Because Dom took God's Eye, so we need to stay off the grid.
But like this?
Look here, man.
Before I throw up in my mouth, let me ask you, what are we doing here?
That's a good question, Roman.
Let me show you.
Welcome to our new base of operations.
No, seriously.
What is this place?
This is heaven.
It's the agency garage.
They call it the Toy Shop.
This is where we house every vehicle seized from drug dealers on the East Coast.
Now, Mr. Nobody said that if we're gonna have a chance at catching Dom,
we're gonna have to be damn fast.
Figured this would help.
We got a tank.
750 horsepower, 6.6 liter, V8 Duramax engine with an M153 CROWS remotely operated weapon station on top.
You didn't get this from drug dealers.
No.
No, that, uh, the United States Army lent me.
See, the Army's developing machines like this that soldiers can drive from a mile away, so they can stay safe and alive.
But, luckily, there's a backup driver's seat for those of us that like to get more "hands on."
I'm sitting here wondering this whole time, will this thing fit in valet at Cheesecake Factory?
No one is getting "hands on."
She doesn't go on city streets.
Wow.
I'm in love.
Again, no, no.
That's a million-dollar show car.
The point is to not draw attention.
It's reverse psychology.
Dom would never see it coming.
It's neon orange.
The International Space Station would see it coming.
Go choose anything less conspicuous.
No, no, no.
Calipers are my...
This is ridiculous.
Not happening.
Hey, my man, you can put that down right there.
This is a gift, a real gift.
I know what you're doing.
I like your beard.
You're Blanta.
Black Santa?
No, I'm serious.
Put it down right there.
What are you doing?
Engine's misfiring.
I gotta check it out.
No, that's not part of the plan, Dom.
Clearly.
But unless you want the engine to seize on the job...
You have five minutes.
Five minutes.
I want another visual.
I got an ATM.
I don't like this.
I want to see Toretto.
There are no more cameras.
Then find something!
Punch in on something reflective.
A car mirror, anything.
Do you know who I am?
It's why I'm here.
Do you know what I'm capable of?
It's why I'm here.
I'll give you until I finish me cuppa.
And I'm fucking thirsty.
I've got limited time, so I won't take up too much of yours.
Oh, no.
No, you've already taken everything I have of value, Mr. Toretto.
What more could you possibly want?
To give you something back.
Talk to me.
Something's not right here.
First time I saw my son was behind a bulletproof glass.
When he reached for me, I couldn't hold him.
It's the worst pain I ever felt.
I know you know exactly how that feels.
Maybe we could change that.
Now, why do I think you're about to suggest something really dodgy, Mr. Toretto?
It's why I'm here.
Jesus, punch in on something.
I'm not liking this.
Something's not right.
- Rhodes, you close?
- Yeah.
Go.
The delivery truck's moving.
I know.
"Captain Deckard Shaw
"distinguished himself by acts of gallantry
"at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.
"His bold actions saved the lives of hostages and his teammates.
"Recommendation:
Victoria Cross."
Highest honor the British government has ever given to a traitor.
Something about this whole thing that just doesn't add up to me.
Well, that would be the same kind of funny math that says a DSS agent who has a Silver Star for valor stole an EMP.
Sound familiar, huh?
You want to give me a hand?
On three?
Yeah.
One, two, three.
You know what, Twinkle Toes?
In another life, I bet me and you could've done some serious damage.
Yeah, we could've.
Yeah.
Shame I'm gonna have to bounce your head off the fender when this is all over.
Ah, well, with all due respect, Captain, when this whole thing is over, we're gonna find a location, and I'm gonna knock your teeth so far down your throat, you're gonna stick a toothbrush right up your ass to brush them.
Give me God's Eye.
God's Eye, active.
Good.
Let's find us a Russian.
I spy with my little eye, a Minister of Defense.
Upload those coordinates to Dom's nav.
Copy that.
He's in the third car.
It's a Guard Class limousine.
Where's my team?
Where's his team?
There's no sign of them yet.
They're off the grid.
They're probably just bunkered down somewhere.
We're closing in on 'em.
You guys ready?
One thing I can guarantee, Dom, no one's ready for this.
I want every chip with a zero-day exploit in a two-mile radius around that motorcade now.
There's over a thousand of them.
Hack 'em all.
It's zombie time.
I'd buckle up if I were you.
Hmm?
What are you doing?
Ah!
Safety sensors overridden.
Thank you.
Whoa.
Hey!
Target the motorcade.
And here they come.
Ouch.
Police escort down.
Take out the lead and follow cars.
Two more down.
They're still under warranty.
We got an army of cars driving themselves!
Send backup, send SWAT!
I don't care if you send the goddamn Boy Scouts, just send 'em some help!
Now, that's Dom.
The motorcade just turned on Seventh.
Perfect.
Make it rain.
Ah!
Target immobilized.
You're up, Dom.
Give me the case.
Good work, Dom.
Meet you at the pickup.
I think I know where my team's at.
Where?
Right in front of me.
This is on you.
Get out of there, Dom.
Guys, I know why Dom's here.
Police scanners are saying he stole a nuclear football.
It's over, Toretto.
Get your ass outta the car now.
So, that's how you wanna play this?
Let's play.
Don't do this, Dom.
He's going for it!
What are you doing?
It's a trap!
Damn it!
Now I know what it feels like to be every cop ever chasing us!
I'm gonna get a little closer.
I'm gonna PIT him.
Oh, so, you just gonna PIT Dom?
Little Nobody has clearly lost his little mind.
I'm on him.
Easy.
Work together.
Wait, wait, wait!
Oh, sh...
I'll take the shortcut!
Look out!
Watch those people!
Big Sexy coming' through!
Not this time, Dom.
Watch the drag or the line will snap!
Stretch him out!
Hold him!
He's gotta have about 2,000 horsepower in that thing.
Try 3,000!
Try five.
Get out of there.
I'm working on it.
Stop working on it and do it.
No, no, no, this my Bentley!
No!
No!
Get that case and run.
Move.
They thought this was gonna be a street fight.
What are you waiting for, Toretto?
No!
Letty, stop!
What are you gonna do?
I don't know why you're doing this, but I know one thing.
You love me.
And you are not gonna shoot me.
You should've given him the case, 'cause I won't chase you.
Okay.
I will just take it from a dead girl.
You willing to die for it?
Let's go, then.
Anything?
They're gone.
And DOD confirmed it was a nuclear football.
He's got an EMP and nuclear launch codes.
I don't know what it is, but they're building towards something.
Deckard?
He didn't make it.
I'm disappointed in you, Dom.
When push came to shove, you were gonna let Letty just walk away with the codes.
You got the codes!
Rhodes got the codes.
You made the choice to let her go.
And now I have to make one of my own.
They are adorable little things, aren't they?
God, I hope I don't hurt him.
Look, psychotic, I did exactly what you asked me to do.
Don't do this.
This is your doing.
My doing?
Da-dada.
Dada.
Da-da.
Please don't hurt him, I'm begging you.
I don't want you to beg.
I want you to learn.
Learn what?
I understand why you did what you did.
I really do.
Da-da.
But it was the wrong choice.
This is the consequence of that.
No!
No!
No!
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait.
Save your son!
No!
Can you pull up the footage from the guy in the alley?
Traffic cams.
I got you.
I knew it.
I recognize that guy.
That's Connor Rhodes.
I met him when I was working with Shaw's brother.
He wanted us to get the Nightshade device for him.
Connor Rhodes.
He's also linked to somebody I'd quite like to forget.
It's Mose Jakande.
Warlord who tried to get God's Eye.
Which means that's twice that Dom has messed up Cipher's business.
Everything you're feeling right now, this rage, a sense of loss, it's not real.
It's a survival instinct wired deep into our brains to ensure continuation of the species.
When early man would visit a watering hole, if they didn't watch their child, and it got snatched by a crocodile,
our brains would create a painful but instructional memory, so it would never happen again.
This idea of "family" that is so core with you, that rules your world,
it's a biological lie.
You don't have to accept it.
I don't.
Did you really think you could destroy two of my teams without any repercussions?
I wouldn't have even looked your way if you hadn't done that.
You didn't even know you had a kid.
You can thank me for that and start doing the job I'm asking you to do.
Help you start a war.
Is that what you think I want?
That's so limited.
I didn't take that football to start a war any more than I took your son to start a family.
Taking your son got me the codes.
The codes will get me the nukes and the nukes will get me what I want today, tomorrow, and every day after that.
And what's that?
Accountability.
The second I fire off one of those nukes,
I put the superpowers of this world on notice that, when they cross the line,
I'm gonna be there to hold them responsible.
Because the truth is, Dom, to the world out there,
I am the crocodile at the watering hole.
We've got one last job to do.
Cipher.
If I were you, I'd kiss my son.
Because whether you value it or not, all of this, your plane, your security, and you,
are still on this earth because of him.
The problem we've had with tracking Cipher is there's nothing to trace.
But now, we have Rhodes' information.
And we're getting snapshots of his data before it's scrubbed off the net.
That looks like somebody's bank account, so why don't we just go ahead...
It's a longitude.
Given the fact that Dom hit a Russian motorcade, it's safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead and bring up the map.
Good.
Let's start here and run the possibilities.
Yalta, Poltava...
It's like they just threw letters together.
Kronyurt.
It's "Vladovin."
What are you doing here?
What?
Told you I was gonna check in on you from time to time to see how you were doin'.
By the way, not so hot.
But there's nothing in Vladovin.
It's just ice.
That's funny.
Could've sworn there was a secret Russian naval base where they retrofitted Cold War submarines.
Well, technically, it's not Russian anymore.
The base was taken over by a terror group of military separatists about a month ago, and the Russians haven't taken it back yet, so there is a little window of opportunity here.
Russian submarines.
Nuclear football.
It sounds like everything we do, our legs gonna be blown off.
It sounds like you still number 11 on the list.
It sounds like you've changed since your little punk-ass facial hairs done came in.
Guys, guys.
Hey, we gotta call this in.
All the way up the chain.
That's good thinking, champ, except unfortunately, the Russian Minister of Defense got himself involved in a little incident on US territory, and the two governments aren't talking to each other for a while.
By the time they do, it'll be too late.
So, any other suggestions?
Yeah.
I got one.
How about we just stop them ourselves?
You're talking about a Russian military base.
Separatist.
Whatever.
It's suicide.
It's stopping World War III.
What's it gonna be, rook?
You gonna close your eyes on this one, too?
Pray that the apocalypse doesn't come knocking on your mama's front door?
Or, are you gonna saddle up, be a man, and save the entire goddamn world?
You know, I think I figured it out.
What's that?
Rule number three.
Which is?
There are no rules.
What'd I tell you, Luke?
I knew he'd get it in three.
Aerial transport leaves in an hour.
Take whatever vehicle you want.
All bets are off.
All bets are off?
Bets are off?
Do svidanya!
Letty, I don't like telling you this one bit.
But the game's changed.
Before, we were just trying to catch Dom, but now, after all this,
I want you to know, if I have to,
I'm gonna put him down.
Then you might have to take us both down.
I'm freezing, man.
This ain't for me.
I come from a different kind of lifestyle, brah.
Ladies know me.
They know where I'm at with it.
I tried to take a piss, I didn't even recognize myself.
Man, that's entirely too much information.
I'm just sayin'.
Well, one thing's for sure.
Dom's gotta be either working with them or making a trade, because no one would be this insane to hit this place without a damn army.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Speak of the devil.
All right, Dom, you're one step closer to that family reunion.
400 meters to base.
Prep the EMP.
Let's take these defenses down.
Gates are open.
Let's get this party started.
EMP is recharging.
How long?
Sixty seconds.
All right, Dom, you have one pulse left in that EMP.
That sub is heavily insulated.
You're gonna need to be right underneath it for this thing to work.
Come on.
Yes!
Two birds with one stone.
We've got control of the sub.
Dom, we are good.
Head over to the rendezvous.
Okay, Matty, let's take this baby for a spin.
Damn!
I think Cipher just rebooted that sub to slave its command system.
What the hell is he talking about?
In layman's terms, she just carjacked a submarine.
We can't let it get away.
There's the control room.
If you can get me into that wheelhouse,
I can tap the network and counter-hack Cipher.
Keep it from lowering into the water.
No, what we need to do is get me on that sub.
I find the weapons room and I can pull the launch chip before she can fire any of those nukes.
That is too crazy.
What you're saying is too dangerous.
We'll do both.
Knock, knock.
Five vehicles just breached the base.
They just don't give up, do they?
All right, let's haul ass, team.
Double time, double time!
Letty, let's roll!
Go!
Go, go, go!
Change of plans, Dom.
I'm sending you new coordinates.
Head there immediately.
I'm done.
I want my son.
I'll tell you when you're done.
Your team is in play.
Now, meet Rhodes and follow my instruction.
I've got you covered!
Go!
Move, move!
Get outta here!
Go, go, go!
Okay.
How do you like this?
Remote link has been severed.
I'll take care of this.
Hi, Ramsey.
She's regained control.
Damn it.
She's good.
They're entering the weapons room.
Oh, that's cute.
Pull!
Pull!
Roman, Roman!
We gotta find the chip, go!
Oh, she's slick.
Gonna have to do better than that, though.
Okay, now you're starting to piss me off.
Ramsey, how much time we talkin' here?
You're smart, but not smart enough.
She's locked me out.
Tej, I can't stop her.
You're gonna have to pull that chip.
I can't!
This thing's gone into attack mode!
The door's not gonna open until you pull the chip!
Tej, we got no idea what the hell we're looking for.
I got it!
What in the hell are you guys doin'?
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me, okay?
It'll be labeled "Guidance Go."
Guidance Go, Guidance Go...
Okay, I got somethin'.
What?
It says...
Do you understand that?
Wow.
Nasty.
Hmm.
Quite a show.
We're arming the nuke.
Nuke's going hot!
She's tryin' to fire this thing!
Roger that.
We're moving out.
Disable the nukes!
Roman, what are you seeing?
Come on, talk to me.
I don't see shit.
I'm holding on!
And we have a countdown.
What the hell is goin' on, man?
We're about to launch a nuclear missile, is what the hell is goin' on!
Pull the damn chip!
Countdown, countdown!
Look for a countdown!
What countdown?
The missiles need to activate to launch.
The countdown timer won't be in Russian.
The countdown...
Let's show the world what we've got.
No, no, no!
Don't press that!
I got it.
Something's wrong.
It won't launch.
Get that sub outta there.
Now!
Move your ass, Roman!
You all right?
There's nothing all right about any of this!
Let's go!
What about the missiles?
We got the chip.
No nukes for her.
Hell, yeah.
Let's roll.
Guys, we got company.
A lot of company!
All right, team, here's the plan.
There's a sea lock at the opening of the bay.
We get there first and close it, we can stop the submarine from escaping into open water and disappearing forever.
I've got the location.
It's 10 miles southwest.
Ten miles?
We're not gonna make it ten seconds!
Ah!
No, no, no!
This is not good!
What's the matter, Roman?
Forgot your snow tires?
Whoa!
You lovin' that Lambo now?
Whoa!
Ah!
All right, everyone.
We'll deal with that launch chip later.
Right now, I want that sub in deep water where no one can find it.
Find me the fastest route out of that bay.
Copy that.
Why are they shootin' at me?
Maybe 'cause you're in an orange Lamborghini, I don't know.
Shut up, Tej!
Dom...
Do you really wanna put that car in gear?
Do it.
Huh?
I didn't think so.
They're heading for the sea lock.
They're trying to trap the sub in the bay.
I should have taken care of this a long time ago.
Rhodes, take his team out.
I'm on it.
Roman, get in front of me!
Okay, y'all wanna play rough?
Now it's my turn.
Yeah, baby!
Guys, we got snowmobiles on the right.
They're gonna flank us!
No, they ain't!
Oh, shit!
Tej!
Roman, hold tight, I'm on the way!
I don't wanna go swimmin'!
No!
Really, Tej?
Oh, no, no, no!
Oh, shit!
Roman, grab your door!
Tej!
Grab the door, Roman!
It's so cold!
Shit!
Oh, shit!
Whoa!
Whoo!
Yeah!
What is going on?
Roman, hang on!
Tej!
Get me off of this thing!
Tej!
Come on!
Argh!
All right.
I've had enough of this shit!
Number 11, my ass!
Yo, shrinkage!
We got a sub to catch.
Get in!
What?
Depressurization alert in the cargo hold.
Drop it to 10,000 feet.
I know how much these people mean to you.
So I will let you pick the first target.
I don't pick a target from a mile away.
I stand face to face and look 'em dead in the eye.
Okay.
The wife it is.
Nice plane.
I'm gonna enjoy having this.
Hey, don't go gettin' any ideas.
You and planes don't have a good history.
No shit.
Okay, let's go, Scarface.
These assholes ain't gonna kill themselves.
Pull up surveillance right now.
Surprise.
You're supposed to be dead.
We have a security breach in the cargo hold.
Take care of it now.
Jesus, Mum.
You're supposed to avoid the nerves.
Oh, shut up.
Don't be such a baby.
Get to the pilot.
He's got the second key.
Wait for my signal.
Give Cipher my regards.
Did Toretto hold up his end of the deal?
He gave us this little thing here.
No, no, no.
Don't touch.
You can track Cipher with this, but you can't do this on your own.
There's gotta be two of ya.
Fine.
I've got contacts.
No, you're gonna take your brother.
Oh, dear...
Yes.
Toretto knows where he is.
He's got this thing.
It can see everything.
It's like...
It's called the Devil's Bum Hole or something.
It's called the God's Eye.
Yeah, well, whatever.
There's no way I'm using Owen, all right?
He's a lost cause.
He's your brother, Decks.
He's my son.
He's our family.
And our family don't die in bloody cages.
How can you talk like that about Owen?
I can't believe you.
You've gone and upset me.
You've really upset your mother.
Call yourself a brother?
You're...
Look, come here...
Mum.
Okay, okay.
Every time.
Owen.
In position.
Go.
I'm in.
I've got the package, Toretto.
All 12 pounds of him.
Ah.
Dada.
Dada.
You made me miss my shot.
What you think you're doing?
Looking at you dead in the eye.
That was for Elena.
Rhodes.
He's no longer with us.
Rhodes picked the wrong target.
Congratulations, Dom.
You just killed your son.
You're wrong.
I just saved him.
And you just took your foot off the tiger's neck.
All right, governor, it's gonna get noisy.
