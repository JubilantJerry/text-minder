Excuse me, Spaulding.
I'm Spaulding.
You're Chandler.
Let's have no more of this.
Alright.
- Bad enough being Spaulding.
- Tell me, Captain Spaulding...
Spaulding is the right name?
- Right.
I'm Chand...
No, I'm Spauld...
Show me the program.
For all he knows, I might be coming next week.
Captain Spaulding, you're quite a traveler.
How about South America?
I'm going there soon.
Where exactly?
- Uruguay.
You go your-a-way, I'll go mine.
Let's change the subject.
Take the foreign situation.
Take Abyssinia.
And I'll take a hot butterscotch sundae on rye.
Let's see what the boys in the back room are up to.
Let's see how yours compares with the original.
- Alright.
No difference!
- Look closer.
Maybe you'll find it's better.
You seen my partner?
- No.
Oh, Mr. Raviola!
Ravelli.
Ravelli.
- Oh, Mr. Ravelli.
Would you do something for me?
I'd do anything for you.
What do ya want?
You see that painting?
- You mean this piksh?
Take it out of the frame and put this one in its place.
You want I should take this one down and put this one upstairs?
- Yes.
You want I should steal?
- No.
It's not stealing.
Then I couldn't do it.
- Oh, Mr. Raviola!
Hey, get up.
Come here.
That's all you do.
Chase the women.
Oh, stop.
Everybody plays cards, but they don't ask us.
We just wasting our time.
We've been here all day.
How much we make?
Nothing.
Soon we go to the old ladies' home.
How do you like that?
No, that's no good.
These people here got money.
We gotta find someone to play with us.
I'd play anything.
Poker, pinochle...
- Signor Ravelli,
I want to talk to you about the music.
What's wrong with you?
It would be nice...
Go away from me!
What is this?
Hello, Professor.
What's the matter with his feet?
We play all kinds of games.
Blackjack, soccer...
One, two, three...
Why don't you leave him alone?
Now that this game is over, how about some bridge?
You play bridge?
- A little.
- What do you play for?
Just for small stakes.
- And french-fried potatoes?
Set it up right over there, Hives.
- Very good, madam.
What is he up to?
Look at this.
Take it away, Hives.
- Extraordinary.
How do you want to play?
Honest?
- I hope so.
You put that right away.
It's your own fault.
We'll cut for partners.
- No, I only play if he's my partner.
It's against the rules.
We have to cut for partners.
Alright, we cut for partners.
I got ace of spades.
He's got ace of spades.
Coincidences!
Two aces of spades?
- Yeah, he's got thousands of them.
He has the choice of seat then.
- You have the choice of seat.
Not on her lap.
- Sit down.
What's the matter with him?
- He thought it was contact bridge.
Just a moment.
Shuffle the cards.
- You gotta scrumble them up.
Just a moment.
I'd like to cut them.
That's a winner.
Your bid, partner.
You pass?
Misdeal.
You pass?
I bid one spade.
I pass.
- Three spades.
Four spades.
One club.
- I don't understand this bidding.
You don't have to.
You bid four spades, eh?
I haven't a spade in my hand.
- Alright.
We double.
Something's wrong here.
Let's do over the bidding.
Oh, she want to bid again.
He bids one.
One?
One what?
- That's alright.
You'll find out.
But we have to know what he's bidding.
- Later.
Now I bid two.
Two what?
- Two of the same he bids.
Now the bidding's over.
That's enough.
It's your lead.
You can't lead that.
- Why not?
We can't take it.
- What should I lead?
He'll show you.
Ace of spades.
That's -a very good.
Three of spades.
Four of spades.
You trump it?
You call that finesse.
No spades, partner.
No spades.
Ace of hearts.
Ace of clubs.
Dummy leads.
The dummy leads.
I'm not the dummy.
- Well, you could be.
Ace of diamonds.
Hundred aces, eh?
Two hundred?
That's better.
Ace of hearts.
Atta boy.
Make a big slam.
Make a big, big slam.
Ace of spades.
Ace of spades.
That's a good guy.
Plays a good game.
Ace of spades.
Plays a fine game.
Ace of spades.
- I refuse to play any longer.
You're nothing but two cardsharps.
- My shoes are gone.
Graciousness.
He has your slippers.
Come along.
Hey, you take-a the ladies' shoes?
Quiet!
Hide.
Somebody's coming.
Alright, I make a mistake.
Get up, come on.
Come on.
Hurry up.
You know what we do?
We hang that picture upstairs, for the lady.
Don't touch.
You got everything ready?
Shovel, axe, dynamite, pineapples?
Where's the flash?
Flash, flash.
That's no the flash.
That's a fish!
I don't want the fish.
Flash!
Stop it.
You crazy.
When you go out at night, you gotta have the flash.
That's no flash.
That's a flisk.
Flash.
When you wanna see somebody, you gotta have the flash.
That's a flush.
What I gonna do with the flush?
That's a flitz.
What I gonna do with flitz?
What do ya got?
That's a flutz.
All you got is a fish and a flutz and a flitz and a flutz...
Stop this.
Where's the flash?
Look, when everything's light and you wanna make 'em dark.
What ya do?
Hey, you crazy.
I want no blackjack.
My mistake.
When everything's dark and you wanna make 'em light.
Yeah, that's a flash.
That's a flash.
Hey, that's good, alright.
The storm put the lights out.
Nobody can see what we do.
Where's the flash?
Where's the flash?
I no want the fish.
Flash.
No, no flutz.
What's the matter with you?
Flash.
Before the people are coming.
What's a matter?
You lose it?
You gotta find it.
Look for it.
Alright, never mind.
We'll work without it.
Hide!
Hide!
Somebody's coming.
Hide.
Quiet, quiet.
Shut up.
Keep quiet.
I know where you are.
It's alright.
Oh, Captain Spaulding, where are you?
- Yeah?
Oh, Captain...
- What's the trouble?
The lights have gone out.
You can't see your hand before your face.
It wouldn't be very pleasant, anyway.
Well, I'm going to take a nap.
Leave me a call for three o'clock.
Make it three-thirty.
The service here is excellent.
Pardon me, did you lose a fish?
- What?
Somebody lost it.
Will you have it fried for me?
Did you hear that?
Somebody's over there.
I say somebody's over there.
- Nonsense.
The house is settling.
Anybody over there?
- I don't see anybody.
There you are.
If anybody was there, he'd see him, wouldn't I?
What is it, Captain?
What is it?
You know what I think?
I think you got roaches.
You got roaches alright.
And the biggest one has asthma.
Horrible!
Come on, Captain.
This can't be the library.
This must be the operating room.
We get the picture and we don't make a sound.
Somebody turned on the lights.
Alright, we get the picture and don't make one sound.
What do you want?
Oh, the fish.
Go on.
That's some storm, eh?
A regular tornado.
Let's go this way.
I think it's a shortcut.
Come on, let's go.
California.
Before we start the musical program,
Captain Spaulding will tell us about his trip to Africa.
Captain Spaulding.
- Me?
Friends, I'm going to tell you of that great, mysterious, wonderful Africa.
Africa is God's country, and he can have it.
We left New York drunk and early on the morning of February 2.
After 15 days on the water and 6 on the boat, we reached Africa.
We proceeded 300 miles inland, where I shot a polar bear.
This bear was 6' 7" in its stockinged feet, with shoes on.
- Just a moment.
I always thought polar bears lived in the frozen north.
You did?
This one was anemic and couldn't stand the cold.
He was a rich bear and could afford the trip.
You take care of your animals, and I'll take care of mine.
Frozen north, my eye!
From our arrival, we led an active life.
The first morning saw us up at 6, breakfasted and back in bed at 7.
This went on for 3 months.
We got so we were able to be in bed by 6:30.
One morning I was smoking some meat...
Smoking some meat?
- Yes, there was no cigar store.
I was sitting in front of the cabin, when I bagged 6 tigers.
Captain.
Did you catch 6 tigers?
I begged them to go away, but they hung around all day.
They were the most persistent tigers I've ever seen.
The principal animals in Africa are moose, elks and Knights of Pythias.
You all know what a moose is.
The first day I shot two bucks.
As I say, you all know what a moose is.
A moose eats cheese and is chased by cats.
The elks live in the hills, and hold their convention in the spring.
It's interesting when they come to the waterhole.
Boy, do they run when they see it's only a waterhole.
What they're looking for is an alco-hole.
One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas.
How he got in them, I don't know.
We tried to remove the tusks.
That's not so easy to say, tusks.
Oh, simple.
Tusks.
My name is Spaulding.
I've always wanted to meet you.
As I say, we tried to remove the tusks, but we couldn't budge them.
In Alabama, the tusks are looser.
But that's entirely ir-elephant.
We took pictures of the native girls, but they weren't developed.
But we're going back in a couple of weeks...
Very enlightening.
- Hooray for Captain Spaulding.
Three cheers!
Three cheers for Captain Spaulding!
Three cheers...
- No one asked for the chairs.
Put them back.
Now get along.
Go on, go on!
And now, friends, Signor Ravelli will oblige us at the piano.
His first selection is "Somewhere My Love Lies Sleeping"
with a male chorus.
Say, if you get near a song, play it.
I can't think of the finish.
That's strange.
I can't think of anything else.
You know what?
I think I went past it.
If you come around again, jump off.
I once kept this up for three days.
You wouldn't consider hush money, would you?
I can't get 'em now.
I've gotta wait for inspiration.
- It's about time.
Play the song about Montreal.
- Montreal?
"I'm A Dreamer, Montreal."
Don't know it.
I'll play one of my own compositions, by Victor Herbert.
Make it short.
He plays them both well.
Your team scored that time.
And the old blue one.
Why do you push?
- They may exterminate each other.
The best thing for either of them.
That one's for old Purdue.
I was afraid of that.
I thought I had the finish.
- I wish you did.
Yours.
Play the song about the Irish chiropodist.
"My Fate Is In Your Hands".
Is there a horse in the house?
They got everything else here.
And now, Mrs. Rittenrotten...
Rittenhouse.
- Yes, a slight error.
I have a surprise for you.
The man is here for the piano.
- Oh, Captain!
When I departed from the natives in Africa, they gave me a gift.
And this I give to you, at a low fare.
- How wonderful.
Don't be too hasty...
- I can't wait...
It was all done with the white of an egg.
What is it, Captain?
What is it?
It's a hope chest for a guinea pig.
This magnificent chest...
No, this magnificent chest
I present to you with my compliments.
- This leaves me speechless.
See that you remain that way.
- And now, ladies and gentlemen...
Step outside and say that.
Mrs. Rittenhouse has perhaps a greater surprise for us in the library.
This way, Captain.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, how do you pay Hives?
By the week or by the pound?
And now it is my privilege to reveal the masterpiece of François Jacques DuBois Gilbert Beaugard.
No trains will be sold after the magazines leave the depot.
"After the Hunt."
There!
I said you were a great artist.
Shall we spill the beans?
- Wait.
Something might happen.
We'd all enjoy a few words from Mr. Chandler, who will tell us something of Beaugard's life and work.
And keep it clean!
Mr. Chandler!
My friends, you are all familiar with Beaugard.
This is perhaps his masterpiece.
In it he has achieved a greatness in the handling of color and line.
Now you will see here...
Wait!
This is not my picture.
This is a rank imitation.
What do you mean?
- See for yourself.
You are right.
It's not the Beaugard.
- Certainly not.
A dog is missing.
Captain Spaulding, what shall I do?
- Call the dog-catchers at once.
They've taken the original.
- I'll throw some light on this.
Anyone have a match?
- What happened?
Hives, where are you?
Turn on the lights.
Did you lose that fish again?
- I'm so worried.
Good heavens.
That one is gone, too.
- Oh, this is awful.
The crooks are escaping.
Follow me, men.
No, just the women!
Right this way.
They went out here.
Oh, the excitement.
I never saw anything so funny before.
This is great.
And there goes her old party.
Wasn't it funny?
- Oh, v-v-v-very.
You're not afraid, are you?
- Oh no.
Not at all.
But they were talking about the police and I don't want them suspecting me.
They won't suspect you.
- Oh yes!
The last time they suspected me, I got four years.
- Hives!
You give me the painting, and I'll take care of it.
- Good.
Good heavens.
It's gone.
- Gone?
- I left it in there.
There must be thieves at this party.
If I'd known that, I never would have come.
Wait!
That professor!
- The Professor!
I see!
That's the culprit.
We've got to get that picture away from him.
Might I suggest this?
Very satisfactory in these cases.
A few drops on a handkerchief and the Professor is out.
You're sure it'll work?
- Absolutely.
You want to try some?
No thanks, Hives.
Let's find the Professor.
How did the thieves get away?
And who was it?
Lucky that we switched it.
Imagine them getting the original.
Oh?
It would have been okay had they taken mine?
I didn't mean that.
But what would Mother do?
It's worth $100,000.
How could she have replaced it?
Oh, I understand.
Isn't it exciting?
Just think, the thief was in the room with us.
Isn't it romantic?
All the boys I've known used to say I was made of stone.
I would always leave them alone in despair.
I've been on the pan, I've been called an electric fan, told I'm even much colder than Frigidaire.
I began to wonder if I was all wrong.
I thought so till you came along.
Tell me, dear, why am I so romantic?
When you're near, why am I so romantic?
What a grand feeling, when your lips meet mine.
That certain something comes stealing up and down my spine.
I don't know what it is you've done to me.
You don't know half of the good you do me.
Other boys bore me, they just leave me blue.
Oh, why am I so romantic with you?
Tell me, dear, why am I so romantic?
When you're near, why am I so romantic?
What a grand feeling, when your lips touch mine.
That certain something comes stealing up and down my spine.
When we touch, close in your arms you hold me.
I forget all that my mother told me.
Other girls bore me, they just leave me blue.
But why am I so romantic with you?
Oh, Signor Ravelli!
I've been looking for you all morning.
I was busy all morning.
- You've got to return that painting.
Painting?
What painting?
The painting you changed last night.
You mean the piksh?
- Yes.
First you want it upstairs, then downstairs.
Make up your mind.
I do thank you.
But you've got to return it before the police come.
The police are coming?
- Yes.
- I give it you.
You put it back.
Where's the piksh?
- What do you mean?
I put 'em in here.
It's gone.
You take 'em?
- Me?
No, I know.
Abie the fish peddler.
Did Mother invite a fish peddler here?
I don't know, but he's here.
Come on, we find him.
Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Jamison.
How is Captain Spaulding?
He didn't sleep a wink.
He went horseback riding last night.
I'm sorry.
We've all been pretty upset.
Good morning, Captain.
Did you enjoy your ride?
What are you looking for?
- I lost my horse.
He slipped out from between me.
I had my feet in the stirrups, too.
Never mind.
But I lost the bit you loaned me.
I'll get you another bit.
- Then I owe you two bits.
I hope you weren't distressed by last night's sad occurrence.
You mean dinner?
- No, the stolen painting!
A painting was stolen?
I haven't seen one in three weeks.
Why didn't you inform me?
What do I engage you for?
I didn't know it.
- You should have asked me.
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?
You're a contemptible cur!
I repeat.
You're a contemptible cur.
If I were a man, you'd resent that.
Please keep quiet!
I can get along without you.
I got along without your father.
And your uncle.
And your uncle.
And my uncle.
I didn't come to be exonerated.
- I beg your pardon.
You do, eh?
I'd like to see you crawl out of a rumble seat.
The police are here.
- Have them come in.
Oh, so that's your game.
You can't shut me up!
You can talk to my attorney.
Jamison, take a letter to my lawyers.
I'll show you a thing or two.
Or three.
I'll show you a thing or three.
Sending for the police!
Take a letter to my lawyers.
Sending for the police!
Take a letter to my lawyers.
- I am.
Read me what you have so far.
Honorable Charles H. Hungadunga, c/o Hungadunga, Hungadunga, Hungadunga, Hungadunga McCormack.
Semicolon.
How do you spell "semicolon"?
- Alright, make it a comma.
Honorable Charles H. Hungadunga, Hungadunga...
McCormack.
Gentlemen, question mark.
Er-r-r!
Do you want "er-r-r" in the letter?
- No, put that in an envelope.
Now then...
In re yours of the 5 inst, yours to hand and beg to rep, brackets, that we have gone over the ground carefully and we seem to believe, i.e., to wit, e.g., in lieu,
that despite all our precautionary measures, we seem to believe it is hardly necessary for us to proceed unless we receive an ipso facto that is not negligible at this moment.
Quotes, unquotes and quotes.
Hoping this finds you...
- Finds him where?
Let him worry about that.
Don't be so inquisitive.
Sneak!
Hoping this finds you, I beg to remain...
I'll show you where I get off.
Sending for the police.
Now read me the letter.
"Honorable Charles H. Hungadunga."
That's it.
"C/ o Hungadunga, Hungadunga, Hungadunga McCormack."
You've left out a Hungadunga.
You left out the main one, too.
Thought you could slip one over on me, didn't you?
Alright, leave it out.
Put in a windshield wiper instead.
I tell you what.
Make it three windshield wipers and one Hungadunga.
They won't all be there when the letter arrives.
"...and McCormack.
Gentlemen, question mark."
Put it on the penultimate and not on the dipthonic.
You should brush up on your Greek.
Get a Greek and brush up on him.
"In re yours of the 5 inst."
- I see.
A lot of things you said weren't important, so I just omitted them.
Oh Captain!
Good gracious.
Omitted them, eh?
You just omitted the body of the letter, that's all.
Just left out the body of the letter.
Yours is not to reason why.
You've left out the body.
Alright, send it that way and tell him the body will follow.
The body in brackets?
No, it'll never get there in brackets.
Put it in a box.
Put it in a box and mark it 'fragilly'
Mark it what?
- 'Fragilly!
' F-R-A-G...
Look it up in the dictionary, under fragile.
Look under the table if you don't find it there.
"Quotes, unquotes and quotes." - 3 quotes?
- Yes, sir.
Add another and make it a gallon.
Regards.
- That's a fine letter, Jamison.
That's an epic.
Make two carbon copies and throw the original away.
Then throw the copies away.
Just send a stamp.
Air mail.
Mrs. Rittenhouse?
I'm Inspector Hennessey.
- How do you do?
I'm Captain Scotland of Spaulding Yard.
No.
Spaulding, Scotland Yard.
Don't make the same mistake again.
- I'm glad to know you.
Between us we can solve this crime.
Especially if you go home.
No hasty arrests, please!
I don't want my guests embarrassed.
We won't arrest anybody.
- He's lucky to not go jail himself.
Would you take the Inspector and his men to the scene of the crime.
Certainly.
This way.
Come on, boys.
Jamison, count the spoons.
I didn't know you'd been a detective.
- There's a lot you don't know.
I suppose so.
- Darn right!
Where were you on June 5, 1774?
I don't know.
- Where was I?
I don't know.
- Me neither.
If I did, I wouldn't tell you.
Take a number from 1 to 10.
- Alright.
Which one?
- 7.
- That's right. 7 is right.
I could solve this in 5 minutes if I wanted to worry.
I don't want you to worry.
Nothing should interfere with your weekend.
Nothing interferes with my weak end.
And don't be so personal!
Where's my secretary?
Jamison!
- I didn't want to offend you.
Dastardly cracker!
I wish I was in the jungle where men are monkeys.
Captain, I'm so sorry.
- Jamison!
No, no.
Good morning, Mrs. Rittenhouse!
- Good morning.
Charming party.
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
It's just full of surprises.
- Glad you're enjoying yourself.
Hives!
Good morning.
Some breakfast?
- Nothing doing.
Where's the painting?
I watched all night, but the Professor did not sleep in his room.
Very strange.
- Good heavens.
What will we do?
I don't know.
Until we see the Professor...
You keep an eye on him till I get back with the bottle.
Don't worry, he'll not get away from me this time.
Did you get it?
- Yes.
- I'll engage him in conversation.
You trail behind and knock him out when the time comes.
Very good, madam.
Hello.
I've been looking all over for you!
Where were you?
What's the matter with this?
Are they the morning papers?
No, that isn't the one I want.
Show me the others.
That still isn't the one.
Out!
Yes, out!
The birds...
Come on, sit down.
I want to talk.
Don't you like me?
You don't?
Well, I like you.
I like little boys like you.
How old are you?
Five years old?
You're just a baby.
Oh, isn't that nice?
I like that.
No, no, no.
All joking aside, isn't there someone you do like?
Isn't there someone you love?
Think again.
Isn't there someone you really and truly love?
Is there?
Tell me who!
Why, that's a horse!
You love a horse?
Come on, lift him up.
Come on.
He's out.
- Let's go.
Arabella!
- I've been trying to find you.
Ravelli has lost the painting.
I just found one on the terrace.
The Beaugard?
- No.
- Oh, yours?
If it's not yours, and not the Beaugard, whose is it?
Someone switched it for mine, thinking they got the original.
Somebody swiped my scheme, eh?
Then Chandler never saw your painting?
- No.
You may still be a great artist.
Where is this picture?
Up in my room.
- You get it and I'll get the Captain.
He'll get to the bottom of this.
Then John found the third painting.
- Very interesting.
Well, sort of.
We have to keep our eyes open.
- If I don't find it, Mother's out $100,000.
Give me 24 hours for the case.
Then we'll call in someone else.
Wait till tomorrow.
Remember the Charlie Ross case?
I was on that, and he was never found.
Captain Yard of Scotland Spaulding always gets his women, or paintings.
Do you know what's happened with the painting I found?
It's been stolen from my room.
You see!
I've been on the case five minutes and another one is gone.
I bet it's not even three minutes.
My watch is gone.
This is too much.
It wasn't going, and now it's gone.
And my room was locked.
- Who could it have been?
Wait.
I think I've got a clue.
No, it's a red hair.
The Professor?
No, it couldn't be.
He's Crook of the Month this month.
Anyhow, we'll investigate it.
You know Conductor Hennessey?
- Inspector!
Inspect her yourself.
You know that redheaded fellow?
- Yes.
Well, get those flagpole sitters of yours to find him.
Come on, boys.
We'll soon get to the bottom of this.
Hey, what's that cop doing there?
It didn't take that long to find him.
- This is it!
Yes, but which one is it?
- The one just taken from my room.
Maybe my watch is back, too.
Now the fob is gone!
Well, I still got the pocket.
Anything I retain now is velvet.
Except the coat.
That's Prince Albert.
Well, all the jokes can't be good.
If we find the fella who painted this, it'd be a pretty good clue.
- What?
If we find the fella who painted this, it'd be a pretty good clue.
You just said that.
How dull you turned out to be!
Let me see that a minute.
It's signed "Beaugard".
There's the criminal.
No.
Beaugard is dead.
Dead?
Then it's murder!
Now we've got something.
What do you got?
- Jacks and aces.
And you?
Good.
I was bluffing.
- Does something strike you funny about this picture?
It isn't as funny as all that.
Did you ever see a tree like that?
Tree?
That's a spinach.
- It can't be.
Where's the egg?
It could be spinach.
Look at all the sand.
You mean it's an old Spinach custom?
No, it's not that.
No.
That's my mistake.
You know what it is?
Coleslaw.
Coleslaw?
- Yeah.
Did you ever see a coleslaw like that?
- Sure, look at this.
I don't want any of your lip now.
Did you ever see anything like that?
You know what this is?
A left-handed painting.
There's a signature.
- That's right.
This is either a left-handed painting or a vegetable dinner.
If we can find the left-handed person, we'll have "The Trial of Mary Dugan".
I saw that.
Goodbye.
- Wait.
I'm going to need you.
We mustn't lose this evidence.
Take it to your room and leave the door open this time.
And not a word about this to anybody.
Not even to me.
Ravelli, we've got to find the left-handed painting.
The first thing to do is to find the motive.
What was the motive of the Beaugard crooks?
I got it.
Robbery!
Would you mind crossing the street when it's red?
Si, Capt' Sit down.
I know how we find this painting.
In such a mysterious case, you gotta get the clues.
You gotta use the Sherlock Holmes method.
It goes like this:
You say, "What happened?" The answer: "Something was stolen."
You say, "What was stolen?" The answer come back: "A painting."
Are you a ventriloquist?
Now you say, "Where was this painting stolen?" The answer: "In this house."
Now, so far I'm right?
It's pretty hard to be wrong if you keep answering yourself.
You go a little further and say, "Who stole the painting?"
A very important question.
When you answer it, you got the whole solution.
Especially if you find the picture.
Now put all the clues together and what do ya got?
- Bread pudding.
No.
Something was stolen.
Where?
In this house.
By who?
Somebody here.
Now all you gotta do is ask everyone in the house if they took it.
I could rent you out as a decoy for duck hunters.
You're going to ask everyone here if they took the painting?
And suppose no one here took it?
- Go next door.
Great.
Suppose there is no house next door?
Well, then we gotta build one.
Now you're talking.
What kind of house should we build?
My idea of a house is something nice and small and comfortable.
Exactly, nothing elaborate.
A little place to call home and tell the wife I'm not coming for dinner.
I see.
You want a telephone booth.
No, in that case I'd just call Chic Sale.
What do ya say we build right about here?
Here?
- Yeah, here.
- I'd like it over here if possible.
I don't like junior crossing the rails on his way to reform school.
Actually I don't like junior at all.
Alright.
We got something over there, and believe me, that's convenient.
You just open the door, step outside, and there you are.
There you are?
Where?
- Outside.
If you want to get back in again?
- You had no right to go out.
Don't do anything until I hear from you, will you?
Maybe the painting is in the cellar!
- That's no cellar, that's the roof.
Down there?
- Yeah, so the chimney don't get wet when it rains.
I'm off to get x-rayed.
I'll be back in a little while.
I think you're wrong, Ravelli.
- Don't get excited.
Here's the rooms.
This is your room.
This is mine.
And this is the maid's room.
I'd have to go through your room?
That's alright, I won't be in it.
You couldn't put the maid in your room?
- Who says I couldn't?
There's going to be a lot of traffic.
I can see that.
Well, what do ya say?
You ready to sign the lease?
I'd like to talk to my husband first.
Could you come back later?
You married?
- I've got a girl as big as you are.
Alright.
Get me one.
- Don't get vulgar, Ravelli.
How about the painting?
We take care of that.
I'll tell you my idea.
The kitchen should be white.
Outside, green.
Inside, cerise.
The painting, I say!
What you think I talk?
Painting the kitchen white...
The painting that was stolen!
- Stolen?
Don't you remember?
Mrs. Rittenhouse lost a painting worth $100,000.
No, I'm a stranger here.
What do you think I am?
One of the early settlers?
Don't you remember Mrs. Beaugard lost a Rittenhouse oil painting?
No, but I've seen you someplace before.
Yeah, I was there.
But I'll stay away in the future.
Hey, Capt!
It come to me like a flash!
This painting wasn't stolen.
It has disappeared.
Yes, disappeared.
And you know what make it disappear?
Moths!
Moths eat it!
Left-handed moths!
Go away.
I'll be alright in a minute.
Left-handed moths ate it?
- That's my own solution.
I wish you were in it.
Left-handed moths!
I'd buy you a parachute if I thought it wouldn't open.
Hey, I got pair of shoes.
He's crazy.
Let's go and get the reward.
We solved it.
You solved it.
It was eaten by left-handed moths.
- We did good work.
Are you tired?
Lie down for a couple of years.
Lie down until rigor mortis sets in.
I know what we'll do.
Go to court to get a writ of habeas corpus.
To get rid of what?
I never should have started that way.
I say, we'll go to court to get a writ of habeas corpus.
Yes, corpus.
- Didn't you ever see a habeas corpus?
No, but I see "Habeas Irish Rose".
Good morning.
- Good morning.
Why don't you go to the beach with the others?
You'd feel better.
I'd feel better with my Beaugard.
We're doing everything we can.
Mrs. Rittenhouse!
I have it!
- The Beaugard!
Wonderful!
My Beaugard!
Wait.
This is a rank imitation.
Where did you find it?
In Mr. Parker's room, madam.
- Parker?
One thing is certain.
Whoever did this also stole the Beaugard.
Hives, ask Mr. Parker to come here.
Wait.
My men will bring him in.
Get Mr. Parker.
What's wrong with this?
- It's obvious that it's a rank imitation.
Mother, what's wrong?
Something very strange has occurred and only you can explain it.
Gladly.
We found this in your room.
What have you done with the original?
Come clean!
- I think it would be wise...
I don't know where the Beaugard is.
Why did we find this in your room?
You'd better come with me.
You can't take him.
This program is coming to you from the House of David.
Either this suit is on upside-down or there is no law of gravity.
Einstein or no Einstein.
- My tie!
Captain, what shall I do?
They're going to arrest John.
Who?
- I am!
In Scotland Yard they teach you never to arrest an innocent man.
He's not innocent.
I'll have to arrest him.
Of course, or nobody's safe here.
You can't arrest him.
I stole it.
- Don't listen to her.
I did it.
They're both lying.
I did it.
- He's crazy.
I confess.
I did it.
Maybe there was no painting.
- That's right.
I saw it.
Stop this!
Who stole the painting?
I did!
- Good gracious.
You?
You took the picture?
Where is it?
Aw, that's a horse.
That is my Beaugard!
- No, that isn't your Beaugard.
Ridiculous.
I paid $100,000 for this.
I know what I bought.
Look at the signature.
John Parker.
Somebody changed it.
That is my Beaugard!
That's it, I tell you.
But that one has the color, the depth, the soul of the Beaugard.
Only a master could have produced a painting like that.
You mean, you painted it?
- Yes, sir.
- You're a genius.
I commission you to paint a portrait of me immediately.
It'll have to wait until tomorrow.
I'm going to be busy all day.
- Yes.
You come with me.
- Don't take him away, officer.
He returned the paintings.
My name is Spaulding.
I've always wanted to meet you.
Alright.
Just this time.
But I want to tell you something.
You're running around with the wrong people.
You wanna be a crook?
Why don't you go home?
- He's got no home.
Go home and stay home.
Your poor old mother sits there sits there, night after... night after night... waiting to hear your steps on the stairs.
- Ain't got no stairs.
And I can see a little light burns in the window.
No you can't!
The gas company turned it off.
What I'm telling you is for your own good.
And if you listen to me, you can't go wrong.
This may go on for years.
- There's just one thing...
What's delaying that coffee pot?
Where's the cream?
- You certainly surprised me.
Me too.
I thought he had more.
- No use giving you any advice.
Captain, this time I'm afraid I'll have to take him.
Come on.
Oh, what are you doing?
My dear!
What's the idea?
- Take a letter to my lawyers.
Oh no, don't!
Anything but...
That I've got to go!
So young!
Good.
Let's get out of here before they all wake up.
Hurry up.
You must do your best tonight Be on your toes, men
There's another guest tonight It's one of those men
Who are being feted by the smart set.
We'll see that he gets what he deserves
Treat him as they do a king in manner royal
Like a subject to a king you must be loyal
On this object you must have your heart set
We'll do nothing to get on his nerves
Again I mention Be on your toes, men
He craves attention He's one of those men
Yes, sir, we will give him just what he deserves
Oh, Hives?
Oh, yes, Mrs. Rittenhouse?
I'd like to make a few changes in the assignment of the rooms.
Very good, madam.
Suppose you put Mr. Chandler in the blue suite.
And Captain Spaulding, as guest of honor, will have the green duplex with the two baths.
Two, madam?
Why, yes.
I think the Captain would like two baths, don't you?
Well, if he's just returned from Africa, he may need two baths.
Mr. Roscoe W. Chandler.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, well!
Mr. Chandler.
So nice to see you.
The famous Beaugard, as I have promised.
Mr. Chandler, how can I ever express my gratitude?
Oh, it's nothing.
Nothing?
You return from Europe with a masterpiece valued at $100,000, and instead of displaying it yourself, you allow me to unveil it at my party in honor of Captain Spaulding.
You call that nothing?
Mrs. Rittenhouse, I...
Uh, will you please remove that to the place where it is to be exhibited?
Very good, sir.
And uh, very careful, please.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, you think that is something?
It is nothing compared to what I would like to do for you.
You are a very beautiful woman.
No, no, Mr. Chandler.
Well, maybe I'm wrong.
What?
Please, do not go, Mrs. Rittenhouse,
I love you.
I know, but...
Do not take away your hand.
I tell you, I love you.
Careful...
Hello, Mother.
Playing house?
Well, uh, if you'll pardon me.
Have you seen Johnny Parker?
I wish you'd get Johnny Parker out of your mind and show more respect to Mr. Chandler.
The trouble with you is you don't take these social affairs seriously.
What would you suggest, Mom?
Suicide?
I would suggest...
Mrs. Rittenhouse, Captain Spaulding has arrived!
Splendid.
Oh, I'm so glad.
My friends, Captain Spaulding has arrived.
At last we are to meet him The famous Captain Spaulding
From climates hot and scalding The Captain has arrived
Most heartily we'll greet him with plain and fancy cheering
Until he's hard of hearing The Captain has arrived
At last the Captain
Has arrived
Mr. Horatio W. Jamison, field secretary to Captain Spaulding.
I represent the Captain who insists on my informing you
Of these conditions under which he camps here
In one thing he is very strict he wants his women young and thin
And as for men, he won't have any tramps here
And as for men, he won't have any tramps here
There must be no tramps
The men must all be very old the women warm, the champagne cold
It's under these conditions that he camps here
I'm announcing Captain Geoffrey Spaulding
He's announcing Captain Geoffrey Spaulding
Oh, dear, he is coming
At last he's here
Well, what do I owe you?
What?
From Africa to here, $1.85?
That's an outrage.
I told you not to take me through Australia.
You know it's all ripped up.
You should have come right up Lincoln Boulevard.
Where do you come to that stuff?
Turn around the rear end, I wanna see your license plates.
I don't think, you're on the square.
Oh, Captain Spaulding.
I'll attend to you later.
Oh, Captain Spaulding.
Why you're one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen.
That's not saying much for you.
Captain Spaulding,
Rittenhouse Manor is entirely at your disposal.
Well, I'm certainly grateful for this magnificent washout.
Uh, "turnout," and uh, now I'd like to say a few words.
Hello I must be going
I cannot stay, I came to say I must be going
I'm glad I came, but just the same I must be going...
La la
For my sake you must stay
If you should go away you'd spoil this party I am throwing
I'll stay a week or two
I'll stay the summer through
But I am telling you
I must be going.
Before you go will you oblige us
And tell us of your deeds so glowing
I'll do anything you say In fact, I'll even stay
Good
But I must be going
There's something that I'd like to say
That he's too modest to relate
The Captain is a moral man Sometimes he finds it trying
This fact I'll emphasize with stress
I never take a drink unless
Somebody's buying
The Captain is a very moral man
If he hears anything obscene he'll naturally repel it
I hate a dirty joke I do
Unless it's told by someone who knows how to tell it
The Captain is a very moral man
Hooray for Captain Spaulding the African explorer
Did someone call me Schnorer
Hooray, hooray, hooray
He went into the jungles where all the monkeys throw nuts
If I stay here I'll go nuts
Hooray, hooray, hooray
He put all his reliance in courage and defiance
And risked his life for science
Hey, hey
He is the only white man who covered every acre
I think I'll try and make her
Hooray, hooray, hooray
He put all his reliance in courage and defiance
And risked his life for science
Hey, hey
Hooray for Captain Spaulding the African explorer
He brought his name undying fame
And that is why we say hooray, hooray, hooray
My friends, I'm highly gratified at this magnificent display of effusion.
And I want you to know...
Hooray for Captain Spaulding the African explorer
He brought his name undying fame And that is why we say
Hooray, hooray, hooray
My friends, I'm highly gratified at this magnificent display of effusion.
And I want you to know...
Hooray for Captain Spaulding the African explorer
He brought his name undying fame And that is why we say
Hooray, hooray, hooray
My friends, I'm highly gratified at this magnificent display of effusion.
I want you to know...
Hooray for Captain Spaulding the African explorer
Well, somebody's got to do it!
Captain Spaulding?
It is indeed a great honor to welcome you to my poor home.
Oh, it isn't so bad.
Needless to say...
Wait a minute, I think you're right.
It is pretty bad.
As a matter of fact, it's one of the frowsiest looking joints I've ever seen.
Why, Captain...
Where did you get your wallpaper?
You're letting this place run down, and what's the result?
You're not getting the class of people that you used to.
Why, you've got people here that look like you!
Now, I'll tell you what to do.
We'll put up a sign outside, "Place under new management."
We'll set up a 75-cent meal that will knock their eyes out.
After we knock their eyes out, we can charge them anything we want.
Now sign here and give me your check for $1,500.
I want to tell you, madam, with this insurance policy, you've provided for your little ones and for your old age...
Which will be here in a couple of weeks now, if I'm any judge of horseflesh.
And now, madam, "I feel that the time has come," the walrus...
Captain Spaulding!
Captain Spaulding!
You stand before me as one of the bravest men of all times.
All right, I'll do that.
In the dark forests of Africa, there has been no danger you have not dared.
You mind if I don't smoke?
Fearlessly, you have blazed new trails, scornful of the lion's roar and the cannibal's tom-tom.
Says you!
Never once in all those weary months did your footsteps falter.
Cowardice is unknown to you.
Fear is not in you!
Oh, pardon me, a caterpillar...
Put him over here.
Oh, it must have been the caterpillar that frightened him.
Oh, dear.
This is unfortunate.
Don't stand there.
Get the whiskey!
Get the whiskey.
The whiskey?
The whiskey?
Where is the whiskey?
It's in my little black bag in the right-hand corner.
Signor Emanuel Ravelli.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Where's the dining room?
I'm surprised.
Say, I used to know a fellow who looked exactly like you, by the name of, uh, Emanuel Ravelli.
Are you his brother?
I am Emanuel Ravelli.
You're Emanuel Ravelli?
I'm Emanuel Ravelli.
Well, no wonder you look like him, but I insist there is a resemblance.
Hey, he thinks I look alike.
Well, If you do, it's a tough break for both of you.
You are one of the musicians, but you were not due until tomorrow.
Couldn't come tomorrow.
That's too quick.
So, you're lucky they didn't come yesterday.
We were busy yesterday, but we charge just the same.
This is better than exploring.
What do you fellows get an hour?
Oh, for playing, we get a $10 an hour.
I see.
What do you get for not playing?
$12 an hour.
Well, clip me off a piece of that.
Now, for rehearsing, we make special rate, that's $15 an hour.
That's for rehearsing?
Yes, that's for rehearsing.
And what do you get for not rehearsing?
You couldn't afford it.
You see, If we don't rehearse, we don't play.
- And If we don't play...
- That runs into money.
How much will you want to run into an open manhole?
Just the cover charge.
Drop in sometime.
Sewer.
Oh, we cleaned that up pretty well.
Well, let's see how we stand.
Flat-footed.
Yesterday we didn't come.
You remember, yesterday we didn't come.
Oh, I remember.
Yeah, that's $300.
Yesterday you didn't come.
That's $300?
That's $300.
That's reasonable.
I can see that, all right.
Now, today we did come.
That's, uh...
That's $100 you owe us.
Hey, I bet I'm gonna lose on the deal.
Tomorrow we leave.
That's worth about...
A million dollars.
Yeah, that's all right for me, but I got a partner.
What?
Partner?
The Professor!
The gates swung open and a Fig Newton entered.
How do you do?
Goodness!
You haven't got chocolate, have you?
He's got everything.
Hives, take the Professor's hat and coat.
And send for the fumigators.
Oh, my goodness!
Bonjour!
Hey, don't you see.
There are ladies present.
What do you think this is?
Put that hat down.
Will you?
What you do there?
Get out.
Don't go near those guns!
A little more to the right.
Ah-ah, that's better.
Now, see that the drape is well-hung.
The mistress will inspect it before the unveiling.
Hello, Hives!
Mrs. Whitehead, this is a surprise.
And how about me?
Miss Grace, you've grown so in the last year.
You haven't lost any weight, yourself.
No.
Unfortunately not.
You know, Hives, it seems strange to find you working here instead of in our own home.
Well, after you left for Europe,
Mrs. Rittenhouse was good enough to make me an offer.
Lovely!
Oh, by the way, Hives, what's the secret about the painting?
No secret.
It's Beaugard's After the Hunt.
The original?
Most original.
Be careful!
Where did she get hold of that, do you suppose?
Is it very valuable?
Is it?
It must be worth a fortune.
But sis, it looks as if we yield the social honors of the season to Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Well, isn't there something we can do?
We might shoot ourselves.
I'd rather shoot Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Say, I have an idea.
I copied that painting in art school a year ago.
Well, what of it?
But, I still don't get it.
I'll go home and get the copy.
We'll substitute it for the original.
And when she unveils it, what'll she have?
An imitation, and I must admit, a very poor one.
Grace, you're wonderful.
That's what I've been telling you.
I won't be long.
All right.
See you later.
Oh, Hives?
Do you still feel there's a strong bond between us?
Why most certainly, Mrs. Whitehead.
Strong enough for you to do me a big favor?
Why, anything at all.
Well, suppose I were to ask you to take away the Beaugard?
What?
You mean...
Oh, just temporarily, of course.
And substitute something of my own.
Well, I should consider it rather an unusual request.
It is, Hives.
But somehow I still think of you as one of the Whiteheads.
You may count on me.
My soul is yours.
Even though my body may belong to Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Why, Hives?
Oh, Mrs. Whitehead.
Arabella!
May I present, Mr. Parker?
Oh, of the Massachusetts Parkers?
Why, no.
Oh, then the southern Parkers?
Oh, no!
The central Parkers.
You know, the, uh, benches and trees.
I see!
Oh!
I don't like that woman.
Well, never mind.
You come over here and sit down and tell me whom you do like.
Oh!
So, that's your game.
Now, listen, do you really love me?
Why don't you marry me and find out.
Marry you?
Ha!
On what?
Hmm.
Last year, I sold two paintings.
One at $100 and one at $50.
Could we live on $150 a year?
Oh, we wouldn't need any money!
I've got a charge account in every shop on 5th Avenue.
Well, if I had any brains,
I'd give up painting and get a regular job.
You know, I had a cousin who made $50,000 on Wall Street last year.
Oh, I don't want to marry your cousin.
I'm a darn fool.
I want to marry you.
Say, why don't we get that old bluff, Chandler, to buy a portrait from you?
Chandler?
Ha!
What does he know about art?
Well, the less he knows, the easier it will be for you to sell him.
They're right upstairs.
You can't miss them.
Go around to the other side.
Mrs. Rittenhouse?
Yoo-hoo!
Oh, Captain Spaulding, how are you?
Tell me, are you alone?
Captain, I don't understand.
What?
You don't understand being alone?
Don't give me that innocent stuff or you'll be alone!
A big cluck like you turning cute on me!
Mrs. Rittenhouse?
Yes?
Oh, pardon me.
You've been affected like this yourself, haven't you?
Oh, no, Captain.
Well, you will be.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, ever since I met you,
I've swept you off my feet.
Something has been throbbing within me.
Oh, it's been beating like the incessant tom-tom in the primitive jungle.
There's something that I must ask you.
What is it, Captain?
Would you wash out a pair of socks for me?
Captain, I'm surprised.
Well, that maybe surprise you, but it's been on my mind for weeks.
It's just my way of telling you that I love you.
That's all.
I love you.
I...
Captain...
Mrs. Whitehead.
I beg your pardon.
I beg your pardon.
Am I intruding?
Are you intruding?
Just when I had her on the five-yard line.
I should say you are intruding!
I should say you are intruding!
Pardon me,
I was using the subjunctive instead of the past tense.
Yes, we're way past tents.
We're living in bungalows now.
This is a mechanical age, of course.
Mrs. Whitehead, you haven't met Captain Spaulding, have you?
Why, no.
I haven't.
How are you?
How are you?
I'm fine, thank you.
And how are you?
And how are you?
That leaves you one up.
Did anyone ever tell you you had beautiful eyes?
No.
Well, you have.
And so have you!
He shot her a glance.
As a smile played around his lips.
Yes.
I don't think I've ever seen four more beautiful eyes in my life.
Well, three, anyway.
You know, you two girls have everything.
You're tall and short, and slim and stout, blonde and brunette, and that's just the kind of a girl I crave!
We three would make an ideal couple.
Why, you've got beauty, charm, money.
You have that money, haven't you?
Because, if you haven't, we can quit right now.
The Captain is charming, isn't he?
I'm fascinated.
I'm fascinated, too.
Right on the arm.
Fascinated.
Whim-wham.
If I were Eugene O'Neill, I could tell you what I really think of you two.
You know, you're very fortunate the theater guild isn't putting this on.
And so is the guild.
Pardon me while I have a strange interlude.
Why, you couple of baboons, what makes you think I'd marry either one of you?
Strange how the wind blows tonight.
It has a thin, eerie voice.
Reminds me of poor old Marsden.
How happy I could be with either of these two if both of them just went away.
Well, what do you say, girls?
What do you say?
Will you marry me?
But, Captain, which one of us?
Both of you.
Let's all get married.
This is my party.
Party.
Party.
Here I am talking of parties.
I came down here for a party.
What happens?
Nothing.
Not even ice cream.
The gods look down and laugh.
This would be a better world for children if the parents had to eat the spinach.
Well, what do you say, girls?
What do you say?
Are we all going to get married?
All of us?
All of us!
But that's bigamy.
Yes, and it's big of me, too!
It's big of all of us.
Let's be big for a change.
I'm sick of these conventional marriages.
One woman and one man was good enough for your grandmother, but who wants to marry your grandmother?
Nobody.
Not even your grandfather.
Think of the honeymoon, strictly private.
I wouldn't let another woman in on this.
Well, maybe one or two, but no men.
I may not go, myself.
Are you suggesting companionate marriage?
Well, it's got advantages.
You could live with your folks, and I could live with your folks.
And you, you could sell Fuller Brushes.
Living with your folks.
Living with your folks, the beginning of the end.
Drab dead yesterdays shutting out beautiful tomorrows.
Hideous stumbling footsteps creaking along the misty corridors of time.
In those corridors, I see figures, strange figures, weird figures.
Steel 186, anaconda 74,
American Can 138.
Well, let's see.
Where were we?
Oh, yes!
We were about to get married.
Well, what do you think?
Do you think we really ought to get married?
I think marriage is a very noble institution.
It's the foundation of the American home.
Yes, but the trouble is you can't enforce it.
It was put over on the American people...
While our boys were over there and while our girls were over here.
You know that I've been waiting at the bottom of these stairs for years for just such a moment as this.
Why, Captain, where are you going?
I'm sorry, ladies, I'm sorry,
But, uh, I'm afraid we're gonna have to postpone the wedding for a few days, maybe for a few years.
Before I get married, I'm going to sow a couple of wild oats.
The Captain's so amusing.
Isn't he charming?
So that's the famous Beaugard, eh?
It's a great picture, isn't it?
Oh, you've seen it before?
Seen it?
I spent three days in Paris copying it.
You did?
Well, me and a million other young artists.
Oh.
I bet your copy was better than any of them.
Well, it wasn't bad at that.
I'll show it to you sometime.
Listen.
What?
Mother's going to unveil it tonight.
Yeah.
Suppose...
Suppose when she unveils it, it's not the Beaugard at all?
Suppose it's yours!
You mean, put my copy in place of the Beaugard?
Exactly.
Well, Arabella, you're crazy.
What good would that do?
What good?
Listen.
They'll unveil it.
Chandler will tell everybody how fine it is.
They'll all cheer their heads off, and then we'll tell them who really painted it.
They'll say, you're a great artist.
You'll get six commissions for paintings, and we can be married and divorced in no time.
Well, that sounds great.
But what if they don't like my painting?
What then?
Well, isn't the chance worth taking?
Ah, I see you're admiring my picture.
Yes, yes.
Your picture?
Yes, my picture.
Well, it don't look like you.
Hey, wait, wait.
Someplace I met you before, because you're face is a very familiar.
Well, after all, I'm one of the most well-known men in America.
The newspapers will keep on running my photograph.
You're not Abe Kabbible?
Oh, nonsense!
All right.
Hey, wait.
If you're not Abe Kabbible, who are you?
Now, please.
Chandler is my name, Roscoe W. Chandler.
Yeah, but I don't care about the name, you see.
Someplace I met you before, because your face is very familiar.
Now, wait.
Let me see,
Were you ever in Sing Sing?
Please!
No, no, Sing.
I got it.
I got it.
Joliet?
Leave me alone!
No?
All right, don't run away.
Don't run away.
Leavenworth?
Oh, listen here, I have never been in these places.
I spend most of my time in Europe.
Europe.
I got it now.
I know.
You come from Czechoslovakia.
You are wrong, I tell you...
You come from...
Hey, hey, come here, come here.
I tell you...
Please get away from me.
Hey, you remember him.
Who was he?
He comes from Czechoslovakia.
You are wrong, I tell you.
I told you before, you are mistaken.
He comes from Czechoslovakia, and I know who it is.
That's Abie the fish peddler from Czechoslovakia.
Ridiculous, I tell you.
You are wrong.
Wait, wait, wait.
We prove it.
He had a birthmark.
Remember?
Oh, please!
What are you...
Leave me alone.
On the arm.
On the arm.
On the leg.
On the foot, up here, on the mustache.
Ah-ha!
There it is.
There is the birthmark.
Abie the fish man.
I confess.
I was, I was Abie the peddler.
Well, how did you get to be Roscoe W. Chandler?
Say, how did you get to be an Italian?
Never mind.
Whose confession is this?
Well, boys, for heaven's sake, don't say about this to anybody, and I think we can come to some agreement.
Some arrangement which would be, uh, mutually satisfactory.
Money, money.
Yeah.
Shall we say, uh, $500?
Piker!
$500.
Well, that is all the cash I have.
$500?
Well, all right.
I tell you what we do.
We'll take your I.O.U.
I've given you my best offer and that is all you will get.
That's all you give?
Yes.
Abie the fish man Abie the fish man
Abie the fish man Abie the fish man
Please be quiet, quiet!
Please.
Now, come here.
Now, listen here.
I have here a check for $5,000.
Now, I give it to you.
Yeah?
Hey.
Is it good?
Well, of course it is good.
Who would give me a bad check?
I would.
Hey, see if it's good.
All right, if you don't want the check, then that is all you will get.
That's all we get?
Yeah.
Abie the fish man Abie the fish man Please, quiet!
Abie the fish man Abie the fish man Quiet!
Abie the fish man
Here!
Give me that handkerchief.
My tie!
Where is my tie?
I...
You're nothing but a pair of thieves.
That's all.
I get a the tie.
Well, what do you got?
The birthmark!
Hey, hey, where's your tie?
Well, I...
That's a fine way for a millionaire to be running around, open at the neck.
Have you got garters?
Of course, I have garters.
Here.
Oh!
They've taken my garters, too!
A likely story.
Turning collegiate on me, eh?
Have you got socks?
Certainly.
Here they are.
Oh, yeah.
You have got socks.
They look pretty old to me, too.
Whose are they?
My old socks.
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Spaulding, Captain Spaulding.
I am Roscoe W. Chandler.
Well, this is a treat, your treat.
You have heard about me?
Yes, I've heard about you for a great many years, Mr. Chandler, and I'm getting pretty darn sick of it, too.
Quite naturally, I've also heard of the great Captain Spaulding.
Well, that's fine.
I've heard of you and you've heard of me.
Now, have you ever heard the one about the two Irishmen?
Oh, yes!
Now that I've got you in hysterics, let's get to business.
My name is Spaulding, Captain Spaulding.
I am Roscoe W. Chandler.
And I'm Geoffrey T. Spaulding.
I bet you don't know what the "T" stands for.
Uh, Thomas?
Edgar.
You were close, though.
You were close, though, and you still are, I'll bet.
Now, this is what I want to talk to you about, Mr. Chandler.
How would you like to finance a scientific expedition?
Well, that is a question.
Yes that is a question.
You certainly know a question when you see it.
I congratulate you, Mr. Chandler, and that brings us right back to where we were.
How would you like to finance a scientific expedition?
Well, is there any particular kind of an expedition you had in mind?
Well, I tell you.
I'm getting along in years now.
There's one thing I always wanted to do before I quit.
What is that?
Retire.
Now would you be interested in a proposition of that kind?
You know, I've always had an idea that my retirement would be the greatest contribution to science the world has ever known.
This is your chance, Mr. Chandler.
When I think what you have done for this country...
And by the way, what have you done for this country?
Oh, well.
I've always tried to do what I could, especially in the world of art.
Art?
Well, I don't know how we drifted around that.
But what is your opinion of art?
I am very glad you asked me!
I withdraw the question.
This fellow takes things seriously.
It isn't safe to ask him a simple question.
Tell me Mr. Chandler, where are you planning on putting your new opera house?
Oh, I thought I should put it somewhere near Central Park.
I see.
Why don't you put it right in Central Park?
Could we do that?
Sure.
Do it at night when no one is looking.
Why don't you put it in the reservoir and get the whole thing over with?
Of course, that might interfere with the water supply.
But after all, we must remember that art is art.
Still, on the other hand, water is water, isn't it?
And east is east, and west is west.
And If you take cranberries and stew them like applesauce, it tastes more like prunes than rhubarb does.
Now, uh, now, you tell me what you know.
Well, I would be very glad to give you my opinion.
Well, that's dandy.
I'll ask you for them someday.
Remind me, will you?
I'll tell you what, could you come to my office at 10:00 tomorrow morning?
If I'm not there, ask for Mr. Jamison, that's my secretary, and If he sees you, I'll discharge him.
That's a date, now.
Saturday at 3:00.
No, you better make it Tuesday, I'm going to Europe Monday.
Pardon me.
My name is Spaulding.
I've always wanted to meet you, Mr. Chandler.
Tell me.
What do you think of the traffic problem?
What do you think of the marriage problem?
What do you think of at night when you go to bed, you beast?
Well, I'll tell you...
I'd rather not discuss it any further.
Remember, there are children present.
Well, you see, my dear Captain, in the last analysis, it is a question of money.
The nickel today is not what it used to be 10 years ago.
I'll go further than that.
I'll get off at the depot.
The nickel is not what it was 15 years ago.
You know what this country needs today?
What?
A seven-cent nickel.
Yes, sir.
We've been using the five-cent nickel in this country since 1492.
Now, that's pretty near 100 years, daylight saving.
Now, why not give the seven-cent nickel a chance?
If that works out, next year we could have an eight-cent nickel.
Think what that would mean.
You could go to a newsstand buy a three-cent newspaper and get the same nickel back.
One nickel, carefully used, would last a family a lifetime.
Captain Spaulding, I think that is a wonderful idea.
You do, eh?
Yes.
Then there can't be much to it.
Forget about it.
Well, uh...
Well, tell me, Captain Chandler, uh, excuse me, Spaulding.
Spaulding, Spaulding, that's right.
Yeah.
I'm Spaulding, you're Chandler.
Let's have no more of that either, eh?
It's bad enough being Spaulding.
Well, tell me, Captain Spaulding,
Spaulding is the name?
That's right.
That's right.
I'm, I'm Chan...
I'm Spaulding...
Spaulding...
Could I look at a program a minute?
I might be the "News Weekly," for all he knows, or "Coming Next Week."
Well, tell me, Captain Spaulding, you've been quite a traveler.
Uh, what do you think about South America?
I'm going there soon, you know.
Is that so?
Where are you going?
Uruguay.
Well, you go Uruguay and I'll go mine.
Say, how long has this been going on?
Let's change the subject.
Take the foreign situation.
Take Abyssinia.
I'll tell you, you take Abyssinia, and I'll take a hot butterscotch sundae on rye bread.
Let's go and see what the boys in the back room will have.
But, my...
Let's see how yours compares with the original.
All right, let's.
Oh!
I don't see any difference.
Well, look closer.
Maybe, you'll find it's better.
Oh, you!
You seen my partner?
No.
Oh, yoo-hoo.
Oh, Mr. Ravioli.
Ravelli, Ravelli.
Oh, Mr. Ravelli.
I want you to do something for me.
I do anything for you.
What do you want, I should do?
You see that painting?
You mean, this picture?
I want you to take that out of the frame and put this one in its place.
You want I should take this one down and put this one upstairs.
Yes, that's it.
You want I should steal!
Oh, no, no!
It's not stealing.
Well, then, I couldn't do it.
Oh, Mr. Ravioli!
Oh, no, no, no.
Hey, get up, get up.
Come here.
That's all you do, chase the women.
Go.
Aw, stop!
Everybody here plays cards.
They don't ask us.
We are a waste all the time.
We been here all day.
How much a we make?
We make a nothing.
First thing you know, we gonna live on a charity, then go to the old ladies' home.
How do you like that?
No, no.
That's a no good!
These people here all got a money.
Now, we gotta get someone to play with us, see.
I play anything.
Oh, Signor Ravelli,
I want to speak to you about the music.
Yeah.
How do you do?
What's the matter with you?
I thought, it would be nice...
Go away from me.
What is this?
That's all right.
Just a...
Oh, there you are.
My, dear...
Hello, Professor.
Good heavens.
What's the matter with his feet?
This is embarrassing.
That's nothing.
Why, we play all kinds of games.
We play blackjack, soccer...
Oh!
Dear, I'm so sorry!
Mrs. Whitehead...
What is the matter with him?
I wouldn't have had this happen for the world.
Oh!
Heavens!
Come on!
Atta boy!
Go away from me!
One...
Two...
Three.
Atta boy.
Atta boy.
Good heavens.
Oh, dear.
I must, get them out.
I must get them out of here!
Oh, look.
You see how terrible he looks!
Look.
I'm so frightened.
Look, what can I do?
I don't know.
I better get Hives.
No, let me get her.
Well, you go, then.
I'm just trying to watch my...
Oh, oh.
Oh, this is terrible.
She can't take it there.
You better get Hives.
Go away from me!
This is dreadful.
Well, why don't you leave him alone?
Stop!
Now that this game is over, how about playing bridge?
You play bridge?
I play bridge a little.
What do you play for?
Oh, we just play for small stakes.
And French fried potatoes?
Set it up over there, Hives.
Very good, madam.
What in the world is he up to?
Look at this.
The whole house will be torn to pieces.
Absolutely.
If it isn't one thing, it's another.
Oh, Hives!
Oh!
Take it away, Hives.
Extraordinary.
We'll play over here.
Now, how do you want to play?
Honest?
Well, I hope so.
You put that right away.
It's your own fault.
Come along now.
We'll cut for partners.
Oh, he's my partner.
That's the only way we play.
I'm sorry but it's against the rules of the games.
We have to cut for partners.
All right.
We cut for partners.
I got ace of spades.
He's got ace of spades.
That's what you call "quin-cidences."
Two aces of spaces?
Yeah, he's got thousands of them.
Well, I suppose that gives him the choice of seats.
You have the choice of seats.
Good heavens!
Not on her lap.
Come on!
Sit down.
What's the matter with him?
I don't know.
He thought it was contact bridge.
Just a minute now.
Shuffle the cards.
Yeah.
You got to scrumble them up a bit.
You know.
Just a moment.
I'd like to cut those cards.
That's a better.
Uh, your bid, partner.
You pass?
Misdeal.
You pass?
I bid one spade.
I pass.
Three spades.
Four spades.
One club.
I don't understand this kind of bidding!
Well, you don't have to understand.
You bid four spades, huh?
Why, I haven't a spade in my hand!
All right.
We double.
There's something wrong here.
I want you to go over the bidding.
Hey, she wants to start them up again, the bidding.
He bids one.
One?
One what?
That's all right.
You find out.
But we have to know what he's bidding.
We tell you later.
Now I bid two.
Two what?
Uh, two of the same he bids.
Now, the bidding's over.
See, that's enough bidding.
Uh, it's your lead.
Oh, no, you can't lead that.
Why not?
Why, we can't take it.
Well, what should I lead?
Ace.
Ace of spades.
That's very good.
Three of spades, four of spades...
You trump it?
Uh, that's what you call a finesse.
Oh!
No spades, partner.
No spades!
Ace of hearts.
Ace of clubs.
Dummy leads.
The dummy leads.
I'm not the dummy!
Well, you could be.
Ace of diamonds.
100 aces, huh?
200?
That's better.
Ace of hearts.
Atta boy, make a big slam.
Make a big, big slam!
Ace of spades.
Ace of spades.
That's a good.
He plays a good game.
Ace of spades.
He plays a fine game, all right.
Ace of...
I refuse to play any longer.
You're nothing but a couple of card sharps.
Good heavens!
What's the matter, dear?
My shoes are gone!
Good gracious.
He has your slippers.
Come along, come along.
Hey, you take a the lady's shoes, huh?
Hey.
Quiet.
Quiet, quiet.
Hide!
Hide!
Somebody's coming.
All right.
I make a mistake.
Get up, get up.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Come.
Hey, hurry up.
Come here.
You know what we gotta do, eh?
We gotta take a that picture out and put this one upstairs for the lady.
Wait!
No touch.
You got everything ready, huh?
The shovel, the ax, the dynamite, the pineapples?
Where's the flash?
That's a no flash.
A flash.
There's a flash.
Flash.
That's a flash.
A flash.
Yeah, that's a flash.
That's a fish!
I no want a fish.
No fish.
Flash.
Aw, stop it.
You act crazy.
When you go out in the night time, you gotta have a the flash.
Ha!
That's a no flash.
That's a flask.
Flash.
When you wanna see somebody, you gotta have a the flash.
That's a flush.
What I gonna do with a flush?
A flash.
No flit.
It's a flits.
What am I gonna do with a flits?
What do you got?
That's whatcha call a flutes.
All you got is a fish, a flutes, a flits, flutes, flits and a flutes.
Stop this!
Where's the flash?
Look, when everything is a light...
And you wanna make them a dark, what do you do?
Ah!
You're crazy.
I don't want no blackjack.
That's a my mistake, I guess.
When everything is dark, and you wanna make them light...
Yeah, that's a flash.
That's a flash.
Hey, that's a good, all right.
The storm put the lights out.
Now, nobody can see what we do.
That's a fine.
Where is the flash?
Where's the flash?
I no want the fish!
The flash!
No, no flute!
No, flute!
What's the matter with you, eh?
Flash.
Before the people come, get a the flash.
What's the matter?
You lose it?
Well, you gotta find it.
Look for it.
All right, all right.
Never mind.
Come on.
We'll work without it.
Yes, madam.
Hide!
Hide!
Somebody's coming.
Hide, hide, hide.
Quiet!
Shut up!
Quiet.
Shut up.
Be quiet.
I know where you are.
It's all right.
Oh, Captain Spaulding?
Captain Spaulding, where are you?
Here.
Yes, what's the trouble?
The storm has put the lights out, and you can't see your hand before your face.
You wouldn't get much enjoyment out of that.
I don't know what you're gonna do, but I'm gonna take a nap.
Leave me a call for 3:00.
Make it 3:30.
You certainly get service around here.
Pardon me, Mrs. Rittenhouse, did you lose a fish?
What?
Well, somebody lost it.
Will you take it out in the kitchen and have it fried for me?
Did you hear that?
There's somebody over there.
I say, there's somebody over there!
Don't be silly.
The house is just settling.
That's all.
Anybody over there?
I don't see anybody.
There you are.
If there's anybody there, we'd see him, wouldn't I?
- Oh, what is it?
- Captain, what is it?
You know, what I think?
I think you got roaches.
Yes, you got roaches, all right.
And the biggest one has got asthma.
Oh, this is terrible.
Captain, let's get out of here.
We get a the picture.
We don't make one sound.
Hey!
Somebody put on the lights.
All right.
We get a the picture.
We don't make one sound.
Come on.
Let's go.
Get out of here.
What do you want?
Oh, the fish.
Come on, come on.
Oh!
That's some storm, huh?
That's a regular tomato.
Come on.
Let's go this way.
I think it's a shortcut.
Come on, let's go.
California!
Oh, Captain, how thrilling.
And then what happened?
It was nothing at all.
I'd rather not discuss it.
But I can't wait to hear the finish.
I must hear it.
Well, there I was.
There I was in the top of the tree with this rhinoceros pointing his gun straight at me.
A rhinoceros?
Yes.
Captain, what did you do?
What could I do?
I had to marry his daughter.
What kind of a story do you call that?
All right, you tell one.
And now, my friends, before we start the musical program,
Captain Spaulding has kindly consented to tell us about his trip to Africa.
Captain Spaulding.
Me?
My friends, I'm going to tell you of that great mysterious, wonderful continent known as Africa.
Africa is God's country, and he can have it.
Well, sir.
We left New York drunk and early on the morning of February 2.
After 15 days on the water and six on the boat, we finally arrived on the shores of Africa.
We once proceeded 300 miles into the heart of the jungle, where I shot a polar bear.
"This bear was 6' 7" in his stocking feet and had shoes on...
Pardon me, just a moment, Captain.
Just a moment.
I always thought that polar bears lived in the frozen north.
Oh, you did.
Well, this bear was anemic, and he couldn't stand the cold climate.
He was a rich bear and could afford to go away in the winter.
You take care of your animals and I'll take care of mine!
Frozen north, my eye.
From the day of our arrival, we led an active life.
The first morning saw us up at 6:00, breakfasted and back in bed at 7:00.
This was our routine for the first three months.
We finally got so we were back in bed at 6:30.
One morning, I was sitting in front of the cabin, smoking some meat.
Smoking some meat?
Yes, there wasn't a cigar store in the neighborhood.
As I say, I was sitting in front of the cabin when I bagged six tigers.
Oh, Captain!
Six of them biggest I...
Captain, did you catch six tigers?
I bagged them.
I...
I bagged them to go away, but they hung around all afternoon.
They were the most persistent tigers I've ever seen.
The principal animals inhabiting the African jungle are moose, elks and Knights of Pythias.
Of course, you all know what a moose is.
That's big game.
The first day I shot two bucks.
That was the biggest game we had.
As I say, you all know what a moose is.
A moose runs around on the floor and eats cheese and is chased by the cats.
The elks, on the other hand, live up in the hills.
And in the spring, they come down for their annual convention.
It is interesting to watch them come to the water hole.
And you should see them run when they find it's only a water hole!
What they're looking for is an elk-a-hole.
One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas.
How he got in my pajamas, I don't know.
Then we tried to remove the tusks.
The tusks.
That's not so easy to say.
Tusks.
You try that sometime.
Tusks.
Oh, simple.
Tusks.
Pardon me, my name is Spaulding.
I've always wanted to meet you, Mr. Chandler.
As I say, we tried to remove the tusks.
But they were embedded in so firmly that we couldn't bust them.
Of course, in Alabama, the Tuscaloosa.
But, uh, that's entirely irr-elephant to what I was talking about.
We took some pictures of the native girls, but they weren't developed.
But we're going back again in a couple of weeks.
I will...
A very enlightening speech, Captain.
Very enlightening.
Hooray for Captain Spaulding!
Three cheers for Captain Spaulding!
Aw.
Oh, really I...
Three cheers for Captain Spaulding!
Three cheers...
No one asked for the chairs!
Put them right where you found them.
Now, go now.
Go now.
Go on, go on!
Go on with your chairs.
Get out!
Go on, go on, go on, you.
And, now, friends,
Signor Ravelli will oblige us at the piano.
Signor Ravelli.
Signor Ravelli's first selection will be
Somewhere My Love Lies Sleeping With a Male Chorus.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
17, 18, 19, 20...
Say, if you get near a song, play it.
I can't think of the finish.
That's strange.
And I can't think of anything else.
You know what I think?
I think I went past it.
I mean, if you come around again, jump off.
I once kept this up for three days.
You wouldn't consider hush money, would you?
I can't get him now, I've got to wait for inspiration.
It's about time.
Play the song about Montreal.
Montreal?
I'm a Dreamer, Montreal.
I don't know that.
I'll tell you what I do.
I play one of my own compositions by Victor Herbert.
Make it short.
He plays them both well.
Atta boy.
The old red team scored that time.
So did the old blue one.
Why do you push, huh?
Why do you push?
Oh, please, stop them.
Let them alone.
They may exterminate each other.
Come on, come on!
The best thing that can happen for either of them.
And once for old Purdue.
I was afraid of that.
Hey, I thought I had the finish.
I wish you did.
Yours.
Play the song about the Irish chiropodist.
Irish chiropodist?
My Fate is in Your Hands.
Is there a horse in the house?
They've got everything else here.
And, uh, now, Mrs. Rittenrotten...
Uh, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Yes, a slight error.
I have a little surprise for you!
The man is here for the piano.
Oh, Captain.
No, really.
What I meant to say was that, uh...
When I departed from the natives in Africa, I was presented with a gift.
And this gift I'm going to give to you at a very low figure.
Oh, how wonderful, Captain!
Well, no.
Don't be too hasty.
Oh, I just...
This is all hand-painted.
The whole thing was done with the white of an egg.
Well, what is it, Captain?
What is it?
"What is it?" you ask.
This is a hope chest for a guinea pig.
Oh.
What is it?
This magnificent chest...
No, this...
No, this magnificent chest,
I now take great pleasure in presenting to you with my compliments.
Captain, this leaves me speechless.
Well, see that you remain that way.
And, now, ladies and gentlemen...
Come outside and say that.
If we will all adjourn to the library,
Mrs. Rittenhouse has another, and perhaps greater, surprise for us.
Hmm.
This way, Captain.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, how do you pay Hives?
By the week or by the pound?
And now, it is my privilege to reveal the masterpiece of Francois Jacques Dubois Gilbert Beaugard.
No trains will be sold after the magazines leave the depot.
After the Hunt.
There!
I told you you were a great artist.
Shall we spill the beans now?
Let's wait a minute.
Something might happen.
Now, I'm sure, we'd all appreciate a few words from Mr. Chandler, who will tell us of the life and work of the artist, Beaugard.
And keep it clean.
Mr. Chandler.
My friends,
I am quite sure that you are all familiar with Beaugard, and this is perhaps his masterpiece.
In it, he has achieved the greatness in the handling of color and line.
Now, you will see here that I...
Wait!
This is not my picture.
This is a rank imitation!
What do you mean, Mr. Chandler?
Well, here, see for yourself!
You are right.
It is not the Beaugard.
It certainly isn't.
There's a dog missing!
Oh, Captain Spaulding, what shall I do?
Telephone the dog catchers immediately!
They have taken the original and left me this.
Leave it to me.
I'll throw some light on this subject.
Has anyone a match?
What's wrong?
- Hives, Hives, where are you?
- Turn on the lights.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, did you lose that fish again?
Oh, Captain, I'm so worried.
Good heavens!
That one is gone, too!
Oh, this is awful.
The crooks!
The crooks!
They are escaping.
Follow me, men!
Never mind the men, just the women.
Oh, Captain.
Captain!
- Captain!
- Come on.
Right this way.
He went out here someplace.
Excitement.
I never saw anything so funny in all my life.
It was great, and there goes her old party.
Good old Hives.
Wasn't it funny?
Oh, very.
Why, you're not afraid, are you, Hives?
Oh, no, I'm not afraid.
Oh, dear, no.
Only, you see, well, they were talking of having the police here.
And I wouldn't want the police to suspect me.
Why, they wouldn't suspect you.
Oh, yes, they would.
You see, the last time they suspected me,
I got four years.
Hives!
All right, Hives.
Give me the painting and I'll take care of it.
Good.
Come.
Good heavens!
It's gone!
Gone?
I left it in there.
There?
There must be thieves at this party.
Oh, God!
If I'd known that, I never would have come.
Wait a minute.
That professor.
The professor!
I see!
Hives, that's the fellow in the woodpile.
Now, listen.
We've got to get that picture away from him!
Might I suggest some of this?
What...
Oh, very satisfactory in these cases.
A few drops on a handkerchief and the professor will no longer obstruct us.
You are sure it'll do the trick?
Oh, absolutely.
Would you care to try some?
No, thanks, Hives.
Let's find the professor.
I don't see how the thief could have gotten away.
I wonder who it could have been.
It's a good thing we substituted yours.
Suppose that the thief had gotten away with the Beaugard!
Oh, it would be all right if they stole mine.
Oh, darling, I...
I didn't mean that.
But what would mother do?
Why, it's worth $100,000!
How could she have replaced it?
Oh, I understand, dear.
Isn't it exciting?
Just think.
Whoever took it was right in the room with us!
Just like Raffles.
Oh, isn't it romantic?
All the boys I've known
Used to say I was made of stone
I would always leave them alone
In despair
I've been on the pan
I've been called an electric fan
Told I'm even much colder than
Frigidaire
I began to wonder
If I was all wrong
I thought so till you came along
Tell me, dear
Why am I so romantic
When you're near
Why am I so romantic
What a grand feeling
When your lips meet mine
That certain something comes
Stealing up and down my spine
I don't know what it is you do to me
You don't know half of the good you do me
Other boys bore me
They just leave me blue
But why am I so romantic
With you
Tell me, dear
Why am I so romantic
When you're near
Why am I so romantic
What a grand feeling
When your lips touch mine
That certain something comes
Stealing up and down my spine
When we pet close in your arms
You hold me
I forget all that my mother told me
Other girls bore me
They just leave me blue
But why am I so romantic
With you
Oh, Signor Ravelli.
Ah, how do you do?
I've been looking for you all morning.
I was busy all morning, but you could have had me last night.
Signor Ravelli, you've gotta put that painting back.
Painting?
Painting?
What painting?
What are you talking?
The one you changed last night, you remember?
Oh, you mean the picture?
Yes.
Hey, what's the matter for you?
First you want them downstairs, then you want them upstairs.
Then you want them downstairs, then you...
Come on, make up your mind.
Oh, I do thank you for what you've done.
But you've got to get that painting back before the police get here.
Police?
Yes!
They come here?
Yes!
Wait, I give it to you, you put it back.
Come on, come on.
Where's the picture?
What do you mean, "Where's the picture"?
I put him in there.
It's gone.
Somebody take him.
You take him!
Me?
No, I know.
I know.
I...
The fish peddler.
Abie, the fish peddler.
Did mother invite a fish peddler here?
I don't know whether she invite, but he's here.
Come on.
We find him.
Good morning, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Good morning, Mr. Jamison.
And how is Captain Spaulding this morning?
Oh, he had a very bad night.
He didn't sleep a wink.
He went horseback riding in the middle of the night.
I'm sorry.
Yes, I know.
But we've all been very upset.
Bad case.
Yeah.
Uh, good morning, Captain.
Did you enjoy your ride?
What in the world are you looking for?
I lost my horse.
Oh!
Yes, he slipped right out from between me.
I can't understand it.
I had my feet in the syrups, too.
I don't know.
I don't know how he got...
I didn't care about that, but I lost the bit you loaned me.
Never mind.
I'll get you another bit.
Well, that'll be two bits I owe you, then.
Captain, I hope you weren't distressed by last night's unfortunate occurrence.
You mean that dinner you served?
No, the painting that was stolen.
Was there a painting stolen?
I haven't seen a paper in three weeks.
Jamison, as my secretary, why didn't you inform me there was a painting stolen?
What do you think I engaged you for?
But, Captain, I didn't know it.
Well, you should have asked me.
I didn't know it!
- Well, I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.
You're a contemptible cur!
I repeat, sir, you're a contemptible cur!
Oh, if I were a man you'd resent that.
Please keep quiet, will you?
I can get along without you, you know.
I got along without your father, didn't I?
Yes, and your grandfather.
Yes, and your uncle!
Yes, and your uncle!
Yes, and my uncle.
Captain!
I didn't come here to be exonerated.
I beg pardon, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Oh, you do, eh?
Well, I'd like to see you crawl out of a rumble seat.
The police are here, madam.
Oh, the police.
Have them come in.
Oh, so, that's your game, is it?
You can't shut me up.
Captain.
No!
You can talk to my attorney.
Jamison?
Yes, sir.
Take a letter to my lawyers.
I'll show you a thing or two, or three.
I'll show you a thing or three.
Oh, Captain.
Sending for the police.
Take a letter to my lawyers!
Sending for the police, eh?
I say, take a letter to my lawyers!
I am taking it!
Uh, read me what you have so far.
Honorable Charles H. Hungerdunger, in care of Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger and McCormick.
Semicolon.
How do you spell "semicolon"?
All right, make it a comma.
Dear, Elsie...
No, never mind Elsie.
Do you want me to scratch "Elsie"?
Well, if you enjoy that sort of thing, it's quite all right with me.
However, I'm not interested in your private affairs, Jamison.
Begin this way.
Let's start all over again.
Honorable Charles H. Hungerdunger, in care of Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger and McCormick.
Gentlemen, question mark.
- Do you want that, uh...
- in the letter?
No, put that in an envelope.
Now, then, in re yours of the fifth inst.
Yours to hand and beg to rep.
Brackets.
That, uh, we have gone over the ground carefully and we seem to believe,
I-E, to wit, E-G, in lieu, that, uh, despite all our precautionary measures which have been involved...
Uh...
We seem to believe that it is hardly necessary for us to proceed unless we receive an ipso facto that is not negligible at this moment.
Quotes, unquotes and quotes.
Uh, hoping this finds you, I beg you to remain...
Hoping this finds him where?
Well, let him worry about that.
Don't be so inquisitive, Jamison.
Sneak!
I say, hoping this finds you,
I beg to remain, as of June 9th, cordially yours.
Regards.
That's all, Jamison.
I'll show you where I get off.
Sending for the police.
Now read me the letter, Jamison.
"Honorable Charles H. Hungadunga..."
"Hungerdunger."
"Hunga...
Hun." "Hunga..."
"Hungerdunger." That's it.
"Hungerdunger."
"In care of Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger and McCormick."
You've left out a "Hungerdunger."
You left out the main one, too.
Thought you could slip one over on me, eh?
All right, leave it out and put in a windshield wiper instead.
I'll tell you what you do, Jamison.
I'll tell you what.
Make it, uh, make it three windshield wipers and one "Hungerdunger."
They won't all be there when the letter arrives anyhow.
"Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger and McCormick."
"And McCormick."
"Dear Elsie, scratch."
That won't do, Jamison.
That won't go through the mail, the way you got it.
The way you've got the letter, you've got McCormick scratching Elsie.
Now you better turn that around and have Elsie scratch McCormick.
And you better turn McCormick around, too, Jamison.
And see what you can do for me.
"Gentlemen, question mark."
"Gentlemen, question mark"?
Put it on the penultimate, not on the diphthongic.
You wanna brush up on your Greek, Jamison.
Well, get a Greek and brush up on him.
"In re yours of the fifth inst." I see.
Now, you said a lot of things here that I didn't think were important, so I just omitted them.
Well!
Hmm.
Oh, Captain!
Good gracious!
Oh, my!
So, you've just omitted them, eh?
You've just omitted the body of the letter, that's all.
You've left out the body of the letter, that's all.
Yours is not to reason why, Jamison!
You've left out the body of the letter!
All right, send it that way and tell them the body will follow.
Do you want the body in brackets?
No, it'll never get there in brackets.
Put it in a box.
Put it in a box and mark it, uh, "fragilly."
Mark it what?
Mark it "fragilly." F-R-A-G...
Look it up, Jamison.
It's in the dictionary.
Look under "fragile."
Look under the table if you don't find it there.
Uh, "Quotes, unquotes, and quotes."
That's three quotes?
Yes, sir.
Add another quote and make it a gallon.
How much is it, a gallon, Jamison?
Regards.
Regards.
That's a fine letter, Jamison.
That's an epic.
That's dandy.
Now, I want you to make two carbon copies of that letter and throw the original away.
And when you get through with that, throw the carbon copies away.
Just send a stamp airmail.
And that's all.
You may go, Jamison.
I may go, too.
Mrs. Rittenhouse?
Yes?
I'm Inspector Hennessey from headquarters.
How do you do, Inspector?
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Captain Scotland of Spaulding Yard.
No, I'm Captain Spaulding of Scotland Yard.
Please don't make the same mistake again.
I'm glad to know you, Captain.
Well, I should think you would be.
Now, then, inspector, I think between the two of us we can solve the mystery of the stolen painting.
Especially, if you go home.
Inspector, please don't be too hasty about making an arrest.
I don't want my guests embarrassed.
Don't worry.
We won't arrest anybody.
He's lucky if he can stay out of jail himself.
Mr. Jamison, would you mind taking the inspector and his men to the library and showing them the scene of the crime?
Certainly, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Right this way, Inspector.
Come on, boys.
And, Jamison, count the spoons.
Captain, I didn't know you'd been a detective.
There's a whole lot of things you don't know.
I suppose that's so.
You know darn well it's so.
Where were you on the night of June 5, 1774?
I'm afraid I don't know.
You bet you don't know.
Where was I?
I don't know.
Well, I don't know, either.
And if I did know I wouldn't tell you.
Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
Take a number from one to 10.
All right.
All right.
What's the number?
Seven.
That's right.
Seven is right.
I could have done it with one hand if I wanted.
This is no mystery.
I could solve this in five minutes if I wanted to worry.
Captain, I don't want you to worry.
I don't want anything to interfere with your weekend.
Nothing ever interferes with my weekend, and I'll thank you not to get personal, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Captain.
Captain, I assure you...
Where's my secretary?
I didn't mean...
No, no.
Where's my secretary?
Jamison, Jamison?
Captain, you misunderstood me.
Oh!
A more dastardly crack
I've never heard.
Oh.
Captain, please.
I wish I was back in the jungle where men are monkeys.
Captain, I'm so sorry.
Jamison!
Jamison?
No.
Oh, Captain.
Oh, dear.
No!
Good morning, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Good morning.
Perfectly charming party.
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
It's just full of surprises.
So glad you're enjoying yourself.
Oh, Hives.
Hives!
Good morning.
Some breakfast?
Breakfast, nothing.
Did you get the painting?
No, I did not.
I watched all night, but the professor did not sleep in his room.
No?
Strange.
Very strange.
Good heavens, Hives!
What will we do?
I don't know.
Until we see the professor.
You keep an eye on him till I get back with the bottle.
Don't worry, he'll not get away from me this time.
Did you get it?
Good.
Yes, madam.
Now, I'll go ahead and engage him in conversation.
You'll trail behind, and when the proper time comes, see that he gets it.
Very good, madam.
Oh, hello.
I've been looking all over for you.
Where have you been?
What is the matter with this?
What have you got there, the morning papers?
No, that isn't the one I want.
Let me see one of the others.
That still isn't the one I want.
You know what I want.
Out.
Yes, out.
Never mind the birds.
Come on up here.
Sit down.
I want to talk to you.
Don't you like me?
You don't?
Well, I like you.
I like little boys like you.
By the way, how old are you?
Five years old?
Why you're just a baby, aren't you?
Oh!
Aw, isn't that nice?
I like that.
No, no, no!
Now, all joking aside.
Isn't there someone you do like?
Isn't there someone you love?
Now think again.
Isn't there someone you really and truly love?
Is there?
Tell me who.
Why, that's a horse.
You love a horse.
Come on.
Lift him up.
Come on, he's out.
Let us get out.
Arabella.
John, I've been trying to find you.
Ravelli has lost the painting.
Well, I've been looking all over for you.
I found a painting out on the terrace.
Was it the Beaugard?
No.
Oh, yours!
Shh.
Well, if it's not yours and it's not the Beaugard, whose is it?
Where did it come from?
Oh, don't you see?
Someone else came along and substituted it for mine, thinking they were getting away with the original Beaugard.
Somebody swiped my scheme, eh?
Hey, then Chandler never saw your painting after all.
No!
For all I know you may still be a great artist.
Where is this picture?
It's up in my room.
Well, you go get it and I'll get Captain Spaulding.
He'll get to the bottom of this.
And then John found a third painting.
Well, that's very interesting.
Well, fairly interesting.
But we've just got to keep a sharp lookout.
That's all.
Oh, I've got to find it or mother's out of $100,000.
Now, don't worry.
Let me work on this case for 24 hours, and then we'll call in somebody else.
You think it's a mystery now?
Wait till you'll see it tomorrow.
Remember the Charley Ross disappearance?
I worked on that case for 24 hours and they never did find him.
They couldn't find me for five years.
That's me, Captain Yard of Scotland Spaulding.
I always get my women.
Or paintings.
Arabella!
Can you imagine what's happened?
You know that painting I found?
Yes?
Well, it's been stolen from my room.
John!
There you are.
I've been on the case five minutes and there's another painting gone.
I'll bet it's not even five minutes.
I'll bet it not over three.
Now they've got my watch!
This is going too far.
It wasn't going and now it's gone.
The door to my room was locked, too!
Well, how could they get in?
Who could it have been?
Wait a minute.
I think I've got a clue.
No, it's a hair.
A red hair.
The professor?
Oh, no.
No, it couldn't be.
Well, he's been picked this month by the Crook of the Month Club.
Anyhow, we'll investigate it.
You know Conductor Hennessey, don't you?
Inspector!
Inspector yourself.
Now, listen, you know that little redheaded fellow?
The professor?
Yes.
Well, get that gang of flagpole sitters of yours and see if you can find him.
Aye, aye, Captain.
Come on, boys.
He'll get to the bottom of this.
You'll see how quick these boys...
Hey, what's that punk doing there?
They're good policemen.
Didn't take long to find him.
That's right.
This is it.
Yeah, this is it.
But which one is it?
That's the one that was just taken from my room!
Well, we've got that back.
Maybe I got my watch back.
Now, the fob is gone.
Well, I still got the pocket.
Anything I retain now is velvet.
Except the coat.
That's Prince Albert.
Well, all the jokes can't be good.
You've gotta expect that once in a while.
Say, if we could find the fellow that painted this picture, well, we'd have a pretty good clue.
What'd you say?
I said if we could find the fellow that painted this picture, we'd have a pretty good clue.
You just said that!
What a dull conversationalist you turned out to be.
Let me see that a minute.
Will you?
Say, this is signed "Beaugard."
There's the criminal, Beaugard.
No, Beaugard is dead!
Beaugard is dead?
Then it's murder!
Now we've got something.
What you got, Captain?
I got jacks and aces.
What do you got?
That's good.
I was bluffing.
Look at this, Ravelli.
Isn't there something strikes you very funny about this picture?
Oh, come, come.
It isn't as funny as all that.
Did you ever see a tree like that?
Tree?
That's a spinach.
That can't be spinach.
Where's the egg?
Well, it could be spinach.
Look, all the sand laying around there.
You mean, it's an old spinach custom?
No, it's not that, Ravelli.
Anything but that.
Oh.
No, Cap.
That's all right.
It's my mistake.
You know what that is?
That's coleslaw.
Coleslaw?
Yeah, it's a coleslaw.
Did you ever see coleslaw like that?
Sure, look at this one.
No, I don't want one on your lip, now.
Did you ever see anything like that?
Did you ever see anything like that?
You know what this is?
This is a left-handed painting.
Look, there's a signature.
That's right, it's in the right-hand corner.
That's right.
This is either a left-handed painting or a vegetable dinner.
Now, if we can find the left-handed person that painted this, we'll have The Trial of Mary Dugan with sound.
Well, I saw that.
Good-bye.
Now, you wait here.
I'm gonna need you.
Now, look.
We mustn't lose this.
This is evidence.
Now, take it to your room and leave the door open this time.
We'll try that.
And not a word about this to anybody, not even to me.
Ravelli, we have got to find the left-handed painting.
Yes, the left-handed painter.
Now in a case like this the first thing to do is to find the motive.
Now, what could have been the motive of the guy who has swapped the Beaugard?
I got it!
Robbery!
Would you mind going out and crossing the boulevard when the lights are against you?
See, Cap, sit down.
You understand, I got an idea how to find this painting.
In a case like this that is so mysterious, you gotta get at the clues.
You gotta use the Sherlock Holmes method.
Now, you go about it like this.
You say to yourself, "What happened?"
And the answer come back, "Something was stolen."
Then you say to yourself, "What was stolen?"
And the answer come back, "A painting."
What are you, a ventriloquist?
Now you say to yourself, "Where was this painting stolen?"
And the answer come back, "In this house."
Now, so far I'm right, eh?
Well, it's pretty hard to be wrong if you keep answering yourself all the time.
Now you go a little further, and you say to yourself,
"Who stole the painting?"
This is a very, very important question.
Captain, you get the answer, you've got the solution to the whole thing.
Especially if you find the picture.
Now you take all the clues.
You put them together.
What do you got, eh?
A bread pudding.
No, here's what we got.
Something was stolen.
Stolen where?
In this house.
Stolen by who?
Somebody in the house.
Now to find the painting, you only gotta do is go to everybody in the house and ask them if they took it.
You know, I could rent you out as a decoy for duck hunters?
You say you're gonna go to everybody in the house and ask them if they took the painting?
Suppose nobody in the house took the painting.
Go to the house next door.
That's great.
Suppose there isn't any house next door.
Well, then of course we gotta build one.
Well, now you're talking.
What kind of house do you think we ought put up?
Well, I'll tell ya, Cap.
You see.
My idea of a house is something nice and small and comfortable.
That's the way I feel about it.
I don't want anything elaborate.
Just a little place that I can call home and tell the wife I won't be there for dinner.
I see.
You just want a telephone booth.
No, in that case, I'll get in touch with Chic Sales.
Now, what do you say, Cap, we build right about here?
Here?
Yeah, right about here.
Oh, I'd like something over here if I could get it.
I don't like junior crossing the tracks on his way to the reform school.
I don't like junior at all, as a matter of fact.
All right, all right.
We got something over there.
And believe me, that's convenient.
That's very convenient.
Well, all you gotta do is open the door, step outside and there you are.
There you are?
Yeah.
"There you are" where?
Outside.
Well, suppose you want to get back in again?
You had no right to go out.
Well, don't do anything until I hear from you, will you?
Say, maybe that's the painting down in the cellar!
That's no cellar.
That's the roof.
That's the roof?
Down there?
Yeah, you see, we keep the roof in the basement, so when the rain comes, the chimney don't get wet.
I'm going out and get X-rayed.
I'll be back in a little while.
I may be wonderful, but I think you're wrong, Ravelli.
Hey, wait, don't get up excited.
Come here.
Now, look, here's the rooms.
Those are the rooms?
Yeah.
Right, there's the rooms.
This is your room.
This is my room and this is the maid's room.
Oh, I'd have to go through your room?
Ah!
That's all right.
I won't be in it.
Say, Ravelli, you couldn't put the maid in your room, eh?
What makes you think I couldn't?
Well, there's gonna be a lot of traffic in there.
I can see that.
Well, what do you say?
You ready to sign the lease?
Well, it's a little premature.
I'd like to discuss it with my husband.
Could you come back this evening when he is home?
Hey, you married?
Why, I've got a girl as big as you are.
All right, get me one.
Don't get vulgar, Ravelli.
Ravelli, how about the painting?
We take care of that, all right.
Now, I tell you what my idea is.
I think the kitchen should be white.
Outside green, inside cerise with blue...
The painting, I say.
How about the painting, Ravelli?
All right, what do you think I talk?
That's painting.
The kitchen white, outside green, inside cerise.
The painting.
The painting that was stolen.
Stolen?
Don't you remember Mrs. Rittenhouse lost a valuable Beaugard painting worth $100,000?
Don't you remember that?
No, I'm a stranger around here.
I no remember that.
What do you think I am, one of the early settlers?
Ravelli, don't you remember,
Mrs. Beaugard lost a valuable Rittenhouse painting worth $100,000?
Don't you remember that?
No, but I've seen you someplace before.
Well, I don't know where I was, but I'll stay out of there in the future.
Hey, Cap, it come to me like a flash!
This painting wasn't stolen.
Huh!
You know what happened?
This painting, Cap, is disappear.
Vanish.
Yes, it disappear.
And you know what make it disappear?
You'll never guess, Cap.
What do you think make this painting disappear, eh?
Moths!
Moths eat it!
Left-handed moths.
Go away.
Go away.
I'll be all right in a minute.
Left-handed moths ate the painting, eh?
That's my own solution.
I wish you were in it.
Left-handed moths ate the painting.
You know, I'd buy you a parachute if I thought it wouldn't open.
Hey, I got pair of shoes.
That's crazy.
Come on, let's get out and get the reward.
We solved it.
You solved it!
The credit is all yours.
The painting was eaten by a left-handed moth.
Hey, I know, we did a good day's work.
How do you feel?
Tired?
It's worth it.
Maybe you ought to lie down for a couple of years, eh?
Well...
Why don't you just lie down until rigor mortis sets in?
Yeah.
That's nothing.
Come on, Ravelli.
I'll show you how we get the painting.
Yeah.
We go to court and we get out a writ of habeas corpus.
You're gonna get rid of what?
Oh, I should never have started that way.
I can see that.
I say, we'll go to court and we'll get a writ of habeas corpus.
Yeah, scorpus, scorpus.
Didn't you ever see a habeas corpus?
No, but I see Habeas Irish Rose.
Hey, it's okay.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Mr. Chandler, why don't you go down to the beach with the others?
I'm sure you'd feel better.
If I had my Beaugard, I'm sure I'd feel better.
Oh, but we're doing everything we can.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, Mrs. Rittenhouse!
I have it.
The Beaugard!
Wonderful!
My Beaugard!
Wait, this is not my Beaugard!
This is a rank imitation.
Where did you find it?
Why, in Mr. uh...
In Mr. Parker's room, madam.
Parker!
One thing is certain!
The man who made that, stole the Beaugard!
Hives, find Mr. Parker and ask him to come here.
Certainly, madam.
Wait a minute.
My men will bring him in.
Go out and get Mr. Parker.
Oh, what's the matter with this?
Well, look at here.
You've only to look at it once to see what it is.
It is a rank nothing!
Mother, what's wrong?
I can come in without being pulled in.
Mr. Parker, something very mysterious has occurred.
And I'm afraid, you're the only one who can explain.
I'd be only too glad to if I can.
Nothing mysterious about it.
We found this in your room.
Now, what have you done with the original Beaugard?
Come clean!
Come on, out with it.
Really, I think I would be wise...
Well, I have nothing to say.
Except that I don't know where the Beaugard is.
Oh, how is it we found this in your room?
Come on!
You better come with me.
You can't take him!
Arabella!
Sing one song
For my old Kentucky home
For my old
Kentucky home
Far away
So far away
This program is coming to you from the House of David.
He's either got that suit on upside down or there is no law of gravity.
Einstein or no one.
My tie!
Oh, Captain, what shall I do?
They're going to arrest John.
Who's going to arrest John?
I am, Captain.
Oh, you are, eh?
Well, let me tell you something.
The first thing they teach you at Scotland Yard is never to arrest an innocent man.
But he's not innocent.
I'll have to arrest him just the same.
By all means or nobody will be safe here.
You can't arrest him!
- I stole it!
- Arabella!
Don't listen to her, Officer.
I did it.
They're both lying.
I did it!
I did it with my little hatchet.
Eh, he's crazy.
He's crazy.
I confess, I did it.
Or maybe nobody stole the painting.
Maybe there was no painting.
That's right, maybe there was no painting.
I saw it.
Cut out all the talk.
Who stole the painting?
I did.
Good gracious!
What!
What in the...
What?
You?
You took the picture?
Where is it?
Oh, that's a horse.
The Beaugard!
That is my Beaugard!
No, that isn't your Beaugard.
Don't be ridiculous.
I paid $100,000 for this painting.
I know what I bought.
Well, look at the signature.
"John Parker."
Somebody changed it.
That is my Beaugard!
That is the Beaugard, I tell you!
There it is!
Ah, but that one.
That has the color, the depth, the soul of the Beaugard!
Only a master could have produced a painting like that.
Oh, John.
You mean to tell me that you painted that?
Yes, sir.
Why, young man, you're a genius!
You're a genius!
I commission you to paint a portrait of me immediately!
Well, you better wait until tomorrow.
I'm gonna be busy all day.
Get it?
You better come with me, young fellow!
Don't take him away, Officer.
He returned the paintings.
Pardon me, my name is Spaulding.
I've always wanted to meet you.
All right.
I'll let him go this time.
But I want to give you some advice.
You're running around with the wrong kind of people.
You wanna be a crook?
Oh, why don't you go home?
He's got no home.
Go home for a few nights and stay home.
Don't you know your poor, old mother sits there sits there night after night after night.
...waiting to hear your steps on the stairs.
He got no stairs.
And I can see a little light burning in burning in the window.
No, you can't.
The gas company turned it off.
What I'm telling you is for your own good.
And if you listen to me...
You can't go wrong.
This may go on for years.
Now, there's just one thing...
I can't understand what's delaying that coffee pot.
Where's the cream?
Well, you certainly surprised me!
Me, too.
I thought he had more than that.
It's no use giving you any advice.
Captain, this time I'm afraid I'll have to take him.
Come on, here!
Come on!
Come on!
Oh, what's he doing?
Oh, my dear, oh!
Hey, what's the idea?
Jamison, take a letter to my lawyer!
No, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, no, no!
Not...
Oh.
Oh, to think that I've got to go so young.
Good.
Come on, now.
Let's get out of here before they all wake up.
Hurry up!
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
You must do your best tonight Be on your toes, men
There's another guest tonight It's one of those men
Who are being feted by the smart set.
We'll see that he gets what he deserves
Treat him as they do a king in manner royal
Like a subject to a king you must be loyal
On this object you must have your heart set
We'll do nothing to get on his nerves
Again I mention Be on your toes, men
He craves attention He's one of those men
Yes, sir, we will give him just what he deserves
Oh, Hives?
Oh, yes, Mrs. Rittenhouse?
I'd like to make a few changes in the assignment of the rooms.
Very good, madam.
Suppose you put Mr. Chandler in the blue suite.
And Captain Spaulding, as guest of honor, will have the green duplex with the two baths.
Two, madam?
Why, yes.
I think the Captain would like two baths, don't you?
Well, if he's just returned from Africa, he may need two baths.
Mr. Roscoe W. Chandler.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, well!
Mr. Chandler.
So nice to see you.
The famous Beaugard, as I have promised.
Mr. Chandler, how can I ever express my gratitude?
Oh, it's nothing.
Nothing?
You return from Europe with a masterpiece valued at $100,000, and instead of displaying it yourself, you allow me to unveil it at my party in honor of Captain Spaulding.
You call that nothing?
Mrs. Rittenhouse, I...
Uh, will you please remove that to the place where it is to be exhibited?
Very good, sir.
And uh, very careful, please.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, you think that is something?
It is nothing compared to what I would like to do for you.
You are a very beautiful woman.
No, no, Mr. Chandler.
Well, maybe I'm wrong.
What?
Please, do not go, Mrs. Rittenhouse,
I love you.
I know, but...
Do not take away your hand.
I tell you, I love you.
Careful...
Hello, Mother.
Playing house?
Well, uh, if you'll pardon me.
Have you seen Johnny Parker?
I wish you'd get Johnny Parker out of your mind and show more respect to Mr. Chandler.
The trouble with you is you don't take these social affairs seriously.
What would you suggest, Mom?
Suicide?
I would suggest...
Mrs. Rittenhouse, Captain Spaulding has arrived!
Splendid.
Oh, I'm so glad.
My friends, Captain Spaulding has arrived.
At last we are to meet him The famous Captain Spaulding
From climates hot and scalding The Captain has arrived
Most heartily we'll greet him with plain and fancy cheering
Until he's hard of hearing The Captain has arrived
At last the Captain
Has arrived
Mr. Horatio W. Jamison, field secretary to Captain Spaulding.
I represent the Captain who insists on my informing you
Of these conditions under which he camps here
In one thing he is very strict he wants his women young and thin
And as for men, he won't have any tramps here
And as for men, he won't have any tramps here
There must be no tramps
The men must all be very old the women warm, the champagne cold
It's under these conditions that he camps here
I'm announcing Captain Geoffrey Spaulding
He's announcing Captain Geoffrey Spaulding
Oh, dear, he is coming
At last he's here
Well, what do I owe you?
What?
From Africa to here, $1.85?
That's an outrage.
I told you not to take me through Australia.
You know it's all ripped up.
You should have come right up Lincoln Boulevard.
Where do you come to that stuff?
Turn around the rear end, I wanna see your license plates.
I don't think, you're on the square.
Oh, Captain Spaulding.
I'll attend to you later.
Oh, Captain Spaulding.
Why you're one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen.
That's not saying much for you.
Captain Spaulding,
Rittenhouse Manor is entirely at your disposal.
Well, I'm certainly grateful for this magnificent washout.
Uh, "turnout," and uh, now I'd like to say a few words.
Hello I must be going
I cannot stay, I came to say I must be going
I'm glad I came, but just the same I must be going...
La la
For my sake you must stay
If you should go away you'd spoil this party I am throwing
I'll stay a week or two
I'll stay the summer through
But I am telling you
I must be going.
Before you go will you oblige us
And tell us of your deeds so glowing
I'll do anything you say In fact, I'll even stay
Good
But I must be going
There's something that I'd like to say
That he's too modest to relate
The Captain is a moral man Sometimes he finds it trying
This fact I'll emphasize with stress
I never take a drink unless
Somebody's buying
The Captain is a very moral man
If he hears anything obscene he'll naturally repel it
I hate a dirty joke I do
Unless it's told by someone who knows how to tell it
The Captain is a very moral man
Hooray for Captain Spaulding the African explorer
Did someone call me Schnorer
Hooray, hooray, hooray
He went into the jungles where all the monkeys throw nuts
If I stay here I'll go nuts
Hooray, hooray, hooray
He put all his reliance in courage and defiance
And risked his life for science
Hey, hey
He is the only white man who covered every acre
I think I'll try and make her
Hooray, hooray, hooray
He put all his reliance in courage and defiance
And risked his life for science
Hey, hey
Hooray for Captain Spaulding the African explorer
He brought his name undying fame
And that is why we say hooray, hooray, hooray
My friends, I'm highly gratified at this magnificent display of effusion.
And I want you to know...
Hooray for Captain Spaulding the African explorer
He brought his name undying fame And that is why we say
Hooray, hooray, hooray
My friends, I'm highly gratified at this magnificent display of effusion.
And I want you to know...
Hooray for Captain Spaulding the African explorer
He brought his name undying fame And that is why we say
Hooray, hooray, hooray
My friends, I'm highly gratified at this magnificent display of effusion.
I want you to know...
Hooray for Captain Spaulding the African explorer
Well, somebody's got to do it!
Captain Spaulding?
It is indeed a great honor to welcome you to my poor home.
Oh, it isn't so bad.
Needless to say...
Wait a minute, I think you're right.
It is pretty bad.
As a matter of fact, it's one of the frowsiest looking joints I've ever seen.
Why, Captain...
Where did you get your wallpaper?
You're letting this place run down, and what's the result?
You're not getting the class of people that you used to.
Why, you've got people here that look like you!
Now, I'll tell you what to do.
We'll put up a sign outside, "Place under new management."
We'll set up a 75-cent meal that will knock their eyes out.
After we knock their eyes out, we can charge them anything we want.
Now sign here and give me your check for $1,500.
I want to tell you, madam, with this insurance policy, you've provided for your little ones and for your old age...
Which will be here in a couple of weeks now, if I'm any judge of horseflesh.
And now, madam, "I feel that the time has come," the walrus...
Captain Spaulding!
Captain Spaulding!
You stand before me as one of the bravest men of all times.
All right, I'll do that.
In the dark forests of Africa, there has been no danger you have not dared.
You mind if I don't smoke?
Fearlessly, you have blazed new trails, scornful of the lion's roar and the cannibal's tom-tom.
Says you!
Never once in all those weary months did your footsteps falter.
Cowardice is unknown to you.
Fear is not in you!
Oh, pardon me, a caterpillar...
Put him over here.
Oh, it must have been the caterpillar that frightened him.
Oh, dear.
This is unfortunate.
Don't stand there.
Get the whiskey!
Get the whiskey.
The whiskey?
The whiskey?
Where is the whiskey?
It's in my little black bag in the right-hand corner.
Signor Emanuel Ravelli.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Where's the dining room?
I'm surprised.
Say, I used to know a fellow who looked exactly like you, by the name of, uh, Emanuel Ravelli.
Are you his brother?
I am Emanuel Ravelli.
You're Emanuel Ravelli?
I'm Emanuel Ravelli.
Well, no wonder you look like him, but I insist there is a resemblance.
Hey, he thinks I look alike.
Well, If you do, it's a tough break for both of you.
You are one of the musicians, but you were not due until tomorrow.
Couldn't come tomorrow.
That's too quick.
So, you're lucky they didn't come yesterday.
We were busy yesterday, but we charge just the same.
This is better than exploring.
What do you fellows get an hour?
Oh, for playing, we get a $10 an hour.
I see.
What do you get for not playing?
$12 an hour.
Well, clip me off a piece of that.
Now, for rehearsing, we make special rate, that's $15 an hour.
That's for rehearsing?
Yes, that's for rehearsing.
And what do you get for not rehearsing?
You couldn't afford it.
You see, If we don't rehearse, we don't play.
- And If we don't play...
- That runs into money.
How much will you want to run into an open manhole?
Just the cover charge.
Drop in sometime.
Sewer.
Oh, we cleaned that up pretty well.
Well, let's see how we stand.
Flat-footed.
Yesterday we didn't come.
You remember, yesterday we didn't come.
Oh, I remember.
Yeah, that's $300.
Yesterday you didn't come.
That's $300?
That's $300.
That's reasonable.
I can see that, all right.
Now, today we did come.
That's, uh...
That's $100 you owe us.
Hey, I bet I'm gonna lose on the deal.
Tomorrow we leave.
That's worth about...
A million dollars.
Yeah, that's all right for me, but I got a partner.
What?
Partner?
The Professor!
The gates swung open and a Fig Newton entered.
How do you do?
Goodness!
You haven't got chocolate, have you?
He's got everything.
Hives, take the Professor's hat and coat.
And send for the fumigators.
Oh, my goodness!
Bonjour!
Hey, don't you see.
There are ladies present.
What do you think this is?
Put that hat down.
Will you?
What you do there?
Get out.
Don't go near those guns!
A little more to the right.
Ah-ah, that's better.
Now, see that the drape is well-hung.
The mistress will inspect it before the unveiling.
Hello, Hives!
Mrs. Whitehead, this is a surprise.
And how about me?
Miss Grace, you've grown so in the last year.
You haven't lost any weight, yourself.
No.
Unfortunately not.
You know, Hives, it seems strange to find you working here instead of in our own home.
Well, after you left for Europe,
Mrs. Rittenhouse was good enough to make me an offer.
Lovely!
Oh, by the way, Hives, what's the secret about the painting?
No secret.
It's Beaugard's After the Hunt.
The original?
Most original.
Be careful!
Where did she get hold of that, do you suppose?
Is it very valuable?
Is it?
It must be worth a fortune.
But sis, it looks as if we yield the social honors of the season to Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Well, isn't there something we can do?
We might shoot ourselves.
I'd rather shoot Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Say, I have an idea.
I copied that painting in art school a year ago.
Well, what of it?
But, I still don't get it.
I'll go home and get the copy.
We'll substitute it for the original.
And when she unveils it, what'll she have?
An imitation, and I must admit, a very poor one.
Grace, you're wonderful.
That's what I've been telling you.
I won't be long.
All right.
See you later.
Oh, Hives?
Do you still feel there's a strong bond between us?
Why most certainly, Mrs. Whitehead.
Strong enough for you to do me a big favor?
Why, anything at all.
Well, suppose I were to ask you to take away the Beaugard?
What?
You mean...
Oh, just temporarily, of course.
And substitute something of my own.
Well, I should consider it rather an unusual request.
It is, Hives.
But somehow I still think of you as one of the Whiteheads.
You may count on me.
My soul is yours.
Even though my body may belong to Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Why, Hives?
Oh, Mrs. Whitehead.
Arabella!
May I present, Mr. Parker?
Oh, of the Massachusetts Parkers?
Why, no.
Oh, then the southern Parkers?
Oh, no!
The central Parkers.
You know, the, uh, benches and trees.
I see!
Oh!
I don't like that woman.
Well, never mind.
You come over here and sit down and tell me whom you do like.
Oh!
So, that's your game.
Now, listen, do you really love me?
Why don't you marry me and find out.
Marry you?
Ha!
On what?
Hmm.
Last year, I sold two paintings.
One at $100 and one at $50.
Could we live on $150 a year?
Oh, we wouldn't need any money!
I've got a charge account in every shop on 5th Avenue.
Well, if I had any brains,
I'd give up painting and get a regular job.
You know, I had a cousin who made $50,000 on Wall Street last year.
Oh, I don't want to marry your cousin.
I'm a darn fool.
I want to marry you.
Say, why don't we get that old bluff, Chandler, to buy a portrait from you?
Chandler?
Ha!
What does he know about art?
Well, the less he knows, the easier it will be for you to sell him.
They're right upstairs.
You can't miss them.
Go around to the other side.
Mrs. Rittenhouse?
Yoo-hoo!
Oh, Captain Spaulding, how are you?
Tell me, are you alone?
Captain, I don't understand.
What?
You don't understand being alone?
Don't give me that innocent stuff or you'll be alone!
A big cluck like you turning cute on me!
Mrs. Rittenhouse?
Yes?
Oh, pardon me.
You've been affected like this yourself, haven't you?
Oh, no, Captain.
Well, you will be.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, ever since I met you,
I've swept you off my feet.
Something has been throbbing within me.
Oh, it's been beating like the incessant tom-tom in the primitive jungle.
There's something that I must ask you.
What is it, Captain?
Would you wash out a pair of socks for me?
Captain, I'm surprised.
Well, that maybe surprise you, but it's been on my mind for weeks.
It's just my way of telling you that I love you.
That's all.
I love you.
I...
Captain...
Mrs. Whitehead.
I beg your pardon.
I beg your pardon.
Am I intruding?
Are you intruding?
Just when I had her on the five-yard line.
I should say you are intruding!
I should say you are intruding!
Pardon me,
I was using the subjunctive instead of the past tense.
Yes, we're way past tents.
We're living in bungalows now.
This is a mechanical age, of course.
Mrs. Whitehead, you haven't met Captain Spaulding, have you?
Why, no.
I haven't.
How are you?
How are you?
I'm fine, thank you.
And how are you?
And how are you?
That leaves you one up.
Did anyone ever tell you you had beautiful eyes?
No.
Well, you have.
And so have you!
He shot her a glance.
As a smile played around his lips.
Yes.
I don't think I've ever seen four more beautiful eyes in my life.
Well, three, anyway.
You know, you two girls have everything.
You're tall and short, and slim and stout, blonde and brunette, and that's just the kind of a girl I crave!
We three would make an ideal couple.
Why, you've got beauty, charm, money.
You have that money, haven't you?
Because, if you haven't, we can quit right now.
The Captain is charming, isn't he?
I'm fascinated.
I'm fascinated, too.
Right on the arm.
Fascinated.
Whim-wham.
If I were Eugene O'Neill, I could tell you what I really think of you two.
You know, you're very fortunate the theater guild isn't putting this on.
And so is the guild.
Pardon me while I have a strange interlude.
Why, you couple of baboons, what makes you think I'd marry either one of you?
Strange how the wind blows tonight.
It has a thin, eerie voice.
Reminds me of poor old Marsden.
How happy I could be with either of these two if both of them just went away.
Well, what do you say, girls?
What do you say?
Will you marry me?
But, Captain, which one of us?
Both of you.
Let's all get married.
This is my party.
Party.
Party.
Here I am talking of parties.
I came down here for a party.
What happens?
Nothing.
Not even ice cream.
The gods look down and laugh.
This would be a better world for children if the parents had to eat the spinach.
Well, what do you say, girls?
What do you say?
Are we all going to get married?
All of us?
All of us!
But that's bigamy.
Yes, and it's big of me, too!
It's big of all of us.
Let's be big for a change.
I'm sick of these conventional marriages.
One woman and one man was good enough for your grandmother, but who wants to marry your grandmother?
Nobody.
Not even your grandfather.
Think of the honeymoon, strictly private.
I wouldn't let another woman in on this.
Well, maybe one or two, but no men.
I may not go, myself.
Are you suggesting companionate marriage?
Well, it's got advantages.
You could live with your folks, and I could live with your folks.
And you, you could sell Fuller Brushes.
Living with your folks.
Living with your folks, the beginning of the end.
Drab dead yesterdays shutting out beautiful tomorrows.
Hideous stumbling footsteps creaking along the misty corridors of time.
In those corridors, I see figures, strange figures, weird figures.
Steel 186, anaconda 74,
American Can 138.
Well, let's see.
Where were we?
Oh, yes!
We were about to get married.
Well, what do you think?
Do you think we really ought to get married?
I think marriage is a very noble institution.
It's the foundation of the American home.
Yes, but the trouble is you can't enforce it.
It was put over on the American people...
While our boys were over there and while our girls were over here.
You know that I've been waiting at the bottom of these stairs for years for just such a moment as this.
Why, Captain, where are you going?
I'm sorry, ladies, I'm sorry,
But, uh, I'm afraid we're gonna have to postpone the wedding for a few days, maybe for a few years.
Before I get married, I'm going to sow a couple of wild oats.
The Captain's so amusing.
Isn't he charming?
So that's the famous Beaugard, eh?
It's a great picture, isn't it?
Oh, you've seen it before?
Seen it?
I spent three days in Paris copying it.
You did?
Well, me and a million other young artists.
Oh.
I bet your copy was better than any of them.
Well, it wasn't bad at that.
I'll show it to you sometime.
Listen.
What?
Mother's going to unveil it tonight.
Yeah.
Suppose...
Suppose when she unveils it, it's not the Beaugard at all?
Suppose it's yours!
You mean, put my copy in place of the Beaugard?
Exactly.
Well, Arabella, you're crazy.
What good would that do?
What good?
Listen.
They'll unveil it.
Chandler will tell everybody how fine it is.
They'll all cheer their heads off, and then we'll tell them who really painted it.
They'll say, you're a great artist.
You'll get six commissions for paintings, and we can be married and divorced in no time.
Well, that sounds great.
But what if they don't like my painting?
What then?
Well, isn't the chance worth taking?
Ah, I see you're admiring my picture.
Yes, yes.
Your picture?
Yes, my picture.
Well, it don't look like you.
Hey, wait, wait.
Someplace I met you before, because you're face is a very familiar.
Well, after all, I'm one of the most well-known men in America.
The newspapers will keep on running my photograph.
You're not Abe Kabbible?
Oh, nonsense!
All right.
Hey, wait.
If you're not Abe Kabbible, who are you?
Now, please.
Chandler is my name, Roscoe W. Chandler.
Yeah, but I don't care about the name, you see.
Someplace I met you before, because your face is very familiar.
Now, wait.
Let me see,
Were you ever in Sing Sing?
Please!
No, no, Sing.
I got it.
I got it.
Joliet?
Leave me alone!
No?
All right, don't run away.
Don't run away.
Leavenworth?
Oh, listen here, I have never been in these places.
I spend most of my time in Europe.
Europe.
I got it now.
I know.
You come from Czechoslovakia.
You are wrong, I tell you...
You come from...
Hey, hey, come here, come here.
I tell you...
Please get away from me.
Hey, you remember him.
Who was he?
He comes from Czechoslovakia.
You are wrong, I tell you.
I told you before, you are mistaken.
He comes from Czechoslovakia, and I know who it is.
That's Abie the fish peddler from Czechoslovakia.
Ridiculous, I tell you.
You are wrong.
Wait, wait, wait.
We prove it.
He had a birthmark.
Remember?
Oh, please!
What are you...
Leave me alone.
On the arm.
On the arm.
On the leg.
On the foot, up here, on the mustache.
Ah-ha!
There it is.
There is the birthmark.
Abie the fish man.
I confess.
I was, I was Abie the peddler.
Well, how did you get to be Roscoe W. Chandler?
Say, how did you get to be an Italian?
Never mind.
Whose confession is this?
Well, boys, for heaven's sake, don't say about this to anybody, and I think we can come to some agreement.
Some arrangement which would be, uh, mutually satisfactory.
Money, money.
Yeah.
Shall we say, uh, $500?
Piker!
$500.
Well, that is all the cash I have.
$500?
Well, all right.
I tell you what we do.
We'll take your I.O.U.
I've given you my best offer and that is all you will get.
That's all you give?
Yes.
Abie the fish man Abie the fish man
Abie the fish man Abie the fish man
Please be quiet, quiet!
Please.
Now, come here.
Now, listen here.
I have here a check for $5,000.
Now, I give it to you.
Yeah?
Hey.
Is it good?
Well, of course it is good.
Who would give me a bad check?
I would.
Hey, see if it's good.
All right, if you don't want the check, then that is all you will get.
That's all we get?
Yeah.
Abie the fish man Abie the fish man Please, quiet!
Abie the fish man Abie the fish man Quiet!
Abie the fish man
Here!
Give me that handkerchief.
My tie!
Where is my tie?
I...
You're nothing but a pair of thieves.
That's all.
I get a the tie.
Well, what do you got?
The birthmark!
Hey, hey, where's your tie?
Well, I...
That's a fine way for a millionaire to be running around, open at the neck.
Have you got garters?
Of course, I have garters.
Here.
Oh!
They've taken my garters, too!
A likely story.
Turning collegiate on me, eh?
Have you got socks?
Certainly.
Here they are.
Oh, yeah.
You have got socks.
They look pretty old to me, too.
Whose are they?
My old socks.
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Spaulding, Captain Spaulding.
I am Roscoe W. Chandler.
Well, this is a treat, your treat.
You have heard about me?
Yes, I've heard about you for a great many years, Mr. Chandler, and I'm getting pretty darn sick of it, too.
Quite naturally, I've also heard of the great Captain Spaulding.
Well, that's fine.
I've heard of you and you've heard of me.
Now, have you ever heard the one about the two Irishmen?
Oh, yes!
Now that I've got you in hysterics, let's get to business.
My name is Spaulding, Captain Spaulding.
I am Roscoe W. Chandler.
And I'm Geoffrey T. Spaulding.
I bet you don't know what the "T" stands for.
Uh, Thomas?
Edgar.
You were close, though.
You were close, though, and you still are, I'll bet.
Now, this is what I want to talk to you about, Mr. Chandler.
How would you like to finance a scientific expedition?
Well, that is a question.
Yes that is a question.
You certainly know a question when you see it.
I congratulate you, Mr. Chandler, and that brings us right back to where we were.
How would you like to finance a scientific expedition?
Well, is there any particular kind of an expedition you had in mind?
Well, I tell you.
I'm getting along in years now.
There's one thing I always wanted to do before I quit.
What is that?
Retire.
Now would you be interested in a proposition of that kind?
You know, I've always had an idea that my retirement would be the greatest contribution to science the world has ever known.
This is your chance, Mr. Chandler.
When I think what you have done for this country...
And by the way, what have you done for this country?
Oh, well.
I've always tried to do what I could, especially in the world of art.
Art?
Well, I don't know how we drifted around that.
But what is your opinion of art?
I am very glad you asked me!
I withdraw the question.
This fellow takes things seriously.
It isn't safe to ask him a simple question.
Tell me Mr. Chandler, where are you planning on putting your new opera house?
Oh, I thought I should put it somewhere near Central Park.
I see.
Why don't you put it right in Central Park?
Could we do that?
Sure.
Do it at night when no one is looking.
Why don't you put it in the reservoir and get the whole thing over with?
Of course, that might interfere with the water supply.
But after all, we must remember that art is art.
Still, on the other hand, water is water, isn't it?
And east is east, and west is west.
And If you take cranberries and stew them like applesauce, it tastes more like prunes than rhubarb does.
Now, uh, now, you tell me what you know.
Well, I would be very glad to give you my opinion.
Well, that's dandy.
I'll ask you for them someday.
Remind me, will you?
I'll tell you what, could you come to my office at 10:00 tomorrow morning?
If I'm not there, ask for Mr. Jamison, that's my secretary, and If he sees you, I'll discharge him.
That's a date, now.
Saturday at 3:00.
No, you better make it Tuesday, I'm going to Europe Monday.
Pardon me.
My name is Spaulding.
I've always wanted to meet you, Mr. Chandler.
Tell me.
What do you think of the traffic problem?
What do you think of the marriage problem?
What do you think of at night when you go to bed, you beast?
Well, I'll tell you...
I'd rather not discuss it any further.
Remember, there are children present.
Well, you see, my dear Captain, in the last analysis, it is a question of money.
The nickel today is not what it used to be 10 years ago.
I'll go further than that.
I'll get off at the depot.
The nickel is not what it was 15 years ago.
You know what this country needs today?
What?
A seven-cent nickel.
Yes, sir.
We've been using the five-cent nickel in this country since 1492.
Now, that's pretty near 100 years, daylight saving.
Now, why not give the seven-cent nickel a chance?
If that works out, next year we could have an eight-cent nickel.
Think what that would mean.
You could go to a newsstand buy a three-cent newspaper and get the same nickel back.
One nickel, carefully used, would last a family a lifetime.
Captain Spaulding, I think that is a wonderful idea.
You do, eh?
Yes.
Then there can't be much to it.
Forget about it.
Well, uh...
Well, tell me, Captain Chandler, uh, excuse me, Spaulding.
Spaulding, Spaulding, that's right.
Yeah.
I'm Spaulding, you're Chandler.
Let's have no more of that either, eh?
It's bad enough being Spaulding.
Well, tell me, Captain Spaulding,
Spaulding is the name?
That's right.
That's right.
I'm, I'm Chan...
I'm Spaulding...
Spaulding...
Could I look at a program a minute?
I might be the "News Weekly," for all he knows, or "Coming Next Week."
Well, tell me, Captain Spaulding, you've been quite a traveler.
Uh, what do you think about South America?
I'm going there soon, you know.
Is that so?
Where are you going?
Uruguay.
Well, you go Uruguay and I'll go mine.
Say, how long has this been going on?
Let's change the subject.
Take the foreign situation.
Take Abyssinia.
I'll tell you, you take Abyssinia, and I'll take a hot butterscotch sundae on rye bread.
Let's go and see what the boys in the back room will have.
But, my...
Let's see how yours compares with the original.
All right, let's.
Oh!
I don't see any difference.
Well, look closer.
Maybe, you'll find it's better.
Oh, you!
You seen my partner?
No.
Oh, yoo-hoo.
Oh, Mr. Ravioli.
Ravelli, Ravelli.
Oh, Mr. Ravelli.
I want you to do something for me.
I do anything for you.
What do you want, I should do?
You see that painting?
You mean, this picture?
I want you to take that out of the frame and put this one in its place.
You want I should take this one down and put this one upstairs.
Yes, that's it.
You want I should steal!
Oh, no, no!
It's not stealing.
Well, then, I couldn't do it.
Oh, Mr. Ravioli!
Oh, no, no, no.
Hey, get up, get up.
Come here.
That's all you do, chase the women.
Go.
Aw, stop!
Everybody here plays cards.
They don't ask us.
We are a waste all the time.
We been here all day.
How much a we make?
We make a nothing.
First thing you know, we gonna live on a charity, then go to the old ladies' home.
How do you like that?
No, no.
That's a no good!
These people here all got a money.
Now, we gotta get someone to play with us, see.
I play anything.
Oh, Signor Ravelli,
I want to speak to you about the music.
Yeah.
How do you do?
What's the matter with you?
I thought, it would be nice...
Go away from me.
What is this?
That's all right.
Just a...
Oh, there you are.
My, dear...
Hello, Professor.
Good heavens.
What's the matter with his feet?
This is embarrassing.
That's nothing.
Why, we play all kinds of games.
We play blackjack, soccer...
Oh!
Dear, I'm so sorry!
Mrs. Whitehead...
What is the matter with him?
I wouldn't have had this happen for the world.
Oh!
Heavens!
Come on!
Atta boy!
Go away from me!
One...
Two...
Three.
Atta boy.
Atta boy.
Good heavens.
Oh, dear.
I must, get them out.
I must get them out of here!
Oh, look.
You see how terrible he looks!
Look.
I'm so frightened.
Look, what can I do?
I don't know.
I better get Hives.
No, let me get her.
Well, you go, then.
I'm just trying to watch my...
Oh, oh.
Oh, this is terrible.
She can't take it there.
You better get Hives.
Go away from me!
This is dreadful.
Well, why don't you leave him alone?
Stop!
Now that this game is over, how about playing bridge?
You play bridge?
I play bridge a little.
What do you play for?
Oh, we just play for small stakes.
And French fried potatoes?
Set it up over there, Hives.
Very good, madam.
What in the world is he up to?
Look at this.
The whole house will be torn to pieces.
Absolutely.
If it isn't one thing, it's another.
Oh, Hives!
Oh!
Take it away, Hives.
Extraordinary.
We'll play over here.
Now, how do you want to play?
Honest?
Well, I hope so.
You put that right away.
It's your own fault.
Come along now.
We'll cut for partners.
Oh, he's my partner.
That's the only way we play.
I'm sorry but it's against the rules of the games.
We have to cut for partners.
All right.
We cut for partners.
I got ace of spades.
He's got ace of spades.
That's what you call "quin-cidences."
Two aces of spaces?
Yeah, he's got thousands of them.
Well, I suppose that gives him the choice of seats.
You have the choice of seats.
Good heavens!
Not on her lap.
Come on!
Sit down.
What's the matter with him?
I don't know.
He thought it was contact bridge.
Just a minute now.
Shuffle the cards.
Yeah.
You got to scrumble them up a bit.
You know.
Just a moment.
I'd like to cut those cards.
That's a better.
Uh, your bid, partner.
You pass?
Misdeal.
You pass?
I bid one spade.
I pass.
Three spades.
Four spades.
One club.
I don't understand this kind of bidding!
Well, you don't have to understand.
You bid four spades, huh?
Why, I haven't a spade in my hand!
All right.
We double.
There's something wrong here.
I want you to go over the bidding.
Hey, she wants to start them up again, the bidding.
He bids one.
One?
One what?
That's all right.
You find out.
But we have to know what he's bidding.
We tell you later.
Now I bid two.
Two what?
Uh, two of the same he bids.
Now, the bidding's over.
See, that's enough bidding.
Uh, it's your lead.
Oh, no, you can't lead that.
Why not?
Why, we can't take it.
Well, what should I lead?
Ace.
Ace of spades.
That's very good.
Three of spades, four of spades...
You trump it?
Uh, that's what you call a finesse.
Oh!
No spades, partner.
No spades!
Ace of hearts.
Ace of clubs.
Dummy leads.
The dummy leads.
I'm not the dummy!
Well, you could be.
Ace of diamonds.
100 aces, huh?
200?
That's better.
Ace of hearts.
Atta boy, make a big slam.
Make a big, big slam!
Ace of spades.
Ace of spades.
That's a good.
He plays a good game.
Ace of spades.
He plays a fine game, all right.
Ace of...
I refuse to play any longer.
You're nothing but a couple of card sharps.
Good heavens!
What's the matter, dear?
My shoes are gone!
Good gracious.
He has your slippers.
Come along, come along.
Hey, you take a the lady's shoes, huh?
Hey.
Quiet.
Quiet, quiet.
Hide!
Hide!
Somebody's coming.
All right.
I make a mistake.
Get up, get up.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Come.
Hey, hurry up.
Come here.
You know what we gotta do, eh?
We gotta take a that picture out and put this one upstairs for the lady.
Wait!
No touch.
You got everything ready, huh?
The shovel, the ax, the dynamite, the pineapples?
Where's the flash?
That's a no flash.
A flash.
There's a flash.
Flash.
That's a flash.
A flash.
Yeah, that's a flash.
That's a fish!
I no want a fish.
No fish.
Flash.
Aw, stop it.
You act crazy.
When you go out in the night time, you gotta have a the flash.
Ha!
That's a no flash.
That's a flask.
Flash.
When you wanna see somebody, you gotta have a the flash.
That's a flush.
What I gonna do with a flush?
A flash.
No flit.
It's a flits.
What am I gonna do with a flits?
What do you got?
That's whatcha call a flutes.
All you got is a fish, a flutes, a flits, flutes, flits and a flutes.
Stop this!
Where's the flash?
Look, when everything is a light...
And you wanna make them a dark, what do you do?
Ah!
You're crazy.
I don't want no blackjack.
That's a my mistake, I guess.
When everything is dark, and you wanna make them light...
Yeah, that's a flash.
That's a flash.
Hey, that's a good, all right.
The storm put the lights out.
Now, nobody can see what we do.
That's a fine.
Where is the flash?
Where's the flash?
I no want the fish!
The flash!
No, no flute!
No, flute!
What's the matter with you, eh?
Flash.
Before the people come, get a the flash.
What's the matter?
You lose it?
Well, you gotta find it.
Look for it.
All right, all right.
Never mind.
Come on.
We'll work without it.
Yes, madam.
Hide!
Hide!
Somebody's coming.
Hide, hide, hide.
Quiet!
Shut up!
Quiet.
Shut up.
Be quiet.
I know where you are.
It's all right.
Oh, Captain Spaulding?
Captain Spaulding, where are you?
Here.
Yes, what's the trouble?
The storm has put the lights out, and you can't see your hand before your face.
You wouldn't get much enjoyment out of that.
I don't know what you're gonna do, but I'm gonna take a nap.
Leave me a call for 3:00.
Make it 3:30.
You certainly get service around here.
Pardon me, Mrs. Rittenhouse, did you lose a fish?
What?
Well, somebody lost it.
Will you take it out in the kitchen and have it fried for me?
Did you hear that?
There's somebody over there.
I say, there's somebody over there!
Don't be silly.
The house is just settling.
That's all.
Anybody over there?
I don't see anybody.
There you are.
If there's anybody there, we'd see him, wouldn't I?
- Oh, what is it?
- Captain, what is it?
You know, what I think?
I think you got roaches.
Yes, you got roaches, all right.
And the biggest one has got asthma.
Oh, this is terrible.
Captain, let's get out of here.
We get a the picture.
We don't make one sound.
Hey!
Somebody put on the lights.
All right.
We get a the picture.
We don't make one sound.
Come on.
Let's go.
Get out of here.
What do you want?
Oh, the fish.
Come on, come on.
Oh!
That's some storm, huh?
That's a regular tomato.
Come on.
Let's go this way.
I think it's a shortcut.
Come on, let's go.
California!
Oh, Captain, how thrilling.
And then what happened?
It was nothing at all.
I'd rather not discuss it.
But I can't wait to hear the finish.
I must hear it.
Well, there I was.
There I was in the top of the tree with this rhinoceros pointing his gun straight at me.
A rhinoceros?
Yes.
Captain, what did you do?
What could I do?
I had to marry his daughter.
What kind of a story do you call that?
All right, you tell one.
And now, my friends, before we start the musical program,
Captain Spaulding has kindly consented to tell us about his trip to Africa.
Captain Spaulding.
Me?
My friends, I'm going to tell you of that great mysterious, wonderful continent known as Africa.
Africa is God's country, and he can have it.
Well, sir.
We left New York drunk and early on the morning of February 2.
After 15 days on the water and six on the boat, we finally arrived on the shores of Africa.
We once proceeded 300 miles into the heart of the jungle, where I shot a polar bear.
This bear was 6' 7" in his stocking feet and had shoes on...
Pardon me, just a moment, Captain.
Just a moment.
I always thought that polar bears lived in the frozen north.
Oh, you did.
Well, this bear was anemic, and he couldn't stand the cold climate.
He was a rich bear and could afford to go away in the winter.
You take care of your animals and I'll take care of mine!
Frozen north, my eye.
From the day of our arrival, we led an active life.
The first morning saw us up at 6:00, breakfasted and back in bed at 7:00.
This was our routine for the first three months.
We finally got so we were back in bed at 6:30.
One morning, I was sitting in front of the cabin, smoking some meat.
Smoking some meat?
Yes, there wasn't a cigar store in the neighborhood.
As I say, I was sitting in front of the cabin when I bagged six tigers.
Oh, Captain!
Six of them biggest I...
Captain, did you catch six tigers?
I bagged them.
I...
I bagged them to go away, but they hung around all afternoon.
They were the most persistent tigers I've ever seen.
The principal animals inhabiting the African jungle are moose, elks and Knights of Pythias.
Of course, you all know what a moose is.
That's big game.
The first day I shot two bucks.
That was the biggest game we had.
As I say, you all know what a moose is.
A moose runs around on the floor and eats cheese and is chased by the cats.
The elks, on the other hand, live up in the hills.
And in the spring, they come down for their annual convention.
It is interesting to watch them come to the water hole.
And you should see them run when they find it's only a water hole!
What they're looking for is an elk-a-hole.
One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas.
How he got in my pajamas, I don't know.
Then we tried to remove the tusks.
The tusks.
That's not so easy to say.
Tusks.
You try that sometime.
Tusks.
Oh, simple.
Tusks.
Pardon me, my name is Spaulding.
I've always wanted to meet you, Mr. Chandler.
As I say, we tried to remove the tusks.
But they were embedded in so firmly that we couldn't bust them.
Of course, in Alabama, the Tuscaloosa.
But, uh, that's entirely irr-elephant to what I was talking about.
We took some pictures of the native girls, but they weren't developed.
But we're going back again in a couple of weeks.
I will...
A very enlightening speech, Captain.
Very enlightening.
Hooray for Captain Spaulding!
Three cheers for Captain Spaulding!
Aw.
Oh, really I...
Three cheers for Captain Spaulding!
Three cheers...
No one asked for the chairs!
Put them right where you found them.
Now, go now.
Go now.
Go on, go on!
Go on with your chairs.
Get out!
Go on, go on, go on, you.
And, now, friends,
Signor Ravelli will oblige us at the piano.
Signor Ravelli.
Signor Ravelli's first selection will be
Somewhere My Love Lies Sleeping With a Male Chorus.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
17, 18, 19, 20...
Say, if you get near a song, play it.
I can't think of the finish.
That's strange.
And I can't think of anything else.
You know what I think?
I think I went past it.
I mean, if you come around again, jump off.
I once kept this up for three days.
You wouldn't consider hush money, would you?
I can't get him now, I've got to wait for inspiration.
It's about time.
Play the song about Montreal.
Montreal?
I'm a Dreamer, Montreal.
I don't know that.
I'll tell you what I do.
I play one of my own compositions by Victor Herbert.
Make it short.
He plays them both well.
Atta boy.
The old red team scored that time.
So did the old blue one.
Why do you push, huh?
Why do you push?
Oh, please, stop them.
Let them alone.
They may exterminate each other.
Come on, come on!
The best thing that can happen for either of them.
And once for old Purdue.
I was afraid of that.
Hey, I thought I had the finish.
I wish you did.
Yours.
Play the song about the Irish chiropodist.
Irish chiropodist?
My Fate is in Your Hands.
Is there a horse in the house?
They've got everything else here.
And, uh, now, Mrs. Rittenrotten...
Uh, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Yes, a slight error.
I have a little surprise for you!
The man is here for the piano.
Oh, Captain.
No, really.
What I meant to say was that, uh...
When I departed from the natives in Africa, I was presented with a gift.
And this gift I'm going to give to you at a very low figure.
Oh, how wonderful, Captain!
Well, no.
Don't be too hasty.
Oh, I just...
This is all hand-painted.
The whole thing was done with the white of an egg.
Well, what is it, Captain?
What is it?
"What is it?" you ask.
This is a hope chest for a guinea pig.
Oh.
What is it?
This magnificent chest...
No, this...
No, this magnificent chest,
I now take great pleasure in presenting to you with my compliments.
Captain, this leaves me speechless.
Well, see that you remain that way.
And, now, ladies and gentlemen...
Come outside and say that.
If we will all adjourn to the library,
Mrs. Rittenhouse has another, and perhaps greater, surprise for us.
Hmm.
This way, Captain.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, how do you pay Hives?
By the week or by the pound?
And now, it is my privilege to reveal the masterpiece of Francois Jacques Dubois Gilbert Beaugard.
No trains will be sold after the magazines leave the depot.
After the Hunt.
There!
I told you you were a great artist.
Shall we spill the beans now?
Let's wait a minute.
Something might happen.
Now, I'm sure, we'd all appreciate a few words from Mr. Chandler, who will tell us of the life and work of the artist, Beaugard.
And keep it clean.
Mr. Chandler.
My friends,
I am quite sure that you are all familiar with Beaugard, and this is perhaps his masterpiece.
In it, he has achieved the greatness in the handling of color and line.
Now, you will see here that I...
Wait!
This is not my picture.
This is a rank imitation!
What do you mean, Mr. Chandler?
Well, here, see for yourself!
You are right.
It is not the Beaugard.
It certainly isn't.
There's a dog missing!
Oh, Captain Spaulding, what shall I do?
Telephone the dog catchers immediately!
They have taken the original and left me this.
Leave it to me.
I'll throw some light on this subject.
Has anyone a match?
What's wrong?
- Hives, Hives, where are you?
- Turn on the lights.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, did you lose that fish again?
Oh, Captain, I'm so worried.
Good heavens!
That one is gone, too!
Oh, this is awful.
The crooks!
The crooks!
They are escaping.
Follow me, men!
Never mind the men, just the women.
Oh, Captain.
Captain!
- Captain!
- Come on.
Right this way.
He went out here someplace.
Excitement.
I never saw anything so funny in all my life.
It was great, and there goes her old party.
Good old Hives.
Wasn't it funny?
Oh, very.
Why, you're not afraid, are you, Hives?
Oh, no, I'm not afraid.
Oh, dear, no.
Only, you see, well, they were talking of having the police here.
And I wouldn't want the police to suspect me.
Why, they wouldn't suspect you.
Oh, yes, they would.
You see, the last time they suspected me,
I got four years.
Hives!
All right, Hives.
Give me the painting and I'll take care of it.
Good.
Come.
Good heavens!
It's gone!
Gone?
I left it in there.
There?
There must be thieves at this party.
Oh, God!
If I'd known that, I never would have come.
Wait a minute.
That professor.
The professor!
I see!
Hives, that's the fellow in the woodpile.
Now, listen.
We've got to get that picture away from him!
Might I suggest some of this?
What...
Oh, very satisfactory in these cases.
A few drops on a handkerchief and the professor will no longer obstruct us.
You are sure it'll do the trick?
Oh, absolutely.
Would you care to try some?
No, thanks, Hives.
Let's find the professor.
I don't see how the thief could have gotten away.
I wonder who it could have been.
It's a good thing we substituted yours.
Suppose that the thief had gotten away with the Beaugard!
Oh, it would be all right if they stole mine.
Oh, darling, I...
I didn't mean that.
But what would mother do?
Why, it's worth $100,000!
How could she have replaced it?
Oh, I understand, dear.
Isn't it exciting?
Just think.
Whoever took it was right in the room with us!
Just like Raffles.
Oh, isn't it romantic?
All the boys I've known
Used to say I was made of stone
I would always leave them alone
In despair
I've been on the pan
I've been called an electric fan
Told I'm even much colder than
Frigidaire
I began to wonder
If I was all wrong
I thought so till you came along
Tell me, dear
Why am I so romantic
When you're near
Why am I so romantic
What a grand feeling
When your lips meet mine
That certain something comes
Stealing up and down my spine
I don't know what it is you do to me
You don't know half of the good you do me
Other boys bore me
They just leave me blue
But why am I so romantic
With you
Tell me, dear
Why am I so romantic
When you're near
Why am I so romantic
What a grand feeling
When your lips touch mine
That certain something comes
Stealing up and down my spine
When we pet close in your arms
You hold me
I forget all that my mother told me
Other girls bore me
They just leave me blue
But why am I so romantic
With you
Oh, Signor Ravelli.
Ah, how do you do?
I've been looking for you all morning.
I was busy all morning, but you could have had me last night.
Signor Ravelli, you've gotta put that painting back.
Painting?
Painting?
What painting?
What are you talking?
The one you changed last night, you remember?
Oh, you mean the picture?
Yes.
Hey, what's the matter for you?
First you want them downstairs, then you want them upstairs.
Then you want them downstairs, then you...
Come on, make up your mind.
Oh, I do thank you for what you've done.
But you've got to get that painting back before the police get here.
Police?
Yes!
They come here?
Yes!
Wait, I give it to you, you put it back.
Come on, come on.
Where's the picture?
What do you mean, "Where's the picture"?
I put him in there.
It's gone.
Somebody take him.
You take him!
Me?
No, I know.
I know.
I...
The fish peddler.
Abie, the fish peddler.
Did mother invite a fish peddler here?
I don't know whether she invite, but he's here.
Come on.
We find him.
Good morning, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Good morning, Mr. Jamison.
And how is Captain Spaulding this morning?
Oh, he had a very bad night.
He didn't sleep a wink.
He went horseback riding in the middle of the night.
I'm sorry.
Yes, I know.
But we've all been very upset.
Bad case.
Yeah.
Uh, good morning, Captain.
Did you enjoy your ride?
What in the world are you looking for?
I lost my horse.
Oh!
Yes, he slipped right out from between me.
I can't understand it.
I had my feet in the syrups, too.
I don't know.
I don't know how he got...
I didn't care about that, but I lost the bit you loaned me.
Never mind.
I'll get you another bit.
Well, that'll be two bits I owe you, then.
Captain, I hope you weren't distressed by last night's unfortunate occurrence.
You mean that dinner you served?
No, the painting that was stolen.
Was there a painting stolen?
I haven't seen a paper in three weeks.
Jamison, as my secretary, why didn't you inform me there was a painting stolen?
What do you think I engaged you for?
But, Captain, I didn't know it.
Well, you should have asked me.
I didn't know it!
- Well, I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.
You're a contemptible cur!
I repeat, sir, you're a contemptible cur!
Oh, if I were a man you'd resent that.
Please keep quiet, will you?
I can get along without you, you know.
I got along without your father, didn't I?
Yes, and your grandfather.
Yes, and your uncle!
Yes, and your uncle!
Yes, and my uncle.
Captain!
I didn't come here to be exonerated.
I beg pardon, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Oh, you do, eh?
Well, I'd like to see you crawl out of a rumble seat.
The police are here, madam.
Oh, the police.
Have them come in.
Oh, so, that's your game, is it?
You can't shut me up.
Captain.
No!
You can talk to my attorney.
Jamison?
Yes, sir.
Take a letter to my lawyers.
I'll show you a thing or two, or three.
I'll show you a thing or three.
Oh, Captain.
Sending for the police.
Take a letter to my lawyers!
Sending for the police, eh?
I say, take a letter to my lawyers!
I am taking it!
Uh, read me what you have so far.
Honorable Charles H. Hungerdunger, in care of Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger and McCormick.
Semicolon.
How do you spell "semicolon"?
All right, make it a comma.
Dear, Elsie...
No, never mind Elsie.
Do you want me to scratch "Elsie"?
Well, if you enjoy that sort of thing, it's quite all right with me.
However, I'm not interested in your private affairs, Jamison.
Begin this way.
Let's start all over again.
Honorable Charles H. Hungerdunger, in care of Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger and McCormick.
Gentlemen, question mark.
- Do you want that, uh...
- in the letter?
No, put that in an envelope.
Now, then, in re yours of the fifth inst.
Yours to hand and beg to rep.
Brackets.
That, uh, we have gone over the ground carefully and we seem to believe,
I-E, to wit, E-G, in lieu, that, uh, despite all our precautionary measures which have been involved...
Uh...
We seem to believe that it is hardly necessary for us to proceed unless we receive an ipso facto that is not negligible at this moment.
Quotes, unquotes and quotes.
Uh, hoping this finds you, I beg you to remain...
Hoping this finds him where?
Well, let him worry about that.
Don't be so inquisitive, Jamison.
Sneak!
I say, hoping this finds you,
I beg to remain, as of June 9th, cordially yours.
Regards.
That's all, Jamison.
I'll show you where I get off.
Sending for the police.
Now read me the letter, Jamison.
"Honorable Charles H. Hungadunga..."
"Hungerdunger."
"Hunga...
Hun." "Hunga..."
"Hungerdunger." That's it.
"Hungerdunger."
"In care of Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger and McCormick."
You've left out a "Hungerdunger."
You left out the main one, too.
Thought you could slip one over on me, eh?
All right, leave it out and put in a windshield wiper instead.
I'll tell you what you do, Jamison.
I'll tell you what.
Make it, uh, make it three windshield wipers and one "Hungerdunger."
They won't all be there when the letter arrives anyhow.
"Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger and McCormick."
"And McCormick."
"Dear Elsie, scratch."
That won't do, Jamison.
That won't go through the mail, the way you got it.
The way you've got the letter, you've got McCormick scratching Elsie.
Now you better turn that around and have Elsie scratch McCormick.
And you better turn McCormick around, too, Jamison.
And see what you can do for me.
"Gentlemen, question mark."
"Gentlemen, question mark"?
Put it on the penultimate, not on the diphthongic.
You wanna brush up on your Greek, Jamison.
Well, get a Greek and brush up on him.
"In re yours of the fifth inst." I see.
Now, you said a lot of things here that I didn't think were important, so I just omitted them.
Well!
Hmm.
Oh, Captain!
Good gracious!
Oh, my!
So, you've just omitted them, eh?
You've just omitted the body of the letter, that's all.
You've left out the body of the letter, that's all.
Yours is not to reason why, Jamison!
You've left out the body of the letter!
All right, send it that way and tell them the body will follow.
Do you want the body in brackets?
No, it'll never get there in brackets.
Put it in a box.
Put it in a box and mark it, uh, "fragilly."
Mark it what?
Mark it "fragilly." F-R-A-G...
Look it up, Jamison.
It's in the dictionary.
Look under "fragile."
Look under the table if you don't find it there.
Uh, "Quotes, unquotes, and quotes."
That's three quotes?
Yes, sir.
Add another quote and make it a gallon.
How much is it, a gallon, Jamison?
Regards.
Regards.
That's a fine letter, Jamison.
That's an epic.
That's dandy.
Now, I want you to make two carbon copies of that letter and throw the original away.
And when you get through with that, throw the carbon copies away.
Just send a stamp airmail.
And that's all.
You may go, Jamison.
I may go, too.
Mrs. Rittenhouse?
Yes?
I'm Inspector Hennessey from headquarters.
How do you do, Inspector?
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Captain Scotland of Spaulding Yard.
No, I'm Captain Spaulding of Scotland Yard.
Please don't make the same mistake again.
I'm glad to know you, Captain.
Well, I should think you would be.
Now, then, inspector, I think between the two of us we can solve the mystery of the stolen painting.
Especially, if you go home.
Inspector, please don't be too hasty about making an arrest.
I don't want my guests embarrassed.
Don't worry.
We won't arrest anybody.
He's lucky if he can stay out of jail himself.
Mr. Jamison, would you mind taking the inspector and his men to the library and showing them the scene of the crime?
Certainly, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Right this way, Inspector.
Come on, boys.
And, Jamison, count the spoons.
Captain, I didn't know you'd been a detective.
There's a whole lot of things you don't know.
I suppose that's so.
You know darn well it's so.
Where were you on the night of June 5, 1774?
I'm afraid I don't know.
You bet you don't know.
Where was I?
I don't know.
Well, I don't know, either.
And if I did know I wouldn't tell you.
Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
Take a number from one to 10.
All right.
All right.
What's the number?
Seven.
That's right.
Seven is right.
I could have done it with one hand if I wanted.
This is no mystery.
I could solve this in five minutes if I wanted to worry.
Captain, I don't want you to worry.
I don't want anything to interfere with your weekend.
Nothing ever interferes with my weekend, and I'll thank you not to get personal, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Captain.
Captain, I assure you...
Where's my secretary?
I didn't mean...
No, no.
Where's my secretary?
Jamison, Jamison?
Captain, you misunderstood me.
Oh!
A more dastardly crack
I've never heard.
Oh.
Captain, please.
I wish I was back in the jungle where men are monkeys.
Captain, I'm so sorry.
Jamison!
Jamison?
No.
Oh, Captain.
Oh, dear.
No!
Good morning, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Good morning.
Perfectly charming party.
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
It's just full of surprises.
So glad you're enjoying yourself.
Oh, Hives.
Hives!
Good morning.
Some breakfast?
Breakfast, nothing.
Did you get the painting?
No, I did not.
I watched all night, but the professor did not sleep in his room.
No?
Strange.
Very strange.
Good heavens, Hives!
What will we do?
I don't know.
Until we see the professor.
You keep an eye on him till I get back with the bottle.
Don't worry, he'll not get away from me this time.
Did you get it?
Good.
Yes, madam.
Now, I'll go ahead and engage him in conversation.
You'll trail behind, and when the proper time comes, see that he gets it.
Very good, madam.
Oh, hello.
I've been looking all over for you.
Where have you been?
What is the matter with this?
What have you got there, the morning papers?
No, that isn't the one I want.
Let me see one of the others.
That still isn't the one I want.
You know what I want.
Out.
Yes, out.
Never mind the birds.
Come on up here.
Sit down.
I want to talk to you.
Don't you like me?
You don't?
Well, I like you.
I like little boys like you.
By the way, how old are you?
Five years old?
Why you're just a baby, aren't you?
Oh!
Aw, isn't that nice?
I like that.
No, no, no!
Now, all joking aside.
Isn't there someone you do like?
Isn't there someone you love?
Now think again.
Isn't there someone you really and truly love?
Is there?
Tell me who.
Why, that's a horse.
You love a horse.
Come on.
Lift him up.
Come on, he's out.
Let us get out.
Arabella.
John, I've been trying to find you.
Ravelli has lost the painting.
Well, I've been looking all over for you.
I found a painting out on the terrace.
Was it the Beaugard?
No.
Oh, yours!
Shh.
Well, if it's not yours and it's not the Beaugard, whose is it?
Where did it come from?
Oh, don't you see?
Someone else came along and substituted it for mine, thinking they were getting away with the original Beaugard.
Somebody swiped my scheme, eh?
Hey, then Chandler never saw your painting after all.
No!
For all I know you may still be a great artist.
Where is this picture?
It's up in my room.
Well, you go get it and I'll get Captain Spaulding.
He'll get to the bottom of this.
And then John found a third painting.
Well, that's very interesting.
Well, fairly interesting.
But we've just got to keep a sharp lookout.
That's all.
Oh, I've got to find it or mother's out of $100,000.
Now, don't worry.
Let me work on this case for 24 hours, and then we'll call in somebody else.
You think it's a mystery now?
Wait till you'll see it tomorrow.
Remember the Charley Ross disappearance?
I worked on that case for 24 hours and they never did find him.
They couldn't find me for five years.
That's me, Captain Yard of Scotland Spaulding.
I always get my women.
Or paintings.
Arabella!
Can you imagine what's happened?
You know that painting I found?
Yes?
Well, it's been stolen from my room.
John!
There you are.
I've been on the case five minutes and there's another painting gone.
I'll bet it's not even five minutes.
I'll bet it not over three.
Now they've got my watch!
This is going too far.
It wasn't going and now it's gone.
The door to my room was locked, too!
Well, how could they get in?
Who could it have been?
Wait a minute.
I think I've got a clue.
No, it's a hair.
A red hair.
The professor?
Oh, no.
No, it couldn't be.
Well, he's been picked this month by the Crook of the Month Club.
Anyhow, we'll investigate it.
You know Conductor Hennessey, don't you?
Inspector!
Inspector yourself.
Now, listen, you know that little redheaded fellow?
The professor?
Yes.
Well, get that gang of flagpole sitters of yours and see if you can find him.
Aye, aye, Captain.
Come on, boys.
He'll get to the bottom of this.
You'll see how quick these boys...
Hey, what's that punk doing there?
They're good policemen.
Didn't take long to find him.
That's right.
This is it.
Yeah, this is it.
But which one is it?
That's the one that was just taken from my room!
Well, we've got that back.
Maybe I got my watch back.
Now, the fob is gone.
Well, I still got the pocket.
Anything I retain now is velvet.
Except the coat.
That's Prince Albert.
Well, all the jokes can't be good.
You've gotta expect that once in a while.
Say, if we could find the fellow that painted this picture, well, we'd have a pretty good clue.
What'd you say?
I said if we could find the fellow that painted this picture, we'd have a pretty good clue.
You just said that!
What a dull conversationalist you turned out to be.
Let me see that a minute.
Will you?
Say, this is signed "Beaugard."
There's the criminal, Beaugard.
No, Beaugard is dead!
Beaugard is dead?
Then it's murder!
Now we've got something.
What you got, Captain?
I got jacks and aces.
What do you got?
That's good.
I was bluffing.
Look at this, Ravelli.
Isn't there something strikes you very funny about this picture?
Oh, come, come.
It isn't as funny as all that.
Did you ever see a tree like that?
Tree?
That's a spinach.
That can't be spinach.
Where's the egg?
Well, it could be spinach.
Look, all the sand laying around there.
You mean, it's an old spinach custom?
No, it's not that, Ravelli.
Anything but that.
Oh.
No, Cap.
That's all right.
It's my mistake.
You know what that is?
That's coleslaw.
Coleslaw?
Yeah, it's a coleslaw.
Did you ever see coleslaw like that?
Sure, look at this one.
No, I don't want one on your lip, now.
Did you ever see anything like that?
Did you ever see anything like that?
You know what this is?
This is a left-handed painting.
Look, there's a signature.
That's right, it's in the right-hand corner.
That's right.
This is either a left-handed painting or a vegetable dinner.
Now, if we can find the left-handed person that painted this, we'll have The Trial of Mary Dugan with sound.
Well, I saw that.
Good-bye.
Now, you wait here.
I'm gonna need you.
Now, look.
We mustn't lose this.
This is evidence.
Now, take it to your room and leave the door open this time.
We'll try that.
And not a word about this to anybody, not even to me.
Ravelli, we have got to find the left-handed painting.
Yes, the left-handed painter.
Now in a case like this the first thing to do is to find the motive.
Now, what could have been the motive of the guy who has swapped the Beaugard?
I got it!
Robbery!
Would you mind going out and crossing the boulevard when the lights are against you?
See, Cap, sit down.
You understand, I got an idea how to find this painting.
In a case like this that is so mysterious, you gotta get at the clues.
You gotta use the Sherlock Holmes method.
Now, you go about it like this.
You say to yourself, "What happened?"
And the answer come back, "Something was stolen."
Then you say to yourself, "What was stolen?"
And the answer come back, "A painting."
What are you, a ventriloquist?
Now you say to yourself, "Where was this painting stolen?"
And the answer come back, "In this house."
Now, so far I'm right, eh?
Well, it's pretty hard to be wrong if you keep answering yourself all the time.
Now you go a little further, and you say to yourself,
"Who stole the painting?"
This is a very, very important question.
Captain, you get the answer, you've got the solution to the whole thing.
Especially if you find the picture.
Now you take all the clues.
You put them together.
What do you got, eh?
A bread pudding.
No, here's what we got.
Something was stolen.
Stolen where?
In this house.
Stolen by who?
Somebody in the house.
Now to find the painting, you only gotta do is go to everybody in the house and ask them if they took it.
You know, I could rent you out as a decoy for duck hunters?
You say you're gonna go to everybody in the house and ask them if they took the painting?
Suppose nobody in the house took the painting.
Go to the house next door.
That's great.
Suppose there isn't any house next door.
Well, then of course we gotta build one.
Well, now you're talking.
What kind of house do you think we ought put up?
Well, I'll tell ya, Cap.
You see.
My idea of a house is something nice and small and comfortable.
That's the way I feel about it.
I don't want anything elaborate.
Just a little place that I can call home and tell the wife I won't be there for dinner.
I see.
You just want a telephone booth.
No, in that case, I'll get in touch with Chic Sales.
Now, what do you say, Cap, we build right about here?
Here?
Yeah, right about here.
Oh, I'd like something over here if I could get it.
I don't like junior crossing the tracks on his way to the reform school.
I don't like junior at all, as a matter of fact.
All right, all right.
We got something over there.
And believe me, that's convenient.
That's very convenient.
Well, all you gotta do is open the door, step outside and there you are.
There you are?
Yeah.
"There you are" where?
Outside.
Well, suppose you want to get back in again?
You had no right to go out.
Well, don't do anything until I hear from you, will you?
Say, maybe that's the painting down in the cellar!
That's no cellar.
That's the roof.
That's the roof?
Down there?
Yeah, you see, we keep the roof in the basement, so when the rain comes, the chimney don't get wet.
I'm going out and get X-rayed.
I'll be back in a little while.
I may be wonderful, but I think you're wrong, Ravelli.
Hey, wait, don't get up excited.
Come here.
Now, look, here's the rooms.
Those are the rooms?
Yeah.
Right, there's the rooms.
This is your room.
This is my room and this is the maid's room.
Oh, I'd have to go through your room?
Ah!
That's all right.
I won't be in it.
Say, Ravelli, you couldn't put the maid in your room, eh?
What makes you think I couldn't?
Well, there's gonna be a lot of traffic in there.
I can see that.
Well, what do you say?
You ready to sign the lease?
Well, it's a little premature.
I'd like to discuss it with my husband.
Could you come back this evening when he is home?
Hey, you married?
Why, I've got a girl as big as you are.
All right, get me one.
Don't get vulgar, Ravelli.
Ravelli, how about the painting?
We take care of that, all right.
Now, I tell you what my idea is.
I think the kitchen should be white.
Outside green, inside cerise with blue...
The painting, I say.
How about the painting, Ravelli?
All right, what do you think I talk?
That's painting.
The kitchen white, outside green, inside cerise.
The painting.
The painting that was stolen.
Stolen?
Don't you remember Mrs. Rittenhouse lost a valuable Beaugard painting worth $100,000?
Don't you remember that?
No, I'm a stranger around here.
I no remember that.
What do you think I am, one of the early settlers?
Ravelli, don't you remember,
Mrs. Beaugard lost a valuable Rittenhouse painting worth $100,000?
Don't you remember that?
No, but I've seen you someplace before.
Well, I don't know where I was, but I'll stay out of there in the future.
Hey, Cap, it come to me like a flash!
This painting wasn't stolen.
Huh!
You know what happened?
This painting, Cap, is disappear.
Vanish.
Yes, it disappear.
And you know what make it disappear?
You'll never guess, Cap.
What do you think make this painting disappear, eh?
Moths!
Moths eat it!
Left-handed moths.
Go away.
Go away.
I'll be all right in a minute.
Left-handed moths ate the painting, eh?
That's my own solution.
I wish you were in it.
Left-handed moths ate the painting.
You know, I'd buy you a parachute if I thought it wouldn't open.
Hey, I got pair of shoes.
That's crazy.
Come on, let's get out and get the reward.
We solved it.
You solved it!
The credit is all yours.
The painting was eaten by a left-handed moth.
Hey, I know, we did a good day's work.
How do you feel?
Tired?
It's worth it.
Maybe you ought to lie down for a couple of years, eh?
Well...
Why don't you just lie down until rigor mortis sets in?
Yeah.
That's nothing.
Come on, Ravelli.
I'll show you how we get the painting.
Yeah.
We go to court and we get out a writ of habeas corpus.
You're gonna get rid of what?
Oh, I should never have started that way.
I can see that.
I say, we'll go to court and we'll get a writ of habeas corpus.
Yeah, scorpus, scorpus.
Didn't you ever see a habeas corpus?
No, but I see Habeas Irish Rose.
Hey, it's okay.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Mr. Chandler, why don't you go down to the beach with the others?
I'm sure you'd feel better.
If I had my Beaugard, I'm sure I'd feel better.
Oh, but we're doing everything we can.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, Mrs. Rittenhouse!
I have it.
The Beaugard!
Wonderful!
My Beaugard!
Wait, this is not my Beaugard!
This is a rank imitation.
Where did you find it?
Why, in Mr. uh...
In Mr. Parker's room, madam.
Parker!
One thing is certain!
The man who made that, stole the Beaugard!
Hives, find Mr. Parker and ask him to come here.
Certainly, madam.
Wait a minute.
My men will bring him in.
Go out and get Mr. Parker.
Oh, what's the matter with this?
Well, look at here.
You've only to look at it once to see what it is.
It is a rank nothing!
Mother, what's wrong?
I can come in without being pulled in.
Mr. Parker, something very mysterious has occurred.
And I'm afraid, you're the only one who can explain.
I'd be only too glad to if I can.
Nothing mysterious about it.
We found this in your room.
Now, what have you done with the original Beaugard?
Come clean!
Come on, out with it.
Really, I think I would be wise...
Well, I have nothing to say.
Except that I don't know where the Beaugard is.
Oh, how is it we found this in your room?
Come on!
You better come with me.
You can't take him!
Arabella!
Sing one song
For my old Kentucky home
For my old
Kentucky home
Far away
So far away
This program is coming to you from the House of David.
He's either got that suit on upside down or there is no law of gravity.
Einstein or no one.
My tie!
Oh, Captain, what shall I do?
They're going to arrest John.
Who's going to arrest John?
I am, Captain.
Oh, you are, eh?
Well, let me tell you something.
The first thing they teach you at Scotland Yard is never to arrest an innocent man.
But he's not innocent.
I'll have to arrest him just the same.
By all means or nobody will be safe here.
You can't arrest him!
- I stole it!
- Arabella!
Don't listen to her, Officer.
I did it.
They're both lying.
I did it!
I did it with my little hatchet.
Eh, he's crazy.
He's crazy.
I confess, I did it.
Or maybe nobody stole the painting.
Maybe there was no painting.
That's right, maybe there was no painting.
I saw it.
Cut out all the talk.
Who stole the painting?
I did.
Good gracious!
What!
What in the...
What?
You?
You took the picture?
Where is it?
Oh, that's a horse.
The Beaugard!
That is my Beaugard!
No, that isn't your Beaugard.
Don't be ridiculous.
I paid $100,000 for this painting.
I know what I bought.
Well, look at the signature.
"John Parker."
Somebody changed it.
That is my Beaugard!
That is the Beaugard, I tell you!
There it is!
Ah, but that one.
That has the color, the depth, the soul of the Beaugard!
Only a master could have produced a painting like that.
Oh, John.
You mean to tell me that you painted that?
Yes, sir.
Why, young man, you're a genius!
You're a genius!
I commission you to paint a portrait of me immediately!
Well, you better wait until tomorrow.
I'm gonna be busy all day.
Get it?
You better come with me, young fellow!
Don't take him away, Officer.
He returned the paintings.
Pardon me, my name is Spaulding.
I've always wanted to meet you.
All right.
I'll let him go this time.
But I want to give you some advice.
You're running around with the wrong kind of people.
You wanna be a crook?
Oh, why don't you go home?
He's got no home.
Go home for a few nights and stay home.
Don't you know your poor, old mother sits there sits there night after night after night.
...waiting to hear your steps on the stairs.
He got no stairs.
And I can see a little light burning in burning in the window.
No, you can't.
The gas company turned it off.
What I'm telling you is for your own good.
And if you listen to me...
You can't go wrong.
This may go on for years.
Now, there's just one thing...
I can't understand what's delaying that coffee pot.
Where's the cream?
Well, you certainly surprised me!
Me, too.
I thought he had more than that.
It's no use giving you any advice.
Captain, this time I'm afraid I'll have to take him.
Come on, here!
Come on!
Come on!
Oh, what's he doing?
Oh, my dear, oh!
Hey, what's the idea?
Jamison, take a letter to my lawyer!
No, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, no, no!
Not...
Oh.
Oh, to think that I've got to go so young.
Good.
Come on, now.
Let's get out of here before they all wake up.
Hurry up!
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
You must do your best tonight Be on your toes, men
There's another guest tonight It's one of those men
Who are being feted by the smart set.
We'll see that he gets what he deserves
Treat him as they do a king in manner royal
Like a subject to a king you must be loyal
On this object you must have your heart set
We'll do nothing to get on his nerves
Again I mention Be on your toes, men
He craves attention He's one of those men
Yes, sir, we will give him just what he deserves
Oh, Hives?
Oh, yes, Mrs. Rittenhouse?
I'd like to make a few changes in the assignment of the rooms.
Very good, madam.
Suppose you put Mr. Chandler in the blue suite.
And Captain Spaulding, as guest of honor, will have the green duplex with the two baths.
Two, madam?
Why, yes.
I think the Captain would like two baths, don't you?
Well, if he's just returned from Africa, he may need two baths.
Mr. Roscoe W. Chandler.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, well!
Mr. Chandler.
So nice to see you.
The famous Beaugard, as I have promised.
Mr. Chandler, how can I ever express my gratitude?
Oh, it's nothing.
Nothing?
You return from Europe with a masterpiece valued at $100,000, and instead of displaying it yourself, you allow me to unveil it at my party in honor of Captain Spaulding.
You call that nothing?
Mrs. Rittenhouse, I...
Uh, will you please remove that to the place where it is to be exhibited?
Very good, sir.
And uh, very careful, please.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, you think that is something?
It is nothing compared to what I would like to do for you.
You are a very beautiful woman.
No, no, Mr. Chandler.
Well, maybe I'm wrong.
What?
Please, do not go, Mrs. Rittenhouse,
I love you.
I know, but...
Do not take away your hand.
I tell you, I love you.
Careful...
Hello, Mother.
Playing house?
Well, uh, if you'll pardon me.
Have you seen Johnny Parker?
I wish you'd get Johnny Parker out of your mind and show more respect to Mr. Chandler.
The trouble with you is you don't take these social affairs seriously.
What would you suggest, Mom?
Suicide?
I would suggest...
Mrs. Rittenhouse, Captain Spaulding has arrived!
Splendid.
Oh, I'm so glad.
My friends, Captain Spaulding has arrived.
At last we are to meet him The famous Captain Spaulding
From climates hot and scalding The Captain has arrived
Most heartily we'll greet him with plain and fancy cheering
Until he's hard of hearing The Captain has arrived
At last the Captain
Has arrived
Mr. Horatio W. Jamison, field secretary to Captain Spaulding.
I represent the Captain who insists on my informing you
Of these conditions under which he camps here
In one thing he is very strict he wants his women young and thin
And as for men, he won't have any tramps here
And as for men, he won't have any tramps here
There must be no tramps
The men must all be very old the women warm, the champagne cold
It's under these conditions that he camps here
I'm announcing Captain Geoffrey Spaulding
He's announcing Captain Geoffrey Spaulding
Oh, dear, he is coming
At last he's here
Well, what do I owe you?
What?
From Africa to here, $1.85?
That's an outrage.
I told you not to take me through Australia.
You know it's all ripped up.
You should have come right up Lincoln Boulevard.
Where do you come to that stuff?
Turn around the rear end, I wanna see your license plates.
I don't think, you're on the square.
Oh, Captain Spaulding.
I'll attend to you later.
Oh, Captain Spaulding.
Why you're one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen.
That's not saying much for you.
Captain Spaulding,
Rittenhouse Manor is entirely at your disposal.
Well, I'm certainly grateful for this magnificent washout.
Uh, "turnout," and uh, now I'd like to say a few words.
Hello I must be going
I cannot stay, I came to say I must be going
I'm glad I came, but just the same I must be going...
La la
For my sake you must stay
If you should go away you'd spoil this party I am throwing
I'll stay a week or two
I'll stay the summer through
But I am telling you
I must be going.
Before you go will you oblige us
And tell us of your deeds so glowing
I'll do anything you say In fact, I'll even stay
Good
But I must be going
There's something that I'd like to say
That he's too modest to relate
The Captain is a moral man Sometimes he finds it trying
This fact I'll emphasize with stress
I never take a drink unless
Somebody's buying
The Captain is a very moral man
If he hears anything obscene he'll naturally repel it
I hate a dirty joke I do
Unless it's told by someone who knows how to tell it
The Captain is a very moral man
Hooray for Captain Spaulding the African explorer
Did someone call me Schnorer
Hooray, hooray, hooray
He went into the jungles where all the monkeys throw nuts
If I stay here I'll go nuts
Hooray, hooray, hooray
He put all his reliance in courage and defiance
And risked his life for science
Hey, hey
He is the only white man who covered every acre
I think I'll try and make her
Hooray, hooray, hooray
He put all his reliance in courage and defiance
And risked his life for science
Hey, hey
Hooray for Captain Spaulding the African explorer
He brought his name undying fame
And that is why we say hooray, hooray, hooray
My friends, I'm highly gratified at this magnificent display of effusion.
And I want you to know...
Hooray for Captain Spaulding the African explorer
He brought his name undying fame And that is why we say
Hooray, hooray, hooray
My friends, I'm highly gratified at this magnificent display of effusion.
And I want you to know...
Hooray for Captain Spaulding the African explorer
He brought his name undying fame And that is why we say
Hooray, hooray, hooray
My friends, I'm highly gratified at this magnificent display of effusion.
I want you to know...
Hooray for Captain Spaulding the African explorer
Well, somebody's got to do it!
Captain Spaulding?
It is indeed a great honor to welcome you to my poor home.
Oh, it isn't so bad.
Needless to say...
Wait a minute, I think you're right.
It is pretty bad.
As a matter of fact, it's one of the frowsiest looking joints I've ever seen.
Why, Captain...
Where did you get your wallpaper?
You're letting this place run down, and what's the result?
You're not getting the class of people that you used to.
Why, you've got people here that look like you!
Now, I'll tell you what to do.
We'll put up a sign outside, "Place under new management."
We'll set up a 75-cent meal that will knock their eyes out.
After we knock their eyes out, we can charge them anything we want.
Now sign here and give me your check for $1,500.
I want to tell you, madam, with this insurance policy, you've provided for your little ones and for your old age...
Which will be here in a couple of weeks now, if I'm any judge of horseflesh.
And now, madam, "I feel that the time has come," the walrus...
Captain Spaulding!
Captain Spaulding!
You stand before me as one of the bravest men of all times.
All right, I'll do that.
In the dark forests of Africa, there has been no danger you have not dared.
You mind if I don't smoke?
Fearlessly, you have blazed new trails, scornful of the lion's roar and the cannibal's tom-tom.
Says you!
Never once in all those weary months did your footsteps falter.
Cowardice is unknown to you.
Fear is not in you!
Oh, pardon me, a caterpillar...
Put him over here.
Oh, it must have been the caterpillar that frightened him.
Oh, dear.
This is unfortunate.
Don't stand there.
Get the whiskey!
Get the whiskey.
The whiskey?
The whiskey?
Where is the whiskey?
It's in my little black bag in the right-hand corner.
Signor Emanuel Ravelli.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Where's the dining room?
I'm surprised.
Say, I used to know a fellow who looked exactly like you, by the name of, uh, Emanuel Ravelli.
Are you his brother?
I am Emanuel Ravelli.
You're Emanuel Ravelli?
I'm Emanuel Ravelli.
Well, no wonder you look like him, but I insist there is a resemblance.
Hey, he thinks I look alike.
Well, If you do, it's a tough break for both of you.
You are one of the musicians, but you were not due until tomorrow.
Couldn't come tomorrow.
That's too quick.
So, you're lucky they didn't come yesterday.
We were busy yesterday, but we charge just the same.
This is better than exploring.
What do you fellows get an hour?
Oh, for playing, we get a $10 an hour.
I see.
What do you get for not playing?
$12 an hour.
Well, clip me off a piece of that.
Now, for rehearsing, we make special rate, that's $15 an hour.
That's for rehearsing?
Yes, that's for rehearsing.
And what do you get for not rehearsing?
You couldn't afford it.
You see, If we don't rehearse, we don't play.
- And If we don't play...
- That runs into money.
How much will you want to run into an open manhole?
Just the cover charge.
Drop in sometime.
Sewer.
Oh, we cleaned that up pretty well.
Well, let's see how we stand.
Flat-footed.
Yesterday we didn't come.
You remember, yesterday we didn't come.
Oh, I remember.
Yeah, that's $300.
Yesterday you didn't come.
That's $300?
That's $300.
That's reasonable.
I can see that, all right.
Now, today we did come.
That's, uh...
That's $100 you owe us.
Hey, I bet I'm gonna lose on the deal.
Tomorrow we leave.
That's worth about...
A million dollars.
Yeah, that's all right for me, but I got a partner.
What?
Partner?
The Professor!
The gates swung open and a Fig Newton entered.
How do you do?
Goodness!
You haven't got chocolate, have you?
He's got everything.
Hives, take the Professor's hat and coat.
And send for the fumigators.
Oh, my goodness!
Bonjour!
Hey, don't you see.
There are ladies present.
What do you think this is?
Put that hat down.
Will you?
What you do there?
Get out.
Don't go near those guns!
A little more to the right.
Ah-ah, that's better.
Now, see that the drape is well-hung.
The mistress will inspect it before the unveiling.
Hello, Hives!
Mrs. Whitehead, this is a surprise.
And how about me?
Miss Grace, you've grown so in the last year.
You haven't lost any weight, yourself.
No.
Unfortunately not.
You know, Hives, it seems strange to find you working here instead of in our own home.
Well, after you left for Europe,
Mrs. Rittenhouse was good enough to make me an offer.
Lovely!
Oh, by the way, Hives, what's the secret about the painting?
No secret.
It's Beaugard's After the Hunt.
The original?
Most original.
Be careful!
Where did she get hold of that, do you suppose?
Is it very valuable?
Is it?
It must be worth a fortune.
But sis, it looks as if we yield the social honors of the season to Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Well, isn't there something we can do?
We might shoot ourselves.
I'd rather shoot Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Say, I have an idea.
I copied that painting in art school a year ago.
Well, what of it?
But, I still don't get it.
I'll go home and get the copy.
We'll substitute it for the original.
And when she unveils it, what'll she have?
An imitation, and I must admit, a very poor one.
Grace, you're wonderful.
That's what I've been telling you.
I won't be long.
All right.
See you later.
Oh, Hives?
Do you still feel there's a strong bond between us?
Why most certainly, Mrs. Whitehead.
Strong enough for you to do me a big favor?
Why, anything at all.
Well, suppose I were to ask you to take away the Beaugard?
What?
You mean...
Oh, just temporarily, of course.
And substitute something of my own.
Well, I should consider it rather an unusual request.
It is, Hives.
But somehow I still think of you as one of the Whiteheads.
You may count on me.
My soul is yours.
Even though my body may belong to Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Why, Hives?
Oh, Mrs. Whitehead.
Arabella!
May I present, Mr. Parker?
Oh, of the Massachusetts Parkers?
Why, no.
Oh, then the southern Parkers?
Oh, no!
The central Parkers.
You know, the, uh, benches and trees.
I see!
Oh!
I don't like that woman.
Well, never mind.
You come over here and sit down and tell me whom you do like.
Oh!
So, that's your game.
Now, listen, do you really love me?
Why don't you marry me and find out.
Marry you?
Ha!
On what?
Hmm.
Last year, I sold two paintings.
One at $100 and one at $50.
Could we live on $150 a year?
Oh, we wouldn't need any money!
I've got a charge account in every shop on 5th Avenue.
Well, if I had any brains,
I'd give up painting and get a regular job.
You know, I had a cousin who made $50,000 on Wall Street last year.
Oh, I don't want to marry your cousin.
I'm a darn fool.
I want to marry you.
Say, why don't we get that old bluff, Chandler, to buy a portrait from you?
Chandler?
Ha!
What does he know about art?
Well, the less he knows, the easier it will be for you to sell him.
They're right upstairs.
You can't miss them.
Go around to the other side.
Mrs. Rittenhouse?
Oh, Captain Spaulding, how are you?
Tell me, are you alone?
Captain, I don't understand.
What?
You don't understand being alone?
Don't give me that innocent stuff or you'll be alone!
A big cluck like you turning cute on me!
Mrs. Rittenhouse?
Yes?
Oh, pardon me.
You've been affected like this yourself, haven't you?
Oh, no, Captain.
Well, you will be.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, ever since I met you,
I've swept you off my feet.
Something has been throbbing within me.
Oh, it's been beating like the incessant tom-tom in the primitive jungle.
There's something that I must ask you.
What is it, Captain?
Would you wash out a pair of socks for me?
Captain, I'm surprised.
Well, that maybe surprise you, but it's been on my mind for weeks.
It's just my way of telling you that I love you.
That's all.
I love you.
I...
Captain...
Mrs. Whitehead.
I beg your pardon.
I beg your pardon.
Am I intruding?
Are you intruding?
Just when I had her on the five-yard line.
I should say you are intruding!
I should say you are intruding!
Pardon me,
I was using the subjunctive instead of the past tense.
Yes, we're way past tents.
We're living in bungalows now.
This is a mechanical age, of course.
Mrs. Whitehead, you haven't met Captain Spaulding, have you?
Why, no.
I haven't.
How are you?
How are you?
I'm fine, thank you.
And how are you?
And how are you?
That leaves you one up.
Did anyone ever tell you you had beautiful eyes?
No.
Well, you have.
And so have you!
He shot her a glance.
As a smile played around his lips.
Yes.
I don't think I've ever seen four more beautiful eyes in my life.
Well, three, anyway.
You know, you two girls have everything.
You're tall and short, and slim and stout, blonde and brunette, and that's just the kind of a girl I crave!
We three would make an ideal couple.
Why, you've got beauty, charm, money.
You have that money, haven't you?
Because, if you haven't, we can quit right now.
The Captain is charming, isn't he?
I'm fascinated.
I'm fascinated, too.
Right on the arm.
Fascinated.
Whim-wham.
If I were Eugene O'Neill, I could tell you what I really think of you two.
You know, you're very fortunate the theater guild isn't putting this on.
And so is the guild.
Pardon me while I have a strange interlude.
Why, you couple of baboons, what makes you think I'd marry either one of you?
Strange how the wind blows tonight.
It has a thin, eerie voice.
Reminds me of poor old Marsden.
How happy I could be with either of these two if both of them just went away.
Well, what do you say, girls?
What do you say?
Will you marry me?
But, Captain, which one of us?
Both of you.
Let's all get married.
This is my party.
Party.
Party.
Here I am talking of parties.
I came down here for a party.
What happens?
Nothing.
Not even ice cream.
The gods look down and laugh.
This would be a better world for children if the parents had to eat the spinach.
Well, what do you say, girls?
What do you say?
Are we all going to get married?
All of us?
All of us!
But that's bigamy.
Yes, and it's big of me, too!
It's big of all of us.
Let's be big for a change.
I'm sick of these conventional marriages.
One woman and one man was good enough for your grandmother, but who wants to marry your grandmother?
Nobody.
Not even your grandfather.
Think of the honeymoon, strictly private.
I wouldn't let another woman in on this.
Well, maybe one or two, but no men.
I may not go, myself.
Are you suggesting companionate marriage?
Well, it's got advantages.
You could live with your folks, and I could live with your folks.
And you, you could sell Fuller Brushes.
Living with your folks.
Living with your folks, the beginning of the end.
Drab dead yesterdays shutting out beautiful tomorrows.
Hideous stumbling footsteps creaking along the misty corridors of time.
In those corridors, I see figures, strange figures, weird figures.
Steel 186, anaconda 74,
American Can 138.
Well, let's see.
Where were we?
Oh, yes!
We were about to get married.
Well, what do you think?
Do you think we really ought to get married?
I think marriage is a very noble institution.
It's the foundation of the American home.
Yes, but the trouble is you can't enforce it.
It was put over on the American people...
While our boys were over there and while our girls were over here.
You know that I've been waiting at the bottom of these stairs for years for just such a moment as this.
Why, Captain, where are you going?
I'm sorry, ladies, I'm sorry,
But, uh, I'm afraid we're gonna have to postpone the wedding for a few days, maybe for a few years.
Before I get married, I'm going to sow a couple of wild oats.
The Captain's so amusing.
Isn't he charming?
So that's the famous Beaugard, eh?
It's a great picture, isn't it?
Oh, you've seen it before?
Seen it?
I spent three days in Paris copying it.
You did?
Well, me and a million other young artists.
I bet your copy was better than any of them.
Well, it wasn't bad at that.
I'll show it to you sometime.
Listen.
What?
Mother's going to unveil it tonight.
Yeah.
Suppose...
Suppose when she unveils it, it's not the Beaugard at all?
Suppose it's yours!
You mean, put my copy in place of the Beaugard?
Exactly.
Well, Arabella, you're crazy.
What good would that do?
What good?
Listen.
They'll unveil it.
Chandler will tell everybody how fine it is.
They'll all cheer their heads off, and then we'll tell them who really painted it.
They'll say, you're a great artist.
You'll get six commissions for paintings, and we can be married and divorced in no time.
Well, that sounds great.
But what if they don't like my painting?
What then?
Well, isn't the chance worth taking?
Ah, I see you're admiring my picture.
Yes, yes.
Your picture?
Yes, my picture.
Well, it don't look like you.
Hey, wait, wait.
Someplace I met you before, because you're face is a very familiar.
Well, after all, I'm one of the most well-known men in America.
The newspapers will keep on running my photograph.
You're not Abe Kabbible?
Oh, nonsense!
All right.
Hey, wait.
If you're not Abe Kabbible, who are you?
Now, please.
Chandler is my name, Roscoe W. Chandler.
Yeah, but I don't care about the name, you see.
Someplace I met you before, because your face is very familiar.
Now, wait.
Let me see,
Were you ever in Sing Sing?
Please!
No, no, Sing.
I got it.
I got it.
Joliet?
Leave me alone!
No?
All right, don't run away.
Don't run away.
Leavenworth?
Oh, listen here, I have never been in these places.
I spend most of my time in Europe.
Europe.
I got it now.
I know.
You come from Czechoslovakia.
You are wrong, I tell you...
You come from...
Hey, hey, come here, come here.
I tell you...
Please get away from me.
Hey, you remember him.
Who was he?
He comes from Czechoslovakia.
You are wrong, I tell you.
I told you before, you are mistaken.
He comes from Czechoslovakia, and I know who it is.
That's Abie the fish peddler from Czechoslovakia.
Ridiculous, I tell you.
You are wrong.
Wait, wait, wait.
We prove it.
He had a birthmark.
Remember?
Oh, please!
What are you...
Leave me alone.
On the arm.
On the arm.
On the leg.
On the foot, up here, on the mustache.
Ah-ha!
There it is.
There is the birthmark.
Abie the fish man.
I confess.
I was, I was Abie the peddler.
Well, how did you get to be Roscoe W. Chandler?
Say, how did you get to be an Italian?
Never mind.
Whose confession is this?
Well, boys, for heaven's sake, don't say about this to anybody, and I think we can come to some agreement.
Some arrangement which would be, uh, mutually satisfactory.
Money, money.
Yeah.
Shall we say, uh, $500?
Piker!
$500.
Well, that is all the cash I have.
$500?
Well, all right.
I tell you what we do.
We'll take your I.O.U.
I've given you my best offer and that is all you will get.
That's all you give?
Yes.
Abie the fish man Abie the fish man
Abie the fish man Abie the fish man
Please be quiet, quiet!
Please.
Now, come here.
Now, listen here.
I have here a check for $5,000.
Now, I give it to you.
Yeah?
Hey.
Is it good?
Well, of course it is good.
Who would give me a bad check?
I would.
Hey, see if it's good.
All right, if you don't want the check, then that is all you will get.
That's all we get?
Yeah.
Abie the fish man Abie the fish man Please, quiet!
Abie the fish man Abie the fish man Quiet!
Abie the fish man
Here!
Give me that handkerchief.
My tie!
Where is my tie?
I...
You're nothing but a pair of thieves.
That's all.
I get a the tie.
Well, what do you got?
The birthmark!
Hey, hey, where's your tie?
Well, I...
That's a fine way for a millionaire to be running around, open at the neck.
Have you got garters?
Of course, I have garters.
Here.
Oh!
They've taken my garters, too!
A likely story.
Turning collegiate on me, eh?
Have you got socks?
Certainly.
Here they are.
Oh, yeah.
You have got socks.
They look pretty old to me, too.
Whose are they?
My old socks.
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Spaulding, Captain Spaulding.
I am Roscoe W. Chandler.
Well, this is a treat, your treat.
You have heard about me?
Yes, I've heard about you for a great many years, Mr. Chandler, and I'm getting pretty darn sick of it, too.
Quite naturally, I've also heard of the great Captain Spaulding.
Well, that's fine.
I've heard of you and you've heard of me.
Now, have you ever heard the one about the two Irishmen?
Oh, yes!
Now that I've got you in hysterics, let's get to business.
My name is Spaulding, Captain Spaulding.
I am Roscoe W. Chandler.
And I'm Geoffrey T. Spaulding.
I bet you don't know what the "T" stands for.
Uh, Thomas?
Edgar.
You were close, though.
You were close, though, and you still are, I'll bet.
Now, this is what I want to talk to you about, Mr. Chandler.
How would you like to finance a scientific expedition?
Well, that is a question.
Yes that is a question.
You certainly know a question when you see it.
I congratulate you, Mr. Chandler, and that brings us right back to where we were.
How would you like to finance a scientific expedition?
Well, is there any particular kind of an expedition you had in mind?
Well, I tell you.
I'm getting along in years now.
There's one thing I always wanted to do before I quit.
What is that?
Retire.
Now would you be interested in a proposition of that kind?
You know, I've always had an idea that my retirement would be the greatest contribution to science the world has ever known.
This is your chance, Mr. Chandler.
When I think what you have done for this country...
And by the way, what have you done for this country?
Oh, well.
I've always tried to do what I could, especially in the world of art.
Art?
Well, I don't know how we drifted around that.
But what is your opinion of art?
I am very glad you asked me!
I withdraw the question.
This fellow takes things seriously.
It isn't safe to ask him a simple question.
Tell me Mr. Chandler, where are you planning on putting your new opera house?
Oh, I thought I should put it somewhere near Central Park.
I see.
Why don't you put it right in Central Park?
Could we do that?
Sure.
Do it at night when no one is looking.
Why don't you put it in the reservoir and get the whole thing over with?
Of course, that might interfere with the water supply.
But after all, we must remember that art is art.
Still, on the other hand, water is water, isn't it?
And east is east, and west is west.
And If you take cranberries and stew them like applesauce, it tastes more like prunes than rhubarb does.
Now, uh, now, you tell me what you know.
Well, I would be very glad to give you my opinion.
Well, that's dandy.
I'll ask you for them someday.
Remind me, will you?
I'll tell you what, could you come to my office at 10:00 tomorrow morning?
If I'm not there, ask for Mr. Jamison, that's my secretary, and If he sees you, I'll discharge him.
That's a date, now.
Saturday at 3:00.
No, you better make it Tuesday, I'm going to Europe Monday.
Pardon me.
My name is Spaulding.
I've always wanted to meet you, Mr. Chandler.
Tell me.
What do you think of the traffic problem?
What do you think of the marriage problem?
What do you think of at night when you go to bed, you beast?
Well, I'll tell you...
I'd rather not discuss it any further.
Remember, there are children present.
Well, you see, my dear Captain, in the last analysis, it is a question of money.
The nickel today is not what it used to be 10 years ago.
I'll go further than that.
I'll get off at the depot.
The nickel is not what it was 15 years ago.
You know what this country needs today?
What?
A seven-cent nickel.
Yes, sir.
We've been using the five-cent nickel in this country since 1492.
Now, that's pretty near 100 years, daylight saving.
Now, why not give the seven-cent nickel a chance?
If that works out, next year we could have an eight-cent nickel.
Think what that would mean.
You could go to a newsstand buy a three-cent newspaper and get the same nickel back.
One nickel, carefully used, would last a family a lifetime.
Captain Spaulding, I think that is a wonderful idea.
You do, eh?
Yes.
Then there can't be much to it.
Forget about it.
Well, uh...
Well, tell me, Captain Chandler, uh, excuse me, Spaulding.
Spaulding, Spaulding, that's right.
Yeah.
I'm Spaulding, you're Chandler.
Let's have no more of that either, eh?
It's bad enough being Spaulding.
Well, tell me, Captain Spaulding,
Spaulding is the name?
That's right.
That's right.
I'm, I'm Chan...
I'm Spaulding...
Spaulding...
Could I look at a program a minute?
I might be the "News Weekly," for all he knows, or "Coming Next Week."
Well, tell me, Captain Spaulding, you've been quite a traveler.
Uh, what do you think about South America?
I'm going there soon, you know.
Is that so?
Where are you going?
Uruguay.
Well, you go Uruguay and I'll go mine.
Say, how long has this been going on?
Let's change the subject.
Take the foreign situation.
Take Abyssinia.
I'll tell you, you take Abyssinia, and I'll take a hot butterscotch sundae on rye bread.
Let's go and see what the boys in the back room will have.
But, my...
Let's see how yours compares with the original.
All right, let's.
Oh!
I don't see any difference.
Well, look closer.
Maybe, you'll find it's better.
Oh, you!
You seen my partner?
No.
Oh, Mr. Ravioli.
Ravelli, Ravelli.
Oh, Mr. Ravelli.
I want you to do something for me.
I do anything for you.
What do you want, I should do?
You see that painting?
You mean, this picture?
I want you to take that out of the frame and put this one in its place.
You want I should take this one down and put this one upstairs.
Yes, that's it.
You want I should steal!
Oh, no, no!
It's not stealing.
Well, then, I couldn't do it.
Oh, Mr. Ravioli!
Oh, no, no, no.
Hey, get up, get up.
Come here.
That's all you do, chase the women.
Go.
Aw, stop!
Everybody here plays cards.
They don't ask us.
We are a waste all the time.
We been here all day.
How much a we make?
We make a nothing.
First thing you know, we gonna live on a charity, then go to the old ladies' home.
How do you like that?
No, no.
That's a no good!
These people here all got a money.
Now, we gotta get someone to play with us, see.
I play anything.
Oh, Signor Ravelli,
I want to speak to you about the music.
Yeah.
How do you do?
What's the matter with you?
I thought, it would be nice...
Go away from me.
What is this?
That's all right.
Just a...
Oh, there you are.
My, dear...
Hello, Professor.
Good heavens.
What's the matter with his feet?
This is embarrassing.
That's nothing.
Why, we play all kinds of games.
We play blackjack, soccer...
Oh!
Dear, I'm so sorry!
Mrs. Whitehead...
What is the matter with him?
I wouldn't have had this happen for the world.
Oh!
Heavens!
Come on!
Atta boy!
Go away from me!
One...
Two...
Three.
Atta boy.
Atta boy.
Good heavens.
Oh, dear.
I must, get them out.
I must get them out of here!
Oh, look.
You see how terrible he looks!
Look.
I'm so frightened.
Look, what can I do?
I don't know.
I better get Hives.
No, let me get her.
Well, you go, then.
I'm just trying to watch my...
Oh, this is terrible.
She can't take it there.
You better get Hives.
Go away from me!
This is dreadful.
Well, why don't you leave him alone?
Stop!
Now that this game is over, how about playing bridge?
You play bridge?
I play bridge a little.
What do you play for?
Oh, we just play for small stakes.
And French fried potatoes?
Set it up over there, Hives.
Very good, madam.
What in the world is he up to?
Look at this.
The whole house will be torn to pieces.
Absolutely.
If it isn't one thing, it's another.
Oh, Hives!
Oh!
Take it away, Hives.
Extraordinary.
We'll play over here.
Now, how do you want to play?
Honest?
Well, I hope so.
You put that right away.
It's your own fault.
Come along now.
We'll cut for partners.
Oh, he's my partner.
That's the only way we play.
I'm sorry but it's against the rules of the games.
We have to cut for partners.
All right.
We cut for partners.
I got ace of spades.
He's got ace of spades.
That's what you call "quin-cidences."
Two aces of spaces?
Yeah, he's got thousands of them.
Well, I suppose that gives him the choice of seats.
You have the choice of seats.
Good heavens!
Not on her lap.
Come on!
Sit down.
What's the matter with him?
I don't know.
He thought it was contact bridge.
Just a minute now.
Shuffle the cards.
Yeah.
You got to scrumble them up a bit.
You know.
Just a moment.
I'd like to cut those cards.
That's a better.
Uh, your bid, partner.
You pass?
Misdeal.
You pass?
I bid one spade.
I pass.
Three spades.
Four spades.
One club.
I don't understand this kind of bidding!
Well, you don't have to understand.
You bid four spades, huh?
Why, I haven't a spade in my hand!
All right.
We double.
There's something wrong here.
I want you to go over the bidding.
Hey, she wants to start them up again, the bidding.
He bids one.
One?
One what?
That's all right.
You find out.
But we have to know what he's bidding.
We tell you later.
Now I bid two.
Two what?
Uh, two of the same he bids.
Now, the bidding's over.
See, that's enough bidding.
Uh, it's your lead.
Oh, no, you can't lead that.
Why not?
Why, we can't take it.
Well, what should I lead?
Ace.
Ace of spades.
That's very good.
Three of spades, four of spades...
You trump it?
Uh, that's what you call a finesse.
No spades, partner.
No spades!
Ace of hearts.
Ace of clubs.
Dummy leads.
The dummy leads.
I'm not the dummy!
Well, you could be.
Ace of diamonds.
100 aces, huh?
200?
That's better.
Ace of hearts.
Atta boy, make a big slam.
Make a big, big slam!
Ace of spades.
Ace of spades.
That's a good.
He plays a good game.
Ace of spades.
He plays a fine game, all right.
Ace of...
I refuse to play any longer.
You're nothing but a couple of card sharps.
Good heavens!
What's the matter, dear?
My shoes are gone!
Good gracious.
He has your slippers.
Come along, come along.
Hey, you take a the lady's shoes, huh?
Hey.
Quiet.
Quiet, quiet.
Hide!
Hide!
Somebody's coming.
All right.
I make a mistake.
Get up, get up.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Come.
Hey, hurry up.
Come here.
You know what we gotta do, eh?
We gotta take a that picture out and put this one upstairs for the lady.
Wait!
No touch.
You got everything ready, huh?
The shovel, the ax, the dynamite, the pineapples?
Where's the flash?
That's a no flash.
A flash.
There's a flash.
Flash.
That's a flash.
A flash.
Yeah, that's a flash.
That's a fish!
I no want a fish.
No fish.
Flash.
Aw, stop it.
You act crazy.
When you go out in the night time, you gotta have a the flash.
Ha!
That's a no flash.
That's a flask.
Flash.
When you wanna see somebody, you gotta have a the flash.
That's a flush.
What I gonna do with a flush?
A flash.
No flit.
It's a flits.
What am I gonna do with a flits?
What do you got?
That's whatcha call a flutes.
All you got is a fish, a flutes, a flits, flutes, flits and a flutes.
Stop this!
Where's the flash?
Look, when everything is a light...
And you wanna make them a dark, what do you do?
Ah!
You're crazy.
I don't want no blackjack.
That's a my mistake, I guess.
When everything is dark, and you wanna make them light...
Yeah, that's a flash.
That's a flash.
Hey, that's a good, all right.
The storm put the lights out.
Now, nobody can see what we do.
That's a fine.
Where is the flash?
Where's the flash?
I no want the fish!
The flash!
No, no flute!
No, flute!
What's the matter with you, eh?
Flash.
Before the people come, get a the flash.
What's the matter?
You lose it?
Well, you gotta find it.
Look for it.
All right, all right.
Never mind.
Come on.
We'll work without it.
Yes, madam.
Hide!
Hide!
Somebody's coming.
Hide, hide, hide.
Quiet!
Shut up!
Quiet.
Shut up.
Be quiet.
I know where you are.
It's all right.
Oh, Captain Spaulding?
Captain Spaulding, where are you?
Here.
Yes, what's the trouble?
The storm has put the lights out, and you can't see your hand before your face.
You wouldn't get much enjoyment out of that.
I don't know what you're gonna do, but I'm gonna take a nap.
Leave me a call for 3:00.
Make it 3:30.
You certainly get service around here.
Pardon me, Mrs. Rittenhouse, did you lose a fish?
What?
Well, somebody lost it.
Will you take it out in the kitchen and have it fried for me?
Did you hear that?
There's somebody over there.
I say, there's somebody over there!
Don't be silly.
The house is just settling.
That's all.
Anybody over there?
I don't see anybody.
There you are.
If there's anybody there, we'd see him, wouldn't I?
- Oh, what is it?
- Captain, what is it?
You know, what I think?
I think you got roaches.
Yes, you got roaches, all right.
And the biggest one has got asthma.
Oh, this is terrible.
Captain, let's get out of here.
We get a the picture.
We don't make one sound.
Hey!
Somebody put on the lights.
All right.
We get a the picture.
We don't make one sound.
Come on.
Let's go.
Get out of here.
What do you want?
Oh, the fish.
Come on, come on.
Oh!
That's some storm, huh?
That's a regular tomato.
Come on.
Let's go this way.
I think it's a shortcut.
Come on, let's go.
California!
Oh, Captain, how thrilling.
And then what happened?
It was nothing at all.
I'd rather not discuss it.
But I can't wait to hear the finish.
I must hear it.
Well, there I was.
There I was in the top of the tree with this rhinoceros pointing his gun straight at me.
A rhinoceros?
Yes.
Captain, what did you do?
What could I do?
I had to marry his daughter.
What kind of a story do you call that?
All right, you tell one.
And now, my friends, before we start the musical program,
Captain Spaulding has kindly consented to tell us about his trip to Africa.
Captain Spaulding.
Me?
My friends, I'm going to tell you of that great mysterious, wonderful continent known as Africa.
Africa is God's country, and he can have it.
Well, sir.
We left New York drunk and early on the morning of February 2.
After 15 days on the water and six on the boat, we finally arrived on the shores of Africa.
We once proceeded 300 miles into the heart of the jungle, where I shot a polar bear.
This bear was 6' 7" in his stocking feet and had shoes on...
Pardon me, just a moment, Captain.
Just a moment.
I always thought that polar bears lived in the frozen north.
Oh, you did.
Well, this bear was anemic, and he couldn't stand the cold climate.
He was a rich bear and could afford to go away in the winter.
You take care of your animals and I'll take care of mine!
Frozen north, my eye.
From the day of our arrival, we led an active life.
The first morning saw us up at 6:00, breakfasted and back in bed at 7:00.
This was our routine for the first three months.
We finally got so we were back in bed at 6:30.
One morning, I was sitting in front of the cabin, smoking some meat.
Smoking some meat?
Yes, there wasn't a cigar store in the neighborhood.
As I say, I was sitting in front of the cabin when I bagged six tigers.
Oh, Captain!
Six of them biggest I...
Captain, did you catch six tigers?
I bagged them.
I...
I bagged them to go away, but they hung around all afternoon.
They were the most persistent tigers I've ever seen.
The principal animals inhabiting the African jungle are moose, elks and Knights of Pythias.
Of course, you all know what a moose is.
That's big game.
The first day I shot two bucks.
That was the biggest game we had.
As I say, you all know what a moose is.
A moose runs around on the floor and eats cheese and is chased by the cats.
The elks, on the other hand, live up in the hills.
And in the spring, they come down for their annual convention.
It is interesting to watch them come to the water hole.
And you should see them run when they find it's only a water hole!
What they're looking for is an elk-a-hole.
One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas.
How he got in my pajamas, I don't know.
Then we tried to remove the tusks.
The tusks.
That's not so easy to say.
Tusks.
You try that sometime.
Tusks.
Oh, simple.
Tusks.
Pardon me, my name is Spaulding.
I've always wanted to meet you, Mr. Chandler.
As I say, we tried to remove the tusks.
But they were embedded in so firmly that we couldn't bust them.
Of course, in Alabama, the Tuscaloosa.
But, uh, that's entirely irr-elephant to what I was talking about.
We took some pictures of the native girls, but they weren't developed.
But we're going back again in a couple of weeks.
I will...
A very enlightening speech, Captain.
Very enlightening.
Hooray for Captain Spaulding!
Three cheers for Captain Spaulding!
Aw.
Oh, really I...
Three cheers for Captain Spaulding!
Three cheers...
No one asked for the chairs!
Put them right where you found them.
Now, go now.
Go now.
Go on, go on!
Go on with your chairs.
Get out!
Go on, go on, go on, you.
And, now, friends,
Signor Ravelli will oblige us at the piano.
Signor Ravelli.
Signor Ravelli's first selection will be
Somewhere My Love Lies Sleeping With a Male Chorus.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
17, 18, 19, 20...
Say, if you get near a song, play it.
I can't think of the finish.
That's strange.
And I can't think of anything else.
You know what I think?
I think I went past it.
I mean, if you come around again, jump off.
I once kept this up for three days.
You wouldn't consider hush money, would you?
I can't get him now, I've got to wait for inspiration.
It's about time.
Play the song about Montreal.
Montreal?
I'm a Dreamer, Montreal.
I don't know that.
I'll tell you what I do.
I play one of my own compositions by Victor Herbert.
Make it short.
He plays them both well.
Atta boy.
The old red team scored that time.
So did the old blue one.
Why do you push, huh?
Why do you push?
Oh, please, stop them.
Let them alone.
They may exterminate each other.
Come on, come on!
The best thing that can happen for either of them.
And once for old Purdue.
I was afraid of that.
Hey, I thought I had the finish.
I wish you did.
Yours.
Play the song about the Irish chiropodist.
Irish chiropodist?
My Fate is in Your Hands.
Is there a horse in the house?
They've got everything else here.
And, uh, now, Mrs. Rittenrotten...
Uh, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Yes, a slight error.
I have a little surprise for you!
The man is here for the piano.
Oh, Captain.
No, really.
What I meant to say was that, uh...
When I departed from the natives in Africa, I was presented with a gift.
And this gift I'm going to give to you at a very low figure.
Oh, how wonderful, Captain!
Well, no.
Don't be too hasty.
Oh, I just...
This is all hand-painted.
The whole thing was done with the white of an egg.
Well, what is it, Captain?
What is it?
"What is it?" you ask.
This is a hope chest for a guinea pig.
Oh.
What is it?
This magnificent chest...
No, this...
No, this magnificent chest,
I now take great pleasure in presenting to you with my compliments.
Captain, this leaves me speechless.
Well, see that you remain that way.
And, now, ladies and gentlemen...
Come outside and say that.
If we will all adjourn to the library,
Mrs. Rittenhouse has another, and perhaps greater, surprise for us.
Hmm.
This way, Captain.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, how do you pay Hives?
By the week or by the pound?
And now, it is my privilege to reveal the masterpiece of Francois Jacques Dubois Gilbert Beaugard.
No trains will be sold after the magazines leave the depot.
After the Hunt.
There!
I told you you were a great artist.
Shall we spill the beans now?
Let's wait a minute.
Something might happen.
Now, I'm sure, we'd all appreciate a few words from Mr. Chandler, who will tell us of the life and work of the artist, Beaugard.
And keep it clean.
Mr. Chandler.
My friends,
I am quite sure that you are all familiar with Beaugard, and this is perhaps his masterpiece.
In it, he has achieved the greatness in the handling of color and line.
Now, you will see here that I...
Wait!
This is not my picture.
This is a rank imitation!
What do you mean, Mr. Chandler?
Well, here, see for yourself!
You are right.
It is not the Beaugard.
It certainly isn't.
There's a dog missing!
Oh, Captain Spaulding, what shall I do?
Telephone the dog catchers immediately!
They have taken the original and left me this.
Leave it to me.
I'll throw some light on this subject.
Has anyone a match?
What's wrong?
- Hives, Hives, where are you?
- Turn on the lights.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, did you lose that fish again?
Oh, Captain, I'm so worried.
Good heavens!
That one is gone, too!
Oh, this is awful.
The crooks!
The crooks!
They are escaping.
Follow me, men!
Never mind the men, just the women.
Oh, Captain.
Captain!
- Captain!
- Come on.
Right this way.
He went out here someplace.
Excitement.
I never saw anything so funny in all my life.
It was great, and there goes her old party.
Good old Hives.
Wasn't it funny?
Oh, very.
Why, you're not afraid, are you, Hives?
Oh, no, I'm not afraid.
Oh, dear, no.
Only, you see, well, they were talking of having the police here.
And I wouldn't want the police to suspect me.
Why, they wouldn't suspect you.
Oh, yes, they would.
You see, the last time they suspected me,
I got four years.
Hives!
All right, Hives.
Give me the painting and I'll take care of it.
Good.
Come.
Good heavens!
It's gone!
Gone?
I left it in there.
There?
There must be thieves at this party.
Oh, God!
If I'd known that, I never would have come.
Wait a minute.
That professor.
The professor!
I see!
Hives, that's the fellow in the woodpile.
Now, listen.
We've got to get that picture away from him!
Might I suggest some of this?
What...
Oh, very satisfactory in these cases.
A few drops on a handkerchief and the professor will no longer obstruct us.
You are sure it'll do the trick?
Oh, absolutely.
Would you care to try some?
No, thanks, Hives.
Let's find the professor.
I don't see how the thief could have gotten away.
I wonder who it could have been.
It's a good thing we substituted yours.
Suppose that the thief had gotten away with the Beaugard!
Oh, it would be all right if they stole mine.
Oh, darling, I...
I didn't mean that.
But what would mother do?
Why, it's worth $100,000!
How could she have replaced it?
Oh, I understand, dear.
Isn't it exciting?
Just think.
Whoever took it was right in the room with us!
Just like Raffles.
Oh, isn't it romantic?
All the boys I've known
Used to say I was made of stone
I would always leave them alone
In despair
I've been on the pan
I've been called an electric fan
Told I'm even much colder than
Frigidaire
I began to wonder
If I was all wrong
I thought so till you came along
Tell me, dear
Why am I so romantic
When you're near
Why am I so romantic
What a grand feeling
When your lips meet mine
That certain something comes
Stealing up and down my spine
I don't know what it is you do to me
You don't know half of the good you do me
Other boys bore me
They just leave me blue
But why am I so romantic
With you
Tell me, dear
Why am I so romantic
When you're near
Why am I so romantic
What a grand feeling
When your lips touch mine
That certain something comes
Stealing up and down my spine
When we pet close in your arms
You hold me
I forget all that my mother told me
Other girls bore me
They just leave me blue
But why am I so romantic
With you
Oh, Signor Ravelli.
Ah, how do you do?
I've been looking for you all morning.
I was busy all morning, but you could have had me last night.
Signor Ravelli, you've gotta put that painting back.
Painting?
Painting?
What painting?
What are you talking?
The one you changed last night, you remember?
Oh, you mean the picture?
Yes.
Hey, what's the matter for you?
First you want them downstairs, then you want them upstairs.
Then you want them downstairs, then you...
Come on, make up your mind.
Oh, I do thank you for what you've done.
But you've got to get that painting back before the police get here.
Police?
Yes!
They come here?
Yes!
Wait, I give it to you, you put it back.
Come on, come on.
Where's the picture?
What do you mean, "Where's the picture"?
I put him in there.
It's gone.
Somebody take him.
You take him!
Me?
No, I know.
I know.
I...
The fish peddler.
Abie, the fish peddler.
Did mother invite a fish peddler here?
I don't know whether she invite, but he's here.
Come on.
We find him.
Good morning, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Good morning, Mr. Jamison.
And how is Captain Spaulding this morning?
Oh, he had a very bad night.
He didn't sleep a wink.
He went horseback riding in the middle of the night.
I'm sorry.
Yes, I know.
But we've all been very upset.
Bad case.
Yeah.
Uh, good morning, Captain.
Did you enjoy your ride?
What in the world are you looking for?
I lost my horse.
Oh!
Yes, he slipped right out from between me.
I can't understand it.
I had my feet in the syrups, too.
I don't know.
I don't know how he got...
I didn't care about that, but I lost the bit you loaned me.
Never mind.
I'll get you another bit.
Well, that'll be two bits I owe you, then.
Captain, I hope you weren't distressed by last night's unfortunate occurrence.
You mean that dinner you served?
No, the painting that was stolen.
Was there a painting stolen?
I haven't seen a paper in three weeks.
Jamison, as my secretary, why didn't you inform me there was a painting stolen?
What do you think I engaged you for?
But, Captain, I didn't know it.
Well, you should have asked me.
I didn't know it!
- Well, I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.
You're a contemptible cur!
I repeat, sir, you're a contemptible cur!
Oh, if I were a man you'd resent that.
Please keep quiet, will you?
I can get along without you, you know.
I got along without your father, didn't I?
Yes, and your grandfather.
Yes, and your uncle!
Yes, and your uncle!
Yes, and my uncle.
Captain!
I didn't come here to be exonerated.
I beg pardon, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Oh, you do, eh?
Well, I'd like to see you crawl out of a rumble seat.
The police are here, madam.
Oh, the police.
Have them come in.
Oh, so, that's your game, is it?
You can't shut me up.
Captain.
No!
You can talk to my attorney.
Jamison?
Yes, sir.
Take a letter to my lawyers.
I'll show you a thing or two, or three.
I'll show you a thing or three.
Oh, Captain.
Sending for the police.
Take a letter to my lawyers!
Sending for the police, eh?
I say, take a letter to my lawyers!
I am taking it!
Uh, read me what you have so far.
Honorable Charles H. Hungerdunger, in care of Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger and McCormick.
Semicolon.
How do you spell "semicolon"?
All right, make it a comma.
Dear, Elsie...
No, never mind Elsie.
Do you want me to scratch "Elsie"?
Well, if you enjoy that sort of thing, it's quite all right with me.
However, I'm not interested in your private affairs, Jamison.
Begin this way.
Let's start all over again.
Honorable Charles H. Hungerdunger, in care of Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger and McCormick.
Gentlemen, question mark.
- Do you want that, uh...
- in the letter?
No, put that in an envelope.
Now, then, in re yours of the fifth inst.
Yours to hand and beg to rep.
Brackets.
That, uh, we have gone over the ground carefully and we seem to believe,
I-E, to wit, E-G, in lieu, that, uh, despite all our precautionary measures which have been involved...
We seem to believe that it is hardly necessary for us to proceed unless we receive an ipso facto that is not negligible at this moment.
Quotes, unquotes and quotes.
Uh, hoping this finds you, I beg you to remain...
Hoping this finds him where?
Well, let him worry about that.
Don't be so inquisitive, Jamison.
Sneak!
I say, hoping this finds you,
I beg to remain, as of June 9th, cordially yours.
Regards.
That's all, Jamison.
I'll show you where I get off.
Sending for the police.
Now read me the letter, Jamison.
"Honorable Charles H. Hungadunga..."
"Hungerdunger."
"Hunga...
Hun." "Hunga..."
"Hungerdunger." That's it.
"Hungerdunger."
"In care of Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger and McCormick."
You've left out a "Hungerdunger."
You left out the main one, too.
Thought you could slip one over on me, eh?
All right, leave it out and put in a windshield wiper instead.
I'll tell you what you do, Jamison.
I'll tell you what.
Make it, uh, make it three windshield wipers and one "Hungerdunger."
They won't all be there when the letter arrives anyhow.
"Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger and McCormick."
"And McCormick."
"Dear Elsie, scratch."
That won't do, Jamison.
That won't go through the mail, the way you got it.
The way you've got the letter, you've got McCormick scratching Elsie.
Now you better turn that around and have Elsie scratch McCormick.
And you better turn McCormick around, too, Jamison.
And see what you can do for me.
"Gentlemen, question mark."
"Gentlemen, question mark"?
Put it on the penultimate, not on the diphthongic.
You wanna brush up on your Greek, Jamison.
Well, get a Greek and brush up on him.
"In re yours of the fifth inst." I see.
Now, you said a lot of things here that I didn't think were important, so I just omitted them.
Well!
Hmm.
Oh, Captain!
Good gracious!
Oh, my!
So, you've just omitted them, eh?
You've just omitted the body of the letter, that's all.
You've left out the body of the letter, that's all.
Yours is not to reason why, Jamison!
You've left out the body of the letter!
All right, send it that way and tell them the body will follow.
Do you want the body in brackets?
No, it'll never get there in brackets.
Put it in a box.
Put it in a box and mark it, uh, "fragilly."
Mark it what?
Mark it "fragilly." F-R-A-G...
Look it up, Jamison.
It's in the dictionary.
Look under "fragile."
Look under the table if you don't find it there.
Uh, "Quotes, unquotes, and quotes."
That's three quotes?
Yes, sir.
Add another quote and make it a gallon.
How much is it, a gallon, Jamison?
Regards.
Regards.
That's a fine letter, Jamison.
That's an epic.
That's dandy.
Now, I want you to make two carbon copies of that letter and throw the original away.
And when you get through with that, throw the carbon copies away.
Just send a stamp airmail.
And that's all.
You may go, Jamison.
I may go, too.
Mrs. Rittenhouse?
Yes?
I'm Inspector Hennessey from headquarters.
How do you do, Inspector?
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Captain Scotland of Spaulding Yard.
No, I'm Captain Spaulding of Scotland Yard.
Please don't make the same mistake again.
I'm glad to know you, Captain.
Well, I should think you would be.
Now, then, inspector, I think between the two of us we can solve the mystery of the stolen painting.
Especially, if you go home.
Inspector, please don't be too hasty about making an arrest.
I don't want my guests embarrassed.
Don't worry.
We won't arrest anybody.
He's lucky if he can stay out of jail himself.
Mr. Jamison, would you mind taking the inspector and his men to the library and showing them the scene of the crime?
Certainly, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Right this way, Inspector.
Come on, boys.
And, Jamison, count the spoons.
Captain, I didn't know you'd been a detective.
There's a whole lot of things you don't know.
I suppose that's so.
You know darn well it's so.
Where were you on the night of June 5, 1774?
I'm afraid I don't know.
You bet you don't know.
Where was I?
I don't know.
Well, I don't know, either.
And if I did know I wouldn't tell you.
Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
Take a number from one to 10.
All right.
All right.
What's the number?
Seven.
That's right.
Seven is right.
I could have done it with one hand if I wanted.
This is no mystery.
I could solve this in five minutes if I wanted to worry.
Captain, I don't want you to worry.
I don't want anything to interfere with your weekend.
Nothing ever interferes with my weekend, and I'll thank you not to get personal, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Captain.
Captain, I assure you...
Where's my secretary?
I didn't mean...
No, no.
Where's my secretary?
Jamison, Jamison?
Captain, you misunderstood me.
Oh!
A more dastardly crack
I've never heard.
Oh.
Captain, please.
I wish I was back in the jungle where men are monkeys.
Captain, I'm so sorry.
Jamison!
Jamison?
No.
Oh, Captain.
Oh, dear.
No!
Good morning, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Good morning.
Perfectly charming party.
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
It's just full of surprises.
So glad you're enjoying yourself.
Oh, Hives.
Hives!
Good morning.
Some breakfast?
Breakfast, nothing.
Did you get the painting?
No, I did not.
I watched all night, but the professor did not sleep in his room.
No?
Strange.
Very strange.
Good heavens, Hives!
What will we do?
I don't know.
Until we see the professor.
You keep an eye on him till I get back with the bottle.
Don't worry, he'll not get away from me this time.
Did you get it?
Good.
Yes, madam.
Now, I'll go ahead and engage him in conversation.
You'll trail behind, and when the proper time comes, see that he gets it.
Very good, madam.
Oh, hello.
I've been looking all over for you.
Where have you been?
What is the matter with this?
What have you got there, the morning papers?
No, that isn't the one I want.
Let me see one of the others.
That still isn't the one I want.
You know what I want.
Out.
Yes, out.
Never mind the birds.
Come on up here.
Sit down.
I want to talk to you.
Don't you like me?
You don't?
Well, I like you.
I like little boys like you.
By the way, how old are you?
Five years old?
Why you're just a baby, aren't you?
Aw, isn't that nice?
I like that.
No, no, no!
Now, all joking aside.
Isn't there someone you do like?
Isn't there someone you love?
Now think again.
Isn't there someone you really and truly love?
Is there?
Tell me who.
Why, that's a horse.
You love a horse.
Come on.
Lift him up.
Come on, he's out.
Let us get out.
Arabella.
John, I've been trying to find you.
Ravelli has lost the painting.
Well, I've been looking all over for you.
I found a painting out on the terrace.
Was it the Beaugard?
No.
Oh, yours!
Shh.
Well, if it's not yours and it's not the Beaugard, whose is it?
Where did it come from?
Oh, don't you see?
Someone else came along and substituted it for mine, thinking they were getting away with the original Beaugard.
Somebody swiped my scheme, eh?
Hey, then Chandler never saw your painting after all.
No!
For all I know you may still be a great artist.
Where is this picture?
It's up in my room.
Well, you go get it and I'll get Captain Spaulding.
He'll get to the bottom of this.
And then John found a third painting.
Well, that's very interesting.
Well, fairly interesting.
But we've just got to keep a sharp lookout.
That's all.
Oh, I've got to find it or mother's out of $100,000.
Now, don't worry.
Let me work on this case for 24 hours, and then we'll call in somebody else.
You think it's a mystery now?
Wait till you'll see it tomorrow.
Remember the Charley Ross disappearance?
I worked on that case for 24 hours and they never did find him.
They couldn't find me for five years.
That's me, Captain Yard of Scotland Spaulding.
I always get my women.
Or paintings.
Arabella!
Can you imagine what's happened?
You know that painting I found?
Yes?
Well, it's been stolen from my room.
John!
There you are.
I've been on the case five minutes and there's another painting gone.
I'll bet it's not even five minutes.
I'll bet it not over three.
Now they've got my watch!
This is going too far.
It wasn't going and now it's gone.
The door to my room was locked, too!
Well, how could they get in?
Who could it have been?
Wait a minute.
I think I've got a clue.
No, it's a hair.
A red hair.
The professor?
Oh, no.
No, it couldn't be.
Well, he's been picked this month by the Crook of the Month Club.
Anyhow, we'll investigate it.
You know Conductor Hennessey, don't you?
Inspector!
Inspector yourself.
Now, listen, you know that little redheaded fellow?
The professor?
Yes.
Well, get that gang of flagpole sitters of yours and see if you can find him.
Aye, aye, Captain.
Come on, boys.
He'll get to the bottom of this.
You'll see how quick these boys...
Hey, what's that punk doing there?
They're good policemen.
Didn't take long to find him.
That's right.
This is it.
Yeah, this is it.
But which one is it?
That's the one that was just taken from my room!
Well, we've got that back.
Maybe I got my watch back.
Now, the fob is gone.
Well, I still got the pocket.
Anything I retain now is velvet.
Except the coat.
That's Prince Albert.
Well, all the jokes can't be good.
You've gotta expect that once in a while.
Say, if we could find the fellow that painted this picture, well, we'd have a pretty good clue.
What'd you say?
I said if we could find the fellow that painted this picture, we'd have a pretty good clue.
You just said that!
What a dull conversationalist you turned out to be.
Let me see that a minute.
Will you?
Say, this is signed "Beaugard."
There's the criminal, Beaugard.
No, Beaugard is dead!
Beaugard is dead?
Then it's murder!
Now we've got something.
What you got, Captain?
I got jacks and aces.
What do you got?
That's good.
I was bluffing.
Look at this, Ravelli.
Isn't there something strikes you very funny about this picture?
Oh, come, come.
It isn't as funny as all that.
Did you ever see a tree like that?
Tree?
That's a spinach.
That can't be spinach.
Where's the egg?
Well, it could be spinach.
Look, all the sand laying around there.
You mean, it's an old spinach custom?
No, it's not that, Ravelli.
Anything but that.
Oh.
No, Cap.
That's all right.
It's my mistake.
You know what that is?
That's coleslaw.
Coleslaw?
Yeah, it's a coleslaw.
Did you ever see coleslaw like that?
Sure, look at this one.
No, I don't want one on your lip, now.
Did you ever see anything like that?
Did you ever see anything like that?
You know what this is?
This is a left-handed painting.
Look, there's a signature.
That's right, it's in the right-hand corner.
That's right.
This is either a left-handed painting or a vegetable dinner.
Now, if we can find the left-handed person that painted this, we'll have The Trial of Mary Dugan with sound.
Well, I saw that.
Good-bye.
Now, you wait here.
I'm gonna need you.
Now, look.
We mustn't lose this.
This is evidence.
Now, take it to your room and leave the door open this time.
We'll try that.
And not a word about this to anybody, not even to me.
Ravelli, we have got to find the left-handed painting.
Yes, the left-handed painter.
Now in a case like this the first thing to do is to find the motive.
Now, what could have been the motive of the guy who has swapped the Beaugard?
I got it!
Robbery!
Would you mind going out and crossing the boulevard when the lights are against you?
See, Cap, sit down.
You understand, I got an idea how to find this painting.
In a case like this that is so mysterious, you gotta get at the clues.
You gotta use the Sherlock Holmes method.
Now, you go about it like this.
You say to yourself, "What happened?"
And the answer come back, "Something was stolen."
Then you say to yourself, "What was stolen?"
And the answer come back, "A painting."
What are you, a ventriloquist?
Now you say to yourself, "Where was this painting stolen?"
And the answer come back, "In this house."
Now, so far I'm right, eh?
Well, it's pretty hard to be wrong if you keep answering yourself all the time.
Now you go a little further, and you say to yourself,
"Who stole the painting?"
This is a very, very important question.
Captain, you get the answer, you've got the solution to the whole thing.
Especially if you find the picture.
Now you take all the clues.
You put them together.
What do you got, eh?
A bread pudding.
No, here's what we got.
Something was stolen.
Stolen where?
In this house.
Stolen by who?
Somebody in the house.
Now to find the painting, you only gotta do is go to everybody in the house and ask them if they took it.
You know, I could rent you out as a decoy for duck hunters?
You say you're gonna go to everybody in the house and ask them if they took the painting?
Suppose nobody in the house took the painting.
Go to the house next door.
That's great.
Suppose there isn't any house next door.
Well, then of course we gotta build one.
Well, now you're talking.
What kind of house do you think we ought put up?
Well, I'll tell ya, Cap.
You see.
My idea of a house is something nice and small and comfortable.
That's the way I feel about it.
I don't want anything elaborate.
Just a little place that I can call home and tell the wife I won't be there for dinner.
I see.
You just want a telephone booth.
No, in that case, I'll get in touch with Chic Sales.
Now, what do you say, Cap, we build right about here?
Here?
Yeah, right about here.
Oh, I'd like something over here if I could get it.
I don't like junior crossing the tracks on his way to the reform school.
I don't like junior at all, as a matter of fact.
All right, all right.
We got something over there.
And believe me, that's convenient.
That's very convenient.
Well, all you gotta do is open the door, step outside and there you are.
There you are?
Yeah.
"There you are" where?
Outside.
Well, suppose you want to get back in again?
You had no right to go out.
Well, don't do anything until I hear from you, will you?
Say, maybe that's the painting down in the cellar!
That's no cellar.
That's the roof.
That's the roof?
Down there?
Yeah, you see, we keep the roof in the basement, so when the rain comes, the chimney don't get wet.
I'm going out and get X-rayed.
I'll be back in a little while.
I may be wonderful, but I think you're wrong, Ravelli.
Hey, wait, don't get up excited.
Come here.
Now, look, here's the rooms.
Those are the rooms?
Yeah.
Right, there's the rooms.
This is your room.
This is my room and this is the maid's room.
Oh, I'd have to go through your room?
Ah!
That's all right.
I won't be in it.
Say, Ravelli, you couldn't put the maid in your room, eh?
What makes you think I couldn't?
Well, there's gonna be a lot of traffic in there.
I can see that.
Well, what do you say?
You ready to sign the lease?
Well, it's a little premature.
I'd like to discuss it with my husband.
Could you come back this evening when he is home?
Hey, you married?
Why, I've got a girl as big as you are.
All right, get me one.
Don't get vulgar, Ravelli.
Ravelli, how about the painting?
We take care of that, all right.
Now, I tell you what my idea is.
I think the kitchen should be white.
Outside green, inside cerise with blue...
The painting, I say.
How about the painting, Ravelli?
All right, what do you think I talk?
That's painting.
The kitchen white, outside green, inside cerise.
The painting.
The painting that was stolen.
Stolen?
Don't you remember Mrs. Rittenhouse lost a valuable Beaugard painting worth $100,000?
Don't you remember that?
No, I'm a stranger around here.
I no remember that.
What do you think I am, one of the early settlers?
Ravelli, don't you remember,
Mrs. Beaugard lost a valuable Rittenhouse painting worth $100,000?
Don't you remember that?
No, but I've seen you someplace before.
Well, I don't know where I was, but I'll stay out of there in the future.
Hey, Cap, it come to me like a flash!
This painting wasn't stolen.
Huh!
You know what happened?
This painting, Cap, is disappear.
Vanish.
Yes, it disappear.
And you know what make it disappear?
You'll never guess, Cap.
What do you think make this painting disappear, eh?
Moths!
Moths eat it!
Left-handed moths.
Go away.
Go away.
I'll be all right in a minute.
Left-handed moths ate the painting, eh?
That's my own solution.
I wish you were in it.
Left-handed moths ate the painting.
You know, I'd buy you a parachute if I thought it wouldn't open.
Hey, I got pair of shoes.
That's crazy.
Come on, let's get out and get the reward.
We solved it.
You solved it!
The credit is all yours.
The painting was eaten by a left-handed moth.
Hey, I know, we did a good day's work.
How do you feel?
Tired?
It's worth it.
Maybe you ought to lie down for a couple of years, eh?
Well...
Why don't you just lie down until rigor mortis sets in?
Yeah.
That's nothing.
Come on, Ravelli.
I'll show you how we get the painting.
Yeah.
We go to court and we get out a writ of habeas corpus.
You're gonna get rid of what?
Oh, I should never have started that way.
I can see that.
I say, we'll go to court and we'll get a writ of habeas corpus.
Yeah, scorpus, scorpus.
Didn't you ever see a habeas corpus?
No, but I see Habeas Irish Rose.
Hey, it's okay.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Mr. Chandler, why don't you go down to the beach with the others?
I'm sure you'd feel better.
If I had my Beaugard, I'm sure I'd feel better.
Oh, but we're doing everything we can.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, Mrs. Rittenhouse!
I have it.
The Beaugard!
Wonderful!
My Beaugard!
Wait, this is not my Beaugard!
This is a rank imitation.
Where did you find it?
Why, in Mr. uh...
In Mr. Parker's room, madam.
Parker!
One thing is certain!
The man who made that, stole the Beaugard!
Hives, find Mr. Parker and ask him to come here.
Certainly, madam.
Wait a minute.
My men will bring him in.
Go out and get Mr. Parker.
Oh, what's the matter with this?
Well, look at here.
You've only to look at it once to see what it is.
It is a rank nothing!
Mother, what's wrong?
I can come in without being pulled in.
Mr. Parker, something very mysterious has occurred.
And I'm afraid, you're the only one who can explain.
I'd be only too glad to if I can.
Nothing mysterious about it.
We found this in your room.
Now, what have you done with the original Beaugard?
Come clean!
Come on, out with it.
Really, I think I would be wise...
Well, I have nothing to say.
Except that I don't know where the Beaugard is.
Oh, how is it we found this in your room?
Come on!
You better come with me.
You can't take him!
Arabella!
Sing one song
For my old Kentucky home
For my old
Kentucky home
Far away
So far away
This program is coming to you from the House of David.
He's either got that suit on upside down or there is no law of gravity.
Einstein or no one.
My tie!
Oh, Captain, what shall I do?
They're going to arrest John.
Who's going to arrest John?
I am, Captain.
Oh, you are, eh?
Well, let me tell you something.
The first thing they teach you at Scotland Yard is never to arrest an innocent man.
But he's not innocent.
I'll have to arrest him just the same.
By all means or nobody will be safe here.
You can't arrest him!
- I stole it!
- Arabella!
Don't listen to her, Officer.
I did it.
They're both lying.
I did it!
I did it with my little hatchet.
Eh, he's crazy.
He's crazy.
I confess, I did it.
Or maybe nobody stole the painting.
Maybe there was no painting.
That's right, maybe there was no painting.
I saw it.
Cut out all the talk.
Who stole the painting?
I did.
Good gracious!
What!
What in the...
What?
You?
You took the picture?
Where is it?
Oh, that's a horse.
The Beaugard!
That is my Beaugard!
No, that isn't your Beaugard.
Don't be ridiculous.
I paid $100,000 for this painting.
I know what I bought.
Well, look at the signature.
"John Parker."
Somebody changed it.
That is my Beaugard!
That is the Beaugard, I tell you!
There it is!
Ah, but that one.
That has the color, the depth, the soul of the Beaugard!
Only a master could have produced a painting like that.
Oh, John.
You mean to tell me that you painted that?
Yes, sir.
Why, young man, you're a genius!
You're a genius!
I commission you to paint a portrait of me immediately!
Well, you better wait until tomorrow.
I'm gonna be busy all day.
Get it?
You better come with me, young fellow!
Don't take him away, Officer.
He returned the paintings.
Pardon me, my name is Spaulding.
I've always wanted to meet you.
All right.
I'll let him go this time.
But I want to give you some advice.
You're running around with the wrong kind of people.
You wanna be a crook?
Oh, why don't you go home?
He's got no home.
Go home for a few nights and stay home.
Don't you know your poor, old mother sits there sits there night after night after night.
...waiting to hear your steps on the stairs.
He got no stairs.
And I can see a little light burning in burning in the window.
No, you can't.
The gas company turned it off.
What I'm telling you is for your own good.
And if you listen to me...
You can't go wrong.
This may go on for years.
Now, there's just one thing...
I can't understand what's delaying that coffee pot.
Where's the cream?
Well, you certainly surprised me!
Me, too.
I thought he had more than that.
It's no use giving you any advice.
Captain, this time I'm afraid I'll have to take him.
Come on, here!
Come on!
Come on!
Oh, what's he doing?
Oh, my dear, oh!
Hey, what's the idea?
Jamison, take a letter to my lawyer!
No, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, no, no!
Not...
Oh.
Oh, to think that I've got to go so young.
Good.
Come on, now.
Let's get out of here before they all wake up.
Hurry up!
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
You must do your best tonight, be on your toes, men.
There's an honored guest tonight.
He's one of those men, who are being feted by the smart-set.
We'll see that he gets what he deserves.
Treat him as they do a king, in manner royal.
Like a subject to a king, you must be loyal.
On this you must have your hearts set.
We'll do nothing to get on his nerves.
Again I mention:
Be on your toes, men.
He craves attention, he's one of those men.
We will give him just what he deserves.
Oh, Hives...
- Yes, Mrs. Rittenhouse?
I'd like to reassign the rooms.
- Very good, madam.
Mr. Chandler should have the Blue suite.
Captain Spaulding, as guest of honor, gets the Green duplex with 2 baths.
Two?
- Yes.
I think the Captain would like 2 baths, don't you?
If he's just returned from Africa, he may need 2 baths.
Mr. Roscoe W. Chandler.
Mrs. Rittenhouse!
Well, I...
Mr. Chandler!
So nice to see you.
- The famous Beaugard, as promised.
How can I ever express my gratitude?
- Oh, 'tis nothing.
Nothing?
You return from Europe with a masterpiece worth $100,000, and instead of displaying it yourself, you let me unveil it at my party for Captain Spaulding.
You call that nothing?
- Mrs. Rittenhouse, I...
Please remove it to where it will be exhibited.
- Very good, sir.
And very careful, please.
You think that is something?
I would do much more for you.
You are a very beautiful woman.
- No, no, Mr. Chandler.
Well, maybe I'm wrong.
- What?
Please do not go.
I love you.
- I know.
Mr. Chandler, now look...
Hello, Mother.
Playing house?
Well, if you'll pardon me.
Have you seen Johnny Parker?
- Forget him.
Think more of our guest.
Your problem is you don't take these social affairs seriously.
What would you suggest, Mom?
Suicide?
I would suggest...
That must be him.
- Captain Spaulding has arrived.
What a pleasure!
I'm so glad.
Friends, Captain Spaulding has arrived.
At last we are to meet him, the famous Captain Spaulding.
From climates hot and scalding, the Captain has arrived.
Most heartily we'll greet him, with plain and fancy cheering, until he's hard of hearing.
The Captain has arrived.
The Captain has arrived.
Mr. Horatio W. Jamison, Field Secretary of Captain Spaulding.
The Captain insists on these conditions under which he camps here.
In one thing he is very strict.
He wants his women young and picked.
As for men, he won't have any tramps here.
As for men, he won't have any tramps here.
The men must all be very old, the women warm, the champagne cold.
It's under these conditions that he camps here.
I'm announcing Captain Geoffrey Spaulding.
He's announcing Captain Geoffrey Spaulding.
Oh dear.
He is coming.
At last he's here.
Well, what do I owe you?
From Africa to here, $1.85?
Outrageous!
I told you not to take me through Australia.
That's criminal.
Turn around.
I want to see your license plates.
I'll attend to you later.
You're one of the most beautiful women I've seen.
Doesn't say much.
Captain, Rittenhouse Manor is entirely at your disposal.
I'm grateful for this magnificent washout, ah, turnout.
Vow I'd like to say a few words.
Hello, I must be going.
I cannot stay.
I came to say I must be going.
I'm glad I came, but just the same, I must be going.
But you must stay.
If you should go away, you'll spoil this party I am throwing.
I'll stay a week or two, I'll stay the summer through, but I am telling you,
I must be going.
Before you go, will you oblige us and tell us of your deeds so glowing?
I'll do anything you say.
In fact I'll even stay.
- Good.
But I must be going.
There's something I would like to say that he's too modest to relay.
The Captain is a moral man.
Sometimes he finds it trying.
This I emphasize with stress.
I never drink unless... somebody's buying.
The Captain is a very moral man.
If he hears anything obscene, he'll naturally repel it.
I hate a dirty joke, unless it's told by someone who knows how to tell it.
The Captain is a very moral man.
Hooray for Captain Spaulding, the African explorer.
Did someone call me Shnorrer?
He went into the jungle, where the monkeys throw nuts.
If I stay here, I'll go nuts.
He puts all his reliance in courage and defiance and risks his life for science.
He is the only white man to cover every acre.
He puts all his reliance in courage and defiance and risks his life for science.
Hooray for Captain Spaulding, the African explorer.
He put his name on dying fame and that is why we say:
Hooray, hooray, hooray.
My friends, I'm highly gratified of this display of effusion.
And I want you to know...
My friends, I'm highly gratified of this display of effusion...
My friends, I'm highly gratified of this display of effusion.
Hooray for Captain Spaulding...
Well, somebody's got to do it.
It is indeed a great honor to welcome you to my poor home.
Oh, it isn't so bad.
Wait.
You're right, it's one of the frowziest joints I've ever seen.
The wallpaper!
You're letting this place run down.
You're not getting the class of people you need.
These people look like you.
Let's put up a sign, "Under new management".
We set up a 75-cent meal that knocks their eyes out.
Then we can charge whatever we want.
Sign here and give me a check for $1,500.
This insurance policy provides for your little one and your old age, which will be here in a few weeks.
I feel that the time has come, the walrus said...
You stand before me as one of the bravest men of all times.
Alright, I'll do that.
In the dark forests of Africa, you dared all dangers.
You mind if I don't smoke?
Fearlessly you have blazed new trails, scoffed at the lions' roar and the cannibals' tom-toms.
Says you.
Never once in all those months did your footsteps falter.
Cowardice is unknown to you.
Fear is not in you.
Pardon me, a caterpillar, Captain.
The caterpillar must have frightened him.
Oh dear.
Don't just stand there, get the whiskey.
Where's the whiskey?
- In my little black bag, in the right-hand corner.
Signor Emanuel Ravelli.
How are you?
Where's the dining room?
- This is a surprise.
I used to know an Emanuel Ravelli who looked exactly like you.
I am Emanuel Ravelli.
- You're Emanuel Ravelli?
No wonder you look like him.
But there is a resemblance.
And he thinks I look alike.
- If so, it's a tough break for you.
You are one of the musicians?
Aren't you due tomorrow?
Tomorrow's too quick.
Lucky they didn't come yesterday.
- We charge for yesterday, too.
What do you get an hour?
For playing, we get $10 an hour.
- And for not playing?
$12 an hour.
- Clip me off a piece of that.
For rehearsing, we make special rate.
That's $15 an hour.
For rehearsing?
And for not rehearsing?
You couldn't afford it.
If we don't rehearse, we don't play.
And if we don't play, that runs into money.
How much for running into an open manhole?
- Just a cover charge.
Well, drop in some time.
- Sewer.
Well, we cleaned that up pretty well.
- Let's see how we stand.
Flat-footed.
Yesterday we didn't come.
You remember?
That's $300.
Yesterday you didn't come.
That's $300?
Oh, that's reasonable.
Today we did come...
- You owe us 100.
I bet I'm gonna lose on the deal.
Tomorrow we leave.
That's worth...
- A million dollars.
Yeah, that's alright for me, but I got a partner.
The Professor.
The gates swung open and a Fig Newton entered.
How do you do?
Goodness.
You haven't got chocolate, have you?
He's got everything.
- Hives, take the Professor's hat and coat.
And send for the fumigators.
Don't you see that there are ladies present?
Put that hat down.
What are you doing?
Get out of here.
Go on.
A little more to the right.
That's better.
See that the drape is well-hung.
The mistress will inspect it later.
Hello, Hives.
- Mrs. Whitehead!
This is a surprise.
- And how about me?
- Miss Grace!
You've grown so.
- You haven't lost any weight, either.
No, unfortunately not.
It seems strange to find you working here instead of our own home.
After you left for Europe, Mrs. Rittenhouse made me an offer.
Lovely.
By the way, what's the secret about the painting?
No secret.
It's Beaugard's "After the Hunt".
The original?
- Most original.
Be careful.
Where did she get that?
Is it very valuable?
- It must be worth a fortune.
It looks as if Mrs. Rittenhouse gets the Social Award of the Season.
Can't we do something?
- We might shoot ourselves.
I'd rather shoot Mrs. Rittenhouse.
I have an idea.
I copied that painting at art school a year ago.
Well, what of it?
But I still don't get it.
I'll get the copy.
We'll substitute it for the original and when she unveils it, she'll have a cruel imitation.
Grace, you're wonderful.
- That's what I've been telling you.
I won't be long.
- Alright.
See you later.
Oh, Hives?
Do you still feel a bond between us?
- Most certainly, Mrs. Whitehead.
Strong enough for you to do me a big favor?
- Anything at all.
If I were to ask you to take away the Beaugard...
Do you mean...
- Temporarily, of course.
And substitute something of my own?
- Quite an unusual request.
It is, but somehow I still think of you as one of the Whiteheads.
You may count on me.
My soul is yours, even though my body may belong to Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Why, Hives!
Oh, Mrs. Whitehead!
- Arabella!
May I present Mr. Parker?
- Of the Massachusetts' Parkers?
Why, no.
- Then the Southern Parkers?
No, the Central Parkers.
You know, the Benches and Trees.
I see.
Meow!
Oh, I don't like that woman.
You sit down here and tell me whom you do like.
Oh, so that's your game.
- Vow listen.
Do you really love me?
Marry me and find out.
- Marry you?
On what?
Last year I sold 2 paintings.
One at 100 and one at 50.
Could we live on $150 a year?
- We wouldn't need money.
I've got a charge account in every shop on 5th Avenue.
If I had any brains, I'd give up painting and get a regular job.
I had a cousin who made $50,000 in Wall Street last year.
I don't wanna marry your cousin.
I'm a darn fool and wanna marry you.
Say... we could get that old bluff Chandler to buy a portrait from you.
Chandler?
What does he know about art?
The less he knows, the easier it'll be for you.
They're right upstairs.
You can't miss them.
Go round the other side.
Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Captain Spaulding!
How are you?
Tell me.
Are you alone?
- Captain, I don't understand.
You don't?
Don't give me that innocent stuff or you'll be alone.
A big cluck like you turning cute on me!
Mrs. Rittenhouse...
- Yes?
Oh, pardon me.
You've been affected like this before?
Oh no, Captain.
- You will be.
Mrs. Rittenhouse...
Ever since I've met you, I've swept you off my feet.
Something has been beating in me like the incessant tom-tom in the jungle.
Something that I must ask you.
- What is it, Captain?
Would you wash a pair of socks for me?
- I'm surprised.
It's been on my mind for weeks.
It's my way of saying I love you.
I love you.
I've never been...
- Captain!
Pardon me.
Am I intruding?
Are you intruding?
Just when I had her on the 5-yard line.
I should say you were intruding.
Pardon, that you are intruding.
I was using the subjunctive instead of the past tense.
Yes, we're way past tents, we're living in bungalows now.
Mrs. Whitehead, you haven't met Captain Spaulding, have you?
No
How are you?
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.
How are you?
And how are you?
That leaves you one up.
Did anyone ever tell you you had beautiful eyes?
- No
Well, you have.
And so have you.
He shot her a glance.
As a smile played around his lips.
I've never seen four more beautiful eyes in my life.
Well, three anyway.
You two girls have everything.
You're tall and short, slim and stout.
Just the kind of girl I crave.
We three would make an ideal couple.
You have beauty, charm, money.
You have got money?
If not, we can quit right now.
The Captain is charming, isn't he?
- I'm fascinated.
I'm fascinated, too.
Right on the arm.
Fascinated, whim-wham!
If I were Eugene O'Neill, I could tell you what I really think of you two.
You're fortunate the Theater Gill isn't putting this on.
And so is The Gill.
Pardon me while I have a strange interlude.
You couple of baboons, what makes you think I'd marry either one of you?
Strange how the wind blows tonight.
It reminds me of poor old Marsden.
How happy I could be with either of these two, if both of them just went away.
Well, girls, will you marry me?
Which one of us?
- Both of you.
Let's all get married.
It's my party.
Party...
Party...
Here I am talking of parties.
I came down for a party.
What happens?
Nothing Not even ice cream.
The gods look down and laugh.
The world would be better for children if the parents had to eat the spinach.
What do you say?
We all gonna get married?
- All of us?
- All of us.
That's bigamy.
- Yes, and that's big of me, too.
Let's be big for a change.
One woman and one man was enough for your grandmother, but who wants to marry her?
Nobody Not even your grandfather.
Think of the honeymoon.
Strictly private.
No other woman allowed.
Well, maybe one or two, but no men.
I may not go myself.
You want a companionate marriage?
It has its advantages.
You'd live with your folks, I'd live with your folks.
And you'd sell Fuller brushes.
Living with your folks...
The beginning of the end.
Drab yesterdays shutting out beautiful tomorrows.
Hideous footsteps creaking along the misty corridors of time, and in those corridors I see figures.
Strange figures.
Weird figures:
Steel 186, Anaconda 74,
American Can 138.
Where were we?
Oh yes, we wanted to marry.
What do you think?
Should we?
- Marriage is a noble institution.
The foundation of the American home.
- Yes, but it can't be enforced.
It was put over on us while our boys were over there and our girls over here.
I've waited at these stairs for years for just this moment.
Captain, where are you going?
- I'm sorry, ladies, we'll have to postpone the wedding for a few days.
Maybe for a few years.
Before I get married, I'm gonna sow a couple of wild oats.
The Captain's so amusing.
- Isn't he charming?
That's the famous Beaugard, eh?
Great picture, isn't it?
You've seen it before?
- I spent 3 days in Paris copying it.
You did?
- Me and a million other artists.
I bet yours was better than the rest.
- It wasn't bad.
I'll show it to you sometime.
Listen.
- What?
- Mother's going to unveil it tonight.
Yeah?
Suppose when she unveils it, it's not the Beaugard at all.
Suppose it's yours.
- You want to swap mine for his?
Exactly.
- You're crazy.
What good would it do?
What good?
Listen.
They'll unveil it.
Chandler will tell everyone how fine it is.
They'll cheer like mad, and then we'll tell them who really did it.
They'll say you're a great artist.
You'll get 6 commissions, and we can be married and divorced in no time.
Sound great.
But what if they don't like my painting?
Isn't the chance worth taking?
I see you're admiring my picture?
- Yes, yes.
Your picture?
- Yes, my picture.
- It don't look like you.
Some place I met you before.
Your face is very familiar.
I am one of the most well-known men in America.
The newspapers keep running my photograph.
You're not Abe Kabibble?
- Nonsense
If you're not Abe Kabibble, who are you?
Vow please.
My name is Roscoe W. Chandler.
I don't get about the name.
Some place I met you before.
Were you ever in Sing Sing?
- Please.
No I got it.
Joliet!
- Let me alone.
Alright.
Don't run away.
Leavenworth!
I've never been in these places.
I've spent most of my time in Europe.
I've got it now.
You come from Czechoslovakia.
You're wrong.
I've never been there.
Hey, come here.
- I tell you.
Get away from me.
You remember him?
He come from Czechoslovakia.
You are wrong.
I told you before.
He come from Czechoslovakia.
And I know who it is.
Abie, the fish peddler from Czechoslovakia.
- Ridiculous.
We prove it.
He had a birthmark.
Please, what are you trying?
Let me alone!
There it is!
The birthmark!
Abie, the fishman.
I confess.
I was Abie.
How did you get to be Chandler?
- How did you get to be Italian?
Whose confession is this?
Don't tell anyone about this and we can come to some agreement.
One that is mutually satisfactory.
Money.
Money.
- Shall we say $500?
Fie to $500!
- All the cash I have with me.
$500?
I tell you what.
We'll take your IOU.
That's my best offer.
- That's all you'll give?
Abie the fishman!
Abie the fishman!
Please, be quiet.
Come here.
I have a check for $5,000.
Is it good?
- Of course.
Who would give me a bad check?
I would.
See if it's good.
Alright, if you don't want it...
- That's all we get?
Yes.
- He's Abie the fishman!
Give me that handkerchief.
My tie!
Where's my tie?
Nothing but a pair of thieves.
I get the tie.
What you got?
The birthmark!
Where's your tie?
- Why I...
Fine way for a millionaire to run around.
Have you got garters?
- Of course.
Oh, they've taken them.
A likely story.
Have you at least got socks?
Certainly.
Here.
- They look pretty old to me.
Whose are they?
Well, old socks.
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Captain Spaulding.
Roscoe W. Chandler.
- This is a treat, your treat.
You have heard about me?
I've heard about you for years, and I'm getting pretty sick of it.
Quite naturally, I've also heard of the great Captain Spaulding.
Fine.
I've heard of you and you've heard of me.
Have you heard the one about the two Irishmen?
- Oh yes.
Then let's get down to business.
My name is Spaulding.
Roscoe W. Chandler.
- Geoffrey T. Spaulding.
What's the "T" stand for?
Thomas?
- Edgar.
You were close, though.
I want to talk to you about something.
Would you like to finance an expedition?
- That is a question.
You certainly know a question when you see it.
I congratulate you.
And that brings us back to where we were.
Will you finance an expedition?
Do you have a particular one in mind?
I've always wanted to do something before I quit.
- What is that?
Retire.
Vow, would you be interested?
My retirement would be the greatest contribution to science ever.
This is your chance.
When I think what you have done for this country.
What have you done, by the way?
- Oh well...
I've always tried to do what I could.
Especially for art.
How have we drifted around to that?
What is your opinion of art?
I'm glad you asked.
- I withdraw the question.
He takes things seriously.
You can't ask a simple question.
Where will you build your new opera house?
- Near Central Park.
Why not right in Central Park?
- Could we?
At night, when no one's looking.
Better yet, in the reservoir.
But that could interfere with the water supply.
After all, art is art.
On the other hand, water is water.
And east is east, west is west.
If you stew cranberries like applesauce, they tastes like prunes.
Vow tell me what you know.
I would gladly giving you my opinion.
Dandy, I'll ask you for them someday.
Can you be in my office at 10 tomorrow?
Ask for my secretary.
If he sees you, I'll discharge him.
Saturday at 3.
No, make that Tuesday.
I'm going to Europe Monday.
My name is Spaulding.
I've always wanted to meet you.
What do you think of the problems of traffic and marriage?
What do you think of when you go to bed, you beast?
Well, I...
- I'd rather not hear it.
There are children present.
My dear Captain, it boils down to a question of money.
The nickel is not what it was 10 years ago.
I'll go further than that.
It's not what it was 15 years ago.
You know what this country needs?
A 7-cent nickel.
We've had the 5-cent nickel since 1492.
Nearly 100 years.
Let's give the 7-cent nickel a chance, and then try an 8-cent nickel.
You buy a 3-cent paper and get the same nickel back.
One nickel carefully used would last a family a lifetime.
I think that's a wonderful idea.
- Really?
- Yes.
Then there can't be much to it.
Forget it.
Tell me, Captain Chandler...
Excuse me, Spaulding.
I'm Spaulding.
You're Chandler.
Let's have no more of this.
Alright.
- Bad enough being Spaulding.
- Tell me, Captain Spaulding...
Spaulding is the right name?
- Right.
I'm Chand...
No, I'm Spauld...
Show me the program.
For all he knows, I might be coming next week.
Captain Spaulding, you're quite a traveler.
How about South America?
I'm going there soon.
Where exactly?
- Uruguay.
You go your-a-way, I'll go mine.
Let's change the subject.
Take the foreign situation.
Take Abyssinia.
And I'll take a hot butterscotch sundae on rye.
Let's see what the boys in the back room are up to.
Let's see how yours compares with the original.
- Alright.
No difference!
- Look closer.
Maybe you'll find it's better.
You seen my partner?
- No
Oh, Mr. Raviola!
Ravelli.
Ravelli.
- Oh, Mr. Ravelli.
Would you do something for me?
I'd do anything for you.
What do ya want?
You see that painting?
- You mean this piksh?
Take it out of the frame and put this one in its place.
You want I should take this one down and put this one upstairs?
- Yes.
You want I should steal?
- No It's not stealing.
Then I couldn't do it.
- Oh, Mr. Raviola!
Hey, get up.
Come here.
That's all you do.
Chase the women.
Oh, stop.
Everybody plays cards, but they don't ask us.
We just wasting our time.
We've been here all day.
How much we make?
Nothing Soon we go to the old ladies' home.
How do you like that?
No, that's no good.
These people here got money.
We gotta find someone to play with us.
I'd play anything.
Poker, pinochle...
- Signor Ravelli,
I want to talk to you about the music.
What's wrong with you?
It would be nice...
Go away from me!
What is this?
Hello, Professor.
What's the matter with his feet?
We play all kinds of games.
Blackjack, soccer...
One, two, three...
Why don't you leave him alone?
Vow that this game is over, how about some bridge?
You play bridge?
- A little.
- What do you play for?
Just for small stakes.
- And french-fried potatoes?
Set it up right over there, Hives.
- Very good, madam.
What is he up to?
Look at this.
Take it away, Hives.
- Extraordinary.
How do you want to play?
Honest?
- I hope so.
You put that right away.
It's your own fault.
We'll cut for partners.
- No, I only play if he's my partner.
It's against the rules.
We have to cut for partners.
Alright, we cut for partners.
I got ace of spades.
He's got ace of spades.
Coincidences!
Two aces of spades?
- Yeah, he's got thousands of them.
He has the choice of seat then.
- You have the choice of seat.
Not on her lap.
- Sit down.
What's the matter with him?
- He thought it was contact bridge.
Just a moment.
Shuffle the cards.
- You gotta scrumble them up.
Just a moment.
I'd like to cut them.
That's a winner.
Your bid, partner.
You pass?
Misdeal.
You pass?
I bid one spade.
I pass.
- Three spades.
Four spades.
One club.
- I don't understand this bidding.
You don't have to.
You bid four spades, eh?
I haven't a spade in my hand.
- Alright.
We double.
Something's wrong here.
Let's do over the bidding.
Oh, she want to bid again.
He bids one.
One?
One what?
- That's alright.
You'll find out.
But we have to know what he's bidding.
- Later.
Vow I bid two.
Two what?
- Two of the same he bids.
Vow the bidding's over.
That's enough.
It's your lead.
You can't lead that.
- Why not?
We can't take it.
- What should I lead?
He'll show you.
Ace of spades.
That's-a very good.
Three of spades.
Four of spades.
You trump it?
You call that finesse.
No spades, partner.
No spades.
Ace of hearts.
Ace of clubs.
Dummy leads.
The dummy leads.
I'm not the dummy.
- Well, you could be.
Ace of diamonds.
Hundred aces, eh?
Two hundred?
That's better.
Ace of hearts.
Atta boy.
Make a big slam.
Make a big, big slam.
Ace of spades.
Ace of spades.
That's a good guy.
Plays a good game.
Ace of spades.
Plays a fine game.
Ace of spades.
- I refuse to play any longer.
You're nothing but two cardsharps.
- My shoes are gone.
Graciousness.
He has your slippers.
Come along.
Hey, you take-a the ladies' shoes?
Quiet!
Hide.
Somebody's coming.
Alright, I make a mistake.
Get up, come on.
Come on.
Hurry up.
You know what we do?
We hang that picture upstairs, for the lady.
Don't touch.
You got everything ready?
Shovel, axe, dynamite, pineapples?
Where's the flash?
Flash, flash.
That's no the flash.
That's a fish!
I don't want the fish.
Flash!
Stop it.
You crazy.
When you go out at night, you gotta have the flash.
That's no flash.
That's a flisk.
Flash.
When you wanna see somebody, you gotta have the flash.
That's a flush.
What I gonna do with the flush?
That's a flitz.
What I gonna do with flitz?
What do ya got?
That's a flutz.
All you got is a fish and a flutz and a flitz and a flutz...
Stop this.
Where's the flash?
Look, when everything's light and you wanna make 'em dark.
What ya do?
Hey, you crazy.
I want no blackjack.
My mistake.
When everything's dark and you wanna make 'em light.
Yeah, that's a flash.
That's a flash.
Hey, that's good, alright.
The storm put the lights out.
Nobody can see what we do.
Where's the flash?
Where's the flash?
I no want the fish.
Flash.
No, no flutz.
What's the matter with you?
Flash.
Before the people are coming.
What's a matter?
You lose it?
You gotta find it.
Look for it.
Alright, never mind.
We'll work without it.
Hide!
Hide!
Somebody's coming.
Hide.
Quiet, quiet.
Shut up.
Keep quiet.
I know where you are.
It's alright.
Oh, Captain Spaulding, where are you?
- Yeah?
Oh, Captain...
- What's the trouble?
The lights have gone out.
You can't see your hand before your face.
It wouldn't be very pleasant, anyway.
Well, I'm going to take a nap.
Leave me a call for three o'clock.
Make it three-thirty.
The service here is excellent.
Pardon me, did you lose a fish?
- What?
Somebody lost it.
Will you have it fried for me?
Did you hear that?
Somebody's over there.
I say somebody's over there.
- Nonsense The house is settling.
Anybody over there?
- I don't see anybody.
There you are.
If anybody was there, he'd see him, wouldn't I?
What is it, Captain?
What is it?
You know what I think?
I think you got roaches.
You got roaches alright.
And the biggest one has asthma.
Horrible!
Come on, Captain.
This can't be the library.
This must be the operating room.
We get the picture and we don't make a sound.
Somebody turned on the lights.
Alright, we get the picture and don't make one sound.
What do you want?
Oh, the fish.
Go on.
That's some storm, eh?
A regular tornado.
Let's go this way.
I think it's a shortcut.
Come on, let's go.
California.
Before we start the musical program,
Captain Spaulding will tell us about his trip to Africa.
Captain Spaulding.
- Me?
Friends, I'm going to tell you of that great, mysterious, wonderful Africa.
Africa is God's country, and he can have it.
We left New York drunk and early on the morning of February 2.
After 15 days on the water and 6 on the boat, we reached Africa.
We proceeded 300 miles inland, where I shot a polar bear.
This bear was 6' 7" in its stockinged feet, with shoes on.
- Just a moment.
I always thought polar bears lived in the frozen north.
You did?
This one was anemic and couldn't stand the cold.
He was a rich bear and could afford the trip.
You take care of your animals, and I'll take care of mine.
Frozen north, my eye!
From our arrival, we led an active life.
The first morning saw us up at 6, breakfasted and back in bed at 7.
This went on for 3 months.
We got so we were able to be in bed by 6:30.
One morning I was smoking some meat...
Smoking some meat?
- Yes, there was no cigar store.
I was sitting in front of the cabin, when I bagged 6 tigers.
Captain.
Did you catch 6 tigers?
I begged them to go away, but they hung around all day.
They were the most persistent tigers I've ever seen.
The principal animals in Africa are moose, elks and Knights of Pythias.
You all know what a moose is.
The first day I shot two bucks.
As I say, you all know what a moose is.
A moose eats cheese and is chased by cats.
The elks live in the hills, and hold their convention in the spring.
It's interesting when they come to the waterhole.
Boy, do they run when they see it's only a waterhole.
What they're looking for is an alco-hole.
One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas.
How he got in them, I don't know.
We tried to remove the tusks.
That's not so easy to say, tusks.
Oh, simple.
Tusks.
My name is Spaulding.
I've always wanted to meet you.
As I say, we tried to remove the tusks, but we couldn't budge them.
In Alabama, the tusks are looser.
But that's entirely ir-elephant.
We took pictures of the native girls, but they weren't developed.
But we're going back in a couple of weeks...
Very enlightening.
- Hooray for Captain Spaulding.
Three cheers!
Three cheers for Captain Spaulding!
Three cheers...
- No one asked for the chairs.
Put them back.
Vow get along.
Go on, go on!
And now, friends, Signor Ravelli will oblige us at the piano.
His first selection is "Somewhere My Love Lies Sleeping"
with a male chorus.
Say, if you get near a song, play it.
I can't think of the finish.
That's strange.
I can't think of anything else.
You know what?
I think I went past it.
If you come around again, jump off.
I once kept this up for three days.
You wouldn't consider hush money, would you?
I can't get 'em now.
I've gotta wait for inspiration.
- It's about time.
Play the song about Montreal.
- Montreal?
"I'm A Dreamer, Montreal."
Don't know it.
I'll play one of my own compositions, by Victor Herbert.
Make it short.
He plays them both well.
Your team scored that time.
And the old blue one.
Why do you push?
- They may exterminate each other.
The best thing for either of them.
That one's for old Purdue.
I was afraid of that.
I thought I had the finish.
- I wish you did.
Yours.
Play the song about the Irish chiropodist.
"My Fate Is In Your Hands".
Is there a horse in the house?
They got everything else here.
And now, Mrs. Rittenrotten...
Rittenhouse.
- Yes, a slight error.
I have a surprise for you.
The man is here for the piano.
- Oh, Captain!
When I departed from the natives in Africa, they gave me a gift.
And this I give to you, at a low fare.
- How wonderful.
Don't be too hasty...
- I can't wait...
It was all done with the white of an egg.
What is it, Captain?
What is it?
It's a hope chest for a guinea pig.
This magnificent chest...
No, this magnificent chest
I present to you with my compliments.
- This leaves me speechless.
See that you remain that way.
- And now, ladies and gentlemen...
Step outside and say that.
Mrs. Rittenhouse has perhaps a greater surprise for us in the library.
This way, Captain.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, how do you pay Hives?
By the week or by the pound?
And now it is my privilege to reveal the masterpiece of François Jacques DuBois Gilbert Beaugard.
No trains will be sold after the magazines leave the depot.
"After the Hunt."
There!
I said you were a great artist.
Shall we spill the beans?
- Wait.
Something might happen.
We'd all enjoy a few words from Mr. Chandler, who will tell us something of Beaugard's life and work.
And keep it clean!
Mr. Chandler!
My friends, you are all familiar with Beaugard.
This is perhaps his masterpiece.
In it he has achieved a greatness in the handling of color and line.
Vow you will see here...
Wait!
This is not my picture.
This is a rank imitation.
What do you mean?
- See for yourself.
You are right.
It's not the Beaugard.
- Certainly not.
A dog is missing.
Captain Spaulding, what shall I do?
- Call the dog-catchers at once.
They've taken the original.
- I'll throw some light on this.
Anyone have a match?
- What happened?
Hives, where are you?
Turn on the lights.
Did you lose that fish again?
- I'm so worried.
Good heavens.
That one is gone, too.
- Oh, this is awful.
The crooks are escaping.
Follow me, men.
No, just the women!
Right this way.
They went out here.
Oh, the excitement.
I never saw anything so funny before.
This is great.
And there goes her old party.
Wasn't it funny?
- Oh, v-v-v-very.
You're not afraid, are you?
- Oh no.
Not at all.
But they were talking about the police and I don't want them suspecting me.
They won't suspect you.
- Oh yes!
The last time they suspected me, I got four years.
- Hives!
You give me the painting, and I'll take care of it.
- Good.
Good heavens.
It's gone.
- Gone?
- I left it in there.
There must be thieves at this party.
If I'd known that, I never would have come.
Wait!
That professor!
- The Professor!
I see!
That's the culprit.
We've got to get that picture away from him.
Might I suggest this?
Very satisfactory in these cases.
A few drops on a handkerchief and the Professor is out.
You're sure it'll work?
- Absolutely.
You want to try some?
No thanks, Hives.
Let's find the Professor.
How did the thieves get away?
And who was it?
Lucky that we switched it.
Imagine them getting the original.
Oh?
It would have been okay had they taken mine?
I didn't mean that.
But what would Mother do?
It's worth $100,000.
How could she have replaced it?
Oh, I understand.
Isn't it exciting?
Just think, the thief was in the room with us.
Isn't it romantic?
All the boys I've known used to say I was made of stone.
I would always leave them alone in despair.
I've been on the pan, I've been called an electric fan, told I'm even much colder than Frigidaire.
I began to wonder if I was all wrong.
I thought so till you came along.
Tell me, dear, why am I so romantic?
When you're near, why am I so romantic?
What a grand feeling, when your lips meet mine.
That certain something comes stealing up and down my spine.
I don't know what it is you've done to me.
You don't know half of the good you do me.
Other boys bore me, they just leave me blue.
Oh, why am I so romantic with you?
Tell me, dear, why am I so romantic?
When you're near, why am I so romantic?
What a grand feeling, when your lips touch mine.
That certain something comes stealing up and down my spine.
When we touch, close in your arms you hold me.
I forget all that my mother told me.
Other girls bore me, they just leave me blue.
But why am I so romantic with you?
Oh, Signor Ravelli!
I've been looking for you all morning.
I was busy all morning.
- You've got to return that painting.
Painting?
What painting?
The painting you changed last night.
You mean the piksh?
- Yes.
First you want it upstairs, then downstairs.
Make up your mind.
I do thank you.
But you've got to return it before the police come.
The police are coming?
- Yes.
- I give it you.
You put it back.
Where's the piksh?
- What do you mean?
I put 'em in here.
It's gone.
You take 'em?
- Me?
No, I know.
Abie the fish peddler.
Did Mother invite a fish peddler here?
I don't know, but he's here.
Come on, we find him.
Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Jamison.
How is Captain Spaulding?
He didn't sleep a wink.
He went horseback riding last night.
I'm sorry.
We've all been pretty upset.
Good morning, Captain.
Did you enjoy your ride?
What are you looking for?
- I lost my horse.
He slipped out from between me.
I had my feet in the stirrups, too.
Never mind.
But I lost the bit you loaned me.
I'll get you another bit.
- Then I owe you two bits.
I hope you weren't distressed by last night's sad occurrence.
You mean dinner?
- No, the stolen painting!
A painting was stolen?
I haven't seen one in three weeks.
Why didn't you inform me?
What do I engage you for?
I didn't know it.
- You should have asked me.
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?
You're a contemptible cur!
I repeat.
You're a contemptible cur.
If I were a man, you'd resent that.
Please keep quiet!
I can get along without you.
I got along without your father.
And your uncle.
And your uncle.
And my uncle.
I didn't come to be exonerated.
- I beg your pardon.
You do, eh?
I'd like to see you crawl out of a rumble seat.
The police are here.
- Have them come in.
Oh, so that's your game.
You can't shut me up!
You can talk to my attorney.
Jamison, take a letter to my lawyers.
I'll show you a thing or two.
Or three.
I'll show you a thing or three.
Sending for the police!
Take a letter to my lawyers.
Sending for the police!
Take a letter to my lawyers.
- I am.
Read me what you have so far.
Honorable Charles H. Hungadunga, c/ o Hungadunga, Hungadunga, Hungadunga, Hungadunga McCormack.
Semicolon.
How do you spell "semicolon"?
- Alright, make it a comma.
Honorable Charles H. Hungadunga, Hungadunga...
McCormack.
Gentlemen, question mark.
Er-r-r!
Do you want "er-r-r" in the letter?
- No, put that in an envelope.
Vow then...
In re yours of the 5 inst, yours to hand and beg to rep, brackets, that we have gone over the ground carefully and we seem to believe, i.e., to wit, e.g., in lieu,
that despite all our precautionary measures, we seem to believe it is hardly necessary for us to proceed unless we receive an ipso facto that is not negligible at this moment.
Quotes, unquotes and quotes.
Hoping this finds you...
- Finds him where?
Let him worry about that.
Don't be so inquisitive.
Sneak!
Hoping this finds you, I beg to remain...
I'll show you where I get off.
Sending for the police.
Vow read me the letter.
"Honorable Charles H. Hungadunga."
That's it.
"C/ o Hungadunga, Hungadunga, Hungadunga McCormack."
You've left out a Hungadunga.
You left out the main one, too.
Thought you could slip one over on me, didn't you?
Alright, leave it out.
Put in a windshield wiper instead.
I tell you what.
Make it three windshield wipers and one Hungadunga.
They won't all be there when the letter arrives.
"...and McCormack.
Gentlemen, question mark."
Put it on the penultimate and not on the dipthonic.
You should brush up on your Greek.
Get a Greek and brush up on him.
"In re yours of the 5 inst."
- I see.
A lot of things you said weren't important, so I just omitted them.
Oh Captain!
Good gracious.
Omitted them, eh?
You just omitted the body of the letter, that's all.
Just left out the body of the letter.
Yours is not to reason why.
You've left out the body.
Alright, send it that way and tell him the body will follow.
The body in brackets?
No, it'll never get there in brackets.
Put it in a box.
Put it in a box and mark it 'fragilly'.
Mark it what?
- 'Fragilly!
' F-R-A-G...
Look it up in the dictionary, under fragile.
Look under the table if you don't find it there.
"Quotes, unquotes and quotes." - 3 quotes?
- Yes, sir.
Add another and make it a gallon.
Regards.
- That's a fine letter, Jamison.
That's an epic.
Make two carbon copies and throw the original away.
Then throw the copies away.
Just send a stamp.
Air mail.
Mrs. Rittenhouse?
I'm Inspector Hennessey.
- How do you do?
I'm Captain Scotland of Spaulding Yard.
No Spaulding, Scotland Yard.
Don't make the same mistake again.
- I'm glad to know you.
Between us we can solve this crime.
Especially if you go home.
No hasty arrests, please!
I don't want my guests embarrassed.
We won't arrest anybody.
- He's lucky to not go jail himself.
Would you take the Inspector and his men to the scene of the crime.
Certainly.
This way.
Come on, boys.
Jamison, count the spoons.
I didn't know you'd been a detective.
- There's a lot you don't know.
I suppose so.
- Darn right!
Where were you on June 5, 1774?
I don't know.
- Where was I?
I don't know.
- Me neither.
If I did, I wouldn't tell you.
Take a number from 1 to 10.
- Alright.
Which one?
- 7.
- That's right. 7 is right.
I could solve this in 5 minutes if I wanted to worry.
I don't want you to worry.
Nothing should interfere with your weekend.
Nothing interferes with my weak end.
And don't be so personal!
Where's my secretary?
Jamison!
- I didn't want to offend you.
Dastardly cracker!
I wish I was in the jungle where men are monkeys.
Captain, I'm so sorry.
- Jamison!
No, no.
Good morning, Mrs. Rittenhouse!
- Good morning.
Charming party.
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
It's just full of surprises.
- Glad you're enjoying yourself.
Hives!
Good morning.
Some breakfast?
- Nothing doing.
Where's the painting?
I watched all night, but the Professor did not sleep in his room.
Very strange.
- Good heavens.
What will we do?
I don't know.
Until we see the Professor...
You keep an eye on him till I get back with the bottle.
Don't worry, he'll not get away from me this time.
Did you get it?
- Yes.
- I'll engage him in conversation.
You trail behind and knock him out when the time comes.
Very good, madam.
Hello.
I've been looking all over for you!
Where were you?
What's the matter with this?
Are they the morning papers?
No, that isn't the one I want.
Show me the others.
That still isn't the one.
Out!
Yes, out!
The birds...
Come on, sit down.
I want to talk.
Don't you like me?
You don't?
Well, I like you.
I like little boys like you.
How old are you?
Five years old?
You're just a baby.
Oh, isn't that nice?
I like that.
No, no, no.
All joking aside, isn't there someone you do like?
Isn't there someone you love?
Think again.
Isn't there someone you really and truly love?
Is there?
Tell me who!
Why, that's a horse!
You love a horse?
Come on, lift him up.
Come on.
He's out.
- Let's go.
Arabella!
- I've been trying to find you.
Ravelli has lost the painting.
I just found one on the terrace.
The Beaugard?
- No
- Oh, yours?
If it's not yours, and not the Beaugard, whose is it?
Someone switched it for mine, thinking they got the original.
Somebody swiped my scheme, eh?
Then Chandler never saw your painting?
- No
You may still be a great artist.
Where is this picture?
Up in my room.
- You get it and I'll get the Captain.
He'll get to the bottom of this.
Then John found the third painting.
- Very interesting.
Well, sort of.
We have to keep our eyes open.
- If I don't find it, Mother's out $100,000.
Give me 24 hours for the case.
Then we'll call in someone else.
Wait till tomorrow.
Remember the Charlie Ross case?
I was on that, and he was never found.
Captain Yard of Scotland Spaulding always gets his women, or paintings.
Do you know what's happened with the painting I found?
It's been stolen from my room.
You see!
I've been on the case five minutes and another one is gone.
I bet it's not even three minutes.
My watch is gone.
This is too much.
It wasn't going, and now it's gone.
And my room was locked.
- Who could it have been?
Wait.
I think I've got a clue.
No, it's a red hair.
The Professor?
No, it couldn't be.
He's Crook of the Month this month.
Anyhow, we'll investigate it.
You know Conductor Hennessey?
- Inspector!
Inspect her yourself.
You know that redheaded fellow?
- Yes.
Well, get those flagpole sitters of yours to find him.
Come on, boys.
We'll soon get to the bottom of this.
Hey, what's that cop doing there?
It didn't take that long to find him.
- This is it!
Yes, but which one is it?
- The one just taken from my room.
Maybe my watch is back, too.
Vow the fob is gone!
Well, I still got the pocket.
Anything I retain now is velvet.
Except the coat.
That's Prince Albert.
Well, all the jokes can't be good.
If we find the fella who painted this, it'd be a pretty good clue.
- What?
If we find the fella who painted this, it'd be a pretty good clue.
You just said that.
How dull you turned out to be!
Let me see that a minute.
It's signed "Beaugard".
There's the criminal.
No Beaugard is dead.
Dead?
Then it's murder!
Vow we've got something.
What do you got?
- Jacks and aces.
And you?
Good.
I was bluffing.
- Does something strike you funny about this picture?
It isn't as funny as all that.
Did you ever see a tree like that?
Tree?
That's a spinach.
- It can't be.
Where's the egg?
It could be spinach.
Look at all the sand.
You mean it's an old Spinach custom?
No, it's not that.
No That's my mistake.
You know what it is?
Coleslaw.
Coleslaw?
- Yeah.
Did you ever see a coleslaw like that?
- Sure, look at this.
I don't want any of your lip now.
Did you ever see anything like that?
You know what this is?
A left-handed painting.
There's a signature.
- That's right.
This is either a left-handed painting or a vegetable dinner.
If we can find the left-handed person, we'll have "The Trial of Mary Dugan".
I saw that.
Goodbye.
- Wait.
I'm going to need you.
We mustn't lose this evidence.
Take it to your room and leave the door open this time.
And not a word about this to anybody.
Not even to me.
Ravelli, we've got to find the left-handed painting.
The first thing to do is to find the motive.
What was the motive of the Beaugard crooks?
I got it.
Robbery!
Would you mind crossing the street when it's red?
Si, Capt'.
Sit down.
I know how we find this painting.
In such a mysterious case, you gotta get the clues.
You gotta use the Sherlock Holmes method.
It goes like this:
You say, "What happened?" The answer: "Something was stolen."
You say, "What was stolen?" The answer come back: "A painting."
Are you a ventriloquist?
Vow you say, "Where was this painting stolen?" The answer: "In this house."
Vow, so far I'm right?
It's pretty hard to be wrong if you keep answering yourself.
You go a little further and say, "Who stole the painting?"
A very important question.
When you answer it, you got the whole solution.
Especially if you find the picture.
Vow put all the clues together and what do ya got?
- Bread pudding.
No Something was stolen.
Where?
In this house.
By who?
Somebody here.
Vow all you gotta do is ask everyone in the house if they took it.
I could rent you out as a decoy for duck hunters.
You're going to ask everyone here if they took the painting?
And suppose no one here took it?
- Go next door.
Great.
Suppose there is no house next door?
Well, then we gotta build one.
Vow you're talking.
What kind of house should we build?
My idea of a house is something nice and small and comfortable.
Exactly, nothing elaborate.
A little place to call home and tell the wife I'm not coming for dinner.
I see.
You want a telephone booth.
No, in that case I'd just call Chic Sale.
What do ya say we build right about here?
Here?
- Yeah, here.
- I'd like it over here if possible.
I don't like junior crossing the rails on his way to reform school.
Actually I don't like junior at all.
Alright.
We got something over there, and believe me, that's convenient.
You just open the door, step outside, and there you are.
There you are?
Where?
- Outside.
If you want to get back in again?
- You had no right to go out.
Don't do anything until I hear from you, will you?
Maybe the painting is in the cellar!
- That's no cellar, that's the roof.
Down there?
- Yeah, so the chimney don't get wet when it rains.
I'm off to get x-rayed.
I'll be back in a little while.
I think you're wrong, Ravelli.
- Don't get excited.
Here's the rooms.
This is your room.
This is mine.
And this is the maid's room.
I'd have to go through your room?
That's alright, I won't be in it.
You couldn't put the maid in your room?
- Who says I couldn't?
There's going to be a lot of traffic.
I can see that.
Well, what do ya say?
You ready to sign the lease?
I'd like to talk to my husband first.
Could you come back later?
You married?
- I've got a girl as big as you are.
Alright.
Get me one.
- Don't get vulgar, Ravelli.
How about the painting?
We take care of that.
I'll tell you my idea.
The kitchen should be white.
Outside, green.
Inside, cerise.
The painting, I say!
What you think I talk?
Painting the kitchen white...
The painting that was stolen!
- Stolen?
Don't you remember?
Mrs. Rittenhouse lost a painting worth $100,000.
No, I'm a stranger here.
What do you think I am?
One of the early settlers?
Don't you remember Mrs. Beaugard lost a Rittenhouse oil painting?
No, but I've seen you someplace before.
Yeah, I was there.
But I'll stay away in the future.
Hey, Capt!
It come to me like a flash!
This painting wasn't stolen.
It has disappeared.
Yes, disappeared.
And you know what make it disappear?
Moths!
Moths eat it!
Left-handed moths!
Go away.
I'll be alright in a minute.
Left-handed moths ate it?
- That's my own solution.
I wish you were in it.
Left-handed moths!
I'd buy you a parachute if I thought it wouldn't open.
Hey, I got pair of shoes.
He's crazy.
Let's go and get the reward.
We solved it.
You solved it.
It was eaten by left-handed moths.
- We did good work.
Are you tired?
Lie down for a couple of years.
Lie down until rigor mortis sets in.
I know what we'll do.
Go to court to get a writ of habeas corpus.
To get rid of what?
I never should have started that way.
I say, we'll go to court to get a writ of habeas corpus.
Yes, corpus.
- Didn't you ever see a habeas corpus?
No, but I see "Habeas Irish Rose".
Good morning.
- Good morning.
Why don't you go to the beach with the others?
You'd feel better.
I'd feel better with my Beaugard.
We're doing everything we can.
Mrs. Rittenhouse!
I have it!
- The Beaugard!
Wonderful!
My Beaugard!
Wait.
This is a rank imitation.
Where did you find it?
In Mr. Parker's room, madam.
- Parker?
One thing is certain.
Whoever did this also stole the Beaugard.
Hives, ask Mr. Parker to come here.
Wait.
My men will bring him in.
Get Mr. Parker.
What's wrong with this?
- It's obvious that it's a rank imitation.
Mother, what's wrong?
Something very strange has occurred and only you can explain it.
Gladly.
We found this in your room.
What have you done with the original?
Come clean!
- I think it would be wise...
I don't know where the Beaugard is.
Why did we find this in your room?
You'd better come with me.
You can't take him.
This program is coming to you from the House of David
Either this suit is on upside-down or there is no law of gravity.
Einstein or no Einstein.
- My tie!
Captain, what shall I do?
They're going to arrest John.
Who?
- I am!
In Scotland Yard they teach you never to arrest an innocent man.
He's not innocent.
I'll have to arrest him.
Of course, or nobody's safe here.
You can't arrest him.
I stole it.
- Don't listen to her.
I did it.
They're both lying.
I did it.
- He's crazy.
I confess.
I did it.
Maybe there was no painting.
- That's right.
I saw it.
Stop this!
Who stole the painting?
I did!
- Good gracious.
You?
You took the picture?
Where is it?
Aw, that's a horse.
That is my Beaugard!
- No, that isn't your Beaugard.
Ridiculous.
I paid $100,000 for this.
I know what I bought.
Look at the signature.
John Parker.
Somebody changed it.
That is my Beaugard!
That's it, I tell you.
But that one has the color, the depth, the soul of the Beaugard.
Only a master could have produced a painting like that.
You mean, you painted it?
- Yes, sir.
- You're a genius.
I commission you to paint a portrait of me immediately.
It'll have to wait until tomorrow.
I'm going to be busy all day.
- Yes.
You come with me.
- Don't take him away, officer.
He returned the paintings.
My name is Spaulding.
I've always wanted to meet you.
Alright.
Just this time.
But I want to tell you something.
You're running around with the wrong people.
You wanna be a crook?
Why don't you go home?
- He's got no home.
Go home and stay home.
Your poor old mother sits there sits there, night after... night after night... waiting to hear your steps on the stairs.
- Ain't got no stairs.
And I can see a little light burns in the window.
No you can't!
The gas company turned it off.
What I'm telling you is for your own good.
And if you listen to me, you can't go wrong.
This may go on for years.
- There's just one thing...
What's delaying that coffee pot?
Where's the cream?
- You certainly surprised me.
Me too.
I thought he had more.
- No use giving you any advice.
Captain, this time I'm afraid I'll have to take him.
Come on.
Oh, what are you doing?
My dear!
What's the idea?
- Take a letter to my lawyers.
Oh no, don't!
Anything but...
That I've got to go!
So young!
Good.
Let's get out of here before they all wake up.
Hurry up.
You must do your best tonight, be on your toes, men.
There's an honored guest tonight.
He's one of those men, who are being feted by the smart-set.
We'll see that he gets what he deserves.
Treat him as they do a king, in manner royal.
Like a subject to a king, you must be loyal.
On this object you must have your hearts set.
We'll do nothing to get on his nerves.
Again I mention:
Be on your toes, men.
He craves attention, he's one of those men.
Yes sir, We will give him just what he deserves.
Oh, Hives...
- Yes, Mrs. Rittenhouse?
I'd like to make a few changes to the assignment of the rooms.
- Very good, Madam.
So, would you put Mr. Chandler in the Blue suite.
and Captain Spalding, as guest of honor, will have the Green duplex with the two baths.
- Two, Madam?
- Why, yes.
I think the Captain would like two baths, don't you?
Well, if he's just returned from Africa, he may need two baths.
- Mr. Roscoe W. Chandler.
- Mrs. Rittenhouse!
Well, I...
- Mr. Chandler!
So nice to see you.
- The famous Beaugard, as I have promised.
Mr. Chandler, how can I ever express my gratitude?
- Oh, 'tis nothing.
Nothing?
You return from Europe with a masterpiece valued at $100,000, and instead of displaying it yourself, you allow me to unveil it at my party in honour of Captain Spalding.
You call that nothing?
- Mrs. Rittenhouse, I...
Will you please remove that to the place where it is to be exhibited.
- Very good, sir.
And very careful, please.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, You think that is something?
It is nothing compared to what I would like to do for you.
You are a very beautiful woman.
- No, no, Mr. Chandler.
Well, maybe I'm wrong.
- What?
Please do not go, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
I love you.
- I know.
Mr. Chandler, now look...
Hello, Mother.
Playing house?
Well, if you'll pardon me.
Have you seen Johnny Parker?
- I wish you'd get Johnny Parker out of your mind and show more respect to Mr. Chandler.
The trouble with you is you don't take these social affairs seriously.
What would you suggest, Mom?
Suicide?
I would suggest...
That must be him.
- Captain Spalding has arrived.
Splendid!
I'm so glad.
My friends, Captain Spalding has arrived.
At last we are to meet him, the famous Captain Spalding.
From climates hot and scalding, the Captain has arrived.
Most heartily we'll greet him, with plain and fancy cheering, until he's hard of hearing.
The Captain has arrived.
The Captain has arrived.
Mr. Horatio W. Jamison, Field Secretary of Captain Spalding.
I represent the Captain, who insists on my informing you on these conditions under which he camps here.
In one thing he is very strict.
He wants his women young and picked.
As for men, he won't have any tramps here.
As for men, he won't have any tramps here.
There must be no tramps.
The men must all be very old, the women warm, the champagne cold.
It's under these conditions that he camps here.
I'm announcing Captain Jeffrey Spalding.
He's announcing Captain Jeffrey Spalding.
Oh dear.
He is coming.
At last he's here.
Well, what do I owe you?
What, from Africa to here, $1.85?
That's an outrage!
I told you not to take me through Australia.
You know it's all ripped up.
You shoulda come right up to Lincoln Boulevard.
Where do you cover that stuff?
Turn around the rear end.
I want to see your license plates.
I'll attend to you later.
Don't try to pull that..
- Captain Spalding
Why, you're one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen and that's not saying much for you.
Captain Spalding, Rittenhouse Manor is entirely at your disposal.
Well, I'm certainly grateful for this magnificent washout, ah, turnout.
Now I'd like to say a few words.
Hello, I must be going.
I cannot stay.
I came to say I must be going.
I'm glad I came, but just the same, I must be going.
But my friend, you must stay.
If you should go away, you'll spoil this party I am throwing.
I'll stay a week or two, I'll stay the summer through, but I am telling you,
I must be going.
Before you go, will you oblige us and tell us of your deeds so glowing?
I'll do anything you say.
In fact I'll even stay.
- Good.
But I must be going.
There's something that I'd like to say that he's too modest to relay.
The Captain is a moral man.
Sometimes he finds it trying.
This fact I'll emphasize with stress.
I never take a drink unless... somebody's buying.
The Captain is a very moral man.
If he hears anything obscene, he'll naturally repel it.
I hate a dirty joke, I do, unless it's told by someone who knows how to tell it.
The Captain is a very moral man.
Hooray for Captain Spalding, the African explorer.
Did someone call me Shnorrer?
Hooray, hooray, hooray!
He went into the jungle, where all the monkeys throw nuts.
If I stay here, I'll go nuts.
Hooray, hooray, hooray!
He puts all his reliance in courage and defiance and risks his life for science.
Hey hey!
He is the only white man to cover every acre.
Hooray, hooray, hooray!
He puts all his reliance in courage and defiance and risks his life for science.
Hey hey!
Hooray for Captain Spalding, the African explorer.
He put his name on dying fame and that is why we say:
Hooray, hooray, hooray.
My friends, I'm highly gratified of this magnificent display of effusion.
And I want you to know...
My friends, I'm highly gratified of this magnificent display of effusion
And I want you to know that...
My friends, I'm highly gratified of this magnificent display of effusion.
And I want you to know...
Hooray for Captain Spalding...
Well, somebody's got to do it.
Captain Spalding, it is indeed a great honor to welcome you to my poor home.
Oh, it isn't so bad.
- Needless to say, I...
- Wait a minute, I think you're right, it is pretty bad.
As a matter of fact, it's one of the frowziest-looking joints I've ever seen.
Why Captain.
Where did you get your wallpaper?
Well, I...
You're letting this place run down and what's the result, you're not getting the class of people that you used to.
Why, you've got people here now that look like you.
Now I'll tell you what we do, we put up a sign outside,
"Place Under New Management"
We'd set up a 75¢ meal that'd knock their eyes out.
After we knock their eyes out, we can charge 'em anything we want.
Now, sign here and give me your check for fifteen-hundred dollars.
Now I wanna tell you, Madam, that with this insurance policy you are providing for your little ones and for your old age, which will be here in a couple of weeks now if I am any judge of horse flesh.
Now, Madam, I feel that the time has come, the walrus said...
Captain Spalding!
To speak of ma...
Captain Spalding, you stand before me as one of the bravest men of all times.
Alright, I'll do that.
In the dark forests of Africa, there has been no danger you have not dared.
You mind if I don't smoke?
Fearlessly you have blazed new trails, scoffed at the lions' roar and the cannibals' tom-tom.
Says you.
Never once in all those weary months did your footsteps falter.
Cowardice is unknown to you.
Fear is not in you.
Pardon me, a caterpillar, Captain.
The caterpillar must have frightened him.
Oh dear.
Yes, well just don't stand there, get the whiskey, get the whiskey!
Where is the whiskey?
- In my little black bag, in the right-hand corner.
Signor Emanuel Ravelli.
- How do you do?
- How are you?
- Where's the dining room?
- This is a surprise.
Say, I used to know a fella who looked exactly like you by the name of Emanuel Ravelli.
Are you his brother?
I am Emanuel Ravelli.
- You're Emanuel Ravelli?
- I am Emanuel Ravelli.
- Well, no wonder you look like him.
But I still insist there is a resemblance.
- Eh, he thinks I look alike.
- Well, if you do, it's a tough break for both of you.
You are one of the musicians?
But you were not due until tomorrow.
- Couldn't come tomorrow, that's too quick.
- You're lucky they didn't come yesterday.
- We were busy yesterday but we charge just the same.
This is better than exploring!
What do you fellas get an hour?
For playing, we get $10 an hour.
- I see.
What do you get for not playing?
- $12 an hour.
Well, clip me off a piece of that.
Now, for rehearsing, we make special rate.
That's $15 an hour.
For rehearsing?
- That's right for rehearsing.
And what do you get for not rehearsing?
- You couldn't afford it.
You see, if we don't rehearse, we don't play.
And if we don't play, that runs into money.
How much would you want to run into an open manhole?
- Just a cover charge.
Well, drop in some time.
- Sewer.
Well, we cleaned that up pretty well.
- Well, let's see how we stand.
Flat-footed.
Yesterday we didn't come.
You remember?
Yesterday we didn't come?
Oh, I remember.
Yeah, that's $300.
Yesterday you didn't come.
That's $300?
- That's $300
Well, that's reasonable.
I can see that alright.
Now, today we did come.
That's uh...
That's a hundred you owe us.
Hey, I bet I'm gonna lose on the deal.
Tomorrow we leave.
That's worth about...
- A million dollars.
Yeah, that's alright for me, but I got a partner.
The Professor.
The gates swung open and a Fig Newton entered.
How do you do?
Goodness.
You haven't got chocolate, have you?
He's got everything.
- Hives, take the Professor's hat and coat.
And send for the fumigators.
Say, don't you see there are ladies present?
What do you think this is, a...
Put that hat down, will you.
What are you doing here?
Get out of here.
Go on.
A little more to the right.
That's better.
Now, see that the drape is well-hung.
The mistress will inspect it before the unveiling.
Hello, Hives.
- Mrs. Whitehead!
This is a surprise.
- And how about me?
- Miss Grace!
You've grown so in the last year.
- You haven't lost any weight, yourself.
No, unfortunately not.
You know, Hives, it seems strange to find you working here instead of in our own home.
Well, after you left for Europe,
Mrs. Rittenhouse was good enough to make me an offer.
Lovely.
By the way, Hives, what's the secret about the painting?
No secret.
It's Beaugard's "After the Hunt".
The original?
- Most original.
Be careful.
Where did she get hold of that, do you suppose?
Is it very valuable?
- Is it, it must be worth a fortune.
With this, it looks as if we'd steal the Social Award of the Season to Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Well, isn't there something we can do?
- We might shoot ourselves.
I'd rather shoot Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Say, I have an idea.
I copied that painting at art school a year ago.
Well, what of it?
But I still don't get it.
I'll go home and get the copy.
We'll substitute it for the original and when she unveils it, what'll she have?
An imitation, and I must admit, a very cruel one.
Grace, you're wonderful.
- That's what I've been telling you.
I won't be long.
- Alright.
See you later.
Oh, Hives?
Do you still feel a bond between us?
- Most certainly, Mrs. Whitehead.
Strong enough for you to do me a big favor?
- Anything at all.
Well..
suppose I were to ask you to take away the Beaugard...
What, do you mean...
- Oh, just temporarily, of course.
And substitute something of my own?
- Well, I should consider it rather an unusual request.
It is, Hives, but somehow I still think of you as one of the Whiteheads.
You may count on me.
My soul is yours, even though my body may belong to Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Why, Hives!
Oh, Mrs. Whitehead!
- Arabella!
May I present Mr. Parker?
- Of the Massachusetts' Parkers?
Why, no.
- Then the Southern Parkers?
No, the Central Parkers.
You know, the Benches and Trees.
I see.
Meow!
Oh, I don't like that woman.
Well, never mind.
You come over here and sit down and tell me whom you do like.
Oh, so that's your game.
- Now listen.
Do you really love me?
- Why don't you marry me and find out?
- Marry you?
On what?
Last year I sold two paintings.
One at a hundred and one at fifty.
Could we live on $150 a year?
- We wouldn't need any money.
I've got a charge account in every shop on 5th Avenue.
Well, if I had any brains, I'd give up painting and get a regular job.
You know, I had a cousin who made $50,000 in Wall Street last year.
I don't wanna marry your cousin.
I'm a darn fool.
I wanna marry you.
Say... we could get that old bluff Chandler to buy a portrait from you.
Chandler?
What does he know about art?
Well, the less he knows, the easier it'll be for you to sell 'em.
They're right upstairs.
You can't miss them.
Go round the other side.
Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Captain Spalding!
How are you?
Tell me.
Are you alone?
- Captain, I don't understand.
What, you don't understand being alone?
Don't give me that innocent stuff or you'll be alone.
A big cluck like you turning cute on me!
Mrs. Rittenhouse...
- Yes?
Oh, pardon me.
You've been affected like this yourself, haven't you at times?
Oh no, Captain.
- Well, you will be.
Mrs. Rittenhouse...
Ever since I've met you,
I've swept you off my feet.
Something has been throbbing within me.
Oh it's been beating like the incessant tom-tom in the primitive jungle.
Something that I must ask you.
- What is it, Captain?
Would you wash out a pair of socks for me?
- Captain, I'm surprised.
Well it may be a surprise to you but it's been on my mind for weeks.
It's just my way of telling you that I love you, that's all.
I love you.
- Captain, Mrs. Whitehead!
- I've never been...
I beg your pardon.
Am I intruding?
Are you intruding?
Just when I had her on the 5-yard line.
I should say you were intruding.
I should say you are intruding, pardon me.
I was using the subjunctive instead of the past tense.
Yes, we're way past tents, we're living in bungalows now.
This is the mechanical age, of course.
Mrs. Whitehead, you haven't met Captain Spalding, have you?
Why, no, I haven't
How are you?
- How are you?
- I'm fine, thank you.
And how are you?
And how are you?
That leaves you one up.
Did anyone ever tell you you had beautiful eyes?
- No
Well, you have.
And so have you.
He shot her a glance.
As a smile played around his lips.
Yes, I don't think I've never seen four more beautiful eyes in my life.
Well, three anyway.
You know, You two girls have everything.
You're tall and short, and slim and stout and blonde and brunette.
And that's just the kind of a girl I crave.
We three would make an ideal couple.
Why, you've got beauty, charm, money.
You have got money, haven't you?
Because if you haven't, we can quit right now.
The Captain is charming, isn't he?
- I'm fascinated.
I'm fascinated, too--right on the arm.
Fascinated, whim-wham!
If I were Eugene O'Neill, I could tell you what I really think of you two.
You know, you're very fortunate the Theater Guild isn't putting this on.
And so is the Guild.
Pardon me while I have a strange interlude.
Why you couple of baboons, what makes you think I'd marry either one of you?
Strange how the wind blows tonight.
It has a thin eery voice.
Reminds me of poor old Marsden.
How happy I could be with either of these two, if both of them just went away.
Well, what do you say, girls, will you marry me?
But Captain, which one of us?
- Both of you.
Let's all get married.
This is my party.
Party...
Party...
Here I am talking of parties.
I came down here for a party.
What happens?
Nothing.
Not even ice cream.
The gods look down and laugh.
This would be a better world for children if the parents had to eat the spinach.
Well what do you say, girls?
What do you say, are we all gonna get married?
- All of us?
- All of us.
But that's bigamy.
- Yes, and that's big of me, too.
It's big of all of us.
Let's be big for a change.
I'm sick of these conventional marriages.
One woman and one man was good enough for your grandmother, but who wants to marry your grandmother?
Nobody.
Not even your grandfather.
Think of the honeymoon--strictly private:
I wouldn't let another woman in on this.
Well, maybe one or two, but no men.
I may not go myself.
Are you suggesting Companionate Marriage?
Well, It's got its advantages.
You could live with your folks and I could live with your folks.
And you, you could sell Fuller brushes.
Living with your folks...
Living with your folks, the beginning of the end-- drab dead yesterdays shutting out beautiful tomorrows-- hideous stumbling footsteps--creaking along the misty corridors of time, and in those corridors I see figures.
Strange figures.
Weird figures:
Steel 186, Anaconda 74,
American Can 138.
Let's see where were we?
Oh yes, we were about to get married.
Well, what do you think?
Do you think we really ought to get married?
- I think marriage is a very noble institution.
It's the foundation of the American home.
- Yes, but the trouble is you can't enforce it.
It was put over on the American people while our boys were over there and all our girls were over here.
I've been waiting at the bottom these stairs for years for just such a moment as this.
Why Captain, where are you going?
- I'm sorry, ladies, but I'm afraid we're gonna have to postpone the wedding for a few days.
Maybe for a few years.
Before I get married, I'm gonna sow a couple of wild oats.
The Captain's so amusing.
- Isn't he charming?
So that's the famous Beaugard, eh?
It's a great picture, isn't it?
Oh you've seen it before?
- Seen it, I spent 3 days in Paris copying it.
You did?
- Well, me and a million other young artists.
I bet your copy was better than any of them.
- Well, it wasn't bad at that.
I'll show it to you sometime.
- Listen.
- What?
- Mother's going to unveil it tonight.
Yeah?
Suppose...
Suppose when she unveils it, it's not the Beaugard at all.
Suppose it's yours.
- You mean, put my copy in place of the Beaugard?
- Exactly.
- Why Arabella, you're crazy.
What good would that do?
What good?
Listen.
They'll unveil it.
Chandler will tell everybody how fine it is.
They'll all cheer their heads off, and then we'll tell 'em who really painted it.
They'll say you're a great artist.
You'll get 6 commissions for painting, and we can be married and divorced in no time.
Well, that sounds great.
But what if they don't like my painting?
What then?
Well, isn't the chance worth taking?
I see you're admiring my picture, eh?
- Yes, yes.
Your picture?
- Yes, my picture.
- Well, it don't look like you.
Hey wait, some place I met you before.
because your face is very familiar.
Well, after all, I am one of the most well-known men in America.
The newspapers will keep running my photograph.
You're not Abe Kabibble?
- Nonsense
Alright, hey wait, if you're not Abe Kabibble, who are you?
Now please, Chandler is my name.
Roscoe W. Chandler.
Yeah, but I don't get about the name, you see.
Some place I met you before because your face is very familiar.
Now wait, let me see, were you ever in Sing Sing?
- Please.
No I got it.
Joliet!
- Let me alone.
Alright, alright.
Don't run away, don't run away
Leavenworth!
Now, listen here.
I have never been in these places.
I've spent most of my time in Europe.
- Europe.
I've got it now.
I know, you come from Czechoslovakia.
You are wrong, I tell you.
I have never been there.
- Hey, come here.
- I tell you this...
Please!
Get him away from me, would you.
You remember him.
Who was he?
He come from Czechoslovakia.
You are wrong, I tell you.
I told you before, you are mistaken.
He come from Czechoslovakia.
And I know who it is.
That's Abie, the fish peddler from Czechoslovakia.
- Ridiculous, I tell you.
You're wrong!
Wait, wait, wait.
We prove it.
He had a birthmark, remember?
Please, what are you trying?
Let me alone!
There it is!
There's the birthmark!
Abie, the fishman.
I confess.
I was Abie, the peddler.
Well, how did you get to be Roscoe W. Chandler?
- Say, how did you get to be an Italian?
Never mind.
Whose confession is this?
Well now, here, boys, for heaven's sake don't say anything about this to anybody and I think we can come to some agreement.
Some arrangement which will be, uh, mutually satisfactory, yes?
Money.
Money.
- Shall we say $500?
Fie to $500!
- Well, that is all the cash I have with me.
$500?
Well alright, I tell you what we do.
We'll take your IOU.
I have given you my best offer and that is all you will get.
- That's all you'll give, eh?
Abie the fishman!
Abie the fishman!
Please, be quiet.
Please, come here.
Now listen here, I have here a check for $5,000.
Now I give it to you
- Hey, is it good?
- Well of course it is good.
Who would give me a bad check?
I would.
See if it's good.
Alright, if you don't want the check then that is all you will get.
- That's all we get?
- Yes.
- He's Abie the fishman!
- Please be quiet, please!
Here, give me that handkerchief.
My tie!
Where's my tie?
Nothing but a pair of thieves.
I get the tie.
What you got?
The birthmark!
Hey, hey, where's your tie?
- Well, I...
That's a fine way for a millionaire to be running around, open at the neck.
Have you got garters?
- Of course I have garters.
Here.
Oh, they've taken my garters too.
A likely story.
Turning collegian on me, eh?
Have you got socks?
- Certainly.
Here they are.
- So you have, you have got socks.
They look pretty old to me too.
Whose are they?
Well, old socks.
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Spalding, Captain Spalding.
- I am Roscoe W. Chandler.
- Well, this is a treat, your treat.
You have heard about me?
Yes, I've heard about you for a great many years, Mr Chandler, and I'm getting pretty darn sick of it too.
Quite naturally, I've also heard of the great Captain Spalding.
Well, that's fine.
I've heard of you and you've heard of me.
Now, have you ever heard the one about the two Irishmen?
- Oh yes.
Well, now that I've got you in hysterics, let's get down to business.
My name is Spalding, Captain Spalding.
- I am Roscoe W. Chandler.
- I am Jeffrey T. Spalding.
I'll bet you don't know what the "T" stand for.
Thomas?
- Edgar.
You were close, though.
You were close though and you still are, I'll bet.
Now, this is what I want to talk to you about, Mr Chandler:
How would you like to finance a scientific expedition?
- Well, that is a question.
Yes, that is a question, you certainly know a question when you see it.
I congratulate you, Mr Chandler.
And that brings us right back to where we were.
How would you like to finance a scientific expedition?
Well, is there any particular kind of an expedition you've had in mind?
Well, I'll tell you, I'm getting along in years now and there's one thing that I've always wanted to do before I quit.
- What is that?
Retire.
Now, would you be interested in a proposition of that kind?
You know, I've always had an idea that my retirement would be the greatest contribution to science that the world has ever known.
This is your chance, Mr Chandler.
When I think what you have done for this country.
And by the way, what have you done for this country?
- Oh well...
I've always tried to do what I could.
Especially in the world of art.
Art, well I don't know how we drifted around to that, but what is your opinion of art?
I am very glad you asked me.
- I withdraw the question.
This fella takes things seriously.
It isn't safe to ask him a simple question.
Tell me, Mr Chandler, where are you planning on putting your new opera house?
Oh, I thought I should like to put it somewhere near Central Park.
I see.
Why don't you put it right in Central Park?
- Could we do that?
Sure, do it at night, when no one is looking.
Why don't you put it in the reservoir and get the whole thing over with?
Of course, that might interfere with the water supply.
But after all, we must remember that art is art.
Though on the other hand, water is water, isn't it.
And east is east, and west is west.
And if you take cranberries and stew them like applesauce, it tastes much more like prunes than rhubarb does.
Now, uh...
Now, you tell me what you know.
well, i-i-I would be very glad to give you my opinion.
Well, that's dandy, I'll ask you for them someday.
Remind me, will you?
I'll tell you what,
Could you come to my office at ten o'clock tomorrow morning?
If I'm not there, ask for Mr Jameson, that's my secretary.
And if he sees you, I'll discharge him.
That's a date now, Saturday at three.
No, you'd better make it Tuesday.
I'm going to Europe Monday.
Pardon me, My name is Spalding
Heck, I've always wanted to meet you, Mr Chandler.
Tell me, what do you think of the traffic problems?
What do you think of the marriage problems?
What do you think of at night, when you go to bed, you beast?
- Well, I'll tell you my...
- I'd rather not discuss it any further.
Remember, there are children present.
Well, you see, my dear Captain, in the last analysis, it is a question of money.
The nickel today is not what it used to be ten years ago.
I'll go further than that.
I'll get off at the depot.
The nickel today is not what it was 15 years ago.
You know what this country needs today?
- What?
- A seven-cent nickel.
Yessiree, we've been using the five-cen'nick on this country since 1492.
Now, that's putting you near a hundred years, daylight savings.
Now, why not give the seven-cent nickel a chance.
If that works out, next year we could have an eight-cent nickel.
Think what that would mean.
You could go to a news stand, buy a three-cent newspaper and get the same nickel back again.
One nickel carefully used would last a family a lifetime.
Captain Spalding, I think that is a wonderful idea.
- You do, eh?
- Yes.
Well, then there can't be much to it.
Forget about it.
Well, tell me, Captain Chandler...
Excuse me, Spalding.
- Spalding, that's right.
I'm Spalding and you're Chandler.
Let's have no more of that either, eh.
Alright.
- Bad enough being Spalding.
- Well, tell me, Captain Spalding...
Spalding is the right name?
- That's right, that's right.
I'm Chand...
No, I'm Spald...
Could I look at a program in a minute?
I might be the news weekly for all he knows, or coming next week.
Well, tell me, Captain Spalding, you've been quite a traveler.
What do you think about South America?
I'm going there soon, you know.
Is that so?
Where are you going?
- Uruguay.
Well, you go your-a-guay, and I'll go mine.
Say, how long has this been going on?
Let's change the subject.
Take the foreign situation.
Take Abyssinia.
I'll tell you, you take Abyssinia and I'll take a hot butterscotch sundae on rye bread.
Let's go and see what the boys in the back room are up to.
Let's see how yours compares with the original.
- Alright.
I don't see any difference!
- Well, look closer.
Maybe you'll find it's better.
You seen my partner?
- No
Oh, Mr. Raviola!
Ravelli.
Ravelli.
- Oh, Mr. Ravelli.
I want you to do something for me.
I'd do anything for you.
What do ya want I should do?
You see that painting?
- You mean this piksh?
I want you to take that out of the frame and put this one in its place.
You want I should take this one down put this one upstairs, huh?
- Yes.
You want I should steal?
- Oh no, no, It's not stealing.
Well, then I couldn't do it.
- Oh, Mr. Raviola!
Hey, get up.
Come here.
That's all you do.
Chase the women.
Oh, stop.
Everybody here plays cards, they don't ask us.
Here we are to waste all our time.
We've been here all day, eh.
How much we make?
We make nothing.
First thing you know, we're gonna live on a charity then we go to the old ladies' home.
How do you like that?
No, that's no good.
These people here all got money.
Now, we gotta find someone to play with us, see.
I'd play anything.
Poker, pinochle...
- Signor Ravelli,
I want to talk to you about the music.
What in the world's the matter with you?
It would be nice if...
Go away from me!
What is this?
- It's alright, just a...
Hello, Professor.
Good heavens, what's the matter with his feet?
We play all kinds of games.
Blackjack, soccer...
What is the matter with your leg?
One, two, three.
Atta boy.
Get up, buddy.
Yeah, she can't take it there.
Well, why don't you leave him alone?
Now that this game is over, how about playing some bridge?
You play bridge?
- I play bridge a little.
- What do you play for?
Oh we just play for small stakes.
- And french-fried potatoes?
Set it up right over there, Hives.
- Very good, madam.
Chandler, now where is he off to?
Look at this.
Take it away, Hives.
- Extraordinary.
How do you want to play?
Honest?
- I hope so.
You put that right away.
It's your own fault.
Come along now, we'll cut for partners.
- No, he's my partner.
That's the only way we play.
I'm sorry but it's against the rules of the game.
We have to cut for partners.
Alright, we cut for partners.
I got ace of spades.
He's got ace of spades.
That's what you call coincidences!
Two aces of spades?
- Yeah, he's got thousands of them.
Well I suppose that gives him the choice of seat.
- You have the choice of seat.
Good heavens!
Not on her lap.
- Sit down.
What's the matter with him?
- I don't know.
- He thought it was contact bridge.
Just a minute, now.
Shuffle the cards.
- Yeah, you gotta scrumble 'em up a little bit, you know.
Just a moment.
I'd like to cut those cards.
That's a winner.
Your bid, partner.
You pass?
Misdeal.
You pass?
I bid one spade.
I pass.
- Three spades.
Four spades.
One club.
- I don't understand this kind of bidding.
Well, you don't have to.
You bid four spades, eh?
Why, I haven't a spade in my hand.
- Alright.
We double.
There's something wrong here.
I want you to go over the bidding.
Oh, hey, she wants to start 'em off again, the bid.
He bids one.
- One?
One what?
- That's alright.
You'll find out.
But we have to know what he's bidding.
- We tell you later.
Now I bid two.
Two what?
- Two of the same he bids.
Now the bidding's over, see.
That's enough bidding.
It's your lead.
Oh no, you can't lead that.
- Why not?
Why, we can't take it.
- Well, what should I lead?
He'll show you.
Ace of spades.
That's-a very good.
Three of spades.
Four of spades.
You trump it?
That's what you call finesse.
No spades, partner.
No spades.
Ace of hearts.
Ace of clubs.
Dummy leads.
The dummy leads.
I'm not the dummy.
- Well, you could be.
Ace of diamonds.
Hundred aces, eh?
Two hundred?
That's better.
Ace of hearts.
Atta boy.
Make a big slam.
Make a big, big slam.
Ace of spades.
Ace of spades.
That's a good guy.
Plays a good game.
Ace of spades.
Plays a fine game.
Ace of spades.
- I refuse to play any longer.
You're nothing but a couple of cardsharps.
What's the matter, dear?
- My shoes are gone.
Good gracious, he has your slippers.
Come along.
Hey, you take-a the ladies' shoes, eh?
Quiet!
Hide.
Somebody's coming.
Alright, I make a mistake.
Get up, come on.
Come on.
Hey, hurry up.
You know what we to do, eh?
We gotta take that picture and put this one upstairs, for the lady.
Wait, no touch.
You got everything ready?
Shovel, axe, dynamite, pineapples?
Where's the flash?
That's-a no flash.
A flash.
Here's a flash.
That's a fish!
I no want the fish.
No fish.
Flash!
Stop it.
You crazy.
When you go out in the night time, you gotta have the flash.
That's no flash.
That's a flisk.
Flash.
When you wanna see somebody, you gotta have the flash.
That's a flush.
What I gonna do with a flush?
A flash.
That's a flitz.
What I gonna do with flitz?
What do ya got?
That's a whaddaya-call a flutz.
All you got is a fish and a flutz and a flitz and a flutz...
Stop this.
Where's the flash?
Look, when everything's light and you wanna make 'em dark.
What ya do?
Hey, you crazy.
I want no blackjack.
My mistake, I guess.
When everything's dark and you wanna make 'em light.
Yeah, that's a flash.
That's a flash.
Hey, that's good, alright.
The storm put the lights out.
Now nobody can see what we do.
That's-a fine, eh?
Where's the flash?
Where's the flash?
I no want the fish.
Flash.
No, no flutz.
What's-a matter for you, eh?
Flash.
Before the people are coming.
What's a matter?
You lose it?
You gotta find it.
Look for it.
Alright, never mind.
We'll work without it.
Hide!
Hide!
Somebody's coming.
Hide.
Quiet, quiet.
Shut up.
Keep quiet.
I know where you are.
It's alright.
Oh, Captain Spalding, where are you?
- Yeah?
Oh, Captain...
- Yes, what's the trouble?
The storm has put the lights out and you can't see your hand before your face.
Well, you wouldn't get much enjoyment out of that.
Well, I don't know what you're gonna do but I'm gonna take a nap.
Leave me a call for three o'clock.
Make it three-thirty.
You certainly get service around here.
Pardon me, Mrs. Rittenhouse, did you lose a fish?
- What?
Well, somebody lost it.
Will you take it out to the kitchen and have it fried for me?
Did you hear that?
There's somebody over there.
I say, there's somebody over there.
- Don't be silly, the house is just settling, that's all.
Anybody over there?
- I don't see anybody.
There you are.
If there was anybody over there, he'd see him, wouldn't I?
What is it, Captain?
What is it?
You know what I think?
I think you got roaches.
Yes, you've got roaches alright.
And the biggest one has got asthma.
Horrible!
Come on, Captain.
Let us get out of here.
This can't be the library.
This must be the operating room.
Hey, we get the picture and we don't make a one sound.
Hey, somebody turned on the lights.
Alright, we get the picture though we may no make a one sound.
C'mon, let's go, get outta here.
What do you want?
Oh, the fish.
Go on.
Hey, that's some storm, eh?
A regular tornado.
C'mon, let's go this way.
I think it's a shortcut.
Come on, let's go.
California.
And now, my friends, before we start the musical program,
Captain Spalding has kindly considered to tell us about his trip to Africa.
Captain Spalding.
- Me?
Friends, I'm going to tell you of that great, mysterious, wonderful continent known as Africa.
Africa is God's country, and he can have it.
Well sir, we left New York drunk and early on the morning of February 2nd.
After 15 days on the water and 6 on the boat, we finally arrived on the shores of Africa.
We at once proceeded three-hundred miles into the heart of the jungle, where I shot a polar bear.
This bear was 6' 7" in its stockinged feet, and had shoes on him.
I had him...
- Pardon me, just a moment, Captain.
I always thought that polar bears lived in the frozen north.
Oh you did?
Well this bear was anemic and he couldn't stand the cold climate.
He was a rich bear and he could afford to go away in the winter.
You take care of your animals, and I'll take care of mine.
Frozen north, my eye!
From the day of our arrival, we led an active life.
The first morning saw us up at 6, breakfasted and back in bed at 7.
This was our routine for the first three months.
We finally got so we were back in bed at 6:30.
One morning I was sitting in front of the cabin, smoking some meat...
Smoking some meat?
- Yes, there wasn't a cigar store in the neighborhood.
As I say, I was sitting in front of the cabin, when I bagged 6 tigers.
Captain.
Did you catch 6 tigers?
I bagged 'em, I..
I begged 'em to go away, but they hung around all afternoon.
They were the most persistent tigers I've ever seen.
The principal animals inhabiting the African jungle are moose, elks and Knights of Pythias.
You all know what a moose is.
The first day I shot two bucks.
That was the biggest game we had
As I say, you all know what a moose is.
A moose runs around on the floor and eats cheese and is chased by cats.
The elks, on the other hand, live up in the hills, and in the spring they come down for their annual convention.
It is very interesting to watch them come to the waterhole.
And you should see them run when they find out it's only a waterhole.
What they're looking for is an alco-hole.
One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas.
How he got in my pajamas, I don't know.
Then we tried to remove the tusks.
The tusks.
That's not so easy to say, tusks.
You can try that some time.
Oh, simple.
Tusks.
Pardon me, my name is Spalding.
I've always wanted to meet you, Mr. Chandler.
As I say, we tried to remove the tusks, but they were embedded in so firmly that we couldn't budge them.
Of course, in Alabama, the tusks are looser.
But that's entirely ir-elephant to what I was talking about.
We took pictures of the native girls, but they weren't developed.
But we're going back again in a couple of weeks and we...
- Very enlightening speech, Captain.
Very enlightening.
- Hooray for Captain Spalding.
Three cheers for Captain Spalding!
Three cheers for Captain Spalding!
Three cheers...
- No one asked for the chairs.
Put them right where you got them.
Go on.
Go on with your chairs.
Get out.
Go on, go on, you!
And now, friends, Signor Ravelli will oblige us at the piano.
Signor Ravelli.
Signor Ravelli's first selection will be "Somewhere My Love Lies Sleeping"
with a male chorus.
Say, if you get near a song, play it.
I can't think of the finish.
That's strange.
And I can't think of anything else.
You know what I think, I think I went past it.
Well if you come around again, jump off.
I once kept this up for three days.
You wouldn't consider hush money, would you?
I can't get 'em now.
I've gotta wait for inspiration.
- It's about time.
Play the song about Montreal.
- Montreal?
"I'm A Dreamer, Montreal."
I dunno that.
I tell you what I'll do,
I'll play one of my own compositions, by Victor Herbert.
Make it short.
He plays them both well.
Your team scored that time.
So did the old blue one.
Why do you push, huh?
Why do you push?
- Let 'em alone, they may exterminate each other.
The best thing to have for either of them.
And once for old Purdue.
I was afraid of that.
Hey, I thought I had the finish.
- I wish you did.
Yours.
Play the song about the Irish chiropodist.
- Irish chiropodist?
- "My Fate Is In Your Hands".
Is there a horse in the house?
They got everything else here.
And now, Mrs. Rittenrotten...
Rittenhouse.
- Yes, a slight error.
I have a surprise for you.
The man is here for the piano.
- Oh, Captain!
No, really what I meant to say was that, uh, when I departed from the natives in Africa, I was presented with a little gift.
And this gift I am going to give to you, at a very low figure.
- Oh how wonderful.
Well now, don't be too hasty.
Wait'll you see.
- I can't wait...
The whole thing was done with the white of an egg.
Well, what is it, Captain?
What is it?
What is it, you ask?
This is a hope chest for a guinea pig.
"What is it."
This magnificent chest...
No, this mag..
No, this magnificent chest
I now take great pleasure in presenting to you with my compliments.
- Captain, this leaves me speechless.
Well, see that you remain that way.
- And now, ladies and gentlemen...
Come outside and say that.
If we will all adjourn to the library,
Mrs. Rittenhouse has another and perhaps a greater surprise for us.
This way, Captain.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, how do you pay Hives?
By the week or by the pound?
And now it is my privilege to reveal the masterpiece of François Jacques DuBois Gilbert Beaugard.
No trains will be sold after the magazines leave the depot.
"After the Hunt."
There!
I told you, you were a great artist.
Shall we spill the beans now?
- Let's wait a minute.
Something might happen.
I'm sure we'd all appreciate a few words from Mr. Chandler, who will tell us something of the life and work of the artist Beaugard
And keep it clean!
Mr. Chandler!
My friends, I am quite sure that you are all familiar with Beaugard.
And this is perhaps his masterpiece.
In it he has achieved a greatness in the handling of color and line.
Now you will see here that...
Wait!
This is not my picture.
This is a rank imitation.
What do you mean?
- See for yourself.
You are right.
It is not the Beaugard.
- It certainly isn't.
There's a dog missing.
Oh Captain Spalding, what shall I do?
- Telephone the dog-catchers immediately.
They've taken the original and left me this.
- Leave it to me.
I'll throw some light on this subject.
Has anyone a match?
- What happened?
Oh Hives, where are you?
Turn on the lights.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, did you lose that fish again?
- Oh Captain, I'm so worried.
Good heavens.
That one is gone, too.
- Oh, this is awful.
The crooks, they are escaping.
Follow me, men.
Never mind the men, just the women!
Right this way.
They went out here.
Oh, the excitement.
I never saw anything so funny in all my life.
This is great.
And there goes her old party.
Good old Hives.
Wasn't it funny?
- Oh, v-v-v-very.
You're not afraid, are you, Hives?
- Oh no.
I'm not afraid.
Oh dear, no.
Only, you see, well, they were talking of having the police here and I wouldn't want the police suspect me.
Why, they wouldn't suspect you.
- Oh yes, they would!
See, the last time they suspected me, I got four years.
- Hives!
Alright, Hives, give me the painting, and I'll take care of it.
- Good.
Good heavens.
It's gone.
- Gone?
- I left it in there.
There must be thieves at this party.
If I'd known that, I never would have come.
Wait a minute!
That professor!
- The Professor!
I see!
Hives, that's the fella who would plan it.
Now listen, we've got to get that picture away from him.
Might I suggest some of this?
Very satisfactory in these cases.
A few drops on a handkerchief and the Professor will no longer obstruct us.
You're sure it'll do the trick?
- Oh, absolutely.
Would you care to try some?
No thanks, Hives.
Let's find the Professor.
I don't see how the thieves could've gotten away or who it could've been.
It's a good thing we substituted yours.
Suppose the thieves had gotten away with the Beaugard.
Oh, and it'd be alright if they stole mine?
Oh Darling, I didn't mean that.
But what would Mother do?
Why, it's worth $100,000.
How could she have replaced it?
Oh, I understand.
Isn't it exciting?
Just think, whoever took it was right in the room with us.
Just like Raffles!
Isn't it romantic?
All the boys I've known used to say I was made of stone.
I would always leave them alone in despair.
I've been on the pan, I've been called an electric fan, told I'm even much colder than Frigidaire.
I began to wonder if I was all wrong.
I thought so till you came along.
Tell me, dear, why am I so romantic?
When you're near, why am I so romantic?
What a grand feeling, when your lips meet mine.
That certain something comes stealing up and down my spine.
I don't know what it is you've done to me.
You don't know half of the good you do me.
Other boys bore me, they just leave me blue.
Oh, why am I so romantic with you?
Tell me, dear, why am I so romantic?
When you're near, why am I so romantic?
What a grand feeling, when your lips touch mine.
That certain something comes stealing up and down my spine.
When we touch, close in your arms you hold me.
I forget all that my mother told me.
Other girls bore me, they just leave me blue.
But why am I so romantic with you?
Oh, Signor Ravelli!
I've been looking for you all morning.
I was busy all morning.
- Signor Ravelli, you've gotta put that painting back.
Painting?
What painting?
The one you changed last night.
You remember.
Oh, you mean the piksh?
- Yes.
Hey, what's-a matter for you?
First you want 'em downstairs, then you want 'em upstairs, then you want 'em a downstairs, then you..
C'mon, Make up your mind.
Oh I do thank you for what you've done but you've gotta get that painting back before the police get here.
The police are coming?
- Yes.
- Wait, I give it to you.
You put it back.
C'mon.
Where's the piksh?
- What do you mean 'Where's the piksh?
'
I put 'em in here.
It's gone.
Somebody take 'em.
You take 'em!
- Me?
No, I know, I know.
The fish peddler.
Abie the fish peddler.
Did Mother invite a fish peddler here?
I don't know, but he's here.
Come on, we find him.
Good morning, Mrs Rittenhouse.
- Good morning, Mr. Jamison.
And how is Captain Spalding this morning?
- Oh he had a very bad night.
He didn't sleep a wink.
He went on horseback riding in the middle of the night.
I'm sorry.
- Yes, I know.
- But we've all been pretty upset.
Good morning, Captain.
Did you enjoy your ride?
What in the world are you looking for?
- I lost my horse.
Yes, he slipped right out from between me.
I can't understand it.
I had my feet in the stirrups, too.
I dunno, I dunno how he got awa-
I didn't care about that but I lost the bit you loaned me.
Nevermind, I'll get you another bit.
- Well, that'll be two bits I owe you then.
Captain, I hope you weren't distressed by last night's unfortunate occurrence.
You mean that dinner you served?
- No, the painting that was stolen!
Was there a painting stolen?
I haven't seen a painting in three weeks.
Jamison!
As my secretary, why didn't you inform me there was a painting stolen?
What do you think I engaged you for?
Well Captain, I didn't know it.
- Well, you should've asked me.
I didn't know it.
Well, I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?
You're a contemptible cur!
I repeat, sir.
You're a contemptible cur.
Oh if I were a man, you'd resent that.
Please keep quiet, will you?
I can get along without you, you know.
I got along without your father, didn't I?
Yes, and your grandfather.
Yes, and your uncle.
Yes, and your uncle.
Yes, and my uncle.
- Captain!
- I didn't come here to be exonerated.
- I beg pardon Mrs. Rittenhouse..
Oh you do, eh?
Well, I'd like to see you crawl out of a rumble seat.
The police are here, madam.
- Oh, the police.
Have them come in.
Oh, so that's your game, is it.
Well, you can't shut me up!
- Captain!
No, you can talk to my attorney.
Jamison, take a letter to my lawyers.
I'll show you a thing or two.
Or three.
Show you a thing or three.
- Oh Captain.
- Sending for the police!
Take a letter to my lawyers.
Sending for the police, eh?
I say, take a letter to my lawyers.
- I am taking it.
Well, read me what you have so far.
Honorable Charles H. Hungadunga, care of Hungadunga, Hungadunga, Hungadunga, Hungadunga McCormack.
Semicolon.
How do you spell "semicolon"?
- Alright, make it a comma.
Honorable Charles H. Hungadunga, Hungadunga...
McCormack.
Gentlemen, question mark.
Er-r-r!
Do you want "er-r-r" in the letter?
- No, put that in an envelope.
Now then...
In re yours of the 5 inst, yours to hand and beg to rep, brackets, that we have gone over the ground carefully and we seem to believe, i.e., to wit, e.g., in lieu,
that despite all our precautionary measures which have been involved we seem to believe that it is hardly necessary for us to proceed unless we receive an ipso facto that is not negligible at this moment.
Quotes, unquotes and quotes.
Hoping this finds you, I beg to remain...
- Hoping this finds him where?
Well let him worry about that.
Don't be so inquisitive, Jamison.
Sneak!
I say, hoping this finds you, I beg to remain as of June 9th.
Cordially, yours, regards.
That's all, Jamison.
I'll show you where I get off.
Sending for the police.
Vow read me the letter, Jamison.
"Honorable Charles H. Hungadunga."
'Hungadunga.'
Hunga..
Hung..
- Hungadunga
That's it, Hungadunga.
"C/ o Hungadunga, Hungadunga, Hungadunga McCormack."
You've left out a Hungadunga.
You left out the main one, too.
Thought you could slip one over on me, didn't you, eh?
Alright, leave it out and put in a windshield wiper instead.
I tell you what you do, Jamison.
I tell you what.
Make it three windshield wipers and one Hungadunga.
They won't all be there when the letter arrives anyhow.
Hungadunga, Hungadunga, Hungadunga
"...and McCormack.
Gentlemen, question mark."
- Gentlemen, question mark?
Put it on the penultimate and not on the dipthonic.
You want to brush up on your Greek, Jamison.
Well, get a Greek and brush up on him.
"In re yours of the 5 inst."
- I see.
Now, uh... you said a lot of things here that I didn't think were important, so I just omitted them.
Oh Captain!
Good gracious.
So, you just omitted them, eh?
You just omitted the body of the letter, that's all.
You just left out the body of the letter, that's all.
Yours is not to reason why, Jamison.
You've left out the body of the letter.
Alright, send it that way and tell him the body will follow.
You want the body in brackets?
No, it'll never get there in brackets.
Put it in a box.
Put it in a box and mark it 'fragilly'.
Mark it what?
- 'Fragilly!
' F-R-A-G...
Look it up, Jamison, it's in the dictionary.
Look under fragile.
Look under the table if you don't find it there.
"Quotes, unquotes and quotes."
- That's three quotes?
- Yes, sir.
Add another quart and make it a gallon.
How much is in a gallon, Jamison?
Regards.
- Regards, that's a fine letter, Jamison.
That's an epic.
That's dandy.
Now, I want you to make two carbon copies of that letter and throw the original away.
And when you get through with that, throw the carbon copies away.
Just send a stamp.
Air mail.
That's all.
You may go, Jamison.
I may go too.
- Mrs. Rittenhouse?
I'm Inspector Hennessey from headquarters.
- How do you do, Inspector?
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Captain Scotland of Spalding Yard.
No, I'm Captain Spalding of Scotland Yard.
Please don't make the same mistake again.
- I'm glad to know you, Captain.
- Well, I should think you would be.
Now then, Inspector, I think between the two of us, we can solve the mystery of the stolen painting, especially if you go home.
Inspector, please don't be too hasty about making an arrest.
I don't want my guests embarrassed.
Don't worry, we won't arrest anybody.
- He's lucky if he can stay out of jail himself.
Mr. Jamison, would you mind taking the Inspector and his men to the library and showing them the scene of the crime.
Certainly, Mrs Rittenhouse.
Right this way, Inspector.
Come on, boys.
And Jamison, count the spoons.
Captain, I didn't know you'd been a detective too.
- There's a whole lot of things you don't know.
- I suppose that's so.
- You know darn well it's so.
Where were you on the night of June 5th, 1774?
I'm afraid I don't know.
- You betcha don't know.
Where was I?
I don't know.
- Well, I don't know either and if I did know, I wouldn't tell you.
Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
Take a number from 1 to 10.
- Alright.
Alright, what's the number?
- 7.
- That's right. 7 is right.
I coulda done it with one hand if I wanted to.
This is no mystery.
I could solve this in 5 minutes if I wanted to worry.
Captain, I don't want you to worry.
I don't want anything to interfere with your weekend.
Nothing ever interferes with my weak end.
And I'll thank you not to get personal, Mrs. Rittenhouse!
- Oh Captain!
Where's my secretary?
Jamison!
- Captain, I assure you, I didn't mean to offend you.
Oh please, Captain, you misunderstood me.
A more dastardly cracker I've never heard!
I wish I was back in the jungle where men are monkeys.
Captain, I'm so sorry.
- Jamison!
No, no.
Good morning, Mrs. Rittenhouse!
- Good morning.
Perfectly charming party.
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
It's just full of surprises.
- So glad you're enjoying yourself.
Oh Hives, Hives!
Good morning.
Some breakfast?
- Breakfast nothing.
Did you get the painting?
- No, I did not.
I watched all night, but the Professor did not sleep in his room.
Strange, very strange.
- Good heavens, Hives.
What will we do?
I don't know.
Until we see the Professor...
You keep an eye on him till I get back with the bottle.
Don't worry, he'll not get away from me this time.
Did you get it?
- Yes, madam.
- Good.
Now I'll go ahead and engage him in conversation.
You trail behind and when the proper time comes, see that he gets it.
Very good, madam.
Oh hello.
I've been looking all over for you!
Where have you been?
What is the matter with this?
What've you got there, the morning papers?
No, that isn't the one I want.
Let me see one of the others.
That still isn't the one I want.
Out!
Yes, out!
The birds...
Come on up here and sit down.
I want to talk to you.
Don't you like me?
You don't?
Well, I like you.
I like little boys like you.
By the way, how old are you?
Five years old?
Why, you're just a baby, aren't you?
Oh, isn't that nice?
I like that.
No, no, no.
Now all joking aside, isn't there someone you do like?
Isn't there someone you love?
Now think again.
Isn't there someone you really and truly love?
Is there?
Tell me who!
Why, that's a horse!
You love a horse?
Come on, lift him up.
Come on.
He's out.
- Let us get out.
Arabella!
- John, I've been trying to find you.
Ravelli has lost the painting.
Well I've been looking all over for you I just found a painting out on the terrace.
Was it the Beaugard?
- No
- Oh, yours?
Well if it's not yours, and it's not the Beaugard, whose is it?
Where did it come from?
Well, don't you see?
Someone else came along and substituted it for mine, thinking they were getting away with the original Beaugard.
Somebody swiped my scheme, eh?
Say, then Chandler never saw your painting after all?
- No
For all I know, you may still be a great artist.
Where is this picture?
It's up in my room.
- Well, you go get it and I'll get the Captain Spalding.
He'll get to the bottom of this.
And then John found the third painting.
- Well, that's very interesting.
Well, fairly interesting.
Well, we just gotta keep a sharp look out, that's all.
-Oh I've gotta find it or Mother's out $100,000.
Now, don't worry.
Let me work on this case for 24 hours and then we'll call in somebody else.
You think it's a mystery now?
Wait'll you see it tomorrow.
Remember the Charley Ross disappearance?
I worked on that case for 24 hours and they never did find him.
They couldn't find me for five years.
That's me, Captain Yard of Scotland Spalding.
I always get my women, or paintings.
Arabella, can you mention what's happened?
You know that painting I found?
Well, it's been stolen from my room.
There you are!
I haven't been on the case five minutes and there's another painting gone.
I bet it's not even five minutes.
I'll bet it's not over three.
Now they've got my watch.
This is going too far.
It wasn't going, and now it's gone.
And the door to my room was locked too.
- Well how could they get in?
Who could it have been?
Wait a minute.
I think I've got a clue.
No, it's a hair, a red hair.
The Professor?
Oh no, it couldn't be.
Well, he's picked out this month by the Crook of the Month club.
Anyhow, we'll investigate it.
You know Conductor Hennessey?
- Inspector!
Inspect her yourself.
Now listen, you know that little redheaded fellow, the Professor?
- Yes.
Well, get that gang of flagpole sitters of yours and see if you can find him.
Aye aye, Captain.
Come on, boys.
We'll soon get to the bottom of this.
Hey, what's that cop doing there?
It didn't take that long to find him.
- That's right, this is it!
Yeah, this is it, but which one is it?
- The one that was just taken from my room.
Oh, we've got that back.
Maybe I got my watch back.
Now the fob is gone!
Well, I still got the pocket.
Anything I retain now is velvet.
Except the coat.
That's Prince Albert.
Well, all the jokes can't be good.
You've got to expect that once in a while.
Say, if we could find the fellow that painted this picture, well, we'd have a pretty good clue.
- What'd you say?
I said, if we could find the fellow that painted this picture, we'd have a pretty good clue.
You just said that.
What a dull conversationalist you turned out to be!
Let me see that a minute, will ya.
Say, this is signed "Beaugard".
There's the criminal:
Beaugard.
No Beaugard is dead.
Beaugard is dead?
Then it's murder!
Now we've got something.
What do you got, Cap?
- I've got jacks and aces.
What've you got?
That's good.
I was bluffing.
- Look at this, Ravelli.
Isn't there something strikes you very funny about this picture?
Come, come, it isn't as funny as all that.
Did you ever see a tree like that?
Tree?
That's a spinach.
- That can't be spinach.
Where's the egg?
Well, it could be spinach.
Look at all the sand laying around there.
You mean it's an old Spinach custom?
No, it's not that, Ravelli.
Anything but that.
No, Cap, that's alright, it's my mistake.
You know what that is, that's Coleslaw.
Coleslaw?
- Yeah.
That's-a Coleslaw
Did you ever see a coleslaw like that?
- Sure, look at this one.
I don't want any of your lip now.
Did you ever see anything like that?
You know what this is?
This is a left-handed painting.
Look, there's a signature.
- That's right, it's in the right-hand corner.
This is either a left-handed painting or a vegetable dinner.
Now, if we can find the left-handed person that painted this, we'll have "The Trial of Mary Dugan" with sound.
Well, I saw that.
Goodbye.
- Now, you wait here.
I'm going to need you.
Now look,
We mustn't lose this.
This is evidence.
Now take it to your room and leave the door open this time and try that.
And not a word about this to anybody.
Not even to me.
Ravelli, we've got to find the left-handed painting.
Now, in a case like this, the first thing to do is to find the motive.
Now, what could have been the motive of the guys who swiped the Beaugard?
I got it.
Robbery!
Would you mind going out and crossing the boulevard when the lights are against you?
Si, Capt'.
Sit down.
You understand, I got an idea how to find this painting.
In a case like this that's so mysterious, you gotta get the clues.
You gotta use the Sherlock Holmes method.
Now you go about 'em like this:
You say to yourself, "What happened?"
Then the answer come back:
"Something was stolen."
Then you say to yourself, "What was stolen?"
And the answer come back: "A painting."
What are you, a ventriloquist?
Now you say to yourself, "Where was this painting stolen?"
And the answer come back: "In this house."
Now, so far I'm right, eh?
Well, it's pretty hard to be wrong if you keep answering yourself all the time.
Now you go a little further and you say to yourself, "Who stole the painting?"
This a very, very important question, Captain.
You get the answer, you got the solution to the whole thing.
Especially if you find the picture.
Now you take all the clues, you put 'em together.
What do ya got huh?
- Bread pudding.
No, here's what we got:
Something was stolen.
Stolen where?
In this house.
Stolen by who?
Somebody in the house.
Now, to find the painting, all you gotta do is go to everybody in the house and ask 'em if they took it.
I could rent you out as a decoy for duck hunters.
You say you're going to go to everybody in the house and ask 'em if they took the painting?
Suppose nobody in the house took the painting?
- Go to the house next door.
That's Great.
Suppose there is no house next door?
Well, then of course, we gotta build one.
Well, now you're talking.
What kind of a house you think we oughta put up, eh?
Well I tell ya Cap, you see, my idea of a house is something nice and small and comfortable.
That's the way I feel about it.
I don't want anything elaborate.
Just a little place that I can call home and tell the wife I won't be there for dinner.
I see.
You just want a telephone booth.
No, in that case I'd get in touch with Chic Sales.
What do ya say, Cap, we build right about here?
Here?
- Yeah, right about here.
- I'd like something over here if I could get it.
I don't like junior crossing the tracks on his way to the reform school.
I don't like junior at all, as a matter of fact.
Alright.
We got something over there, and believe me, that's convenient.
Oh that's very convenient.
Well look, all you gotta do is open the door, step outside, and there you are.
There you are?
There you are where?
- Outside.
Suppose you want to get back in again?
- You had no right to go out.
Well, don't do anything until I hear from you, will you?
Say, maybe that's the painting down in the cellar!
- That's no cellar, that's the roof.
That's the roof down there?
- Yeah, you see we keep the roof in the basement so when the rain comes, the chimney don't get wet.
Well, I'm going out to get x-rayed.
I'll be back in a little while.
I may be wonderful but I think you're wrong, Ravelli.
- Hey wait, don't get excited.
Come here.
Now look, here's the rooms.
- Those are the rooms?
- Yeah, right here's the rooms.
This is your room.
This is my room.
And this is the maid's room.
I'd have to go through your room?
That's alright, I won't be in it.
Say, Ravelli, you couldn't put the maid in your room, eh?
- What makes you think I couldn't?
Well, there's going to be a lot of traffic in there.
I can see that.
Well, what do ya say?
You ready to sign the lease?
Well, it's a little premature.
I'd like to discuss it with my husband.
Could you come back this evening, when he's home?
Hey, you married?
- Why, I've got a girl as big as you are.
Alright.
Get me one.
- Don't get vulgar, Ravelli.
Ravelli, how about the painting?
We take care of that alright.
Now I'll tell you what my idea is.
I think the kitchen should be white.
Outside, green.
Inside, cerise.
The painting, I say!
How about the painting, Ravelli?
What you think I talk?
That's painting, the kitchen white, outside green...
The painting that was stolen!
- Stolen?
Don't you remember?
Mrs. Rittenhouse lost a valuable Beaugard oil painting worth $100,000?
Don't you remember that?
No, I'm a stranger around here.
I don't remember that.
What do you think I am?
One of the early settlers?
Ravelli, don't you remember Mrs. Beaugard lost a valuable Rittenhouse oil painting?
worth $100,000?
Don't you remember that?
No, but I've seen you someplace before.
Well, I don't know where I was but I'll stay out of there in the future.
Hey, Capt!
It come to me like a flash!
This painting wasn't stolen.
You know what happened, this painting, Captain has disappeared.
And yes, it disappeared.
And you know what make it disappear?
You'll never guess, Cap.
What do you think make this painting disappear, heh?
Moths!
Moths eat it!
Left-handed moths!
Go away.
Go away, I'll be alright in a minute.
Left-handed moths ate the painting, eh?
- That's my own solution.
I wish you were in it.
Left-handed moths ate the painting.
You know, I'd buy you a parachute if I thought it wouldn't open.
Hey, I got pair of shoes.
He's crazy.
C'mon, let's go down and get the reward.
We solved it.
You solved it.
The credit is all yours.
The painting was eaten by left-handed moths.
- Hey, you know, we did a good day's work.
How do you feel, tired?
Maybe you wanna lie down for a couple of years, eh?
Why don't you just lie down until rigor mortis sets in.
Now look, Ravelli
I'll tell you how we get the painting.
We go to court and we'll get out a writ of habeas corpus.
You're going to get rid of what?
Oh, I never should have started that way, I can see that.
I say, we'll go to court and we'll get out a writ of habeas corpus.
Yes, corpus.
- Didn't you ever see a habeas corpus?
No, but I see "Habeas Irish Rose".
Good morning.
- Good morning.
Mr. Chandler, why don't you go down to the beach with the others?
I'm sure you'd feel better.
If I had my Beaugard, I'm sure I'd feel better.
Oh but we're doing everything we can.
Mrs. Rittenhouse!
I have it!
- The Beaugard!
Wonderful!
My Beaugard!
I...
Wait.
This is not my Beaugard, this is a rank imitation.
Where did you find it?
In Mr. Parker's room, madam.
- Parker?
One thing is certain.
The man who made that stole the Beaugard.
Hives, find Mr. Parker and ask him to come here.
- Certainly, madam.
Wait.
My men will bring him in.
Go out and get Mr. Parker.
Now then, what's the matter with this?
- Well, look at here.
You've only to look at it once to see what it is.
It is a rank imitation.
Mother, what's wrong?
Mr. Parker, something very mysterious has occurred and I'm afraid you're the only one who can explain.
I'd be only too glad to if I can.
Nothing mysterious about it.
We found this in your room.
Now, what have you done with the original Beaugard?
Come clean!
- I think it would be wise...
Well, I have nothing to say except that I don't know where the Beaugard is.
Well, how is it we found this in your room?
C'mon, you'd better come with me.
You can't take him.
- Arabella
This program is coming to you from the House of David
He's either got that suit on upside-down or there is no law of gravity.
Einstein or no Einstein.
- My tie!
Captain, what shall I do?
They're going to arrest John.
Who's gonna arrest John?
- I am, Captain!
Oh you are, eh?
Well, let me tell you something:
the first thing they teach you at Scotland Yard is never to arrest an innocent man.
But he's not innocent.
I'll have to arrest him, just the same.
By all means, or nobody will be safe here.
You can't arrest him.
I stole it.
- Don't listen to her, Officer.
I did it.
They're both lying.
I did it.
- He's crazy.
I confess.
I did it.
Maybe nobody stole the painting.
Maybe there was no painting.
- That's right.
Maybe there was no painting.
I saw it.
Cut out all the talk!
Who stole the painting?
I did!
- Good gracious.
What, you?
You took the picture?
Where is it?
Aw, that's a horse.
The Beaugard!
That is my Beaugard!
- No, that isn't your Beaugard.
Don't be ridiculous.
I paid $100,000 for this painting.
I know what I bought.
Look at the signature.
John Parker.
Somebody changed it.
That is my Beaugard!
That is the Beaugard, I tell you.
There it is.
But that one, that has the color, the depth, the soul of the Beaugard.
Only a master could have produced a painting like that.
You mean, you painted that?
- Yes, sir.
- Why, young man, you're a genius.
You're a genius.
I commission you to paint a portrait of me immediately.
Well, you'd better make wait until tomorrow.
I'm going to be busy all day.
- Yes.
You'd better come with me, young fellow.
- Don't take him away, officer.
He returned the paintings.
Pardon me.
My name is Spalding.
I've always wanted to meet you.
Alright.
I'll let him go this time.
But I want to give you some advice.
You're running around with the wrong kinda people.
You wanna be a crook?
Why don't you go home?
- He's got no home.
Go home for a few nights and stay home.
Don't you know your poor old mother sits there sits there, night aft... night after night... waiting to hear your steps on the stairs.
- Ain't got no stairs.
And I can see a little light burning in the... burning in the window.
No you can't!
The gas company turned it off.
What I'm telling you is for your own good.
And if you listen to me, you can't go wrong.
This may go on for years.
- There's just one thing...
I can't understand what's delaying that coffee pot?
Where's the cream?
- Well, you certainly surprised me.
Me too.
I thought he had more than that.
- There's no use giving you any advice.
Captain, this time I'm afraid I'll have to take him.
Come on.
Oh, what are you doing?
My dear!
Hey, what's the idea?
- Jamison, take a letter to my lawyers.
Oh no, don't!
Oh no, oh no no, not, Anything but...
Oh the things that I've got to go...
So young..
C'mon now, let's get out of here before they all wake up.
Hurry up.
C'mon.
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon...

Oh, yes, Mrs. Rittenhouse?
I'd like to make a few changes in the assignment of the rooms.
Very good, madam.
Suppose you put Mr. Chandler in the blue suite.
And Captain Spaulding, as guest of honor, will have the green duplex with the two baths.
Two, madam?
Why, yes.
I think the Captain would like two baths, don't you?
Well, if he's just returned from Africa, he may need two baths.
MAN:
Mr. Roscoe W. Chandler.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, well!
Mr. Chandler.
So nice to see you.
The famous Beaugard, as I have promised.
Mr. Chandler, how can I ever express my gratitude?
Oh, it's nothing.
Nothing?
You return from Europe with a masterpiece valued at $100,000, and instead of displaying it yourself, you allow me to unveil it at my party in honor of Captain Spaulding.
You call that nothing?
Mrs. Rittenhouse, I...
Uh, will you please remove that to the place where it is to be exhibited?
Very good, sir.
And uh, very careful, please.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, you think that is something?
It is nothing compared to what I would like to do for you.
You are a very beautiful woman.
No, no, Mr. Chandler.
Well, maybe I'm wrong.
What?
Please, do not go, Mrs. Rittenhouse,
I love you.
I know, but...
Do not take away your hand.
I tell you, I love you.
Careful...
Hello, Mother.
Playing house?
Well, uh, if you'll pardon me.
Have you seen Johnny Parker?
I wish you'd get Johnny Parker out of your mind and show more respect to Mr. Chandler.
The trouble with you is you don't take these social affairs seriously.
What would you suggest, Mom?
Suicide?
I would suggest...

It's under these conditions that he camps here
MAN:
I'm announcing Captain Geoffrey Spaulding
ALL:
He's announcing Captain Geoffrey Spaulding
Oh, dear, he is coming
At last he's here
(FANFARE PLAYING)
Well, what do I owe you?
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
What?
From Africa to here, $1.85?
That's an outrage.
I told you not to take me through Australia.
You know it's all ripped up.
You should have come right up Lincoln Boulevard.
Where do you come to that stuff?
Turn around the rear end, I wanna see your license plates.
I don't think, you're on the square.
Oh, Captain Spaulding.
I'll attend to you later.
Oh, Captain Spaulding.
Why you're one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen.
That's not saying much for you.
Captain Spaulding,
Rittenhouse Manor is entirely at your disposal.
Well, I'm certainly grateful for this magnificent washout.
Uh, "turnout," and uh, now I'd like to say a few words.
(SINGING) Hello I must be going
I cannot stay, I came to say I must be going
I'm glad I came, but just the same I must be going...
La la
For my sake you must stay
If you should go away you'd spoil this party I am throwing
I'll stay a week or two
I'll stay the summer through
But I am telling you
I must be going.
ALL:
Before you go will you oblige us
And tell us of your deeds so glowing
I'll do anything you say In fact, I'll even stay
ALL:
Good
But I must be going
There's something that I'd like to say
That he's too modest to relate
The Captain is a moral man Sometimes he finds it trying
This fact I'll emphasize with stress
I never take a drink unless
Somebody's buying
ALL:
The Captain is a very moral man
If he hears anything obscene he'll naturally repel it
I hate a dirty joke I do
Unless it's told by someone who knows how to tell it
ALL:
The Captain is a very moral man
Hooray for Captain Spaulding the African explorer
Did someone call me Schnorer
ALL:
Hooray, hooray, hooray
He went into the jungles where all the monkeys throw nuts
If I stay here I'll go nuts
ALL:
Hooray, hooray, hooray
He put all his reliance in courage and defiance
And risked his life for science
Hey, hey
WOMAN:
He is the only white man who covered every acre
I think I'll try and make her
ALL:
Hooray, hooray, hooray
He put all his reliance in courage and defiance
And risked his life for science
Hey, hey
ALL:
Hooray for Captain Spaulding the African explorer
He brought his name undying fame
And that is why we say hooray, hooray, hooray
My friends, I'm highly gratified at this magnificent display of effusion.
And I want you to know...
ALL: (SINGING) Hooray for Captain Spaulding the African explorer
He brought his name undying fame And that is why we say
Hooray, hooray, hooray
My friends, I'm highly gratified at this magnificent display of effusion.
And I want you to know...
ALL: (SINGING) Hooray for Captain Spaulding the African explorer
He brought his name undying fame And that is why we say
Hooray, hooray, hooray
My friends, I'm highly gratified at this magnificent display of effusion.
I want you to know... (SINGING) Hooray for Captain Spaulding the African explorer
Well, somebody's got to do it!
Captain Spaulding?
It is indeed a great honor to welcome you to my poor home.
Oh, it isn't so bad.
Needless to say...
Wait a minute, I think you're right.
It is pretty bad.
As a matter of fact, it's one of the frowsiest looking joints I've ever seen.
Why, Captain...
Where did you get your wallpaper?
You're letting this place run down, and what's the result?
You're not getting the class of people that you used to.
Why, you've got people here that look like you!
Now, I'll tell you what to do.
We'll put up a sign outside, "Place under new management."
We'll set up a 75-cent meal that will knock their eyes out.
After we knock their eyes out, we can charge them anything we want.
Now sign here and give me your check for $1,500.
I want to tell you, madam, with this insurance policy, you've provided for your little ones and for your old age...
Which will be here in a couple of weeks now, if I'm any judge of horseflesh.
And now, madam, "I feel that the time has come," the walrus...
Captain Spaulding!
Captain Spaulding!
You stand before me as one of the bravest men of all times.
All right, I'll do that.
In the dark forests of Africa, there has been no danger you have not dared.
You mind if I don't smoke?
Fearlessly, you have blazed new trails, scornful of the lion's roar and the cannibal's tom-tom.
Says you!
Never once in all those weary months did your footsteps falter.
Cowardice is unknown to you.
Fear is not in you!
Oh, pardon me, a caterpillar...
(SCREAMS)
(ALL GASP) Put him over here.
Oh, it must have been the caterpillar that frightened him.
Oh, dear.
This is unfortunate.
Don't stand there.
Get the whiskey!
Get the whiskey.
The whiskey?
The whiskey?
Where is the whiskey?
It's in my little black bag in the right-hand corner.
(FANFARE PLAYING)
Signor Emanuel Ravelli.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Where's the dining room?
I'm surprised.
Say, I used to know a fellow who looked exactly like you, by the name of, uh, Emanuel Ravelli.
Are you his brother?
I am Emanuel Ravelli.
You're Emanuel Ravelli?
I'm Emanuel Ravelli.
Well, no wonder you look like him, but I insist there is a resemblance.
(LAUGHS) Hey, he thinks I look alike.
Well, If you do, it's a tough break for both of you.
You are one of the musicians, but you were not due until tomorrow.
Couldn't come tomorrow.
That's too quick.
So, you're lucky they didn't come yesterday.
We were busy yesterday, but we charge just the same.
This is better than exploring.
What do you fellows get an hour?
Oh, for playing, we get a $10 an hour.
I see.
What do you get for not playing?
$12 an hour.
Well, clip me off a piece of that.
Now, for rehearsing, we make special rate, that's $15 an hour.
That's for rehearsing?
Yes, that's for rehearsing.
And what do you get for not rehearsing?
You couldn't afford it.
(CHUCKLES) You see, If we don't rehearse, we don't play.
And If we don't play...
(SNAPS) That runs into money.
How much will you want to run into an open manhole?
Just the cover charge.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Drop in sometime.
Sewer.
Oh, we cleaned that up pretty well.
Well, let's see how we stand.
Flat-footed.
Yesterday we didn't come.
You remember, yesterday we didn't come.
Oh, I remember.
Yeah, that's $300.
Yesterday you didn't come.
That's $300?
That's $300.
That's reasonable.
I can see that, all right.
Now, today we did come.
That's, uh...
That's $100 you owe us.
Hey, I bet I'm gonna lose on the deal.
Tomorrow we leave.
That's worth about...
A million dollars.
Yeah, that's all right for me, but I got a partner.
What?
Partner?
The Professor!
The gates swung open and a Fig Newton entered.
How do you do?
(HORN HONKS)
Goodness!
You haven't got chocolate, have you?
RAVELLI: (LAUGHS) He's got everything.
Hives, take the Professor's hat and coat.
And send for the fumigators.
Oh, my goodness!
Bonjour!
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Hey, don't you see.
There are ladies present.
What do you think this is?
Put that hat down.
Will you?
What you do there?
Get out.
MRS. RITTENHOUSE:
Don't go near those guns!
(ALL SCREAMING)
(GUNSHOT)
(COCKS GUN)
(CHIRPING)
(BIRD CHIRPING CONTINUES)
(CHIRPING CONTINUES)
(HONKS SADLY)
(GUN CLOCKS)
(GLASS SHATTERS)
(FIRES GUN)
(FIFE AND DRUM PLAYING)
A little more to the right.
Ah-ah, that's better.
Now, see that the drape is well-hung.
The mistress will inspect it before the unveiling.
Hello, Hives!
Mrs. Whitehead, this is a surprise.
And how about me?
Miss Grace, you've grown so in the last year.
You haven't lost any weight, yourself.
(LAUGHS)
No.
Unfortunately not.
You know, Hives, it seems strange to find you working here instead of in our own home.
Well, after you left for Europe,
Mrs. Rittenhouse was good enough to make me an offer.
Lovely!
Oh, by the way, Hives, what's the secret about the painting?
No secret.
It's Beaugard's After the Hunt.
The original?
Most original.
Be careful!
Where did she get hold of that, do you suppose?
Is it very valuable?
Is it?
It must be worth a fortune.
But sis, it looks as if we yield the social honors of the season to Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Well, isn't there something we can do?
We might shoot ourselves.
I'd rather shoot Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Say, I have an idea.
I copied that painting in art school a year ago.
Well, what of it?
(WHISPERS INAUDIBLY)
But, I still don't get it.
I'll go home and get the copy.
We'll substitute it for the original.
And when she unveils it, what'll she have?
An imitation, and I must admit, a very poor one.
Grace, you're wonderful.
That's what I've been telling you.
I won't be long.
All right.
See you later.
Oh, Hives?
Do you still feel there's a strong bond between us?
Why most certainly, Mrs. Whitehead.
Strong enough for you to do me a big favor?
Why, anything at all.
Well, suppose I were to ask you to take away the Beaugard?
What?
You mean...
Oh, just temporarily, of course.
And substitute something of my own.
Well, I should consider it rather an unusual request.
It is, Hives.
But somehow I still think of you as one of the Whiteheads.
(SIGHS) You may count on me.
My soul is yours.
Even though my body may belong to Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Why, Hives?
(LAUGHS)
Oh, Mrs. Whitehead.
Arabella!
May I present, Mr. Parker?
Oh, of the Massachusetts Parkers?
Why, no.
Oh, then the southern Parkers?
Oh, no!
The central Parkers.
You know, the, uh, benches and trees.
I see!
(MEOWS)
Oh!
I don't like that woman.
Well, never mind.
You come over here and sit down and tell me whom you do like.
Oh!
So, that's your game.
Now, listen, do you really love me?
Why don't you marry me and find out.
Marry you?
Ha!
On what?
Hmm.
Last year, I sold two paintings.
One at $100 and one at $50.
Could we live on $150 a year?
Oh, we wouldn't need any money!
I've got a charge account in every shop on 5th Avenue.
Well, if I had any brains,
I'd give up painting and get a regular job.
You know, I had a cousin who made $50,000 on Wall Street last year.
Oh, I don't want to marry your cousin.
I'm a darn fool.
I want to marry you.
Say, why don't we get that old bluff, Chandler, to buy a portrait from you?
Chandler?
Ha!
What does he know about art?
Well, the less he knows, the easier it will be for you to sell him.
They're right upstairs.
You can't miss them.
Go around to the other side.
Mrs. Rittenhouse?
Yoo-hoo!
MRS. RITTENHOUSE:
Oh, Captain Spaulding, how are you?
Tell me, are you alone?
Captain, I don't understand.
What?
You don't understand being alone?
Don't give me that innocent stuff or you'll be alone!
A big cluck like you turning cute on me!
Mrs. Rittenhouse?
Yes?
Oh, pardon me.
You've been affected like this yourself, haven't you?
(LAUGHS) Oh, no, Captain.
Well, you will be.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, ever since I met you,
I've swept you off my feet.
Something has been throbbing within me.
Oh, it's been beating like the incessant tom-tom in the primitive jungle.
There's something that I must ask you.
What is it, Captain?
Would you wash out a pair of socks for me?
Captain, I'm surprised.
Well, that maybe surprise you, but it's been on my mind for weeks.
It's just my way of telling you that I love you.
That's all.
I love you.
I...
Captain...
Mrs. Whitehead.
I beg your pardon.
I beg your pardon.
Am I intruding?
Are you intruding?
Just when I had her on the five-yard line.
I should say you are intruding!
I should say you are intruding!
Pardon me,
I was using the subjunctive instead of the past tense.
Yes, we're way past tents.
We're living in bungalows now.
This is a mechanical age, of course.
Mrs. Whitehead, you haven't met Captain Spaulding, have you?
Why, no.
I haven't.
How are you?
How are you?
I'm fine, thank you.
And how are you?
And how are you?
That leaves you one up.
Did anyone ever tell you you had beautiful eyes?
No.
Well, you have.
And so have you!
He shot her a glance.
As a smile played around his lips.
Yes.
I don't think I've ever seen four more beautiful eyes in my life.
Well, three, anyway.
You know, you two girls have everything.
You're tall and short, and slim and stout, blonde and brunette, and that's just the kind of a girl I crave!
We three would make an ideal couple.
Why, you've got beauty, charm, money.
You have that money, haven't you?
Because, if you haven't, we can quit right now.
The Captain is charming, isn't he?
I'm fascinated.
I'm fascinated, too.
Right on the arm.
Fascinated.
Whim-wham.
If I were Eugene O'Neill, I could tell you what I really think of you two.
You know, you're very fortunate the theater guild isn't putting this on.
And so is the guild.
Pardon me while I have a strange interlude.
Why, you couple of baboons, what makes you think I'd marry either one of you?
Strange how the wind blows tonight.
It has a thin, eerie voice.
Reminds me of poor old Marsden.
How happy I could be with either of these two if both of them just went away.
Well, what do you say, girls?
What do you say?
Will you marry me?
But, Captain, which one of us?
Both of you.
Let's all get married.
This is my party.
Party.
Party.
Here I am talking of parties.
I came down here for a party.
What happens?
Nothing.
Not even ice cream.
The gods look down and laugh.
This would be a better world for children if the parents had to eat the spinach.
Well, what do you say, girls?
What do you say?
Are we all going to get married?
All of us?
All of us!
But that's bigamy.
Yes, and it's big of me, too!
It's big of all of us.
Let's be big for a change.
I'm sick of these conventional marriages.
One woman and one man was good enough for your grandmother, but who wants to marry your grandmother?
Nobody.
Not even your grandfather.
Think of the honeymoon, strictly private.
I wouldn't let another woman in on this.
Well, maybe one or two, but no men.
I may not go, myself.
Are you suggesting companionate marriage?
Well, it's got advantages.
You could live with your folks, and I could live with your folks.
And you, you could sell Fuller Brushes.
Living with your folks.
Living with your folks, the beginning of the end.
Drab dead yesterdays shutting out beautiful tomorrows.
Hideous stumbling footsteps creaking along the misty corridors of time.
In those corridors, I see figures, strange figures, weird figures.
Steel 186, anaconda 74,
American Can 138.
Well, let's see.
Where were we?
Oh, yes!
We were about to get married.
Well, what do you think?
Do you think we really ought to get married?
I think marriage is a very noble institution.
(MIMICS HORSE WHINNY)
It's the foundation of the American home.
Yes, but the trouble is you can't enforce it.
It was put over on the American people...
While our boys were over there... (GALS GIGGLING) ...and while our girls were over here.
You know that I've been waiting at the bottom of these stairs for years for just such a moment as this.
Why, Captain, where are you going?
I'm sorry, ladies, I'm sorry,
But, uh, I'm afraid we're gonna have to postpone the wedding for a few days, maybe for a few years.
Before I get married, I'm going to sow a couple of wild oats.
(ALL LAUGHING)
The Captain's so amusing.
Isn't he charming?
So that's the famous Beaugard, eh?
It's a great picture, isn't it?
Oh, you've seen it before?
Seen it?
I spent three days in Paris copying it.
You did?
Well, me and a million other young artists.
Oh.
I bet your copy was better than any of them.
Well, it wasn't bad at that.
(LAUGHS)
I'll show it to you sometime.
Listen.
What?
Mother's going to unveil it tonight.
Yeah.
Suppose...
Suppose when she unveils it, it's not the Beaugard at all?
Suppose it's yours!
You mean, put my copy in place of the Beaugard?
Exactly.
Well, Arabella, you're crazy.
What good would that do?
What good?
Listen.
They'll unveil it.
Chandler will tell everybody how fine it is.
They'll all cheer their heads off, and then we'll tell them who really painted it.
They'll say, you're a great artist.
You'll get six commissions for paintings, and we can be married and divorced in no time.
Well, that sounds great.
But what if they don't like my painting?
What then?
Well, isn't the chance worth taking?
Ah, I see you're admiring my picture.
Yes, yes.
Your picture?
Yes, my picture.
Well, it don't look like you.
Hey, wait, wait.
Someplace I met you before, because you're face is a very familiar.
Well, after all, I'm one of the most well-known men in America.
The newspapers will keep on running my photograph.
You're not Abe Kabbible?
Oh, nonsense!
All right.
Hey, wait.
If you're not Abe Kabbible, who are you?
Now, please.
Chandler is my name, Roscoe W. Chandler.
Yeah, but I don't care about the name, you see.
Someplace I met you before, because your face is very familiar.
Now, wait.
Let me see,
Were you ever in Sing Sing?
Please!
No, no, Sing.
I got it.
I got it.
Joliet?
Leave me alone!
No?
All right, don't run away.
Don't run away.
Leavenworth?
Oh, listen here, I have never been in these places.
I spend most of my time in Europe.
Europe.
I got it now.
I know.
You come from Czechoslovakia.
You are wrong, I tell you...
You come from...
Hey, hey, come here, come here.
I tell you...
Please get away from me.
Hey, you remember him.
Who was he?
He comes from Czechoslovakia.
You are wrong, I tell you.
I told you before, you are mistaken.
He comes from Czechoslovakia, and I know who it is.
That's Abie the fish peddler from Czechoslovakia.
Ridiculous, I tell you.
You are wrong.
Wait, wait, wait.
We prove it.
He had a birthmark.
Remember?
Oh, please!
What are you...
Leave me alone.
On the arm.
On the arm.
On the leg.
On the foot, up here, on the mustache.
Ah-ha!
There it is.
There is the birthmark.
Abie the fish man.
I confess.
I was, I was Abie the peddler.
Well, how did you get to be Roscoe W. Chandler?
Say, how did you get to be an Italian?
Never mind.
Whose confession is this?
Well, boys, for heaven's sake, don't say about this to anybody, and I think we can come to some agreement.
Some arrangement which would be, uh, mutually satisfactory.
Money, money.
Yeah.
Shall we say, uh, $500?
Piker!
$500.
Well, that is all the cash I have.
$500?
Well, all right.
I tell you what we do.
We'll take your I.O.U.
I've given you my best offer and that is all you will get.
That's all you give?
Yes.
(SINGING) Abie the fish man Abie the fish man (WHISTLING)
Abie the fish man Abie the fish man
Please be quiet, quiet!
Please.
Now, come here.
Now, listen here.
I have here a check for $5,000.
Now, I give it to you.
Yeah?
Hey.
Is it good?
Well, of course it is good.
Who would give me a bad check?
I would.
Hey, see if it's good.
(WHISTLES)
All right, if you don't want the check, then that is all you will get.
That's all we get?
Yeah.
(SINGING) Abie the fish man Abie the fish man Please, quiet!
Abie the fish man Abie the fish man Quiet!
Abie the fish man
Here!
Give me that handkerchief.
My tie!
Where is my tie?
I...
You're nothing but a pair of thieves.
That's all.
(LAUGHS)
I get a the tie.
Well, what do you got?
The birthmark!
(LAUGHS)
Hey, hey, where's your tie?
Well, I...
That's a fine way for a millionaire to be running around, open at the neck.
Have you got garters?
Of course, I have garters.
Here.
Oh!
They've taken my garters, too!
A likely story.
Turning collegiate on me, eh?
Have you got socks?
Certainly.
Here they are.
Oh, yeah.
You have got socks.
They look pretty old to me, too.
Whose are they?
My old socks.
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Spaulding, Captain Spaulding.
I am Roscoe W. Chandler.
Well, this is a treat, your treat.
You have heard about me?
Yes, I've heard about you for a great many years, Mr. Chandler, and I'm getting pretty darn sick of it, too.
Quite naturally, I've also heard of the great Captain Spaulding.
Well, that's fine.
I've heard of you and you've heard of me.
Now, have you ever heard the one about the two Irishmen?
Oh, yes!
(LAUGHS)
Now that I've got you in hysterics, let's get to business.
My name is Spaulding, Captain Spaulding.
I am Roscoe W. Chandler.
And I'm Geoffrey T. Spaulding.
I bet you don't know what the "T" stands for.
Uh, Thomas?
Edgar.
You were close, though.
You were close, though, and you still are, I'll bet.
Now, this is what I want to talk to you about, Mr. Chandler.
How would you like to finance a scientific expedition?
Well, that is a question.
Yes that is a question.
You certainly know a question when you see it.
I congratulate you, Mr. Chandler, and that brings us right back to where we were.
How would you like to finance a scientific expedition?
Well, is there any particular kind of an expedition you had in mind?
Well, I tell you.
I'm getting along in years now.
There's one thing I always wanted to do before I quit.
What is that?
Retire.
Now would you be interested in a proposition of that kind?
You know, I've always had an idea that my retirement would be the greatest contribution to science the world has ever known.
This is your chance, Mr. Chandler.
When I think what you have done for this country...
And by the way, what have you done for this country?
Oh, well.
I've always tried to do what I could, especially in the world of art.
Art?
Well, I don't know how we drifted around that.
But what is your opinion of art?
I am very glad you asked me!
I withdraw the question.
This fellow takes things seriously.
It isn't safe to ask him a simple question.
Tell me Mr. Chandler, where are you planning on putting your new opera house?
Oh, I thought I should put it somewhere near Central Park.
I see.
Why don't you put it right in Central Park?
Could we do that?
Sure.
Do it at night when no one is looking.
Why don't you put it in the reservoir and get the whole thing over with?
Of course, that might interfere with the water supply.
But after all, we must remember that art is art.
Still, on the other hand, water is water, isn't it?
And east is east, and west is west.
And If you take cranberries and stew them like applesauce, it tastes more like prunes than rhubarb does.
Now, uh, now, you tell me what you know.
Well, I would be very glad to give you my opinion.
Well, that's dandy.
I'll ask you for them someday.
Remind me, will you?
I'll tell you what, could you come to my office at 10:00 tomorrow morning?
If I'm not there, ask for Mr. Jamison, that's my secretary, and If he sees you, I'll discharge him.
That's a date, now.
Saturday at 3:00.
No, you better make it Tuesday, I'm going to Europe Monday.
Pardon me.
My name is Spaulding.
I've always wanted to meet you, Mr. Chandler.
Tell me.
What do you think of the traffic problem?
What do you think of the marriage problem?
What do you think of at night when you go to bed, you beast?
Well, I'll tell you...
I'd rather not discuss it any further.
Remember, there are children present.
Well, you see, my dear Captain, in the last analysis, it is a question of money.
The nickel today is not what it used to be 10 years ago.
I'll go further than that.
I'll get off at the depot.
The nickel is not what it was 15 years ago.
You know what this country needs today?
What?
A seven-cent nickel.
Yes, sir.
We've been using the five-cent nickel in this country since 1492.
Now, that's pretty near 100 years, daylight saving.
Now, why not give the seven-cent nickel a chance?
If that works out, next year we could have an eight-cent nickel.
Think what that would mean.
You could go to a newsstand buy a three-cent newspaper and get the same nickel back.
One nickel, carefully used, would last a family a lifetime.
Captain Spaulding, I think that is a wonderful idea.
You do, eh?
Yes.
Then there can't be much to it.
Forget about it.
Well, uh...
Well, tell me, Captain Chandler, uh, excuse me, Spaulding.
Spaulding, Spaulding, that's right.
Yeah.
I'm Spaulding, you're Chandler.
Let's have no more of that either, eh?
It's bad enough being Spaulding.
Well, tell me, Captain Spaulding,
Spaulding is the name?
That's right.
That's right.
I'm, I'm Chan...
I'm Spaulding...
Spaulding...
Could I look at a program a minute?
I might be the "News Weekly," for all he knows, or "Coming Next Week."
Well, tell me, Captain Spaulding, you've been quite a traveler.
Uh, what do you think about South America?
I'm going there soon, you know.
Is that so?
Where are you going?
Uruguay.
Well, you go Uruguay and I'll go mine.
Say, how long has this been going on?
Let's change the subject.
Take the foreign situation.
Take Abyssinia.
I'll tell you, you take Abyssinia, and I'll take a hot butterscotch sundae on rye bread.
Let's go and see what the boys in the back room will have.
But, my...
Let's see how yours compares with the original.
All right, let's.
Oh!
I don't see any difference.
Well, look closer.
Maybe, you'll find it's better.
Oh, you!
(CHUCKLES)
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
(HONKING HORN)
You seen my partner?
No.
Oh, yoo-hoo.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
Oh, Mr. Ravioli.
Ravelli, Ravelli.
Oh, Mr. Ravelli.
I want you to do something for me.
I do anything for you.
What do you want, I should do?
You see that painting?
You mean, this picture?
I want you to take that out of the frame and put this one in its place.
You want I should take this one down and put this one upstairs.
Yes, that's it.
You want I should steal!
Oh, no, no!
It's not stealing.
Well, then, I couldn't do it.
Oh, Mr. Ravioli!
Oh, no, no, no.
(HONKING HORN)
Hey, get up, get up.
Come here.
That's all you do, chase the women.
Go.
Aw, stop!
Everybody here plays cards.
They don't ask us.
We are a waste all the time.
We been here all day.
How much a we make?
We make a nothing.
First thing you know, we gonna live on a charity, then go to the old ladies' home.
How do you like that?
No, no.
That's a no good!
These people here all got a money.
Now, we gotta get someone to play with us, see.
I play anything.
Oh, Signor Ravelli,
I want to speak to you about the music.
Yeah.
How do you do?
What's the matter with you?
I thought, it would be nice...
Go away from me.
What is this?
That's all right.
Just a...
Oh, there you are.
My, dear...
Hello, Professor.
Good heavens.
What's the matter with his feet?
This is embarrassing.
That's nothing.
Why, we play all kinds of games.
We play blackjack, soccer...
Oh!
Dear, I'm so sorry!
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
(ALL CLAMORING)
Mrs. Whitehead...
What is the matter with him?
I wouldn't have had this happen for the world.
Oh!
Heavens!
Come on!
Atta boy!
Go away from me!
(GASPS)
One...
Two...
Three.
(BELL TOLLS) Atta boy.
Atta boy.
Good heavens.
Oh, dear.
MRS. RITTENHOUSE:
I must, get them out.
I must get them out of here!
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
Oh, look.
You see how terrible he looks!
Look.
I'm so frightened.
Look, what can I do?
I don't know.
I better get Hives.
No, let me get her.
Well, you go, then.
I'm just trying to watch my... (BELL TOLLS)
Oh, oh.
Oh, this is terrible.
(SHOUTS) She can't take it there.
(SHOUTS) You better get Hives.
(SHOUTS) Go away from me!
This is dreadful.
Well, why don't you leave him alone?
Stop!
Now that this game is over, how about playing bridge?
You play bridge?
I play bridge a little.
What do you play for?
Oh, we just play for small stakes.
And French fried potatoes?
Set it up over there, Hives.
HIVES:
Very good, madam.
MRS. RITTENHOUSE:
What in the world is he up to?
Look at this.
The whole house will be torn to pieces.
Absolutely.
If it isn't one thing, it's another.
Oh, Hives!
Oh!
Take it away, Hives.
Extraordinary.
We'll play over here.
Now, how do you want to play?
Honest?
Well, I hope so.
You put that right away.
It's your own fault.
Come along now.
We'll cut for partners.
Oh, he's my partner.
That's the only way we play.
I'm sorry but it's against the rules of the games.
We have to cut for partners.
All right.
We cut for partners.
I got ace of spades.
He's got ace of spades.
(LAUGHS)
That's what you call "quin-cidences."
Two aces of spaces?
Yeah, he's got thousands of them.
Well, I suppose that gives him the choice of seats.
You have the choice of seats.
Good heavens!
Not on her lap.
Come on!
Sit down.
What's the matter with him?
I don't know.
He thought it was contact bridge.
Just a minute now.
Shuffle the cards.
Yeah.
You got to scrumble them up a bit.
You know.
(KNOCKS)
Just a moment.
I'd like to cut those cards.
(CHUCKLES)
That's a better.
(LAUGHS)
Uh, your bid, partner.
You pass?
Misdeal.
You pass?
I bid one spade.
I pass.
Three spades.
Four spades.
One club.
I don't understand this kind of bidding!
Well, you don't have to understand.
You bid four spades, huh?
Why, I haven't a spade in my hand!
All right.
We double.
There's something wrong here.
I want you to go over the bidding.
Hey, she wants to start them up again, the bidding.
He bids one.
One?
One what?
That's all right.
You find out.
But we have to know what he's bidding.
We tell you later.
Now I bid two.
Two what?
Uh, two of the same he bids.
Now, the bidding's over.
See, that's enough bidding.
Uh, it's your lead.
Oh, no, you can't lead that.
(CHUCKLES)
Why not?
Why, we can't take it.
Well, what should I lead?
Ace.
Ace of spades.
That's very good.
Three of spades, four of spades...
You trump it?
(LAUGHS)
Uh, that's what you call a finesse.
Oh!
No spades, partner.
No spades!
Ace of hearts.
Ace of clubs.
Dummy leads.
The dummy leads.
I'm not the dummy!
Well, you could be.
Ace of diamonds.
100 aces, huh?
200?
That's better.
Ace of hearts.
Atta boy, make a big slam.
Make a big, big slam!
Ace of spades.
Ace of spades.
(LAUGHS)
That's a good.
He plays a good game.
Ace of spades.
He plays a fine game, all right.
Ace of...
I refuse to play any longer.
You're nothing but a couple of card sharps.
Good heavens!
What's the matter, dear?
My shoes are gone!
Good gracious.
He has your slippers.
Come along, come along.
(LAUGHS)
Hey, you take a the lady's shoes, huh?
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
(CLANGING)
(SHUSHES)
(SHUSHES) Hey.
Quiet.
Quiet, quiet.
(BANGING) Hide!
Hide!
Somebody's coming.
All right.
I make a mistake.
Get up, get up.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Come.
Hey, hurry up.
Come here.
You know what we gotta do, eh?
We gotta take a that picture out and put this one upstairs for the lady.
Wait!
No touch.
You got everything ready, huh?
The shovel, the ax, the dynamite, the pineapples?
Where's the flash?
(SPEAKING ITALIAN) That's a no flash.
A flash.
There's a flash.
Flash.
That's a flash.
A flash.
Yeah, that's a flash.
That's a fish!
I no want a fish.
No fish.
Flash.
Aw, stop it.
You act crazy.
When you go out in the night time, you gotta have a the flash.
Ha!
That's a no flash.
That's a flask.
Flash.
When you wanna see somebody, you gotta have a the flash.
That's a flush.
What I gonna do with a flush?
A flash.
No flit.
It's a flits.
What am I gonna do with a flits?
What do you got?
(PLAYING FLUTE)
That's whatcha call a flutes.
All you got is a fish, a flutes, a flits, flutes, flits and a flutes.
(PLAYING FLUTE)
Stop this!
Where's the flash?
Look, when everything is a light...
And you wanna make them a dark, what do you do?
Ah!
You're crazy.
I don't want no blackjack.
That's a my mistake, I guess.
When everything is dark, and you wanna make them light...
Yeah, that's a flash.
That's a flash.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
(WHISTLES)
RAVELLI:
Hey, that's a good, all right.
The storm put the lights out.
Now, nobody can see what we do.
That's a fine.
Where is the flash?
Where's the flash?
I no want the fish!
The flash!
(PLAYING FLUTE) No, no flute!
No, flute!
What's the matter with you, eh?
Flash.
Before the people come, get a the flash.
What's the matter?
You lose it?
Well, you gotta find it.
Look for it.
All right, all right.
Never mind.
Come on.
We'll work without it.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
MAN:
Yes, madam.
RAVELLI:
Hide!
Hide!
Somebody's coming.
(PLAYS FLUTE SHRILLY) Hide, hide, hide.
Quiet!
Shut up!
Quiet.
Shut up.
Be quiet.
I know where you are.
It's all right.
MRS. RITTENHOUSE:
Oh, Captain Spaulding?
Captain Spaulding, where are you?
SPAULDING:
Here.
Yes, what's the trouble?
The storm has put the lights out, and you can't see your hand before your face.
SPAULDING:
You wouldn't get much enjoyment out of that.
I don't know what you're gonna do, but I'm gonna take a nap.
Leave me a call for 3:00.
(RAVELLI MIMICS CUCKOO CLOCK)
Make it 3:30.
(CUCKOOS)
You certainly get service around here.
Pardon me, Mrs. Rittenhouse, did you lose a fish?
MRS. RITTENHOUSE:
What?
Well, somebody lost it.
Will you take it out in the kitchen and have it fried for me?
(CLANKING) MRS. RITTENHOUSE:
Did you hear that?
There's somebody over there.
I say, there's somebody over there!
SPAULDING:
Don't be silly.
The house is just settling.
That's all.
Anybody over there?
RAVELLI:
I don't see anybody.
There you are.
If there's anybody there, we'd see him, wouldn't I?
(CLANKING)
MRS. RITTENHOUSE:
Oh, what is it?
Captain, what is it?
SPAULDING:
You know, what I think?
I think you got roaches.
(CLANKING)
(SQUAWKING)
Yes, you got roaches, all right.
And the biggest one has got asthma.
Oh, this is terrible.
Captain, let's get out of here.
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
RAVELLI:
We get a the picture.
We don't make one sound.
Hey!
Somebody put on the lights.
All right.
We get a the picture.
We don't make one sound.
Come on.
Let's go.
Get out of here.
(WHISTLING) What do you want?
Oh, the fish.
Come on, come on.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
Oh!
That's some storm, huh?
That's a regular tomato.
Come on.
Let's go this way.
I think it's a shortcut.
Come on, let's go.
(BIRDS CHIRPING) (LAUGHS) California!
Oh, Captain, how thrilling.
And then what happened?
It was nothing at all.
I'd rather not discuss it.
But I can't wait to hear the finish.
I must hear it.
Well, there I was.
There I was in the top of the tree with this rhinoceros pointing his gun straight at me.
A rhinoceros?
Yes.
Captain, what did you do?
What could I do?
I had to marry his daughter.
What kind of a story do you call that?
All right, you tell one.
And now, my friends, before we start the musical program,
Captain Spaulding has kindly consented to tell us about his trip to Africa.
Captain Spaulding.
Me?
My friends, I'm going to tell you of that great mysterious, wonderful continent known as Africa.
Africa is God's country, and he can have it.
Well, sir.
We left New York drunk and early on the morning of February 2.
After 15 days on the water and six on the boat, we finally arrived on the shores of Africa.
We once proceeded 300 miles into the heart of the jungle, where I shot a polar bear.
This bear was 6' 7" in his stocking feet and had shoes on...
Pardon me, just a moment, Captain.
Just a moment.
I always thought that polar bears lived in the frozen north.
Oh, you did.
Well, this bear was anemic, and he couldn't stand the cold climate.
He was a rich bear and could afford to go away in the winter.
You take care of your animals and I'll take care of mine!
Frozen north, my eye.
From the day of our arrival, we led an active life.
The first morning saw us up at 6:00, breakfasted and back in bed at 7:00.
This was our routine for the first three months.
We finally got so we were back in bed at 6:30.
One morning, I was sitting in front of the cabin, smoking some meat.
Smoking some meat?
Yes, there wasn't a cigar store in the neighborhood.
As I say, I was sitting in front of the cabin when I bagged six tigers.
Oh, Captain!
Six of them biggest I...
Captain, did you catch six tigers?
I bagged them.
I...
I bagged them to go away, but they hung around all afternoon.
They were the most persistent tigers I've ever seen.
The principal animals inhabiting the African jungle are moose, elks and Knights of Pythias.
Of course, you all know what a moose is.
That's big game.
The first day I shot two bucks.
That was the biggest game we had.
As I say, you all know what a moose is.
A moose runs around on the floor and eats cheese and is chased by the cats.
The elks, on the other hand, live up in the hills.
And in the spring, they come down for their annual convention.
It is interesting to watch them come to the water hole.
And you should see them run when they find it's only a water hole!
What they're looking for is an elk-a-hole.
One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas.
How he got in my pajamas, I don't know.
Then we tried to remove the tusks.
The tusks.
That's not so easy to say.
Tusks.
You try that sometime.
Tusks.
Oh, simple.
Tusks.
Pardon me, my name is Spaulding.
I've always wanted to meet you, Mr. Chandler.
As I say, we tried to remove the tusks.
But they were embedded in so firmly that we couldn't bust them.
Of course, in Alabama, the Tuscaloosa.
But, uh, that's entirely irr-elephant to what I was talking about.
We took some pictures of the native girls, but they weren't developed.
But we're going back again in a couple of weeks.
I will...
A very enlightening speech, Captain.
Very enlightening.
Hooray for Captain Spaulding!
Three cheers for Captain Spaulding!
Aw.
Oh, really I...
Three cheers for Captain Spaulding!
Three cheers...
No one asked for the chairs!
Put them right where you found them.
Now, go now.
Go now.
Go on, go on!
Go on with your chairs.
Get out!
Go on, go on, go on, you.
And, now, friends,
Signor Ravelli will oblige us at the piano.
Signor Ravelli.
Signor Ravelli's first selection will be
Somewhere My Love Lies Sleeping With a Male Chorus.
(PLAYING)
(QUIETLY) One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
17, 18, 19, 20... (REPEATS MELODY)
Say, if you get near a song, play it.
(REPEATS MELODY)
I can't think of the finish.
That's strange.
And I can't think of anything else.
You know what I think?
I think I went past it.
I mean, if you come around again, jump off.
I once kept this up for three days.
You wouldn't consider hush money, would you?
I can't get him now, I've got to wait for inspiration.
It's about time.
Play the song about Montreal.
Montreal?
I'm a Dreamer, Montreal.
I don't know that.
I'll tell you what I do.
I play one of my own compositions by Victor Herbert.
Make it short.
He plays them both well.
Atta boy.
(INDISCERNIBLE)
The old red team scored that time.
(LAUGHS)
So did the old blue one.
Why do you push, huh?
Why do you push?
Oh, please, stop them.
Let them alone.
They may exterminate each other.
Come on, come on!
The best thing that can happen for either of them.
(SPEAKING MOCK ITALIAN) And once for old Purdue.
(PLAYS FIRST MELODY)
I was afraid of that.
Hey, I thought I had the finish.
I wish you did.
Yours.
Play the song about the Irish chiropodist.
Irish chiropodist?
My Fate is in Your Hands.
(PLAYS 1812 OVERTURE)
(SINGING GIBBERISH)
Is there a horse in the house?
They've got everything else here.
And, uh, now, Mrs. Rittenrotten...
Uh, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Yes, a slight error.
I have a little surprise for you!
The man is here for the piano.
Oh, Captain.
No, really.
What I meant to say was that, uh...
When I departed from the natives in Africa, I was presented with a gift.
And this gift I'm going to give to you at a very low figure.
Oh, how wonderful, Captain!
Well, no.
Don't be too hasty.
Oh, I just...
This is all hand-painted.
The whole thing was done with the white of an egg.
Well, what is it, Captain?
What is it?
"What is it?" you ask.
This is a hope chest for a guinea pig.
Oh.
What is it?
This magnificent chest...
No, this...
No, this magnificent chest,
I now take great pleasure in presenting to you with my compliments.
Captain, this leaves me speechless.
Well, see that you remain that way.
And, now, ladies and gentlemen...
Come outside and say that.
If we will all adjourn to the library,
Mrs. Rittenhouse has another, and perhaps greater, surprise for us.
Hmm.
This way, Captain.
SPAULDING:
Mrs. Rittenhouse, how do you pay Hives?
By the week or by the pound?
(INDISTINCT)
(CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)
And now, it is my privilege to reveal the masterpiece of Francois Jacques Dubois Gilbert Beaugard.
(DRAMATICALLY)
(MIMICKING AN ANNOUNCER) No trains will be sold after the magazines leave the depot.
After the Hunt.
There!
I told you you were a great artist.
Shall we spill the beans now?
Let's wait a minute.
Something might happen.
Now, I'm sure, we'd all appreciate a few words from Mr. Chandler, who will tell us of the life and work of the artist, Beaugard.
And keep it clean.
Mr. Chandler.
(ALL CLAPPING)
(CLEARS THROAT)
My friends,
I am quite sure that you are all familiar with Beaugard, and this is perhaps his masterpiece.
In it, he has achieved the greatness in the handling of color and line.
Now, you will see here that I...
Wait!
This is not my picture.
This is a rank imitation!
What do you mean, Mr. Chandler?
Well, here, see for yourself!
You are right.
It is not the Beaugard.
It certainly isn't.
There's a dog missing!
Oh, Captain Spaulding, what shall I do?
Telephone the dog catchers immediately!
They have taken the original and left me this.
Leave it to me.
I'll throw some light on this subject.
MAN:
Has anyone a match?
WOMAN:
What's wrong?
MRS. RITTENHOUSE:
Hives, Hives, where are you?
Turn on the lights.
SPAULDING:
Mrs. Rittenhouse, did you lose that fish again?
MRS. RITTENHOUSE:
Oh, Captain, I'm so worried.
Good heavens!
That one is gone, too!
Oh, this is awful.
The crooks!
The crooks!
They are escaping.
Follow me, men!
Never mind the men, just the women.
Oh, Captain.
Captain!
MRS. RITTENHOUSE:
Captain!
Come on.
Right this way.
He went out here someplace.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Excitement.
I never saw anything so funny in all my life.
It was great, and there goes her old party.
Good old Hives.
Wasn't it funny?
(STUTTERS) Oh, very.
Why, you're not afraid, are you, Hives?
Oh, no, I'm not afraid.
Oh, dear, no.
Only, you see, well, they were talking of having the police here.
And I wouldn't want the police to suspect me.
Why, they wouldn't suspect you.
Oh, yes, they would.
You see, the last time they suspected me,
I got four years.
(BOTH GASP) Hives!
All right, Hives.
Give me the painting and I'll take care of it.
Good.
Come.
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY) (WOOD CREAKING)
(SHUSHING) (CHUCKLING)
Good heavens!
It's gone!
Gone?
I left it in there.
There?
There must be thieves at this party.
Oh, God!
If I'd known that, I never would have come.
Wait a minute.
That professor.
The professor!
I see!
Hives, that's the fellow in the woodpile.
Now, listen.
We've got to get that picture away from him!
Might I suggest some of this?
What...
Oh, very satisfactory in these cases.
A few drops on a handkerchief and the professor will no longer obstruct us.
You are sure it'll do the trick?
Oh, absolutely.
Would you care to try some?
No, thanks, Hives.
Let's find the professor.
I don't see how the thief could have gotten away.
I wonder who it could have been.
It's a good thing we substituted yours.
Suppose that the thief had gotten away with the Beaugard!
Oh, it would be all right if they stole mine.
Oh, darling, I...
I didn't mean that.
But what would mother do?
Why, it's worth $100,000!
How could she have replaced it?
Oh, I understand, dear.
Isn't it exciting?
Just think.
Whoever took it was right in the room with us!
Just like Raffles.
Oh, isn't it romantic?
All the boys I've known
Used to say I was made of stone
I would always leave them alone
In despair
I've been on the pan
I've been called an electric fan
Told I'm even much colder than
Frigidaire
I began to wonder
If I was all wrong
I thought so till you came along
Tell me, dear
Why am I so romantic
When you're near
Why am I so romantic
What a grand feeling
When your lips meet mine
That certain something comes
Stealing up and down my spine
I don't know what it is you do to me
You don't know half of the good you do me
Other boys bore me
They just leave me blue
But why am I so romantic
With you
Tell me, dear
Why am I so romantic
When you're near
Why am I so romantic
What a grand feeling
When your lips touch mine
That certain something comes
Stealing up and down my spine
When we pet close in your arms
You hold me
I forget all that my mother told me
Other girls bore me
They just leave me blue
But why am I so romantic
With you
(HARP PLAYING)
(WHISTLING)
(WHISTLING)
(WHISTLING)
Oh, Signor Ravelli.
Ah, how do you do?
I've been looking for you all morning.
I was busy all morning, but you could have had me last night.
Signor Ravelli, you've gotta put that painting back.
Painting?
Painting?
What painting?
What are you talking?
The one you changed last night, you remember?
Oh, you mean the picture?
Yes.
Hey, what's the matter for you?
First you want them downstairs, then you want them upstairs.
Then you want them downstairs, then you...
Come on, make up your mind.
Oh, I do thank you for what you've done.
But you've got to get that painting back before the police get here.
Police?
Yes!
They come here?
Yes!
Wait, I give it to you, you put it back.
Come on, come on.
Where's the picture?
What do you mean, "Where's the picture"?
I put him in there.
It's gone.
Somebody take him.
You take him!
Me?
No, I know.
I know.
I...
The fish peddler.
Abie, the fish peddler.
Did mother invite a fish peddler here?
I don't know whether she invite, but he's here.
Come on.
We find him.
Good morning, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Good morning, Mr. Jamison.
And how is Captain Spaulding this morning?
Oh, he had a very bad night.
He didn't sleep a wink.
He went horseback riding in the middle of the night.
I'm sorry.
Yes, I know.
But we've all been very upset.
Bad case.
Yeah.
Uh, good morning, Captain.
Did you enjoy your ride?
What in the world are you looking for?
I lost my horse.
Oh!
(CHUCKLING)
Yes, he slipped right out from between me.
I can't understand it.
I had my feet in the syrups, too.
I don't know.
I don't know how he got...
I didn't care about that, but I lost the bit you loaned me.
Never mind.
I'll get you another bit.
Well, that'll be two bits I owe you, then.
Captain, I hope you weren't distressed by last night's unfortunate occurrence.
You mean that dinner you served?
No, the painting that was stolen.
Was there a painting stolen?
I haven't seen a paper in three weeks.
Jamison, as my secretary, why didn't you inform me there was a painting stolen?
What do you think I engaged you for?
But, Captain, I didn't know it.
Well, you should have asked me.
I didn't know it!
Well, I'm sorry.
(SARCASTICALLY) You're sorry.
You're a contemptible cur!
I repeat, sir, you're a contemptible cur!
Oh, if I were a man you'd resent that.
Please keep quiet, will you?
I can get along without you, you know.
I got along without your father, didn't I?
Yes, and your grandfather.
Yes, and your uncle!
Yes, and your uncle!
Yes, and my uncle.
Captain!
I didn't come here to be exonerated.
I beg pardon, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Oh, you do, eh?
Well, I'd like to see you crawl out of a rumble seat.
The police are here, madam.
Oh, the police.
Have them come in.
Oh, so, that's your game, is it?
You can't shut me up.
Captain.
No!
You can talk to my attorney.
Jamison?
Yes, sir.
Take a letter to my lawyers.
I'll show you a thing or two, or three.
I'll show you a thing or three.
Oh, Captain.
Sending for the police.
Take a letter to my lawyers!
Sending for the police, eh?
I say, take a letter to my lawyers!
I am taking it!
Uh, read me what you have so far.
Honorable Charles H. Hungerdunger, in care of Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger and McCormick.
Semicolon.
How do you spell "semicolon"?
All right, make it a comma.
Dear, Elsie...
No, never mind Elsie.
Do you want me to scratch "Elsie"?
Well, if you enjoy that sort of thing, it's quite all right with me.
However, I'm not interested in your private affairs, Jamison.
Begin this way.
Let's start all over again.
Honorable Charles H. Hungerdunger, in care of Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger and McCormick.
Gentlemen, question mark.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Do you want that, uh...
(CLEARS THROAT) in the letter?
No, put that in an envelope.
Now, then, in re yours of the fifth inst.
Yours to hand and beg to rep.
Brackets.
That, uh, we have gone over the ground carefully and we seem to believe,
I-E, to wit, E-G, in lieu, that, uh, despite all our precautionary measures which have been involved...
Uh...
We seem to believe that it is hardly necessary for us to proceed unless we receive an ipso facto that is not negligible at this moment.
Quotes, unquotes and quotes.
Uh, hoping this finds you, I beg you to remain...
Hoping this finds him where?
Well, let him worry about that.
Don't be so inquisitive, Jamison.
Sneak!
I say, hoping this finds you,
I beg to remain, as of June 9th, cordially yours.
Regards.
That's all, Jamison.
I'll show you where I get off.
Sending for the police.
(SCOFFS)
Now read me the letter, Jamison.
"Honorable Charles H. Hungadunga..."
"Hungerdunger."
"Hunga...
Hun." "Hunga..."
"Hungerdunger." That's it.
"Hungerdunger."
"In care of Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger and McCormick."
You've left out a "Hungerdunger."
You left out the main one, too.
Thought you could slip one over on me, eh?
All right, leave it out and put in a windshield wiper instead.
I'll tell you what you do, Jamison.
I'll tell you what.
Make it, uh, make it three windshield wipers and one "Hungerdunger."
They won't all be there when the letter arrives anyhow.
"Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger and McCormick."
"And McCormick."
"Dear Elsie, scratch."
That won't do, Jamison.
That won't go through the mail, the way you got it.
The way you've got the letter, you've got McCormick scratching Elsie.
Now you better turn that around and have Elsie scratch McCormick.
And you better turn McCormick around, too, Jamison.
And see what you can do for me.
"Gentlemen, question mark."
"Gentlemen, question mark"?
Put it on the penultimate, not on the diphthongic.
You wanna brush up on your Greek, Jamison.
Well, get a Greek and brush up on him.
"In re yours of the fifth inst." I see.
Now, you said a lot of things here that I didn't think were important, so I just omitted them.
Well!
Hmm.
Oh, Captain!
Good gracious!
Oh, my!
So, you've just omitted them, eh?
You've just omitted the body of the letter, that's all.
You've left out the body of the letter, that's all.
Yours is not to reason why, Jamison!
You've left out the body of the letter!
All right, send it that way and tell them the body will follow.
Do you want the body in brackets?
No, it'll never get there in brackets.
Put it in a box.
Put it in a box and mark it, uh, "fragilly."
Mark it what?
Mark it "fragilly." F-R-A-G...
Look it up, Jamison.
It's in the dictionary.
Look under "fragile."
Look under the table if you don't find it there.
Uh, "Quotes, unquotes, and quotes."
That's three quotes?
Yes, sir.
Add another quote and make it a gallon.
How much is it, a gallon, Jamison?
Regards.
Regards.
That's a fine letter, Jamison.
That's an epic.
That's dandy.
Now, I want you to make two carbon copies of that letter and throw the original away.
And when you get through with that, throw the carbon copies away.
Just send a stamp airmail.
And that's all.
You may go, Jamison.
I may go, too.
Mrs. Rittenhouse?
Yes?
I'm Inspector Hennessey from headquarters.
How do you do, Inspector?
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Captain Scotland of Spaulding Yard.
No, I'm Captain Spaulding of Scotland Yard.
Please don't make the same mistake again.
I'm glad to know you, Captain.
Well, I should think you would be.
Now, then, inspector, I think between the two of us we can solve the mystery of the stolen painting.
Especially, if you go home.
Inspector, please don't be too hasty about making an arrest.
I don't want my guests embarrassed.
Don't worry.
We won't arrest anybody.
He's lucky if he can stay out of jail himself.
Mr. Jamison, would you mind taking the inspector and his men to the library and showing them the scene of the crime?
Certainly, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Right this way, Inspector.
Come on, boys.
And, Jamison, count the spoons.
Captain, I didn't know you'd been a detective.
There's a whole lot of things you don't know.
I suppose that's so.
You know darn well it's so.
Where were you on the night of June 5, 1774?
I'm afraid I don't know.
You bet you don't know.
Where was I?
I don't know.
Well, I don't know, either.
And if I did know I wouldn't tell you.
Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
Take a number from one to 10.
All right.
All right.
What's the number?
Seven.
That's right.
Seven is right.
I could have done it with one hand if I wanted.
This is no mystery.
I could solve this in five minutes if I wanted to worry.
Captain, I don't want you to worry.
I don't want anything to interfere with your weekend.
Nothing ever interferes with my weekend, and I'll thank you not to get personal, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Captain.
Captain, I assure you...
Where's my secretary?
I didn't mean...
No, no.
Where's my secretary?
Jamison, Jamison?
Captain, you misunderstood me.
Oh!
A more dastardly crack
I've never heard.
Oh.
Captain, please.
I wish I was back in the jungle where men are monkeys.
Captain, I'm so sorry.
Jamison!
Jamison?
No.
Oh, Captain.
Oh, dear.
No!
(CHUCKLES) Good morning, Mrs. Rittenhouse.
Good morning.
Perfectly charming party.
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
It's just full of surprises.
So glad you're enjoying yourself.
Oh, Hives.
Hives!
Good morning.
Some breakfast?
Breakfast, nothing.
Did you get the painting?
No, I did not.
I watched all night, but the professor did not sleep in his room.
No?
Strange.
Very strange.
Good heavens, Hives!
What will we do?
I don't know.
Until we see the professor.
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
(BIRDS STOP CHIRPING)
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
You keep an eye on him till I get back with the bottle.
Don't worry, he'll not get away from me this time.
Did you get it?
Good.
Yes, madam.
Now, I'll go ahead and engage him in conversation.
You'll trail behind, and when the proper time comes, see that he gets it.
Very good, madam.
Oh, hello.
I've been looking all over for you.
Where have you been?
What is the matter with this?
What have you got there, the morning papers?
No, that isn't the one I want.
Let me see one of the others.
That still isn't the one I want.
You know what I want.
Out.
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
Yes, out.
Never mind the birds.
Come on up here.
Sit down.
I want to talk to you.
Don't you like me?
You don't?
Well, I like you.
I like little boys like you.
(CHUCKLES) By the way, how old are you?
Five years old?
Why you're just a baby, aren't you?
(LAUGHS)
Oh!
(GASPS)
Aw, isn't that nice?
I like that.
(CHUCKLES)
(GASPS) No, no, no!
Now, all joking aside.
Isn't there someone you do like?
Isn't there someone you love?
Now think again.
Isn't there someone you really and truly love?
Is there?
Tell me who.
Why, that's a horse.
You love a horse.
Come on.
Lift him up.
Come on, he's out.
Let us get out.
(HORN HONKS)
(WHISTLES)
(HONKS)
Arabella.
John, I've been trying to find you.
Ravelli has lost the painting.
Well, I've been looking all over for you.
I found a painting out on the terrace.
Was it the Beaugard?
No.
Oh, yours!
Shh.
ARABELLA:
Well, if it's not yours and it's not the Beaugard, whose is it?
Where did it come from?
Oh, don't you see?
Someone else came along and substituted it for mine, thinking they were getting away with the original Beaugard.
ARABELLA:
Somebody swiped my scheme, eh?
Hey, then Chandler never saw your painting after all.
JOHN:
No!
For all I know you may still be a great artist.
(SIGHS)
Where is this picture?
It's up in my room.
Well, you go get it and I'll get Captain Spaulding.
He'll get to the bottom of this.
And then John found a third painting.
Well, that's very interesting.
Well, fairly interesting.
But we've just got to keep a sharp lookout.
That's all.
Oh, I've got to find it or mother's out of $100,000.
Now, don't worry.
Let me work on this case for 24 hours, and then we'll call in somebody else.
You think it's a mystery now?
Wait till you'll see it tomorrow.
Remember the Charley Ross disappearance?
I worked on that case for 24 hours and they never did find him.
They couldn't find me for five years.
That's me, Captain Yard of Scotland Spaulding.
I always get my women.
Or paintings.
Arabella!
Can you imagine what's happened?
You know that painting I found?
Yes?
Well, it's been stolen from my room.
John!
There you are.
I've been on the case five minutes and there's another painting gone.
I'll bet it's not even five minutes.
I'll bet it not over three.
Now they've got my watch!
This is going too far.
It wasn't going and now it's gone.
The door to my room was locked, too!
Well, how could they get in?
Who could it have been?
Wait a minute.
I think I've got a clue.
No, it's a hair.
A red hair.
The professor?
Oh, no.
No, it couldn't be.
Well, he's been picked this month by the Crook of the Month Club.
Anyhow, we'll investigate it.
(WHISTLES)
You know Conductor Hennessey, don't you?
Inspector!
Inspector yourself.
Now, listen, you know that little redheaded fellow?
The professor?
Yes.
Well, get that gang of flagpole sitters of yours and see if you can find him.
Aye, aye, Captain.
Come on, boys.
(MILITARY MUSIC PLAYING)
He'll get to the bottom of this.
You'll see how quick these boys...
Hey, what's that punk doing there?
They're good policemen.
Didn't take long to find him.
That's right.
This is it.
Yeah, this is it.
But which one is it?
That's the one that was just taken from my room!
Well, we've got that back.
Maybe I got my watch back.
Now, the fob is gone.
Well, I still got the pocket.
Anything I retain now is velvet.
Except the coat.
That's Prince Albert.
Well, all the jokes can't be good.
You've gotta expect that once in a while.
Say, if we could find the fellow that painted this picture, well, we'd have a pretty good clue.
What'd you say?
I said if we could find the fellow that painted this picture, we'd have a pretty good clue.
You just said that!
What a dull conversationalist you turned out to be.
Let me see that a minute.
Will you?
Say, this is signed "Beaugard."
There's the criminal, Beaugard.
No, Beaugard is dead!
Beaugard is dead?
Then it's murder!
Now we've got something.
What you got, Captain?
I got jacks and aces.
What do you got?
That's good.
I was bluffing.
Look at this, Ravelli.
Isn't there something strikes you very funny about this picture?
(LAUGHS)
Oh, come, come.
It isn't as funny as all that.
Did you ever see a tree like that?
Tree?
That's a spinach.
That can't be spinach.
Where's the egg?
Well, it could be spinach.
Look, all the sand laying around there.
You mean, it's an old spinach custom?
No, it's not that, Ravelli.
Anything but that.
Oh.
No, Cap.
That's all right.
It's my mistake.
You know what that is?
That's coleslaw.
Coleslaw?
Yeah, it's a coleslaw.
Did you ever see coleslaw like that?
Sure, look at this one.
No, I don't want one on your lip, now.
Did you ever see anything like that?
Did you ever see anything like that?
You know what this is?
This is a left-handed painting.
Look, there's a signature.
That's right, it's in the right-hand corner.
That's right.
This is either a left-handed painting or a vegetable dinner.
Now, if we can find the left-handed person that painted this, we'll have The Trial of Mary Dugan with sound.
Well, I saw that.
Good-bye.
Now, you wait here.
I'm gonna need you.
Now, look.
We mustn't lose this.
This is evidence.
Now, take it to your room and leave the door open this time.
We'll try that.
And not a word about this to anybody, not even to me.
Ravelli, we have got to find the left-handed painting.
Yes, the left-handed painter.
Now in a case like this the first thing to do is to find the motive.
Now, what could have been the motive of the guy who has swapped the Beaugard?
I got it!
Robbery!
Would you mind going out and crossing the boulevard when the lights are against you?
See, Cap, sit down.
You understand, I got an idea how to find this painting.
In a case like this that is so mysterious, you gotta get at the clues.
You gotta use the Sherlock Holmes method.
Now, you go about it like this.
You say to yourself, "What happened?"
And the answer come back, "Something was stolen."
Then you say to yourself, "What was stolen?"
And the answer come back, "A painting."
What are you, a ventriloquist?
Now you say to yourself, "Where was this painting stolen?"
And the answer come back, "In this house."
Now, so far I'm right, eh?
Well, it's pretty hard to be wrong if you keep answering yourself all the time.
Now you go a little further, and you say to yourself,
"Who stole the painting?"
This is a very, very important question.
Captain, you get the answer, you've got the solution to the whole thing.
Especially if you find the picture.
Now you take all the clues.
You put them together.
What do you got, eh?
A bread pudding.
No, here's what we got.
Something was stolen.
Stolen where?
In this house.
Stolen by who?
Somebody in the house.
Now to find the painting, you only gotta do is go to everybody in the house and ask them if they took it.
You know, I could rent you out as a decoy for duck hunters?
You say you're gonna go to everybody in the house and ask them if they took the painting?
Suppose nobody in the house took the painting.
Go to the house next door.
That's great.
Suppose there isn't any house next door.
Well, then of course we gotta build one.
Well, now you're talking.
What kind of house do you think we ought put up?
Well, I'll tell ya, Cap.
You see.
My idea of a house is something nice and small and comfortable.
That's the way I feel about it.
I don't want anything elaborate.
Just a little place that I can call home and tell the wife I won't be there for dinner.
I see.
You just want a telephone booth.
No, in that case, I'll get in touch with Chic Sales.
Now, what do you say, Cap, we build right about here?
Here?
Yeah, right about here.
Oh, I'd like something over here if I could get it.
I don't like junior crossing the tracks on his way to the reform school.
I don't like junior at all, as a matter of fact.
All right, all right.
We got something over there.
And believe me, that's convenient.
That's very convenient.
Well, all you gotta do is open the door, step outside and there you are.
There you are?
Yeah.
"There you are" where?
Outside.
Well, suppose you want to get back in again?
You had no right to go out.
Well, don't do anything until I hear from you, will you?
Say, maybe that's the painting down in the cellar!
That's no cellar.
That's the roof.
That's the roof?
Down there?
Yeah, you see, we keep the roof in the basement, so when the rain comes, the chimney don't get wet.
I'm going out and get X-rayed.
I'll be back in a little while.
I may be wonderful, but I think you're wrong, Ravelli.
Hey, wait, don't get up excited.
Come here.
Now, look, here's the rooms.
Those are the rooms?
Yeah.
Right, there's the rooms.
This is your room.
This is my room and this is the maid's room.
Oh, I'd have to go through your room?
(LAUGHS)
Ah!
That's all right.
I won't be in it.
Say, Ravelli, you couldn't put the maid in your room, eh?
What makes you think I couldn't?
Well, there's gonna be a lot of traffic in there.
I can see that.
Well, what do you say?
You ready to sign the lease?
Well, it's a little premature.
I'd like to discuss it with my husband.
Could you come back this evening when he is home?
Hey, you married?
Why, I've got a girl as big as you are.
All right, get me one.
Don't get vulgar, Ravelli.
Ravelli, how about the painting?
We take care of that, all right.
Now, I tell you what my idea is.
I think the kitchen should be white.
Outside green, inside cerise with blue...
The painting, I say.
How about the painting, Ravelli?
All right, what do you think I talk?
That's painting.
The kitchen white, outside green, inside cerise.
The painting.
The painting that was stolen.
Stolen?
Don't you remember Mrs. Rittenhouse lost a valuable Beaugard painting worth $100,000?
Don't you remember that?
No, I'm a stranger around here.
I no remember that.
What do you think I am, one of the early settlers?
Ravelli, don't you remember,
Mrs. Beaugard lost a valuable Rittenhouse painting worth $100,000?
Don't you remember that?
No, but I've seen you someplace before.
Well, I don't know where I was, but I'll stay out of there in the future.
Hey, Cap, it come to me like a flash!
This painting wasn't stolen.
Huh!
You know what happened?
This painting, Cap, is disappear.
Vanish.
Yes, it disappear.
And you know what make it disappear?
You'll never guess, Cap.
What do you think make this painting disappear, eh?
Moths!
Moths eat it!
Left-handed moths.
Go away.
Go away.
I'll be all right in a minute.
Left-handed moths ate the painting, eh?
That's my own solution.
I wish you were in it.
Left-handed moths ate the painting.
You know, I'd buy you a parachute if I thought it wouldn't open.
Hey, I got pair of shoes.
(MOANS)
That's crazy.
Come on, let's get out and get the reward.
We solved it.
You solved it!
The credit is all yours.
The painting was eaten by a left-handed moth.
Hey, I know, we did a good day's work.
How do you feel?
Tired?
It's worth it.
Maybe you ought to lie down for a couple of years, eh?
Well...
Why don't you just lie down until rigor mortis sets in?
Yeah.
That's nothing.
Come on, Ravelli.
I'll show you how we get the painting.
Yeah.
We go to court and we get out a writ of habeas corpus.
You're gonna get rid of what?
Oh, I should never have started that way.
I can see that.
I say, we'll go to court and we'll get a writ of habeas corpus.
Yeah, scorpus, scorpus.
Didn't you ever see a habeas corpus?
No, but I see Habeas Irish Rose.
(HOWLING)
Hey, it's okay.
ALL:
Good morning.
Good morning.
Mr. Chandler, why don't you go down to the beach with the others?
I'm sure you'd feel better.
If I had my Beaugard, I'm sure I'd feel better.
Oh, but we're doing everything we can.
Mrs. Rittenhouse, Mrs. Rittenhouse!
I have it.
The Beaugard!
Wonderful!
My Beaugard!
Wait, this is not my Beaugard!
This is a rank imitation.
Where did you find it?
Why, in Mr. uh...
In Mr. Parker's room, madam.
Parker!
One thing is certain!
The man who made that, stole the Beaugard!
Hives, find Mr. Parker and ask him to come here.
Certainly, madam.
Wait a minute.
My men will bring him in.
Go out and get Mr. Parker.
Oh, what's the matter with this?
Well, look at here.
You've only to look at it once to see what it is.
It is a rank nothing!
Mother, what's wrong?
I can come in without being pulled in.
Mr. Parker, something very mysterious has occurred.
And I'm afraid, you're the only one who can explain.
I'd be only too glad to if I can.
Nothing mysterious about it.
We found this in your room.
Now, what have you done with the original Beaugard?
Come clean!
Come on, out with it.
Really, I think I would be wise...
Well, I have nothing to say.
Except that I don't know where the Beaugard is.
Oh, how is it we found this in your room?
Come on!
You better come with me.
You can't take him!
Arabella!

This program is coming to you from the House of David.
He's either got that suit on upside down or there is no law of gravity.
Einstein or no one.
My tie!
Oh, Captain, what shall I do?
They're going to arrest John.
Who's going to arrest John?
I am, Captain.
Oh, you are, eh?
Well, let me tell you something.
The first thing they teach you at Scotland Yard is never to arrest an innocent man.
But he's not innocent.
I'll have to arrest him just the same.
By all means or nobody will be safe here.
You can't arrest him!
I stole it!
MRS. RITTENHOUSE:
Arabella!
Don't listen to her, Officer.
I did it.
They're both lying.
I did it!
I did it with my little hatchet.
Eh, he's crazy.
He's crazy.
I confess, I did it.
Or maybe nobody stole the painting.
Maybe there was no painting.
That's right, maybe there was no painting.
I saw it.
Cut out all the talk.
Who stole the painting?
ALL:
I did.
Good gracious!
What!
MRS. RITTENHOUSE:
What in the...
What?
You?
You took the picture?
Where is it?
Oh, that's a horse.
The Beaugard!
That is my Beaugard!
No, that isn't your Beaugard.
Don't be ridiculous.
I paid $100,000 for this painting.
I know what I bought.
Well, look at the signature.
"John Parker."
Somebody changed it.
That is my Beaugard!
That is the Beaugard, I tell you!
There it is!
Ah, but that one.
That has the color, the depth, the soul of the Beaugard!
Only a master could have produced a painting like that.
Oh, John.
You mean to tell me that you painted that?
Yes, sir.
Why, young man, you're a genius!
You're a genius!
I commission you to paint a portrait of me immediately!
Well, you better wait until tomorrow.
I'm gonna be busy all day.
Get it?
(CHUCKLES)
You better come with me, young fellow!
Don't take him away, Officer.
He returned the paintings.
Pardon me, my name is Spaulding.
I've always wanted to meet you.
All right.
I'll let him go this time.
But I want to give you some advice.
You're running around with the wrong kind of people.
You wanna be a crook?
Oh, why don't you go home?
He's got no home.
Go home for a few nights and stay home.
Don't you know your poor, old mother sits there... (CLINKING)
(CLINKING) ...sits there night after...
(CLINKING) ...night after night.
(CLINKING) ...waiting to hear your steps on the stairs.
He got no stairs.
And I can see a little light burning in...
(CLINKING) ...burning in the window.
No, you can't.
The gas company turned it off.
What I'm telling you is for your own good.
(CLINKING)
And if you listen to me...
(CLINKING)
You can't go wrong.
(CLINKING)
This may go on for years.
Now, there's just one thing... (CLINKING)
I can't understand what's delaying that coffee pot.
Where's the cream?
Well, you certainly surprised me!
Me, too.
I thought he had more than that.
It's no use giving you any advice.
Captain, this time I'm afraid I'll have to take him.
Come on, here!
Come on!
Come on!
(MRS. RITTENHOUSE) Oh, what's he doing?
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
Oh, my dear, oh!
Hey, what's the idea?
Jamison, take a letter to my lawyer!
No, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, no, no!
Not...
Oh.
Oh, to think that I've got to go so young.
Good.
Come on, now.
Let's get out of here before they all wake up.
Hurry up!
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

Nobody must know that the festive speaker isn't of the family.

# Festive speaker for all weddings, baptisms, engagements, # funerals, consecrations of flags, # with or without piano accompaniment.
# Give me your card, I'll make a house call, # nowadays nobody can do without me.
What about the little Miss?
But you ordered the wedding speech with piano accompaniment
That's right.
The lady is the piano accompaniment.
Excellent.
Right now they're in the right mood for a beautiful speech.
If I may ask for a few details first.
The bridegroom:
Little Franz Krug, 20 years, not a blemish on his record so far.
The bride:
my daughter, little Marie, about 41 years.
A marriage of love or of convenience?
A loving marriage of convenience.
How long does the engaged couple know each other?
Six weeks.
How many children?
- I beg your pardon?
- That's enough.
Another question:
How shall I introduce you, Herr Klips?
Not at all.
The bride's family should think I'm from the bridegroom's side, and the others think I'm from the bride's side
Dear co-eaters:
[Mit-Esser, meaning also "pimples"]
I have been honoured with the pleasure to make the festive speech.
I avail myself of this pleasure by welcoming you all.
You all have come to watch the young couple's happiness because you'll never again see them as happy as they are today, because what'll follow after this beautiful feast isn't beautiful, but "feisty".
[fest = 1. feast 2. stable, steady]
Because I mean, marriage.
Because the most beautiful thing about marriage is the wedding, and this wedding party is a special wedding party.[Hoch-zeit = high time]
Because it was high time that the thing became steady. [fest]
Because, look at the dear bride, our beloved little Marie.
She's seen many springs till at last the beloved Franz came along.
Poor Franz!
Poor, because he only met his little Marie so late in life.
We know, dear Franz, what awaits you now...
But we don't envy you, no, we're happy you've got your little Marie.
And now the dear parents,
little Marie's parents, they mustn't be forgotten, who spared neither efforts nor money to get rid of their daughter ["los-werden"]
eh, to embellish their daughter's fate ["Los"] on earth.
And now she's got her Franz, and Franz may be calm now.
Nobody will take her away from him.
And so I'll raise this cup of joy at this feast of joy in this house of joy.
[Freuden-Haus : brothel]
May the young couple celebrate very soon their golden wedding and always bear the patriotic poet's lines in mind:
# Marriage is no great evil, # one paints the yoke of marriage in far too black colours.
# Marriage is like an onion:
# one cries over it but swallows it all the same.
The young couple, long may they live, high!
high - high - high high - high - high high - high - high
Come along.
The baptism is without piano accompaniment.
Ah yes.
Don't forget, you're the Deputy Upper Ministerial Official of Zickendorf!
Upper ...
Special...
Upper Zickendorfer Specialist for...

Upper Deputy...
One moment, come with me!
Oh dear.
Come along.
- Please, speak on the telephone!
- I?
Yes, I'll tell you what to say.
Hello, this is the Deputy Upper Ministrant of Upper-Zicke
What, a Zicke [goat]?
Which Zicke?
No, you're Professor Wielander!
But I'm not a Professor!
Ah, Professor.
No, this is Dr. Cajetan,
General Secretary of the "Modern Club".
I am happy to have finally reached the Professor in person.
No, I'm speaking on behalf of our esteemed president, the Baroness Lindenwörth.
I have the honourable task to inform you that the committee has awarded this year's first prize to your book.
I'm getting a prize!
Marvelous!
How much is the prize?
For God's sake!
The club's prize is of course purely idealistic. [idealer]
How many thalers?
I see, idealistic.
But that's very little.
What does he say?
He doesn't want to pay.
Dear Professor, that I finally got hold of the eternally invisible man.
Now there's a lady speaking.
May the ladies of the club ask of you to present us the honour ...
A present?
But that's insolent!
The prize doesn't earn me anything, and I am to make them a present as well!
Hello, Madame General!
Madame Baron.
Stop it, stop it!
We've been cut off.
Didn't you understand what the lady wanted?
Not a word.
But we can call them back.
No no, thank you, thank you
You're welcome.
I don't want to keep you any longer.
Herr ... eh...

# Festive speaker for all weddings, baptisms, engagement parties # funerals, consecrations of flags, # with our without piano accompaniment.
# Give me your card, I'll make a house call # nowadays nobody can do without me.
What?
You're a professional speaker?
I take the liberty.
May I ask for the meaning of this telephone call?
Oh, that was...
A little joke.
A little joke, very well.
If you ever need me again for a joke, my address
#Take my card, I'll make a house call, # nowadays nobody can do without me.
The Deputy Upper Ministerial Official of Zickendorf will honour us with his visit, on the occasion of our little daughter's baptism.
Allow me, von Zickendorf.
Madame.
Herr Henkelmann.
Esteemed...
Esteemed guests, present or absent, dear parents,
dear young man!
Man, that's a girl!
Pardon.
Esteemed young Miss!
I have been awarded the rare honour to hold the festive speech at this feast, the festive speech for our little baptizee.
Because the world is beautiful, wonderfully beautiful.
Let us remember the day when we first saw the light of the bedside table lamp in mother's bedroom.
We all were younger then, more carefree, not so dry, not so...
We all were younger then, more carefree, not so sober, not so dry as we are today.
But more like you, you little baptizee,
well ... yes... that's what I was going to say, not so... not so dry, but rather... jolly, I'd even say...
"wet"-jolly ["feucht-fröhlich" - drink enhanced gaiety] just like the little child in white linen.
What joys such a small child will bring home in later years that I cannot describe in so many words and that's why I end my speech with a vivat for the little drunkard [Säufling] for the little baptizee. [Täufling] High high high!
Hurry up!
what's next?
Consecration of the flag with the boy scouts.
I see.
# Give me your card, I'll make a house call,
# I am the man who can go anything, don't begin without me
# Give me your card, I'll make a house call, # nowadays nobody can do without me.
It won't last forever, that lousy speaking at feasts.
A few hundred more of those weddings and baptisms like those today and we can become engaged.
What about the baptism?
What's going on here?
The door's open.
But I'm positive I've locked it
- Evening.
- Evening.
The doorman was so kind to let me wait here, because I absolutely had to speak to you today.
Really?
Am I to make another phone call?
Can I speak to you alone?
Lillebil...
If you please.
How did you get into this uniform?
I held the festive speech for the firemen brigade's memorial service.
I see.
I've made you participate in a little fraud today.
I am still at your disposition.
Professor Wielander, whom you've impersonated, is my boss, you know.
I'm his secretary.
And surely you must have heard of him.
Emanuel Wielander.
Cyclists Club "Puncture"
I don't know any Emanuel.
But you must know his book, his famous book on marriage which was crowned with a prize today.
Why crowned?
He won't get a crown [penny] for the prize.
Oh!
Wrestlers Club "Jump On Him"
Oh, that's not interesting.
Listen to me:
the condition is that each prize holder must make a big speech in public.
What have I got to do with this?
You must make the speech for him.
- I?
- Yes.
Why doesn't he make the speech himself?
Because he can't.
Is he dumb?
Worse.
He has a speech impediment.
That's the trouble.
Dumb would be interesting, but a famous writer with a speech impediment is ridiculous.
So, what's the problem exactly?
He has a lisp, and he stammers a bit, gets stuck with his tongue, has breathing problems when speaking, suffers from loss of memory, attacks of anxiety, he gets hoarse, and he spatters on top of it.
# We are the audience, the great audience # we demand gaudium for our money # we'll only turn round, here sits the audience # it' s a matter of whether we like it or not.
# we bend forward, and sit around, # a great audience in a big house
# So jump to the beat of the music, show your brimborium # because the audience has requested it.
"Lex mihi ars"
Ladies and gentlemen!
My God, if only everything ... eh works out all right, I feel so... terr....ibly worried.
whether it's true about the ...- speech.
It'll work out fine.
The festive speaker will see to it.
Will he?
and you know, I can so beautifully... make a speech, so enrapturing, so... so ... so... fascinating, if nobody's listening.
Unfortunately you cannot talk in monologue all your life.
Unfortunately.
and now I have the honour to introduce to you the author of the book "Marriage", Professor Wielander.
It's the first time that the prize-winning author speaks in public.
Like this ...
I beg your pardon, but it's all been arranged as you wished.
Nobody may enter the space behind the stage.
Esteemed audience, esteemed Madame President!
The topic has the title "Marriage and its prevention".
An old Arabian proverb says:
marriage is like a town under siege.
Those outside want to get in, those inside want to get out.
In fact, this sums up pretty much everything one could say about marriage.
Because, esteemed ladies and gentlemen, marriage is nothing else but a terrible misunderstanding.
Most marriages are made in the belief that happiness begins with marriage´, whereas nothing else begins but a terrible misunderstanding.
But this is the voice of...
In fact, each marriage is on the one hand a res consuetudinis
- on the other hand ...
- est unius quid ... damned unius quisque which means... it may be seen biologically or sociologically.
And since it is a co... copulatio .... damned fortunae aquae vitae
According to my point of view, one must look at it from two sides.
that is, on the one hand, from the status virilis, on the other hand, from the status muliebre.
muliebre muliebre
Already in paradise, Adam and Eve...
Radio Germany Königs Wusterhausen at 7 p.m.:
transmission from the "Moderner Klub" lecture:
Prof. Emanuel Wielander
Man and woman and the whole world...
Esteemed listeners, because now the matter gets ticklish, all the questioni matrimoni are of an altitudo cuius est magna auctoritas
Rabridrana...
Rabindranath Tragore
Rabindranath Tagore, the Indian scholar, has already remarked:
[now in fancy Bengali] krihis hastopi cria iucto nagriena drihas rami naki ... nakliva ... nakliva putra ... nakaliva ava khan ... pari baldis pari baida dala daima daiva kayyam dakalusta fe hasmi hasmi
Gesundheit!
I proceed:
when Eve, prejunianus himamineva tulease
Exactly my opinion!
I gather you've understood me correctly, ladies and gentlemen, each marriage is nothing but an egocentric necessitas summae possessatis in aria,
But... this egotism is a valitudo minus commoda and as long as... this - auto-cractic egotism sekrotant exists at all, there is no possibility for a good marriage.
Sit!
Sit!
Which phenomenon suddenly appears then?
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Ladies and Gentlemen!
Where on earth do you come from?
Sonja, quiet!
...has its foundation on mutual...
Which after mutual ... assistance,
Will you go into the corner!
Silent!
Will you sit still!
The vita makkaroni must be from the school of the caritas hominum...
Look here, the little kitten!
We have happily taken care of this passus now.
Sonja, come here!
And thus I close my statement:
everything is destiny, marriages are made in heaven, that's why, as Nestroy remarks... a heavenly patience is needed to be able to bear it on earth.
My dear Professor, it has been enrapturing.
I thank you on behalf of the club, and especially on behalf of myself.
Of course we must get acquainted "nearer".
But certainly, as near as possible.
You must come and see me.
I'd be delighted to welcome you as my guest.
I'm afraid that's impossible, Baroness.
But it's very possible!
You see.
But ...
Agreed, Professor.
May I count on your visit?
Of course, Madame, we'll come and we'll be overjoyed.
So goodbye then, tomorrow at my place!
Well, thank you again for the enjoyable evening.
Isn't she delightful!
You insolent person!
How dare you accept the invitation!
Listen to me, when a nice woman invites me to coffee I never say no.
You don't have a say in anything!
All at once?
Till now you needed me, but not when I'm invited for coffee
Anyway...
- You're not invited.
- Why not?
- Only the professor.
- That's the same, the professor and I.
What do you say to that, Professor?
What do you say to that, Professor?
miki ... miki...
The whole world may hear it for all I care!
I don't like it that you go and see that Baroness.
I ... eh....
Come with me
In any case, your services are no longer required.
Mr. Festive Speaker.
Well, Madame Baroness, what about the two of us?
What was that?
What were you saying?
You're afraid of me?
# Already Madame Eve said to her husband
# Dear Adam, come on!
# I'm tired already of paradise so kiss me, kiss me, kiss me!
# And Paris with the tunic # said to his beautiful Helena:
# Your Menelaus waits at home, so kiss me, kiss me, kiss me!
# To beautiful Romeo, little Juliet sends all her love longings # and Käthe has long ago come to an agreement with her Karlheinz.
# Don't be afraid of the first kiss # because it's bound to happen one day.
# Don't be afraid, I'd love to teach you, # kissing is again quite fashionable nowadays.
# Nobody needs to know anything about it, except the two of us, # don't be afraid when it happens, there's nothing to it.
# You'd better be afraid of the last kiss # because it's bound to happen, too.
The transmission of Prof. Wielander's lecture was a splendid success.
after the lecture, the scholar sang a little song which had nothing to do with the theme of marriage, but which will surely be a smash hit very soon.
Tell me, did you listen to the radio last night?
Yes, some learned rubbish about marriage.
So so...
By the way...
Mother has been writing to me again.
She asks when the two of us will finally get married.
Tt's high time, she says.
My dear child,
One mustn't rush into a marriage.
It's a far too important matter, so to speak, a res consuetudinis, on the one hand on the other hand, a res ud unios quisqued that is, it may be looked at from two sides
either sociologically, or biologically.
You see, this is what mother says, too.
It's logical for the two of us to get married, since for such a long time we've been...
Your eternal talk about your mother!
# Mother doesn't have to know about it # if we stand beneath the house gate at night.
# That two people kiss each other without wedding rings, # today, mother cannot understand it anymore.
# In the nightly alley, the two of us, all alone, # there you can be tender nicely # by the light of the gas lantern.
# Mother doesn't have to know about it # if we stand beneath the house gate at night.
# Almost all men shudder when one speaks of marriage # they have hardly heard one word of it and they are gone forever.
# Men are criminals # and are getting cheekier every day.
# They have no conscience at all, all they say is:
# Mother doesn't have to know about it # if we stand beneath the house gate at night.
# That two people kiss each other without wedding rings # today, mother cannot understand it anymore.
# In the nightly alley, the two of us, all alone, # there you can be tender nicely # by the light of the gas lantern.
# Mother doesn't have to know about it # if we stand beneath the house gate at night.
And the Professor must sit next to me.
Then I'll have him all to myself.
Yes, Madame Baroness.
I'm totally overworked.
And Miss Titi?
Oh, that meddlesome person!
Place her right at the end of the table.
Yes, Madame Baroness.
Prof. Wielander on the phone!
Dear Professor, how kind of you to call me.
What are you saying?
You've dreamt about the dress I'll be wearing?
Well?
What?
A gown with silver lace?
In my hair a diadem?
How did you guess this?
How I know about it?
I'm a psychic.
But that's not why I'm calling you but to hear once more your beloved voice, Madame Baroness.
For who knows when and if at all we'll ever see each other again.
But why?
But we'll see each other tonight.
Unfortunately I cannot come, no.
But Professor, how did you manage to be here already?
And you've really predicted my gown?
Or have you bribed my dressmaker, you ... you...
Excuse me.
But we can still turn back and leave.
No!
As you please, let's stay then.
But what the beautiful Baroness will say when she hears how you really speak...
That'll be just great!
Today you belong to me, you must tell me everything, Professor
Oh dear!
Come with me.
Oh dear!
Ladies and Gentlemen!
We have the great honour to greet Herr Wielander who until now was never seen in society.
as our guest.
Oh dear.
Esteemed hostess, honoured guests!
If the servant annoys you during your speech, I'll send him away.
No!
We're sitting at a rich table, we've been invited by a beautiful woman, but... we'd still be sitting in paradise today if God hadn't told Eve:
"I forbid you to eat apples from the tree of knowledge".
But if He had told her instead
"I think eating apples doesn't become you, Eve", and since this little faux-pas made by a beautiful woman, eating became fashionable, and since beautiful women always follow fashion they see to it that we'll always sit at rich tables.
Already the immortal Brillat-Savarin knew it:
"Tell me what you eat, and I tell you who you are".
I look around in this company and I see a classical table service, heavenly dishes, refined food, and I know who's my host:
a classical, heavenly, refined, beautiful woman.
Prosit!
Prosit, Professor.
Prosit.
You're not only a great scholar, but also a great Casanova.
Yes.
Come with me, Professor, let's have a quiet chat.
Oh dear.
Take a seat.
We're alone here.
Isn't it nice here?
Are you looking for something?
I see, help yourself.
Do you know what I like best about you?
Your voice.
Hoppla.
You have such a melodious...
I'd even say... erotic voice.
Say something, Professor
Speak to me now!
I think it's adorable of you:
only when you speak of your work you get carried away,
otherwise you like to keep silent, like all great men.
But now you must tell me what's on your mind.
I know, you want to tell me something, isn't that so, Professor?
I want to know whether you can make a woman happy.
I say!
and how!
Right from the first moment I thought...
What did you think?
Golly!
I thought.
She's my kind of woman.
Oh dear
I held the lecture only for you.
I could sense it.
I also noticed that you lost your composure each time you looked at me.
But that wasn't because of you, it was because of the poodle.
What poodle?
I mean, pudelatio... perfidia...
Because of the chapter on marriage.
I see
And you don't want to get married?
But I do!
ouch!
[Au] what was that?
[Auf] If it were the case, only with a woman like you.
Why me?
Because you have charm, chic, esprit, money [Geld] eh, a reputation [Gelt-ung] in the world.
Oh dear.
You seem so strange to me.
When one looks at you one must love you dearly, but when you speak...
I feel afraid of you.
# All beginnings are hard in life, # more so in love.
# Whether rich or poor, in love they're all alike, # at first happy, and then madly in love, love love.
# That's why it's important to get it right in the beginning, # when one finally has a rendez-vous then you say...
# Don't be afraid of the first kiss # because it's bound to happen one day.
# Don't be afraid, I love to teach you # kissing is quite fashionable nowadays.
# Nobody's to know anything about it, just the two of us # only I'm afraid, perhaps something will happen to me while I'm doing it.
# You'd better be afraid of the last kiss # because it's bound to happen one day, too.
No, I!
You!
Ouch!
I'm not afraid.
How powerful you are, as if you held me with iron arms.
Come with me, Professor, we must get back to the party.
Oh dear.
# it has been very beautiful, I've been so pleased # the guest have greatly amused themselves
# the evening is over, I don't regret it
# The most beautiful thing in the world are the guests. ?
# The dinner was superb, the wines exquisite,
# ?
# The guests took the very best impression home, # and stayed happy in their lives.
The Professor?
What are you doing here?
And you?
I ...
I wanted...
So do I.
So we both want the same.
Yes.
You must make ... to the Baroness... from me ... a.... a declaration of love.
Will you?
And she should ... the ....
Key.
Key, yes, thank you, throw down the key, and whether I can come up and have with her a... a... a cup of tea... yes?
I am to tell her that?
Yes, you're to tell her that. yes?
But I don't want to have tea.
Not you!
I!
Ah, you want to have tea.
- Yes.
- You're a fine gentleman.
Having tea in the middle of the night.
You must tell her... that I ... her... love
Yes?
I won't do it.
Why not?
Because I like her myself.
- You?
- Yes.
And now I'll go upstairs and tell her the truth
Hoppla!
Not ... not... tell her...
I'm fed up playing the Cyrano in the waistcoat pocket.
Get your act together alone!
All right, I'll get my ... eh
Is there anything you want from me?
Tea.
But what is it you want, Professor?
I just wanted to tell you that I never have tea.
And that's why you've come back?
Yes, that's why.
I never have tea, neither with rum, nor lemon, nor cream, and I don't want to have tea, I don't want anything.
I just want to have peace.
Go to bed and dream about whomever you like, only not about me!
But this is unheard-of!
What insolence!
Good night.
may I never see you again.
You ... you ...
But you're crazy!
Why are you shouting in the middle of the night?
Why are you demolishing the gardens?
None of your business.
you look after your own inclinations.
Inclinations?
You!
Don't shout at me!
Otherwise I'll arrest you
Arrest me then, you grease drop ["grease-eye"] of the law
Grease drop?
No ... not eye.
Nine-eyes?
I'll sue you!
# One falls in love here and there # and doesn't know how it happened.
# Suddenly it begins and you only notice # when you can't change it anymore.
# And one stands in front of her house, # looks up to her windows, # and one sighs heavily and wanders up and down # in front of the window.
# Your nightshirt is made of crêpe de chine, # your heart is made of stone, # you've no idea how much I'm in love, # only I alone know about it.
# If you only knew how nice I can be to women # then you wouldn't say no any longer,
# then your heart would be made of crêpe de chine # and not, like it is now, of stone.
# Did you really say no?
# Did you only say it without meaning it?
# tell me, are you only shamming or are you making fun of me?
# Yesterday you were blazing hot, # today you're as cold as ice, # sometimes quiet, sometimes passionate, # child, you're a riddle to me.
# your shirt is made of crêpe de chine, # your heart is made of stone, # you've no idea how much I'm in love # only I alone know about it.
# If you only knew how nice I can be to women, # then you wouldn't say no any longer, # then your heart would be made of crêpe de chine
# and not, like it is now, of stone.
# uhu uhu
You know, Adam, such an elegant woman has her charms.
Believe me, a cozy bedroom, a bed with silk cushions, and Madame in a shirt of crêpe de chine.
Well?
What do you think?
You know, I really like her a lot, but it's always the same.
What do you think?
Should I go to that Baroness and tell her that I like her?
Calm down.
I didn't want to know that much
You too would rather be a Rolls Royce with luxury body and triad horn.
Or should I stay with Lillebil?
What do you say?
Of course, you two,
Lillebil and you, you always stick together.
Now it's enough, do you hear!
Don't get excited!
I'll stay with Lillebil.
I'll even marry her, so that the mother doesn't complain anymore.
But not right now
I'd like to stay a bachelor for a while.
# Mother doesn't have to know about it # if we stand beneath the house gate at night.
Oh, the festive speaker!
What else do you want from us?
I behaved badly with the Professor yesterday.
I'd like to make up for it today, and again ... for him ... eh make speeches.
The Professor has a visitor, and he'll hardly have use for your services after that visitor.
Because the Baroness is with him.
Alone with him!
Yes, sir.
All alone, and in a room without folding screens or curtains or Japanese armour.
In a word: no hiding-place for you.
I got your letter, Professor.
You wrote that you had to see me urgently.
You were going to explain your behaviour last night.
Oh dear.
I have arranged it.
In two minutes she'll learn that her adored Professor can't even speak.
In three minutes she'll be gone.
In four minutes.
my Professor will belong to me again.
I think this is an outrage!
Betraying the poor Professor that way!
Adieu, Mr. Festive Speaker, it has been festive.
You remain silent because you're embarrassed.
I must say, last night at my window you were much more talkative.
Well?
I'm listening, Professor
So formal?
I'm quite curious
Well, what do you have to say to me?
That I love you.
Now this is a surprise!
I didn't expect that!
Me neith... er
I'm embarrassed.
Now I'm stuck.
So am I.
I beg your pardon?
Let's get comfortable now.
Let's light the fireplace
Good Heavens, no!
As you like
You were talking so nicely, go on.
How am I to reconcile your declaration of love with last night's incident?
eh ... eh ...
Baroness, don't think of last night.
Only think of this hour, only this moment matters.
I love you wickedly [ver-rucht
- Rauch = smoke]
Baroness!
- I love you...
- Your voice is so fiery, so flaming.
Yes, fiery and flaming, that is exactly how I feel.
Don't you like the cognac?
I think it's excellent.
Oh dear.
The way the wind howls in the chimney, and there's not even a breeze outside.
But what do we care about that storm!
What do we care about the whole world!
Tell me what's on your heart.
Baroness,
Baroness, I have the honour to ask for your hand in marriage.
If only I could get a grasp for my hand in here.
Oh dear.
Oh dear.
But what on earth were you looking for in there?
You'll laugh, I've been looking for that one.
But how strange you speak!
But you have the same voice as the Professor!
Yes.
In Heaven's name, tell me who you are!
Carry Klips,
# Festive speaker for all weddings, baptisms, engagement parties # funerals, consecrations of flags, # with our without piano accompaniment
# Give me your card, I'll make a house call # nowadays nobody can do without me.
Pardon.
What about your voice?
Was the Professor's.
And the Professor?
Has several effective speech impediments.
And you have....
Spoken for him.
- And the declaration of love?
- Was my own.
- And the kiss?
- Mine, too.
Why?
The "iron" embrace
Insolence!
That's right.
But then I've fallen in love with your voice!
So it seems
Terrible!
A festive speaker!
You have... you have...
Told her everything.
Told everything?
Yes.
Do you know what you are?
Well?
You're a... a fraud.
A crook, a robber, a murderer, a thief a forger, a church robber.
But Professor!
What is it?
But you can speak!
What can I?
Speak!
Oh dear.
Firmly walled in earth and steady, stands the mold of well-burnt clay.
Go away, silly goose!
Again:
Firmly walled in earth and steady, stands the mold of well-burnt clay.
Quick, now, workmen, be ye ready !
Forth must come the bell to-day !
Should the master praise be given ;
Yet the blessing comes... from Heaven.
[Schiller:
Song of the Bell]
One moment.
One moment.
One moment:
Firmly walled in earth and steady, stands the mold of ... of clay, of well-burnt clay.
today...
You!
it is I who's speaking!
Yes.
But I can speak again!
Yes.
I can speak fluently!
You're a....
I know, a fraud.
No no no no, you're an angel, a magician, a genius!
# Two hearts in a 3/4 beat, # the May has united them, # two hearts in a 3/4 beat ...
Madame Baroness.
How dare you show yourself in here, you fraud!
- Baroness!
- You crook!
You fraud!
Baroness!
You've let another man babble in your place.
Baroness!
You've let another man kiss me.
Baroness
And you're calling this love?
Baroness!
You've tricked me into giving you my sympathy, but you can't even speak!
Oh yes, I can speak!
But they don't let me
- You can speak?
- Yes, I can speak.
I can speak like a filibuster, like a festive speaker, like a speaker at an election.
One moment.
One momen.t
What are you looking for?
The festive speaker
But that's me, the festive speaker!
# Give me your card, I'll make a house call # nowadays nobody can do without me.
One moment.
Say:
Fisher's Fritze fishes fresh fish.
Oh dear.
Fisher's Fritze fishes fresh fish.
- So you really can...
- Speak.
- Without the other man?
- without the other man.
Thank God!
Then we can get married.
Oh dear.
Why?
Well, now you're finally able to speak up and say "yes".
# Don't be afraid of the marriage license office, # because from here are issued some beautiful things.
# Don't be afraid of the marriage license, # one day each man falls into the trap.
# Please speak up and say "yes", # then you'll be soon a mama and you the papa.
# Now she belongs to him and will remain his forever.
# If he's fortunate she'll say "no".
Madame Baroness von Lindenwörth, are you determined, of your own free will to enter into matrimony with Herr Professor Emanuel Wielander?
Then answer "yes"
Yes.
Yes.
Herr Professor Emanuel Wielander, are you determined, of your own free will to enter into matrimony with Madame Baroness von Lindenwörth?
Then answer "yes".
I'm asking you for the last time:
answer with a loud and articulate "yes".
Will you really say "yes" when we stand before the marriage registrar?
Yes.
I declare you man and wife
Or rather "no".
Listen darling, we got on so well before.
But I've promised Mother that we'll get married at last.
Oh, you and your mother
# Mother doesn't have to know about it # we'll get married another time, I promise.
I know all about that other time, it's now or never!
# That two kiss each other without wedding rings
And I got the rings, too.
# that I cannot understand, alas
You'll understand all right.
# In the nightly alley, the two of us, all alone
And the marriage registrar in there!
# there you can be nice and cuddly
No more cuddling now, now we'll get married!
# by the light of the gas lantern
Gas or electric, day or night...
# The whole world may know about it, # that I'm your spouse from today on.

OUR DAILY BREAD
You must get this amount or it will be serious.Your Father
"First call for lunch in the dining car"!
Your handkerchiefs are under your shirts.
Use a clean one every day.
Don't stay out late at night
Don't take up with strangers.
Remember we are depending on you to do your best.
Was that the first call for luncheon?
Guess so.
It's the first one I've heard, ma'am.
Maybe I made a mistake sending' Lem to Chicago...alone.
I raise wheat to sell, not to play with!
Every grain counts!
Give us this day our daily bread....
Get to work, Kate... that fan's for the files!
If the files are as hot as I am, they need it!
Can you beat it ?
He's praying !
Betcha two bits he's gonna take a chance on the hash !
I'd like some corned beef hash and coffee, please.
You win!
Gee!
I'm sorry!
It was my fault...for putting 'em there.
Mother.
Minnesota, eh?
Swede ?
No.. pa is Scotch Ma is Canadian and I'm plain American.
Lonesome in the big city, aint it ?
What you doin' here?
I'm down here to sell our wheat crop.
Well, old wheat king, how about some bread pudding for desert?
I always do that at home.
It makesMa's work easier.
Living on a farm must be wonderful!
I'm certainly glad to have met you!
I'm glad too.
CROP ESTIMATE PUTS CORN PRICE UP, WHEAT DOWN.
No letter from Lem yet.
I'm worried, Mother.
Lem's doin' what's right...
You keep forgettin' our boy's a grown man now.
maybe you're right, but I can't help thinkin' of him as a little shaver.
Just the same, if he don't sell right, I'll never be able to make both ends meet!
Hey!
How does he rate a private breeze?
How old is this fish anyway ?
Don't ask me Mister!
Look in his mouth!
Figurin' how much it'll cost to take her out tonight, Buddy?
I sold the wheat today...
I hope Pop won't be mad.
He sent you to sell it, didn't he?
But i didn't get his price.
It was droppin' so fast I was afraid to hold out any longer.
I'd rather be deaf than blind, wouldn't you ?
I can see you'd be nice company.
What do you do with your evenings?
You'll never know!
You shouldn't 'a done that!
Fighting over me!
I'd fight anybody who tried to lay a hand on you!
I'm going home....
on the one o'clock train.
Cut short the side order, Kate...
the boss is givin' you the eagle eye!
There's something I wanted to ask..
I wanted to ask...
If you...
If you...
like like..
like living in the city?
Guess one place is good as another.
It's all a wash-out, If you ask me!
Well s'long Kid!
Give my love to the cows and the chickens!
I think...
I'll wait a minute.
YOUR WEIGHT and YOUR FORTUNE.
If you marry the one you are thinking of all will be well.
I left something behind...
got to get it.
If we get married right away we can be home by morning.
Just married a sweet girl waitress in big resyaurant 69 00:30:55,050 -- 00:31:00,706 Know you will love her.
Bringing her home tomorrow.
Your Son
Good girls ain't that free and easy about getting married.
The boy's been roped in!
Oh, Lem, it's wonderful to have a home and a mother and father...
And a man of my own a real two-fisted guy...
to take care of me!
Ma ...this is Kate!
This is the prettiest bridal bouquet I ever saw!
You're Marie, ain't you?
If I catch you playin' with wheat again, I'll whip you!
Father... here's Kate.
How much did you get for the wheat?
Didn't I tell you not to sell under $1.15?
If you'd been tending' to my business 'stead of your own, you'd 'a waited.
Change your clothes and get to work!
The harvesters are comin' in the mornin'!
Don't mind Father....
he's upset.
And he never can bear to be crossed.
I want to talk to you!
I'd like to know what you expected to get out of marrying' Lem.
What any other wife expects.
I married Lem because I...
..I love him..
Women like you love for what they can get out of it But you'll get nothing from me!
You can go back to Chicago!
You certainly smeared it that time!
Now I'll never give Lem up!
...
I am going to make a man of Lem Tustine in spite of you!
.. And if you think he'll let me go away without him guess again!
I'm master here!
My son does what I say and so will you!
Your... father... hit me!
Kate...
I can't strike my own father!
And this is our honeymoon!
I got some surprise for you!
Lem's went an' married a city girl!
Good looker?
The old man's like a mad bull...
tryin' to bust it up An' last night, she slept in the bedroom alone 'an he slept in the loft!
I'm gonna have first look!
Maybe I'll help the old man bust it up!
.
Well, Pa-in-law, where's the blushing' bride?
Get busy!
Do somethin' to earn your keep!
How do you like bein' here?
Bein' here's all right...
I don't think much of the company.
Don't waste any more time...
we got to get started.
Aw, she don't weigh no 187 pounds!
I don't want anything to eat.
Looks like you've popped into a hornrt's nest.
You said it!
There's your chance, Mac...
to check up on that weighing' machine!
Kate... we can't go on like this...
I didn't think anybody could ever come between us......
Kate, Let's forget this quarrel and be happy.
I love you... you're my wife.
If you marry the one you are thinking of all will be well.
Lem!
This aint the bridal suite.
You mind your own business!
that goes for all of you!
And if anyone wants an argument, I got two good ones!
Hailstorm Sweeps Canada
There's a hailstorm comin'!
We'll have to work all night to save the crop!
Divide the men in two shifts, Mac...
double pay for overtime!
...double pay for overtime!
HAILSTORM SWEEPS CENTRAL CANADÁ
WHEAT CROP RUINED
I cut my hand on the machine.
Say, are you crazy?
A girl like you buryin' yourself in a dump like this!
What's the matter with you hicks?
Don't people ever fall in love out here?
You didn't look exactly lovin' when you ran out of that room tonight.
Why don't you chuck all this... come away with me when we finish the harvesting'...
I'll treat you right...
and that's more than old Tustine will ever let Lem do!
I always knew you wasn't a good woman!
I'm goin' to find Lem now...and tell him what kind of wife he's got
What's the use of talkin' to that old devil?
I know how to get even with him...
The storm'll be here in no time...
I used to think the country was clean, that men out here were decent...
But you're all alike...cheap sports!
You all talk big when you want something!
If that's the way you feel about it, I'll give you somethin' more'n talk!
I don't want anything from you!
I can fight for myself!
You agreed to work all night!
We've changed our minds.
We're quitting' now!
My father says he caught you and Mac planning to run away together.
Haven't you anything to say?
Not a thing... you can believe it or not!
If I thought it was true...
Yeah?
What would you do?
Run to Papa?
I'd smash Mac so's he'd never come hanging around my wife again!
You got to learn any man can get a wife!
But it takes more'n a license and a wedding ring to hold her!
I guess our marriage was a mistake.
I'll shoot the first man that leaves my farm!
Listen to me Kate.
I've settled your score with the old man!
I've called the men out... and we're leavin'the wheat to rot in the fields.
I'm leavin' with the men in ten minutes and you're comin' with me...
..If you don't I'll say you put me up to ruining' the wheat!
Are you comin'?
Yes...yes ..but I've got to have time to pack.
Here's somethin' Mac forgot!
We're waitin' for Kate ...she's comin' with me!
I thought I could help you by staying, then you believed that lie about me and Mac.
Mac tried to get me to go with him but I wouldn't.
Maybe with me gone, They'll work and save the wheat
I never loved anybody but you, Goodbye, Kate.
Father... it's Lem!
FATHER!
Son, you know I...
I wasn't meaning' to shoot you.
There's some things worse'n shooting.
One of 'ems the hell..
...you been putting Kate and me through.
...Now I'm going to find Kate and take her away...
where we can live our own lives.
I been wrong, Lem, and I'm sorry Don't leave us!
Let me find Kate and beg her to stay.
No...
I got to find her myself.
I won't try to stop you again, boys.
You can go whenever you want to.
We ain't goin' to leave till your wheat's in!
You're on the wrong road.
There's only more farms like ours that way That's the road to the station.
Let me give you a lift, Kate.
Remember when we first came along this road how happy we were?
When I got your note Kate, I went crazy...
Father, here's Kate.
Can you forgive me...
Kate?
Come back with us...
to your home.

Sir Thomas, that horse of yours is dead lame.
You ought to get rid of him.
I know it, Lady Teel, I'm planning to.
I shall leave more room in my stables for those new mares coming in.
And the Countess Balakireff.
Her string of mounts taking up so much space.
My stables are always at the disposal of such a gallant horsewoman.
Look at her now!
By Jove, she's wonderful!
Toffee!
Bravo!
I'll say.
Oh, you're a lot of fools.
How old are you Reagan?
Twenty-eight, your ladyship.
Six years in your service.
I thought you were a lot older.
Oh, tea!
Won't you have some?
Cocktails!
Would you like to have a cocktail?
Yes.
Here comes Lord Northmore now.
With the Countess.
Doesn't she look charming.
I thought you'd left your complexion in the mud when you barged me this morning.
I'd quite forgotten the incident.
And your clumsiness.
Well, I'm afraid I've been rather a mess.
My horse took a confounded fall.
Be careful you don't repeat it.
What?
The fall.
Your darling Patricia isn't here to protect you, my dear.
It was a bit cold out in the course today.
Doesn't Patricia ever hunt?
Quite.
But not with horses.
But you can't hunt foxes without horses.
Patricia doesn't hunt foxes.
What then, my dear?
Ideals, in London.
Poor girl.
All she'll find is probably trouble.
It's easy to hunt trouble without anything.
Except curiosity.
Patricia.
When you play like that.
With you for my inspiration...
I will always play like that.
I, um...
I want you to join me in a toast.
To my future son-in-law, Lord Northmore.
Lord Northmore.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
And, in response... may I drink to the charming lady who is going to make me the happiest of men.
Patricia.
Patricia!
And may I also express the hope that absence does indeed make the heart grow fonder.
Is Sir Thomas Hanley at home?
Why yes, sir.
He's at dinner.
Who is he here, Briggs?
The usual guests, Miss Patricia.
Shall I tell Sir Thomas that you're home?
No, never mind.
They'll be out almost in a minute now.
Thank you, Briggs.
But Patricia, I must see your father alone.
Now do let me handle everything.
Really, my dear.
You know, it is my place.
Please, Paul.
You don't know Father.
No, no, that is just it.
Good evening, everybody.
Hello, Patricia, my dear.
I'm so glad to see you.
Thanks, Percy.
This is Lord Northmore.
My husband, Mr. Gherardi.
Your...
I say, what was that you said?
Gherardi.
My husband.
Y...y... your husband?
Oh, yes, of course, your husband.
Patricia!
What was that you said just now?
I was introducing my husband, Mr. Gherardi, to Lord Northmore.
Paul, this is Father.
How do you do, sir?
Uh... uh... quite so.
Percy, do be a good fellow, won't you?
And introduce Paul to everybody.
I haven't seen Father today and I'm quite sure he wants to talk to me.
I do, rather.
You'll pardon us, won't you, Paul?
Certainly, ma chérie.
And don't talk about music.
Just horses.
Come on, Daddy.
You can't wheedle me this time.
I'm furious!
I know it.
And the library is a much better place for a scene.
Oh, I...
When you were a child it was stray cats you brought home.
But I'm older now, Father.
Oh...
I say...
What did you say your name was?
Gherardi.
Gherardi.
Oh yes, of course, Gherardi.
Oh, Duchess, may I introduce Mr. uh...
Mr....
Gherardi.
Gherardi.
The Duchess of Brougham.
Your Grace.
I didn't catch the name.
Paul Gherardi.
English?
British subject, shall we say, for the present.
Not a relative of the Shropshire Gherardis?
No, I do not think it is likely.
But then, very little is known of my father.
I've never heard of another family with that name.
And I have never heard of them.
What?
Never heard of the Shropshire Gherardis?
No, Madame.
Well, we had a jolly fine run today.
Do you hunt?
Well...
After a fashion.
What pack?
Well, I have been one of them so long... it doesn't really matter.
I say, how delightfully democratic.
Where do you hunt?
In London.
But something more elusive than the fox.
I've hunted all my life.
I'd like to know what that can be.
A living.
A trade?
Oh, no, no...
No, I play the...
I play the violin.
Oh, how awful!
I had always hoped that I was not.
I'm sure you aren't.
Thank you.
Oh, but I am awful on the horse.
Oh, yes, I think it is so brave of you all, this horse riding.
I only did it once and I soon come off.
Fortunately for me, my horse he was close beside a canal and when the silly animal he was off his guard, I push him in.
You pushed your horse into the canal?
Yes, Madame, before he bite me.
Oh!
Oh!
Thank you.
Goodbye, Daddy.
I'm sorry you won't give us your blessing.
I'd sort of hoped that...
Where are you going?
Home.
This is your home.
Not anymore.
I'm married now.
You couldn't expect Paul to let you support him.
But you can't expect a poor violinist to support you.
At least I presume he's poor.
Yes.
I always said I would call it that.
We'll have to start out rather modestly at first, I suppose.
But I still have the money that grand-mother left me.
How long do you think that's going to last you?
Paul is going to be famous someday.
All he needs is a start.
He made a pretty good one marrying into our family.
He didn't seem awed a bit.
What?
In fact, I had a hard time persuading him to come here tonight.
Do you mean to say that beggar didn't want to meet me?
He didn't want you to misconstrue his motives in marrying me.
I love him.
And he loves me.
Well I'll be...
Goodbye, Daddy.
I'll mail you our address.
Patricia.
Remember, if you do this thing, you'll not only cut yourself off from me, but from all decent society.
I must come to your next recital.
Thank you.
I hope you will.
Will you pardon me.
We must be going now, Paul.
My dear.
Good night.
So glad to have seen you again.
Your Paul is quite charming.
I think so.
Good night.
I hope I'll see you again.
Very soon.
Both of you.
Thank you.
Good night.
Patricia.
Who was that woman?
I never can remember names.
Oh, Countess Olga Balakireff.
They call her London's most daring horsewoman.
That is odd.
She talked to me of nothing but music.
Not surprising at all.
The countess is very versatile.
You rang, Madame?
Throw this to those singers, Higgins, and wish them a Merry Christmas.
Very good, Madame.
Merry Christmas to you.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Leave it open, Higgins.
Madame, it's snowing outside.
I know it.
You're getting more cold-blooded every day.
Yes, Madame.
Higgins.
Madame?
I never knew you had pale blue eyes.
I hate pale blue eyes.
Funny, I never noticed it before.
Yes, Madame.
I think I'll send you back to the kennels where you belong, Higgins.
Thank you, Madame.
Merry Christmas.
It is, isn't it?
Even if we are as poor as church mice.
Oh, my dear, I am so sorry.
It must be a great comedown for you after past years.
Now you're fishing again.
All right.
I'm the unhappiest woman in London.
Ah, but I know you're not.
Such conceit is colossal.
Now I know that I've married a genius.
But I have the right to be conceited... being able to hold you at all... through all these months of poverty.
I think I deserve a medal or something.
Downtrodden wife sticks to poor violinist through thick and thin.
You make me feel very heroic.
You are heroic.
And oh, oh so sweet.
For that I'll have to kiss you.
Now you know how happy I really am.
A clever woman should never give herself away like that.
Oh, it's cold in here.
I know, my fingers they are getting stiff.
Sit down here and I'll rub them for you.
Oh, what should I do without you?
Probably practice until you became unconscious.
Well, I must be at my very best today.
You know, it is perhaps my chance for recognition.
Jacobsen said all I needed now was someone to sponsor me.
I know it, dear.
Is Jacobsen a good agent?
Oh, I am lucky to have him.
You know, he arranges all the concerts and music halls for the best people in London.
You don't know who might be there today.
Where is it?
Um, somewhere in the West End.
I don't know the name.
Jacobsen only gave me the address.
But you can be quite sure it will be someone of great importance.
Oh, you must be getting along.
It's almost 3 o'clock.
Three o'clock?
Oh, yes, I must not keep Serge waiting.
He will be very nervous and he will not be able to play his notes.
Hello, Serge.
Where have you been?
You look like a snowman.
Who wouldn't, waiting out here in the pavement?
But Jacobsen told me 3 o'clock.
It must be long after that.
All the guests have gone in.
Oh, Serge.
A lot of swells.
Who lives here?
Nothing less than a Duke, whatever his name is.
Mr. Gherardi is here.
Won't you come in, sir.
Here he comes now!
Make way for his limbs.
Please, please!
Oh, please!
Hey, who are you jumping?
I'm sorry.
If you'd just let me through.
I'm Mrs. Gherardi.
Clear the way!
Let her through.
I'm so sorry, my dear.
So am I.
Those poor women.
I couldn't help it, you know.
I know it.
Any casualty tonight?
A button.
That will have to be fixed before you go on.
Those confounded souvenir hunters!
I hope the silly girl she swallows the button!
The air seems charged with electricity.
Can't you feel it?
Certainly a bit thick.
So sorry to annoy you, my dear.
And you don't smoke, Mrs. Poulthwaite?
No, dear.
I'm too highly strung.
My friends tell me I have the artistic flair.
You know.
And when Gherardi plays, I can't describe it.
But he gives me something.
Oh, he's here!
I am Mrs. Poulthwaite.
But no introductions are necessary between us.
Oh, Madame, you are so right.
I've done nothing but talk of your divine art.
An inexhaustible subject, I am sure.
I often wonder... how you spend your days before you pour out your soul to us at night.
Mostly on the golf course.
Do you play at all?
Golf?
No.
I'm afraid my whole life is taken up with art.
That hardest of taskmasters.
Yes, it is , isn't it?
And one cannot serve both golf and Mammon.
I beg your pardon?
It doesn't really matter, no.
If you will please excuse me, the exigencies of my art...
You understand.
You're looking so well, my dear.
Perfectly charming.
Quite like Patricia Hanley again.
It's Mrs. Gherardi now, though, isn't it?
Yes.
We really are married, you know.
I could sit and listen to him play for hours.
It must be so interesting being married to a genius.
It is.
They make such model husbands.
So rarely home, you know.
Still I suppose he does belong to the public.
Paul always says that.
One must be generous.
Every time it is something.
You'd lose your head if it wasn't fastened to your shoulders.
That's not a reason why you should lose yours before a concert.
Don't talk back to me, Serge.
You know perfectly well I cannot play without my white silk handkerchief.
Please be more quiet.
They'll hear you out there.
Oh, haven't they gone yet?
They're going.
But you must remember, Paul, you're not at home.
But my white silk handkerchief is lost.
I've brought one with me.
What should I do without you?
Probably use your artistic temperament completely.
What is that for?
Your coat.
Oh, yes.
You are so cool, so calm... so peaceful.
You used to be.
I am very nervous tonight.
All those silly women.
Now, who was that last one, Mrs...
Mrs...
Mrs. Bla-bla-bla something.
I didn't notice.
Probably just one of your gallery girls.
Ah, gallery girls.
You're not getting jealous, are you?
Who?
Of all those silly women, I mean.
What, dear?
Patricia, you are not listening to me.
Yes, I am.
What was it you said?
I asked you if you were getting jealous.
Because you've arrived?
Hardly, Paul.
I know just how susceptible you are to flattery.
Oh, no, no, no.
There you are quite wrong.
I do not know anyone who is less influenced by that sort of thing than I am.
On the contrary.
I feel myself slowly degenerating into the great man's wife... in spite of myself.
What are you talking about?
Haven't you ever noticed her tagging behind every great man?
To her husband she's sort of watchdog.
And to other women a human monster who holds her man with a cup of tea, and a needle and thread.
Oh, don't be so foolish, Patricia.
I won't listen to you.
Paul, look at me.
Are you ill?
Ill?
No, why?
Every once in a while you get the most haunted look in your eyes.
Haunted?
Are you trying to flatter me with the ghosts of the past?
It isn't a ghost.
It's still alive.
What do you mean?
Oh, I can't explain it.
But it's there.
And you're so pale lately.
You have been brought up with apple-cheeked, port ridden faces
Let me tell you, Patricia, there is no such thing as a musician with a fox hunter's complexion.
Oh, and they're all pale and interesting, is that it?
What are you driving at?
Your health.
And I think you should see a doctor.
No, no, he would only tell me to rest... and if I stopped now after working so long,
I shall probably be very ill and maybe I shall die, hm?
But you're always so strung.
No, I'm all right, really.
But if only people would let me alone!
People?
Yes, I'm naturally very nervous before a concert.
Please, Patricia, don't get me all worked up like this before I go on.
They are waiting for you.
All right, all right, I'm coming.
Oh, how can I play after all this?
At your best, Paul.
I'm sure of it.
And I think it's better if I don't sit in the box tonight.
You think of everything, don't you?
It has made me very nervous lately to see you sit there.
Yes.
Shall I wait for you?
No...
No, no, you are very tired and I shall be a little late tonight.
Jacobsen again.
Yes, he has some new contract to discuss.
You might as well have an owl for your agent.
He is very wide awake, isn't he?
They'll be tired of applauding for you in a minute.
Good night, my dear.
The concert's over early, ma'am.
I didn't go to the concert.
Shall you be wanting anything, ma'am?
No.
Oh, don't forget Mr. Gherardi's warm milk.
At what time, ma'am?
Well, just get it ready.
I'll heat it.
Very good, ma'am.
There is a great crowd again here tonight.
Doesn't sound so formidable.
Oh, your guests are always formidable, my dear.
I...
I cannot play again tonight.
I'm too tired.
I know just how you feel.
I have a little headache myself.
My head feels positively empty.
Just go in for one moment.
Then make your excuses.
Oh... must I?
I'd rather you did.
Oh, Martin.
Yes, milady?
A bottle of champagne and two glasses in my boudoir.
Very good, milady.
And Martin, bring Mr. Gherardi's violin.
Very good, milady.
Mr. Gherardi!
What's the matter, Paul?
I don't know.
I have that strange dizziness again.
Maybe it's the wine.
Yes, that must be it.
Or my nerves.
No, it cannot be the wine, I...
I didn't drink enough.
Come here and let me rub your head.
No, no, no, no.
I must make myself... remember that phrase.
I have begun to forget lately.
What would I do if I could not play anymore?
How absurdly you talk.
It is so peculiarly difficult to remember those notes.
Ah, yes.
Yes, it has come back to me.
All right now?
Yes, I think so.
Now that I can play...
I don't want to anymore.
Paul, look at me.
And how can I play... when you are looking at me like that?
That's rather a dubious compliment, isn't it?
You know what I mean?
I play, play, play!
Everyone thinks I'm a machine for their amusement.
You are tired, aren't you?
Yes, I...
I think I am going home.
That would be a novelty.
Good night, Paul.
You know very well I can't go.
You can't?
Or don't want to?
All the same, I'm going.
Good night, Paul.
Please leave me alone.
I'm perfectly all right.
Very good, sir.
This way, please.
Oh, what has happened, Paul?
Nothing, nothing.
It's only these fellows would leave me alone.
But it must be something to bring you home in an ambulance like this.
He's just fainted, madam.
It ain't no case to worry about.
Where will we take him, madam?
Right in there, please.
Are you really all right, dear?
Oh, yes, yes.
I can get undressed by myself, thank you.
But what happened?
Oh, nothing, nothing...
Jacobsen, he kept me very late, I... discussing the contract.
I was very tired, and I...
I just fainted, that's all.
You better let us help you get undressed...
Leave me alone...
All right...
All right, you can help me.
Yes?
Who is it?
I'm the doctor.
Did they bring the patient in here?
Yes, in this bedroom here.
Oh, thank you.
Patricia!
Why, Alan Pomeroy.
Doctor Alan Pomeroy now.
Doctor?
What on earth are you doing back in England?
Just trying to capitalize on some important-looking diplomas they gave me in Vienna and Berlin.
Patricia, what are you talking about?
Just because I take your advice and have the doctor?
There is no need for him to verbally vivisect me.
He's not, Paul.
Better let me go in alone.
But my husband is all right, isn't he?
Oh, quite.
I'm sorry to have frightened you with the ambulance, but it was the most comfortable way of getting him home.
His nerves are in bad shape and he needs a good rest.
But he'll be all right.
Oh, it is you.
Well, Gherardi, how are you feeling now?
I'm all right, thank you.
Remember what I told you.
What you need is rest and quiet.
I'll drop in and see you tomorrow.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I shall be quite all right in the morning.
All I need now is a little sleep.
Good night.
Good night.
I'm Doctor Pomeroy's chauffeur.
I think this belongs here.
Thank you.
How is he?
He'll be asleep soon.
There's nothing serious the matter, if he obeys orders.
Figure running into you again.
Didn't you ever expect me to get married?
Oh, yes.
Every time I suggested it.
Well, you see, I finally followed your suggestion.
Rather too literally for the unselfish applause of any bitter rival.
When did you give up globetrotting?
When I took up Medicine as a pursuit... instead of you.
You probably made a very wise choice.
And I sincerely hope you have.
From the bottom of my heart.
Thank you, Alan.
How did Paul ever happen to get you of all the doctors in London?
They called me.
I live quite close...
I see.
The Countess Balakineff is a very close friend of ours.
She was very wise not to worry you by phoning.
Yes, the Countess has always been so thoughtful.
What is wrong with my husband?
Oh, just too much popularity.
I'm glad it's nothing serious.
It won't be if he does what I tell him.
He's on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
We just caught it in time.
You're sure?
If he obeys orders.
There must be no late hours, a sane diet and no excitement of any kind.
But of course you know his profession.
Yes, and I'm afraid he'll have to give it up for the present... if he expects to continue it in the future.
In fact, he must give up all his present habits.
Here's a rough diet for a starter.
And I advise you to take him for a complete rest away from London.
But you don't know my husband.
Are you quite sure that you do?
Very few know a genius.
Except his valet.
Or his wife.
I think I'd better call again to see how he's getting on.
May I?
Of course you may.
Any time, Alan.
I'm sure Paul needs medical attention, he's not quite himself lately.
Yes, these cases sometimes require patience.
I'll drop by tomorrow.
Do.
Patricia, my milk is cold.
Patricia!
Patricia!
My milk is cold and my room is too hot.
All right, Paul.
I'm coming.
Is that necessary at this hour?
I said is that necessary at this hour?
Well, I must do something.
How flattering you are, my dear.
So are you, ma chérie.
I have to begin again sometime, you know?
Or they'll forget me.
How will they ever forget you?
When you make such terrible noises.
What if I should lose my technique?
I'm afraid you already have, my dear.
I only need a little practice, you know.
Patricia.
Daddy.
How's my little pet?
Little?
You flatter me.
I'm nearly three pounds heavier.
Glad to see me?
If you're not here to say I told you so.
On the contrary.
I'm here to tell you that I am proud of you.
Because Paul and I have separated?
No, because you've taken offenses like a thoroughbred, that's why.
I came to ask you to come home.
But I can't do that.
You don't mean to tell me that you're still in love with this...
No.
I'm quite sure that it's dead.
But my pride is still very much alive.
The papers are full of innuendos, scandals, columns gossiping about it...
You've got to give up his name.
Please, I know.
But I must work things out in my own way.
Alone.
I rather thought you'd accept my help.
I can't, Daddy.
Not now.
I haven't decided what I want to do.
Just yet.
That's dinner.
Yes.
Will you have something?
No, thank you.
I rather hoped you'd come and have a bite with me.
I'm sorry.
Some other time?
I'd love to.
Pardon, ma'am.
It's the same gentleman again, ma'am.
I told him you were not at home.
Well, I'd better be going.
Goodbye, Pat, dear.
Good night, Daddy.
Good night.
Alan!
Sir Thomas!
How are you?
Splendid.
Glad to see you again, old fellow.
How's the hunting?
I was going to ask you that.
I guess I've forgotten how.
Nonsense.
One never forgets those things.
Have you seen Patricia lately?
Patricia's in now.
She sent me to tell you.
Can I go straight in?
She's expecting you.
Well...
Goodbye, Sir Thomas.
And thank you.
Good night, old fellow.
There's something about a fire.
I know.
And it was positively stupid of me letting the gramophone turn itself off.
And it took you the entire evening to find just the proper musical setting, didn't it?
Well, you see, I have a childlike faith in uh... soul vibrations.
And not much in gramophones anymore, I'm afraid.
Well, they're better than radios.
Imagine having a perfectly good proposal interrupted by uh... the announcement of the weather forecast.
Silence would be better than that, wouldn't it?
It's the only answer you've ever given me.
Except soul vibrations.
I find it much more discreet to trust myself to them.
You're very tantalizing at times, Patricia.
So are you.
But you must listen to me.
I know it, that's the trouble.
You can't expect me to go on like this.
I don't.
I'm going to send you home now.
Oh, no!
It's twelve o'clock.
What a reputation you will have with the porter.
And the first strange man to come here, too.
Well, I should hope so.
I think you'd better leave by the window.
Oh, no.
It would make me look too experienced.
And you really aren't at all.
Maybe you're right.
I've never tried burglary.
I'll say it for you.
You shouldn't have done that, Alan.
Could I have my answer?
Alan, you're positively incorrigible.
Well, that sounds encouraging.
What about lunch tomorrow?
What do my soul vibrations say?
Yes.
Shall we make it at one?
Are you trying to make me fall in love with you?
Well, you see, I have only one visiting card left.
Who on earth could that be at this hour?
Wait a minute.
Telegram for Mrs. Gherardi.
Thank you.
What is it?
What's the matter?
A telegram from Serge.
Serge?
Paul's accompanist.
Oh.
Paul was stricken on the stage tonight.
Another fainting spell?
He's helpless.
He may never be able to play again.
How awful, Alan.
How horrible that will be for Paul.
I warned him.
Where is he?
At the hospital.
He's alone and asking for me.
What are you going to do?
I must go to him.
And then?
A sick man has no one to care for him but his wife.
And his physician.
You will need my help.
If you can give it generously.
Under the circumstances, anything but generosity would be impossible.
I'll get my wrap.
Patricia!
Patricia, do you hear?
I am thirsty.
Do you think I do not know?
Why you stand out there in the wind.
I was watching the ocean.
It is very beautiful today.
So blue... and peaceful.
What else were you watching?
There is nothing else to watch down here.
Except?
Alan Pomeroy's car.
Every day you're out there... waiting.
Is there anything else to wait for?
No.
Not for you to.
Please, Paul.
Don't start that all over again.
If you keep yourself worked up, you'll never get well.
I won't anyway.
But do not forget.
My brain is not paralyzed.
Your will seems to be.
How can you improve if you don't try to help the doctor?
And why should I help him?
Do you think I do not know... why you came back to me?
You should, Oh...
I do.
It was because you could not desert a helpless cripple for another man.
Paul!
Even your society would rebel... against such a divorce.
And remember this, Patricia.
Whatever happens...
I will always be lying here... between you.
Well, here comes your gay Lothario.
Go.
Go quickly!
Run to meet him!
Tell him what I have just said and see how long he'll hang around here.
Hello, Pat.
You're late today, Alan.
Yes, I'm afraid I am rather.
You haven't given up hope, have you?
Has he?
Paul doesn't seem to want to get well.
That's his greatest handicap.
I can't quite understand it.
I can.
But he must get well, Alan.
For his own sake he must.
Well, it's been nearly a month since the operation.
And he can't move a finger.
Is there nothing further one can do?
There is no better surgeon than Dr. Krause of Vienna.
How awful it would be for Paul... if the operation proved a complete failure.
I'm afraid it has.
Well, Gherardi, how's everything today?
Oh, marvelous.
The sea is such a beautiful blue.
At least so they tell me.
Well, I'm glad to see you so much more cheerful.
Who would not be?
It is spring again.
And the birds are singing.
Oh, you've heard them.
We're having our first touch of summer.
Pretty soon it will be the month of lovers.
Lovers?
Yes.
For some people.
Do you feel that?
What?
Feel that?
No.
Nor that?
No.
Try to move your fingers like you used to when you played the violin.
You know very well I cannot!
Oh, why do you torture me like this?
Don't touch me again.
I'm afraid it's no use.
I'm sorry, Gherardi.
I wish I could help you.
You can!
By going away.
And never coming back again.
I might as well.
I've done everything I can.
And all you are going to.
I'm disappointed.
We trusted too much in Dr. Krause's skill.
Undoubtedly.
But... in the garden of Eden there was a serpent, you know.
I'm afraid the worthy Dr. Krause would hardly take that as a compliment.
Goodbye.
No use my coming back.
It is hopeless?
You're quite sure?
For him and for us.
Goodbye, Pat.
Would you like to walk to the car with me?
Yes, I would.
Why... you can walk!
And play, too.
I have known it for some time.
And still you laid there like that?
How long has it been since you've known?
Ever since the doctor took off my bandages.
I found out when he left.
That afternoon.
Then you're all right again, Paul?
You're all right.
No.
No, I have just discovered.
I am all wrong.
But how wonderful the operation wasn't a failure after all.
It was not.
But I am.
My heart too was paralyzed.
With fame.
And I cannot expect you to live here anymore.
Among all my ghosts.
You are free, Patricia.
Perhaps.
We are both free, Paul.
Yes...
Yes, I suppose we are.
I can always go back to my violin.
While you...
You can go to him.
Anytime you wish to now.
It must have taken something more than... mere selfishness to make you lie motionless between me and my happiness.
Just cowardice.
I wanted so to hold you.
And I only succeeded in making myself very melodramatic.
Imagine my trying to hold you with pity.
When love was all that was necessary.

[Chattering In German]
[Both Laughing]
Well, Roy, you seem to like my country.
Like it?
I think it's marvelous.
Say, I wish we were staying here two years instead of just two weeks.
But you know, Karl, it does sound funny hearing you call it "your country. "
I keep forgetting you're not English.
Oh, sometimes I...
Well, I feel almost English myself.
Well, that's natural.
After all, you can't be at Oxford three years... without feeling slightly British.
[Band]
I wish Helen were here.
After all you've said about her, I don't blame you.
[German]
Your brother is not coming today, Herr Rutledge?
Oh, yes, he'll be along soon, Gretchen.
Nothing can keep Monte away from this good beer.
[Chuckles] Nothing except a good-looking woman.
[Laughs] Jawohl.
That brother of yours, he's a naughty boy, but I like him.
He has a way with them, hey, Gretchen?
[Laughs] You, you don't know half of it.
Another conquest for Monte.
Yes.
I don't know why he wants to mess about with every woman he meets.
Yeah, but you have Helen.
I'm not at all sure.
I'm not half good enough for her.
She must be a wonderful girl.
Oh, she is.
She's marvelous.
You'll have to meet her when we get back to Oxford.
- I'd like to.
- Would you like to see what she looks like?
Yes.
I didn't know you had a photograph of her.
Yeah, and neither does Helen.
I took it myself when she wasn't looking.
Really?
Oh.
Stunning, isn't she?
Why, she's marvelous.
Cheerio, you blighters.
Hello, it's Monte.
Meet the countess.
Step up, gents, to the one and only...
Now, Monte, don't, please.
Oh, it's all right.
This little pretzel doesn't understand a word of English.
No?
Gretchen!
[German] Ja!
[Gretchen, In German]
[Countess In German]
[Chuckling]
Found her at the museum.
Yeah, she's a work of art, all right.
You should have left her there.
[All Laughing]
[German] Shh!
Quiet!
I say, Monte, why do you bring around this sort?
Bring her?
Good heavens, I can't get rid of her.
Go home, will you?
Go home.
[German]
You see, I'm stuck.
Hello.
Who's the dowager?
That's Helen.
Oh.
But, of course, that's only a snapshot.
Wait till you meet her.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Go away!
[Laughs]
[German] [Men Laughing]
I say.
This is getting serious.
I've got to get rid of her.
Oh, you know, I have a very important engagement in just 15 minutes.
I say, you chaps, be... be sporting and take her off my hands.
But after all, Monte...
We may be sporting, but we're not feeble-minded.
Well, you can do what you please with her.
I'm going.
Hey, listen, Monte...
Auf Wiedersehen.
[ContinuesInGerman]
Here, just a minute now.
Please.
Leave her to me.
I'll get rid of her.
Please.
Yes.
[German]
[German] Ja.
[German] Nein.
Nein.
Nein.
Nein.
Roy!
No!
Roy!
[Roy] No, carry on.
Carry on.
Pretty boy, you please me very much.
[Doorbell Rings]
What's that?
It is nothing.
I am not at home to anyone except my husband.
And he is away on army business.
He will not be home for hours.
So, you see...
Charming.
[German] [German]
But really, I-I say you mustn't think that...
Your name?
My name is, uh, Rutledge, sir.
You are stopping in Munich?
At the Hotel Bayrischer Hof, sir.
[Clicks Heels Together]
My seconds will call on you later.
But I say you...
There is nothing further to discuss.
Sailing, sailing over the bounding main
Where many a wintery wind shall blow 'ere Jack comes home again
Hello.
Where you going?
Sailing, sailing England.
England?
Why, we're not going back for 10 days.
What's wrong?
[Clicks Heels Together]
Baron Von Kranz.
Who's he?
Oh, he's just a friend of mine.
Really?
Quite a social success, aren't you?
How do you meet these barons?
Well, unfortunately, I met this one through his wife.
And this means...
A duel.
Can you imagine it?
Running away?
Oh, don't be an ass.
Roy.
You don't expect me to go through with a farce like this.
It's the only thing you can do.
Oh, there you go again.
I suppose when a woman's no good and her husband finds it out,
I've got to get shot, just because it's the honorable thing to do.
Well, what do you think people will say?
You'll never live it down.
What do I care what people say?
Well, you can talk all you like, Monte, but you can't walk out like this.
Can't I?
Good-bye.
See you at Oxford.
Hello, Roy.
Hello, Karl.
Well, what's up?
Where's Monte?
He's gone to England.
England?
Well, what's the matter?
Oh, nothing.
But I say...
[Knocking]
Herr Rutledge?
Herr Rutledge?
Yes?
Von Richter.
Von Schlieben.
We represent Colonel Baron Von Kranz.
Yes.
Have you chosen your second?
According to custom, we have selected the time and place.
You have the choice of weapons.
What is your choice?
[German]
What is this?
Golden Aue.
Why, that's a famous dueling place near here.
It says at 4:00 tomorrow morning.
4:00 in the morning.
Well, how did this happen?
I
- I'm sorry, Karl.
I
- I lost my temper with one of your officers.
But, Roy...
Say, Karl, do you know how to be a second?
[Engine Running]
Wait here, Roy.
[German]
Bitte.
[German] [German]

Good luck, Roy.

[Roy] Hey, will you cut it out?
[All Yelling, Cheering]
Hey, did anybody see my green socks?
[Man] Check in the garbage.
Hello there, Roy.
Hello, Elliot.
Glad to see you.
I'm certainly glad to see you back.
Thank you.
And where's your German accent?
Well, I couldn't get it past the Custom officials.
Oh, I say, what have you done to your arm?
Oh, nothing.
It's just a little scratch.
I was hunting in Germany.
I'll see you at dinner?
Righto.
Good.
See you later.
Why aren't you getting dressed?
Aren't you coming to meet Helen?
Oh, yes, but don't remind me of it.
Don't be foolish.
She expects us for tea.
Tea?
Listen, it'll do you good to meet a nice girl.
Oh, well, all right, but first we've gotta get you dressed.
Say, we've gotta get him dressed.
He's going to see his girl.
Now, now, wait a minute, now.
Listen, I've gotta have my shirt!
[Overlapping Yelling]
Wait a minute.
I...
Listen, I'm old enough to dress myself!
No, you're not.
Will you cut it out?
Say, listen, will you pl...
[All Cheering]
Will you...
Hey, my green socks!
[Doorbell Rings]
[Ring]
Is Helen in?
Miss Helen is not at home, sir.
She's expecting us.
Would you care to wait?
Yes, thank you.
Fine reception.
Oh.
Roy, maybe she's forgotten.
Not Helen.
She's not that sort.
Oh.
Roy, I feel sick.
I
- I think I'd better go.
- Monte, will you sit down?
- Oh, I've got an awful headache.
I think I'll go to the chemist and get something for it.
Monte.
[Door Closes]
- Roy!
- Helen!
Oh, terribly sorry.
Mother's fault.
Shopping.
I simply flew My, isn't it hot?
You shouldn't have hurried so.
Oh, but I wanted to.
Roy, you've no right to look so cool.
I'm broiling.
Feel.
Yes, you are, aren't you?
No, not one.
Well, you're so marvelous, I
- I hardly dare.
Oh, silly.
Well, that's better.
Cigarette, Roy?
I thought your brother was coming.
Went out with a headache.
Poor boy.
It must be the heat.
[Paperboy] Extry, extry!
All about the war!
[Continues Yelling, Indistinct]
Well, they've done it.
I never thought they would.
I still can't believe it.
Well, it must be true.
It's official.
Oh, shut up.
I'm trying to think.
It's terrible.
Karl, you won't have to go, will you?
Me?
Oh, Roy, I hope not.
Oh, they can't want me.
I'm not a soldier.
What use would I be to them?
I couldn't... kill anyone.
They couldn't make me do that, could they, Roy?
Oh, I think it'll all be over in a couple of weeks.
I'm not so sure.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Then suppose England comes in.
Why, Roy, that'd be horrible.
I never could do that.
Why, I love England.
Oh, will you shut up?
Monte, Germany's declared war on France.
Hmm?
Oh.
Oh, Roy, how do you spell "ecstatic"?
Hmm?
[Knocking]
Special delivery letter for Karl Arnstedt.
What's the matter, Karl?
Someone ill?
Karl.
May I ask the Prime Minister if he has any information he can give us today.
Our ambassador at Berlin received his passport at 7:00 last evening.
And since 11:00 last night, a state of war has existed between Germany and ourselves.
[Murmuring]
Seven?
What size?
A seven and a half if you please.
I
- I'm afraid it's a bit small, sir.
Move along, there.
Move along.
You'll grow into it.
Present arms!
Come on there.
Come on.
Present arms!
Give it to him, you bloody fool.
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Sleeping sickness?
Here, here.
Let go of that gun, you clinging vine.
Let go, do you hear?
God, you're enough to turn a man's stomach.
Hey, you with the fallen arches...
I've enlisted, Monte, in the Royal Flying Corps.
You're a fool, Roy.
[Chattering] Really?
How lovely.
My grandfather was in the guard during the Revolution.
Oh, he was?
Oh, Roy, you look marvelous in uniform.
Thank you.
Doesn't he?
It's ripping.
Where?
Tell me, what have you joined?
The infantry?
No, the Royal Flying Corps.
Oh, of course.
And all the misery in this world has been caused... by and for capitalism!
Why should we fight this war?
For capitalism?
You will die!
You will die!
All your sons will die for capitalism!
Down with capitalism!
Down with war!
Down with the anarchists.
[Man] That's right. [Clamoring]
[Murmuring]
[Officer] Get back now.
Who do you think you're shoving?
There's the man I'd like to kiss.
What's the matter?
Afraid of a kiss?
[Man] Maybe he's yeller!
Go on, you.
Go on and fight for your country.
[Woman] Slacker!
[CrowdYelling]
Come on.
But really, you don't understand.
I didn't mean to do anything.
Say, I'd rather marry the girl.
[Man, Indistinct] You'll never get your wings that way.
Hi.
How are you?
Oh, boy.
Say, listen, that first solo flight certainly is a great thrill.
It certainly felt great.
[Engine Sputtering]
I will.
[Man] Wonder who that is out there.
That was a fine landing.
Look at him come out of there.
[Continues Indistinct]
[Sighs]
Look, boys, it's Monte.
[Whistling "America"]
Hey, how'd it go, Monte?
Oh, great.
Well, tonight's the night, Monte.
Yeah.
Say, listen, be more cheerful.
You have a treat in store meeting Helen.
Must be Friday the 13th.
Gee, I-I wonder if she'll wear her canteen uniform.
If she does, you can count me out.
Oh, she looks stunning in it.
Who wants to be stunned?
I'm only going as a favor to you.
You and I don't like the same kind of girls.
[Guffaws] Hurry up, will you?
Oh, it's a waste of time to polish these.
She'll probably step all over them the first dance anyway.
Safer to sit it out.
Quiet little corner and a have a chat about votes for women.
Hello there.
Hello.
Whose window are you warbling under tonight?
Lady Randolph's Charity Ball.
Wash your neck and come along.
Oh, but I haven't been invited.
That's all right.
I'm on the committee.
No, I don't think I'll go.
A smart boy.
[Waltz]
I wonder where Helen is.
She should be here by this time.
How do you do, sir?
There's she is.
Don't point.
It's rude.
Oh, Helen.
Roy!
Hello.
Hello, old thing.
You're frightfully late.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
Oh, Helen, this is Monte.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Well, that's done at last.
You know, you two have been avoiding each other for weeks.
Helen, may I have this next dance?
What?
Oh, of course.
Oh, Roy, there you are.
Good evening, Lady Randolph.
I must say, you take your duties on my committee very lightly.
I'm sorry.
Where have you been?
You've completely disarranged my program.
There are no end of things to be done.
Helen dear, you don't mind, do you?
Come along, Roy.
Come at once.
I'm sorry, Helen.
Uh, Monte, would you take this next dance with Helen?
Oh, how do you do, Monte?
How do you do?
Now come along.
[Lady Randolph Continues, Indistinct]
Well?
[Waltz]
[Ends]
Ahem.
Oh.
Hello, Roy.
I
- I really must go and find, uh, Jimmy Kerrigan.
He has something most important to tell me.
I...
Who is this Jimmy Kerrigan?
Kerrigan?
I've never heard of him.
Oh.
[Waltz]
What are you thinking of?
If you must know, I was thinking of Monte.
Do you like him?
Yes, I like him.
He's a marvelous dancer.
Well, Monte does all those things well.
Helen.
What?
May I?
Oh, Monte.
Oh, hello there.
Come sit down.
You having a better time than you expected, Monte?
Marvelous.
Been dancing with a beautiful brunette, name of Eleanor.
She's perfect.
Oh, Eleanor Madden.
You don't really think she's beautiful?
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty?
Stop it.
I'm not a cat.
Yes, you are.
Well, if I'm a kitty, I'm a thirsty kitty.
Roy dear, will you please get me a glass of punch?
Why, of course I will.
No, I'll go, Roy.
No, I'm the committee.
You stay here and look after this wallflower.
But really, I...
Oh, if you'd rather not...
Well, I-I didn't mean...
Don't you like wallflowers?
I shouldn't have done that.
Oh, you're not sorry, Monte.
Awfully sorry.
I had no right to.
What if I'm glad?
But what about Roy?
Isn't that my business?
I suppose so, but...
Hush.
Compliments of the committee.
Thanks awfully, Roy.
Well, has he been properly charming?
Me?
More than charming.
Good for you, Monte.
Taste?
[Waltz]
She loves me.
She blisters you.
It's worth it.
Is she worth it?
Depends on who she is.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Well, thank goodness Lady Randolph's lost sight of me for a minute.
Roy, you've been neglecting me shamefully.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
You see, it's this beastly committee.
Lady Randolph won't let me alone a minute.
Oh, Roy, there you are.
Yes, here I am.
Do you mind?
Where is that list?
Would you mind finding Sir John for me?
It's about my Canteen Unit.
I must have the queen's signature.
It's so important.
My dear, why don't you get into your uniform?
You look so pretty in it.
And, Monte, shouldn't you dance with Mary Blunt?
Yes, why don't you?
And, Roy.
Roy, will you find Sir John?
I want you to lead the grand dance for me.
And really, there are so many things you've got to do.
[Continues, Indistinct] Yes.
L-I'm terribly sorry.
Uh, back soon.
You see, those girls have been looking for you.
But, Lady Randolph, I'm supposed to...
So, you've really joined Lady Lizzie's Canteen Unit?
Rather.
Chance of a lifetime.
We go to France in two weeks.
Two weeks?
Well, Roy says you're sailing the 15th.
Is that so?
[Yawns] Bored?
Tired.
Take me home, Monte.
Home?
It's not far.
I've taken a flat in town near Canteen Headquarters.
But, I mean, Roy will be quite upset to find you gone.
That's what he gets for being on committee.
But, really...
Very well.
I'll find someone else.
Oh, I didn't mean to be rude.
Well, come on then.
[Engine Off]
Are we here?
Well, it's number 27.
Wanna come up for a cigarette and a drink?
Oh, really, you must be awfully tired.
No, I'm not.
Come see my room.
I've only had a place of my own for a week.
It's a new toy.
What a baby you are.
Alley-oop.
All right.
Well, this is jolly.
Sit down and I'll get you a drink.
Thanks.
Say when.
Whoa.
When!
When!
Would you be shocked if I put on something more comfortable?
I'll try to survive.
Well, are you more comfortable now?
Yes, are you?
Oh, yes.
You know, it seems strange being here like this after hearing Roy rave about you for months.
Does Roy rave?
Oh, rather.
He idolizes you.
Oh, I do wish he wouldn't.
It makes me feel guilty.
I can understand his raving now.
Oh, don't be silly.
You're not a bit like Roy, are you?
I should say not.
Roy's frightfully high-minded.
He doesn't approve of me.
He wouldn't approve of me either if he knew what I'm really like.
Doesn't he know?
No.
When I'm with Roy, I'm the way Roy wants me to be.
That's caddish, isn't it?
But I can't help it.
I understand.
Roy wouldn't.
May I ask you a very personal question?
Yes.
Do you love Roy?
No, not really.
Not the way Roy wants me to love him.
I can't.
Roy's love means marriage and children... and never anyone but Roy.
I couldn't bear that.
I wanna be free.
I wanna be gay and have fun.
Life's short, and I wanna live while I'm alive.
I know, that...
that's the way I feel too.
I...
I think I'd better go.
Must you?
I really should.
Pull.
Cold in here now, isn't it?
Have you a match?
Why so gloomy?
God, I'm rotten.
I can't see it.
Can't you?
Well, then you're rotten too.
What do you mean?
And Roy worships you.
You!
Well?
Don't you make yourself sick...
you and Roy.
God, that's funny.
Get out of here!
Don't worry.
I can't get out fast enough.
Get out!
[Door Closes] And stay out!
Where have you been?
Oh, I, uh...
I stopped at a... at a bar after I took Helen home.
Oh.
How'd you like her?
Oh, she's all right.
Pass in a crowd, eh?
I daresay she would.
Just what do you mean by that?
Listen, Roy, let me tell you something.
Even if it hurts.
Yes?
I wouldn't be so idealistic about Helen if I were you.
And why not?
Well, I...
I just wouldn't, that's all.
Well, why not?
Oh, I don't know.
Forget it.
Never mind crawling.
Out with it.
Listen, Roy, I tell you.
Women are all the same.
You look at every woman as a barmaid.
You don't know anything about decent women.
Oh, all right.
You know it all then.
Oh, you've said enough.
Shut up.

Yeah, just our luck.
Lucky we weren't both killed.
Well, we're through.
Herr Kapitän.

Look at it, Monte.
Roy, it's falling!
Look at that, Roy.
Great, isn't it?
They're done for.
Look out!
Run!
[Whistling]
Just a minute.
Why the blazes don't you look where you're going, sir?
I'm sorry, sir.
Isn't it customary to salute one's superior officer?
Thank you.
What is your name, sir?
Lieutenant Roy Rutledge.
Make a note of that.
Yes, sir.
[Helen] Would you like to try it and find out?
[Man] They are.
They glisten in the sun.
What the hell you trying to do?
It took me three hours to write that.
You're nothing but a pest anyhow.
Sitdown.
Oh ,don't,Bruce.
You shouldn't smoke so many.
What difference does it make?
You know it's bad for you.
Buy a chocolate, miss.
Change, miss.
Please.
That's a good boy.
What a life it would be married to you.
Oh, you don't fancy it?
Beastly.
No smokes.
Think of all the money we'd save.
What would we spend it on?
Oh, a diamond dog collar.
For me?
No.
I'd buy a muzzle for you.
You wouldn't spoil my beautiful mustache, would you?
No.
We'd keep that in the parlor under glass.
Hello, Helen.
Oh, hello, Roy.
Roy, I'd like you to meet Captain Redfield.
Lieutenant Rutledge.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Beastly weather.
Yes, isn't it.
- You'll get used to it.
- Thanks.
Gee, it's great to see you again, Helen.
It's been four whole days.
Really?
- Have you been over long?
- Three weeks.
Oh.
Three weeks.
Everything all right up your way?
Oh, yes.
Your squadron near here?
Twenty miles up the line.
Twenty miles.
That far.
- You chaps have it rather soft, haven't you?
- Do you think so?
Well, I mean to say being able to dash about the countryside and all that.
Wish I'd picked the R.F.C.
Well, why didn't you?
Roy.
Well, I must be going.
Oh.
Don't go.
I think I'd better.
Good-bye, Helen, and don't forget your promise.
I won't.
Who's that bag of wind?
Would you mind not talking about my friends like that?
Oh, now, Helen, please.
Oh, you were perfectly beastly to him.
I'm terribly sorry.
Guess my nerves are a bit raw.
Things haven't been so easy this last week.
Oh, you've been fighting?
Did you shoot down any Boche?
Yes.
I managed to get a couple.
Really?
How thrilling.
Tell me about it.
Well, there's really nothing much to tell.
Three bars of chocolate, miss.
[Piano:

[Chattering]
Oh, Jymes.
Oh, Jymes.
Bread, Jymes.
We want bread.
[Chanting] We want bread!
Coming, sir.
Coming!
Did you ever try hurrying, Jymes?
Sorry, sir, but I stopped to dig a few of the cockroaches out of it, sir.
[Laughter] Well, put it down.
[Clamoring]
Well, where's the bread?
Did you ever try hurrying, sir?
- [Laughter]
- Jymes, more bread.
Drown the cockroaches this time.
Yes, sir.
Jymes, what's the taste in this soup?
I can't say, sir.
[Man] It's not soup, it's soap.
[Man# 2]I thinkit 'sshoepolish.
Sorry, sir.
Cook said the soup was a bit weak tonight.
Maybe you taste the disinfectant in the water, sir.
Oh.
Well, strike me blind, it's a hair.
[Man] Wash it off and wear it, Baldy. [Laughing]
Hello, you chaps.
Hello, Monte.
How goes it?
[Men Singing On Victrola]
Still no news of Harry?
No.
Somebody always gets it on the night patrol.
What do you think, Marryat?
You saw it happen.
Is there any chance he got down alive?
No, I don't think so.
The searchlights got him.
We were flying low and they heard us.
We started to climb, but it was too late.
Shrapnel began bursting all around him.
Two bursts caught him and he started to drop.
It was awful to see him down there, twisting and diving... crippled, always dropping.
Trying every way to get clear of those lights.
Then another burst got him.
We could hear him screaming...
Stop!
I can't stand it.
[Man] Good thing he took your place, Rutledge.
Youmight'vegotitinsteadofhim .
Oh, I'll get it sooner or later.
We'll all get it.
Isn't there any end to this?
Oh, shut up.
You're always whining.
Shut up yourself.
Who'll make me?
I'll make you.
[Clamoring]
Sit down, Jack, and be quiet.
All right.
What's the matter with you fellas?
Would anybody like to take Monte's place on tonight's patrol?
[Jeering] Lay off.
[Man] No more soup.
Weneedsome.
No more soup.
We need some soup.
[Men Shouting] [Man] Jymes!
Hurry it up.
[Laughter] [Man] Splendid.
Splendid, Jymes.
[Laughter Continues]
Splendid.
That's what comes from hurrying.
What was dinner before you dropped it, Jymes?
A tasty bit of salmon, sir.
Sewer trout again?
Hasn't the cook anything else?
Well, sir, there's that tin of pork and beans.
No, we don't want that.
Can he do anything with the garbage?
Oh, well, never mind.
We aren't hungry, are we?
[All Saying "No"] Coffee, Jymes.
Yes, sir.
And, Jymes.
Yes, sir?
Don't let anything hurry you.
No, sir.
[Man] Drinking again?
[Chattering]
You dirty louse!
Hey, Baldy.
The sooner you get shot down, the better.
Baldy, darling.
[Laughing] Now that didn't hurt, Baldy.
[Chattering]
Monte!
What's the matter with you?
Attention.
As you were.
The following officers will report for night patrol.
Drayton.
Yes, sir.
Fuller.
Here, sir.
Maloney.
Oh, no.
Not an old baldheaded man like me up there in the cold, cold air.
[Laughing] Perhaps Fritz will warm it up for you.
Neville.
Here, sir.
Monte Rutledge.
Monte Rutledge.
I don't feel very well tonight, sir.
That's all right, boy.
None of us feel well.
But you don't understand.
I think I do, Rutledge.
But I say, sir.
You don't understand.
Th-There seems to be something the matter with me.
I know what's the matter with him.
He's yellow.
Oh, shut up.
Oh, let's say it.
Didn't Harry go west last night because he took this man's place?
Keep quiet, Jack.
I will not keep quiet.
He's yellow and we all know it.
That'sa lie!
I'mnot yellow.
I can see things as they are, that's all.
I'm sick of this rotten business.
You fools.
Why do you let them kill you like this?
What are you fighting for?
Patriotism.
Duty.
Are you mad?
Can't you see they're just words?
Words coined by politicians and profiteers to trick you into fighting for them.
What's a word compared with life...
the only life you've got.
I'll give 'em a word.
Murder!
That's what this dirty rotten politician's war is.
Murder!
You know it as well as I do.
Yellow, am I?
You're the ones that are yellow.
I've got guts to say what I think.
You're afraid to say it.
So afraid to be called yellow, you'd rather be killed first.
You fools!
You poor, stupid fools.
Oh, Monte.
Now, pull yourself together, will ya?
[Murmuring]
Stand up, Rutledge!
I've taken a lot of shirking from you since we came out here, but this is a bit too much.
Sir, he really is ill.
You're a disgrace to your squadron.
Go to your quarters.
Yes, sir.
[Chattering]
Have a cigarette.
You don't think I'm yellow, do you, Roy?
Why, of course not.
You're just more sensitive than the rest of us.
I wonder. [Sniffs] Well, stop thinking about it.
I wish I could.
Haven't I been up twice on the night patrol?
I'm trying to do my share.
Of course you are now.
You...
You must be pretty well fed up with me after all this.
Oh, that's rot.
I
- I'm not yellow.
I'm not!
Oh, now, Monte.
Come on.
Pull yourself together.
[Whistle Blows] [Man Yells Orders]
Staff Colonel.
Everybody out.
Come on, Monte.
Stand easy.
Well, men, I don't like what I have to say, but let's face it, you all know the central munition dump at Spraug.
You've tried three times to bomb that depot without success.
No fault of yours, of course, they've guarded it too closely.
That munition depot at Spraug must be destroyed tomorrow morning.
Now, then, today a German bombing plane was forced down within our lines.
We were lucky enough to capture it before they had a chance to destroy it.
We've fixed it up so it'll fly.
We want to use this plane to bomb the Spraug depot.
There's no question that the venture will succeed this time.
The enemy won't suspect one of their own planes until after the depot is bombed.
Then when they discover the trick, well, you... you may have a little difficulty in getting back.
I need two men to fly this plane.
I'll go, sir.
Are you sure you wanna go?
Quite sure, sir.
Very well.
I'll go with him, sir.
Who are these men?
Lieutenants Monte and Roy Rutledge, sir.
Brothers, eh?
Dismissed.
Now, young men,
I want you to realize how important this is.
The Seventh Brigade has been ordered to go over the top in a surprise attack tomorrow evening at dusk.
The brigade doesn't know it, but I
- I'm afraid they're going to be slaughtered.
There's too much artillery in front of us.
If you destroy that munition depot early tomorrow morning, it will weaken the enemy artillery, and we may be able to get through.
Hundreds of lives depend on you.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Now, another thing.
The plane you are to fly... is far too dangerous a piece of armament to let the enemy recapture it.
It must return or be destroyed.
If you were captured, you'd be shot as spies anyway.
Baldy.
Oh, Baldy?
You'll take the morning patrol in towards Spraug as far as you can.
You might possibly help them get back.
By all means.
Yes, sir.
You'll get your maps and final instructions just before taking off.
Report to the field at 3:00 a. m.
Until then, let them do as they please.
- Yes, sir. 3:00, you two.
- Yes, sir.
Good luck.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
- What time is it, Monte?
- Ten past 9:00.
Helen's canteen closes at 10:00.
We've just enough time to get there.
- Do you think they'll let us have the motorcycle?
- Why, of course.
We're "it" tonight.
Yeah.
We're "it" all right.
Not sorry, are you?
Oh, let's not talk about it.
I'm not even gonna think about it until 3:00. [Chuckles]
What's your program?
Wine, women and song?
Oh, perhaps I'll do without the song tonight. [Chuckles]
[Whistling]
- See you at Grosson's?
- Either there or at Jacques across the street.
- Wherever you hear the most noise.
- Don't you wanna come in with me to see Helen?
Oh, I better not.
Righto.
[Blowing] Where's Helen?
She's gone out.
Oh.
Was she expecting you?
No.
Would you care to leave a note?
Yes, I think I will.
Pen and ink on the table.
You'll see that she gets this?
Oh, yes.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
[Engine Cranks]
Hello.
What's up?
She isn't in.
That's tough.
Wanna come along with me?
Where to?
Grosson's.
Righto.
[Engine Cranks] Your switch on?
[Engine Revs]
[Chattering]
Will you close it a little?
[Speaking French]
- Helen.
- Well, if it isn't old Roy.
Old solemn Roy himself.
[Slurring] Sit down, Roy.
Sit on the floor and hang your legs over.
- Take your hands off her.
- Oh, I can't take my hands off.
You heard what I said.
Take your hands off her.
Who asked you to this party anyway?
Helen, let me take you home.
Home?
Who wants to go home?
I'm having a marvelous time.
I was until you came in.
I advise you to get out before you're kicked out.
Keep your...
Keep your filthy hands off of my girl.
Your girl.
You fool.
I wouldn't belong to you if you were the last man on Earth.
You're nothing to me.
Nothing.
Come on, Roy.
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
Oh, let's have it out.
I don't love you.
I never have.
I never had any fun with you anyway.
You and your high ideals.
You're too good to live.
You're just a stupid prig if you ask me.
You make me sick, do you hear?
Sick.
Now, get out here.
I hate the sight of you!
Come on, Roy.
Let's go across the street.
[Drunken Singing]
[Chattering]
[French Accent] Sweet, sweet baby.
Handsome, big, strong baby.
N'est-ce pas?
[Continues In French]
Mmm, n'est-ce pas, kiss Papa, huh?
Oh, baby.
[Squeals]
Hello, chèri.
[Continues In French]
Aw, don't take it so hard, Roy.
Forget it.
- Is your friend sick?
- [Laughs]
No.
He'll be all right.
Drink up, Roy.
I still can't believe it.
You just don't know anything about women.
They're all the same.
I've been telling you that for years.
Maybe you'll believe me now.
- Oh, Helen's not that sort.
- Oh, nonsense.
- It's the war.
She's changed.
- You're wrong, Roy.
War doesn't change people.
It's...
It's like getting drunk.
It brings out what people really are.
You can't make me believe Helen was like that before.
Well, she was.
I've known it all along.
You too?
Oh, I'm sorry, Roy.
Don't take it so hard.
She isn't worth it. [Squeals]
- I suppose you're right.
- Of course I'm right.
Listen, Roy, never love a woman.
Just make love to her.
You see, like this.
Look.
[Woman In French]
[Loud Kiss] Go ahead, Roy.
Try it.
That's the way.
[Ticking Loudly]
Oh!
What you do, baby?
All wet!
No, no, no, no!
Imbecile!
Aw, baby.
Voilà.
Hey, listen, Monte.
Monte.
Go easy.
We gotta go up at 3:00.
[Slurring] Oh, listen, Roy.
To hell with this 3:00 business.
What do you mean?
Just that.
To hell with it.
Say, you're crazy, Monte.
We can't get out of it now.
Oh, why can't we?
Listen, Roy, all this idealistic stuff won't get you anywhere.
You tried it on Helen and what happened?
You got a kick in the face.
You can't go through life thinking the way you do.
People take advantage of you and make a fool of you the way she did.
- It's beginning to look as though you're right.
- Of course I'm right.
I was right about Helen, and now I'm right about this 3:00 business too.
This is another thing entirely, Monte.
Why is it?
They're just taking advantage of you in another way, that's all.
It's chaps like you that are meat for them.
All they gotta do is make it sound heroic, and you fall for it.
Listen, Roy, what's the difference if we don't go?
- But we can't get out of it now.
- Why can't we?
Listen, tell 'em...
tell 'em the motorcycle broke down.
Tell 'em anything.
What do you say, Roy?
Well...
[Slurring] Come on, old ooo-la-la.
Oh, no, no, no, chèri.
[Continues In French] [French]
Oh, baby.
N'est-ce pas?
Oh, oui, oui, madam.
Oh, baby.
Oh, stop looking at your watch, Roy.
You're not going anywhere.
Yes, I am and so are you.
Who says I am?
Listen, Monte, we're a little drunk and we've been talking wildly.
There's no way out of this and we know it.
Come on, Monte.
No, no.
Let me alone.
Come on, old ooo-la-la.
[French] Monte.
Why, they'd court-martial us in a minute if we didn't show up.
Why, that's desertion, Monte.
They shoot people for that.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
Come on.
I suppose you're right.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Monte.
What a pair of fools we are.
Let's go.
[Straining]
Easy, now.
Easy.
Look out for the firing pin.
Righto.
I got it.
[Roy] Contactor.
[Monte]Contact.
[Sputtering]
Ground speed here.
Keep this site trained on the target.
Then pull the release when you hit the stop.
Do you understand?
Don't forget the leveler.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
[Roy] Contactor.
Contact.
Remember this ship weighs 20,000 pounds.
Good luck.
Thank you.
[Chattering In German]
[Chattering]
[Cheering]
[Vehicle Approaching]
Roy, the depot.
Roy, look there!
They've seen us.
They're coming on.
For Christ's sake.
Hey, Roy, look.
They hit our right motor.
I got him!
Roy!
Look over there.
It's our squadrons.
They're coming!
[Yelling, Indistinct]
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Screams]
[Groaning]
Roy, they've gone.
Jesus.
Son of a Boche.
Hey!
It's me!
Hey!
It's me!
Goddamn it!
It's old Baldy.
Hey!
Baldy.
Hello.
It's Baldy.
Look, Roy.
It's Baldy.
You see that guy?
[Blows Raspberry]
Good old Baldy.
Good boy.
See that?
He's got him.
Hey, look.
He's got him.
He's got him.
Oh.
Look.
They've changed around.
Our strut's gone.
That son of a bitch.
Roy, he got us!
Roy!
Go down!
Go down!
Go down!
One more for Baldy!
No more control?
Pull her up!
Oh, my God!
We're on fire!
We're burning!
Roy, get down!
Do something!
Roy!
[Speaking German]
[Speaking German]
[German]
[Heavy German Accent] Ah, so.
We meet again.
It was you who bombed the depot at Spraug, nicht wahr?
Yes.
And you were flying a German plane, nicht wahr?
- Yes.
- Very clever.
It is a pity you must take your congratulations from me.
There are a few questions I must ask you.
If you answer them simply, it will be easy for you.
To what squadron of the Royal Flying Corps are you attached?
Just why were you sent to bomb that munition depot this morning?
It was our natural target.
But possibly it was to clear the way for a little surprise attack, huh?
[Laughs] You are surprised.
We know all about it, so you need not be afraid to talk.
Now, please, when and where is the attack to be made?
Oh, you are stupid not to tell.
It is nothing.
For you the war is over, nicht wahr?
We are friends.
Hmm.
Listen, if you tell me,
I will see that you are sent to a special camp reserved only for certain prisoners of war.
It's near Munich.
Far away from all this.
You will have every comfort.
And in a few months from now when the war is over, you will be alive and in good health, which is more than most of us will be able to say.
So, you see?
It can be easy for you.
Now, please.
So, you will not tell?
Possibly you do not know that flying a German plane... is the same as wearing a German uniform.
Any disguised soldier is a spy, nicht wahr?
And you know what happens to spies?
I think you two friends had better talk it over.
I will give you 15 minutes.
If you change your mind and tell, good.
If not, you will be shot.
[German]
[Lock Clicks]
Do you think he was bluffing?
No, he wasn't bluffing.
He's the man I was to fight that duel with.
Really?
Quite a coincidence.
He's got it in for me.
Nah, he's probably forgotten it by this time.
The brigade will be going over pretty soon, Monte.
Yes.
[Footsteps Marching]
[Officer Shouts Orders In German]
Roy, look.
Oh, save it to wipe your nose on.
[German]
[Guns Cocking]
[Gunfire]
God, what nerve.
Roy.
Roy, I can't face it.
I'm going to tell.
Don't be a fool, Monte.
Do you realize what it would mean if we told?
It would mean being alive when this bloody war's over.
But, Monte, you can't.
To hell with your heroic stuff.
I wanna live.
I'm not gonna be shot down like that.
I'm going to tell.
Wait a minute.
Monte.
But I...
Listen.
Let me go.
You?
Yes.
You're all upset.
I'll bargain with him, and perhaps I won't have to tell him everything.
I
- I'll come with you.
No.
You said he's got it in for you.
Now, let me do it alone.
All right.
[Officer Shouting In German]
Tell the general I'm ready to talk.
Good.
Come.
[German]
[Together] Ah, yes.
[Telegraph Machine Clicking]
So, you have changed your mind?
Yes.
My friend will never tell, but I wanna live.
I'm ready to talk.
You are very wise.
Now, please, draw a rough map for me showing your positions, brigade numbers, disposition, hour of attack, purpose, number of men.
Wait a minute.
I'll tell only on one condition.
Ah, so, a condition.
Yes.
If I give this information, my friend will know it.
Back home after the war, he'll tell everyone that I was a traitor.
You leave that to me.
Why not let me have that satisfaction?
What do you mean?
I do not understand.
One does not kill a friend.
Friend.
He's not my friend.
He stole the girl I love and I hate him.
Huh.
History repeats itself.
You make rather hard terms.
I'll tell only on that condition.
One bullet.
What if I miss?
Give me two to make sure.
No.
A good soldier will need only one.
Very well.
Not so fast.
[German]
He will give you the bullet outside.
Well?
I didn't tell, Monte.
Why?
What happened?
Has he changed his mind?
No.
Don't you think you can go through with it now?
What do you mean?
Of course we can.
It won't even hurt.
It'll all be over in a second.
We can stand anything for a second.
No, no, Roy.
L-I can't do it.
I'm going to tell.
Listen, Monte.
We tell, the whole brigade will be wiped out.
Three thousand men, and they all want to live too.
You wouldn't spoil their chances, would you?
That's not my business.
I didn't start this war.
I didn't get them into this mess.
Let 'em take care of themselves.
They'll get wiped out sooner or later anyway.
I wanna live.
Live!
You won't tell, I'll tell.
Listen, Monte!
I'll tell!
I'll tell!
Let me out!
I'll tell everything I know.
The brigade is moving up.
They're going to attack...
[Grunts]
Oh.
Roy.
Oh, Monte.
Monte.
Monte.
Monte.
[Exhales]
Don't cry, Roy.
It was the only thing you could do.
[Groans]
The brigade, Roy.
Yes, Monte?
They'll be all right now, won't they?
Yes.
Who's that?
It's the general.
You...
You thought we'd tell, didn't you?
Good old Roy.
You won't tell, and I... forgotten... it all.
[Gasping] Oh, Roy.
Roy.
Yes?
Where are you?
Don't go away, Roy.
[Gasps] I'm here, Monte.
Can't you feel me holding you?
Hello, Karl.
Fig eights.
Cold up here in the night patrol.
Awful to be in the dark.
Oh.
I'm afraid.
Look out.
Look out!
We're falling!
We're going to crash!
Do something, Roy!
Quick!
Quick!
Quick!
[Crying] It's all right, Monte.
Monte?
[Gasps]
It's all right.
Monte?
Monte.
Oh.
[Crying]
Well?
[Crying]
You heard what my brother said.
Your brother?
I'll never tell you anything.
[German]
[German]
Achtung!
[German]
[German]
[Officer Shouts Orders In German]
[Roy] I'll be with you in just a minute, Monte.
[Officer In German]
[Guns Cocking]
[Gunfire]
[Explosions In Distance]
Come on, you Seventh Brigade.
We got 'em now.
Ah!
Ja!
Wunderbar!
Look at that, Karl.
Well, Roy, you seem to like my country.
Like it?
I think it's marvelous.
Say, I wish we were staying here two years instead of just two weeks.
But you know, Karl, it does sound funny hearing you call it "your country. "
I keep forgetting you're not English.
Oh, sometimes I...
Well, I feel almost English myself.
Well, that's natural.
After all, you can't be at Oxford three years... without feeling slightly British.
I wish Helen were here.
After all you've said about her, I don't blame you.
Your brother is not coming today, Herr Rutledge?
Oh, yes, he'll be along soon, Gretchen.
Nothing can keep Monte away from this good beer.
Nothing except a good-looking woman.
Jawohl.
That brother of yours, he's a naughty boy, but I like him.
He has a way with them, hey, Gretchen?
You, you don't know half of it.
Another conquest for Monte.
Yes.
I don't know why he wants to mess about with every woman he meets.
Yeah, but you have Helen.
I'm not at all sure.
I'm not half good enough for her.
She must be a wonderful girl.
Oh, she is.
She's marvelous.
You'll have to meet her when we get back to Oxford.
- I'd like to.
- Would you like to see what she looks like?
Yes.
I didn't know you had a photograph of her.
Yeah, and neither does Helen.
I took it myself when she wasn't looking.
Really?
Oh.
Stunning, isn't she?
Why, she's marvelous.
Cheerio, you blighters.
Hello, it's Monte.
Meet the countess.
Step up, gents, to the one and only...
Now, Monte, don't, please.
Oh, it's all right.
This little pretzel doesn't understand a word of English.
No?
Gretchen!
Ja!
Found her at the museum.
Yeah, she's a work of art, all right.
You should have left her there.
Shh!
Quiet!
I say, Monte, why do you bring around this sort?
Bring her?
Good heavens, I can't get rid of her.
Go home, will you?
Go home.
You see, I'm stuck.
Hello.
Who's the dowager?
That's Helen.
Oh.
But, of course, that's only a snapshot.
Wait till you meet her.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Go away!
I say.
This is getting serious.
I've got to get rid of her.
Oh, you know, I have a very important engagement in just 15 minutes.
I say, you chaps, be... be sporting and take her off my hands.
But after all, Monte...
We may be sporting, but we're not feeble-minded.
Well, you can do what you please with her.
I'm going.
Hey, listen, Monte...
Auf Wiedersehen.
Here, just a minute now.
Please.
Leave her to me.
I'll get rid of her.
Please.
Yes.
Ja.
Nein.
Nein.
Nein.
Nein.
Roy!
No!
Roy!
No, carry on.
Carry on.
Pretty boy, you please me very much.
What's that?
It is nothing.
I am not at home to anyone except my husband.
And he is away on army business.
He will not be home for hours.
So, you see...
Charming.
But really, I-I say you mustn't think that...
Your name?
My name is, uh, Rutledge, sir.
You are stopping in Munich?
At the Hotel Bayrischer Hof, sir.
My seconds will call on you later.
But I say you...
There is nothing further to discuss.
Sailing, sailing over the bounding main
Where many a wintery wind shall blow 'ere Jack comes home again
Hello.
Where you going?
Sailing, sailing England.
England?
Why, we're not going back for 10 days.
What's wrong?
Baron Von Kranz.
Who's he?
Oh, he's just a friend of mine.
Really?
Quite a social success, aren't you?
How do you meet these barons?
Well, unfortunately, I met this one through his wife.
And this means...
A duel.
Can you imagine it?
Running away?
Oh, don't be an ass.
Roy.
You don't expect me to go through with a farce like this.
It's the only thing you can do.
Oh, there you go again.
I suppose when a woman's no good and her husband finds it out,
I've got to get shot, just because it's the honorable thing to do.
Well, what do you think people will say?
You'll never live it down.
What do I care what people say?
Well, you can talk all you like, Monte, but you can't walk out like this.
Can't I?
Good-bye.
See you at Oxford.
Hello, Roy.
Hello, Karl.
Well, what's up?
Where's Monte?
He's gone to England.
England?
Well, what's the matter?
Oh, nothing.
But I say...
Herr Rutledge?
Herr Rutledge?
Yes?
Von Richter.
Von Schlieben.
We represent Colonel Baron Von Kranz.
Yes.
Have you chosen your second?
According to custom, we have selected the time and place.
You have the choice of weapons.
What is your choice?
What is this?
Golden Aue.
Why, that's a famous dueling place near here.
It says at 4:00 tomorrow morning.
4:00 in the morning.
Well, how did this happen?
I
- I'm sorry, Karl.
I
- I lost my temper with one of your officers.
But, Roy...
Say, Karl, do you know how to be a second?
Wait here, Roy.
Bitte.
Good luck, Roy.
Did you ever see a lassie a lassie, a lassie
Did you ever see a lassie go this way and that
Hey, will you cut it out?
Hey, did anybody see my green socks?
Check in the garbage.
Hello there, Roy.
Hello, Elliot.
Glad to see you.
I'm certainly glad to see you back.
Thank you.
And where's your German accent?
Well, I couldn't get it past the Custom officials.
Oh, I say, what have you done to your arm?
Oh, nothing.
It's just a little scratch.
I was hunting in Germany.
I'll see you at dinner?
Righto.
Good.
See you later.
Why aren't you getting dressed?
Aren't you coming to meet Helen?
Oh, yes, but don't remind me of it.
Don't be foolish.
She expects us for tea.
Tea?
Listen, it'll do you good to meet a nice girl.
Oh, well, all right, but first we've gotta get you dressed.
Say, we've gotta get him dressed.
He's going to see his girl.
Now, now, wait a minute, now.
Listen, I've gotta have my shirt!
Wait a minute.
I...
Listen, I'm old enough to dress myself!
No, you're not.
Will you cut it out?
Say, listen, will you pl...
Will you...
Hey, my green socks!
Is Helen in?
Miss Helen is not at home, sir.
She's expecting us.
Would you care to wait?
Yes, thank you.
Fine reception.
Oh.
Roy, maybe she's forgotten.
Not Helen.
She's not that sort.
Oh.
Roy, I feel sick.
I
- I think I'd better go.
- Monte, will you sit down?
- Oh, I've got an awful headache.
I think I'll go to the chemist and get something for it.
Monte.
- Roy!
- Helen!
Oh, terribly sorry.
Mother's fault.
Shopping.
I simply flew My, isn't it hot?
You shouldn't have hurried so.
Oh, but I wanted to.
Roy, you've no right to look so cool.
I'm broiling.
Feel.
Yes, you are, aren't you?
No, not one.
Well, you're so marvelous, I
- I hardly dare.
Oh, silly.
Well, that's better.
Cigarette, Roy?
I thought your brother was coming.
Went out with a headache.
Poor boy.
It must be the heat.
Extry, extry!
All about the war!
Well, they've done it.
I never thought they would.
I still can't believe it.
Well, it must be true.
It's official.
Oh, shut up.
I'm trying to think.
It's terrible.
Karl, you won't have to go, will you?
Me?
Oh, Roy, I hope not.
Oh, they can't want me.
I'm not a soldier.
What use would I be to them?
I couldn't... kill anyone.
They couldn't make me do that, could they, Roy?
Oh, I think it'll all be over in a couple of weeks.
I'm not so sure.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Then suppose England comes in.
Why, Roy, that'd be horrible.
I never could do that.
Why, I love England.
Oh, will you shut up?
Monte, Germany's declared war on France.
Hmm?
Oh.
Oh, Roy, how do you spell "ecstatic"?
Hmm?
Special delivery letter for Karl Arnstedt.
What's the matter, Karl?
Someone ill?
Karl.
May I ask the Prime Minister if he has any information he can give us today.
Our ambassador at Berlin received his passport at 7:00 last evening.
And since 11:00 last night, a state of war has existed between Germany and ourselves.
Seven?
What size?
A seven and a half if you please.
I
- I'm afraid it's a bit small, sir.
Move along, there.
Move along.
You'll grow into it.
Present arms!
Come on there.
Come on.
Present arms!
Give it to him, you bloody fool.
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Sleeping sickness?
Here, here.
Let go of that gun, you clinging vine.
Let go, do you hear?
God, you're enough to turn a man's stomach.
Hey, you with the fallen arches...
I've enlisted, Monte, in the Royal Flying Corps.
You're a fool, Roy.
Really?
How lovely.
My grandfather was in the guard during the Revolution.
Oh, he was?
Oh, Roy, you look marvelous in uniform.
Thank you.
Doesn't he?
It's ripping.
Where?
Tell me, what have you joined?
The infantry?
No, the Royal Flying Corps.
Oh, of course.
And all the misery in this world has been caused... by and for capitalism!
Why should we fight this war?
For capitalism?
You will die!
You will die!
All your sons will die for capitalism!
Down with capitalism!
Down with war!
Down with the anarchists.
That's right.
Get back now.
Who do you think you're shoving?
There's the man I'd like to kiss.
What's the matter?
Afraid of a kiss?
Maybe he's yeller!
Go on, you.
Go on and fight for your country.
Slacker!
Come on.
But really, you don't understand.
I didn't mean to do anything.
Say, I'd rather marry the girl.
You'll never get your wings that way.
Hi.
How are you?
Oh, boy.
Say, listen, that first solo flight certainly is a great thrill.
It certainly felt great.
I will.
Wonder who that is out there.
That was a fine landing.
Look at him come out of there.
Look, boys, it's Monte.
Hey, how'd it go, Monte?
Oh, great.
Well, tonight's the night, Monte.
Yeah.
Say, listen, be more cheerful.
You have a treat in store meeting Helen.
Must be Friday the 13th.
Gee, I-I wonder if she'll wear her canteen uniform.
If she does, you can count me out.
Oh, she looks stunning in it.
Who wants to be stunned?
I'm only going as a favor to you.
You and I don't like the same kind of girls.
Hurry up, will you?
Oh, it's a waste of time to polish these.
She'll probably step all over them the first dance anyway.
Safer to sit it out.
Quiet little corner and a have a chat about votes for women.
Hello there.
Hello.
Whose window are you warbling under tonight?
Lady Randolph's Charity Ball.
Wash your neck and come along.
Oh, but I haven't been invited.
That's all right.
I'm on the committee.
No, I don't think I'll go.
A smart boy.
I wonder where Helen is.
She should be here by this time.
How do you do, sir?
There's she is.
Don't point.
It's rude.
Oh, Helen.
Roy!
Hello.
Hello, old thing.
You're frightfully late.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
Oh, Helen, this is Monte.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Well, that's done at last.
You know, you two have been avoiding each other for weeks.
Helen, may I have this next dance?
What?
Oh, of course.
Oh, Roy, there you are.
Good evening, Lady Randolph.
I must say, you take your duties on my committee very lightly.
I'm sorry.
Where have you been?
You've completely disarranged my program.
There are no end of things to be done.
Helen dear, you don't mind, do you?
Come along, Roy.
Come at once.
I'm sorry, Helen.
Uh, Monte, would you take this next dance with Helen?
Oh, how do you do, Monte?
How do you do?
Now come along.
Well?
Ahem.
Oh.
Hello, Roy.
I
- I really must go and find, uh, Jimmy Kerrigan.
He has something most important to tell me.
I...
Who is this Jimmy Kerrigan?
Kerrigan?
I've never heard of him.
Oh.
What are you thinking of?
If you must know, I was thinking of Monte.
Do you like him?
Yes, I like him.
He's a marvelous dancer.
Well, Monte does all those things well.
Helen.
What?
May I?
Oh, Monte.
Oh, hello there.
Come sit down.
You having a better time than you expected, Monte?
Marvelous.
Been dancing with a beautiful brunette, name of Eleanor.
She's perfect.
Oh, Eleanor Madden.
You don't really think she's beautiful?
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty?
Stop it.
I'm not a cat.
Yes, you are.
Well, if I'm a kitty, I'm a thirsty kitty.
Roy dear, will you please get me a glass of punch?
Why, of course I will.
No, I'll go, Roy.
No, I'm the committee.
You stay here and look after this wallflower.
But really, I...
Oh, if you'd rather not...
Well, I-I didn't mean...
Don't you like wallflowers?
I shouldn't have done that.
Oh, you're not sorry, Monte.
Awfully sorry.
I had no right to.
What if I'm glad?
But what about Roy?
Isn't that my business?
I suppose so, but...
Hush.
Compliments of the committee.
Thanks awfully, Roy.
Well, has he been properly charming?
Me?
More than charming.
Good for you, Monte.
Taste?
She loves me.
She blisters you.
It's worth it.
Is she worth it?
Depends on who she is.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Well, thank goodness Lady Randolph's lost sight of me for a minute.
Roy, you've been neglecting me shamefully.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
You see, it's this beastly committee.
Lady Randolph won't let me alone a minute.
Oh, Roy, there you are.
Yes, here I am.
Do you mind?
Where is that list?
Would you mind finding Sir John for me?
It's about my Canteen Unit.
I must have the queen's signature.
It's so important.
My dear, why don't you get into your uniform?
You look so pretty in it.
And, Monte, shouldn't you dance with Mary Blunt?
Yes, why don't you?
And, Roy.
Roy, will you find Sir John?
I want you to lead the grand dance for me.
And really, there are so many things you've got to do.
Yes.
L-I'm terribly sorry.
Uh, back soon.
You see, those girls have been looking for you.
But, Lady Randolph, I'm supposed to...
So, you've really joined Lady Lizzie's Canteen Unit?
Rather.
Chance of a lifetime.
We go to France in two weeks.
Two weeks?
Well, Roy says you're sailing the 15th.
Is that so?
Bored?
Tired.
Take me home, Monte.
Home?
It's not far.
I've taken a flat in town near Canteen Headquarters.
But, I mean, Roy will be quite upset to find you gone.
That's what he gets for being on committee.
But, really...
Very well.
I'll find someone else.
Oh, I didn't mean to be rude.
Well, come on then.
Are we here?
Well, it's number 27.
Wanna come up for a cigarette and a drink?
Oh, really, you must be awfully tired.
No, I'm not.
Come see my room.
I've only had a place of my own for a week.
It's a new toy.
What a baby you are.
Alley-oop.
All right.
Well, this is jolly.
Sit down and I'll get you a drink.
Thanks.
Say when.
Whoa.
When!
When!
Would you be shocked if I put on something more comfortable?
I'll try to survive.
Well, are you more comfortable now?
Yes, are you?
Oh, yes.
You know, it seems strange being here like this after hearing Roy rave about you for months.
Does Roy rave?
Oh, rather.
He idolizes you.
Oh, I do wish he wouldn't.
It makes me feel guilty.
I can understand his raving now.
Oh, don't be silly.
You're not a bit like Roy, are you?
I should say not.
Roy's frightfully high-minded.
He doesn't approve of me.
He wouldn't approve of me either if he knew what I'm really like.
Doesn't he know?
No.
When I'm with Roy, I'm the way Roy wants me to be.
That's caddish, isn't it?
But I can't help it.
I understand.
Roy wouldn't.
May I ask you a very personal question?
Yes.
Do you love Roy?
No, not really.
Not the way Roy wants me to love him.
I can't.
Roy's love means marriage and children... and never anyone but Roy.
I couldn't bear that.
I wanna be free.
I wanna be gay and have fun.
Life's short, and I wanna live while I'm alive.
I know, that...
that's the way I feel too.
I...
I think I'd better go.
Must you?
I really should.
Pull.
Cold in here now, isn't it?
Have you a match?
Why so gloomy?
God, I'm rotten.
I can't see it.
Can't you?
Well, then you're rotten too.
What do you mean?
And Roy worships you.
You!
Well?
Don't you make yourself sick...
you and Roy.
God, that's funny.
Get out of here!
Don't worry.
I can't get out fast enough.
Get out!
And stay out!
Where have you been?
Oh, I, uh...
I stopped at a... at a bar after I took Helen home.
Oh.
How'd you like her?
Oh, she's all right.
Pass in a crowd, eh?
I daresay she would.
Just what do you mean by that?
Listen, Roy, let me tell you something.
Even if it hurts.
Yes?
I wouldn't be so idealistic about Helen if I were you.
And why not?
Well, I...
I just wouldn't, that's all.
Well, why not?
Oh, I don't know.
Forget it.
Never mind crawling.
Out with it.
Listen, Roy, I tell you.
Women are all the same.
You look at every woman as a barmaid.
You don't know anything about decent women.
Oh, all right.
You know it all then.
Oh, you've said enough.
Shut up.
Karl.
Karl!
Zep overhead!
- South by east.
- Righto!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Right.
All lights out, sir.
Lights out, quick!
Zeppelin overhead!
Zeppelin overhead!
Everybody out!
Hey, come on, Monte.
Zeppelin overhead.
Come on, Monte.
What's the matter with you?
Get up.
We don't all have to go.
I'm tired.
Oh, shut up.
- Come on.
Let's go.
Hurry up.
Come on.
- Be right with you, Elliot.
Come on, Monte.
Get up.
Come on.
Let's go.
Hurry.
All right.
Karl...
Karl.
Danke.
Well, so long there, Tommy.
All right, old chap.
Good luck, Elliot.
Go get 'em, Monte.
Good-bye.
Good luck, Roy.
Right.
Perfect.
Look, Roy, there she goes.
Let's go.
Kapitän?
Kapitän.
Kapitän!
Kapitän!
Kapitän!
Jawohl!
Hey, Roy, they've hit our motor.
Cut the gas.
We'll burn to death!
Roy!
Oh, shut up!
Well, this is a mess, all right.
Yeah, just our luck.
Lucky we weren't both killed.
Well, we're through.
Herr Kapitän.
Look at it, Monte.
Roy, it's falling!
Look at that, Roy.
Great, isn't it?
They're done for.
Look out!
Run!
Just a minute.
Why the blazes don't you look where you're going, sir?
I'm sorry, sir.
Isn't it customary to salute one's superior officer?
Thank you.
What is your name, sir?
Lieutenant Roy Rutledge.
Make a note of that.
Yes, sir.
Would you like to try it and find out?
They are.
They glisten in the sun.
What the hell you trying to do?
It took me three hours to write that.
You're nothing but a pest anyhow.
Sit down.
Oh, don't, Bruce.
You shouldn't smoke so many.
What difference does it make?
You know it's bad for you.
Buy a chocolate, miss.
Change, miss.
Please.
That's a good boy.
What a life it would be married to you.
Oh, you don't fancy it?
Beastly.
No smokes.
Think of all the money we'd save.
What would we spend it on?
Oh, a diamond dog collar.
For me?
No.
I'd buy a muzzle for you.
You wouldn't spoil my beautiful mustache, would you?
No.
We'd keep that in the parlor under glass.
Hello, Helen.
Oh, hello, Roy.
Roy, I'd like you to meet Captain Redfield.
Lieutenant Rutledge.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Beastly weather.
Yes, isn't it.
- You'll get used to it.
- Thanks.
Gee, it's great to see you again, Helen.
It's been four whole days.
Really?
- Have you been over long?
- Three weeks.
Oh.
Three weeks.
Everything all right up your way?
Oh, yes.
Your squadron near here?
Twenty miles up the line.
Twenty miles.
That far.
- You chaps have it rather soft, haven't you?
- Do you think so?
Well, I mean to say being able to dash about the countryside and all that.
Wish I'd picked the R.F.C.
Well, why didn't you?
Roy.
Well, I must be going.
Oh.
Don't go.
I think I'd better.
Good-bye, Helen, and don't forget your promise.
I won't.
Who's that bag of wind?
Would you mind not talking about my friends like that?
Oh, now, Helen, please.
Oh, you were perfectly beastly to him.
I'm terribly sorry.
Guess my nerves are a bit raw.
Things haven't been so easy this last week.
Oh, you've been fighting?
Did you shoot down any Boche?
Yes.
I managed to get a couple.
Really?
How thrilling.
Tell me about it.
Well, there's really nothing much to tell.
Three bars of chocolate, miss.
Oh, Jymes.
Oh, Jymes.
Bread, Jymes.
We want bread.
We want bread!
Coming, sir.
Coming!
Did you ever try hurrying, Jymes?
Sorry, sir, but I stopped to dig a few of the cockroaches out of it, sir.
Well, put it down.
Well, where's the bread?
Did you ever try hurrying, sir?
Jymes, more bread.
Drown the cockroaches this time.
Yes, sir.
Jymes, what's the taste in this soup?
I can't say, sir.
It's not soup, it's soap.
I think it's shoe polish.
Sorry, sir.
Cook said the soup was a bit weak tonight.
Maybe you taste the disinfectant in the water, sir.
Oh.
Well, strike me blind, it's a hair.
Wash it off and wear it, Baldy.
Hello, you chaps.
Hello, Monte.
How goes it?
Still no news of Harry?
No.
Somebody always gets it on the night patrol.
What do you think, Marryat?
You saw it happen.
Is there any chance he got down alive?
No, I don't think so.
The searchlights got him.
We were flying low and they heard us.
We started to climb, but it was too late.
Shrapnel began bursting all around him.
Two bursts caught him and he started to drop.
It was awful to see him down there, twisting and diving... crippled, always dropping.
Trying every way to get clear of those lights.
Then another burst got him.
We could hear him screaming...
Stop!
I can't stand it.
Good thing he took your place, Rutledge.
You might've got it instead of him.
Oh, I'll get it sooner or later.
We'll all get it.
Isn't there any end to this?
Oh, shut up.
You're always whining.
Shut up yourself.
Who'll make me?
I'll make you.
Sit down, Jack, and be quiet.
All right.
What's the matter with you fellas?
Would anybody like to take Monte's place on tonight's patrol?
Lay off.
No more soup.
We need some.
No more soup.
We need some soup.
Jymes!
Hurry it up.
Splendid.
Splendid, Jymes.
Splendid.
That's what comes from hurrying.
What was dinner before you dropped it, Jymes?
A tasty bit of salmon, sir.
Sewer trout again?
Hasn't the cook anything else?
Well, sir, there's that tin of pork and beans.
No, we don't want that.
Can he do anything with the garbage?
Oh, well, never mind.
We aren't hungry, are we?
Coffee, Jymes.
Yes, sir.
And, Jymes.
Yes, sir?
Don't let anything hurry you.
No, sir.
Drinking again?
You dirty louse!
Hey, Baldy.
The sooner you get shot down, the better.
Baldy, darling.
Now that didn't hurt, Baldy.
Monte!
What's the matter with you?
Attention.
As you were.
The following officers will report for night patrol.
Drayton.
Yes, sir.
Fuller.
Here, sir.
Maloney.
Oh, no.
Not an old baldheaded man like me up there in the cold, cold air.
Perhaps Fritz will warm it up for you.
Neville.
Here, sir.
Monte Rutledge.
Monte Rutledge.
I don't feel very well tonight, sir.
That's all right, boy.
None of us feel well.
But you don't understand.
I think I do, Rutledge.
But I say, sir.
You don't understand.
Th-There seems to be something the matter with me.
I know what's the matter with him.
He's yellow.
Oh, shut up.
Oh, let's say it.
Didn't Harry go west last night because he took this man's place?
Keep quiet, Jack.
I will not keep quiet.
He's yellow and we all know it.
That's a lie!
I'm not yellow.
I can see things as they are, that's all.
I'm sick of this rotten business.
You fools.
Why do you let them kill you like this?
What are you fighting for?
Patriotism.
Duty.
Are you mad?
Can't you see they're just words?
Words coined by politicians and profiteers to trick you into fighting for them.
What's a word compared with life...
the only life you've got.
I'll give 'em a word.
Murder!
That's what this dirty rotten politician's war is.
Murder!
You know it as well as I do.
Yellow, am I?
You're the ones that are yellow.
I've got guts to say what I think.
You're afraid to say it.
So afraid to be called yellow, you'd rather be killed first.
You fools!
You poor, stupid fools.
Oh, Monte.
Now, pull yourself together, will ya?
Stand up, Rutledge!
I've taken a lot of shirking from you since we came out here, but this is a bit too much.
Sir, he really is ill.
You're a disgrace to your squadron.
Go to your quarters.
Yes, sir.
Have a cigarette.
You don't think I'm yellow, do you, Roy?
Why, of course not.
You're just more sensitive than the rest of us.
I wonder.
Well, stop thinking about it.
I wish I could.
Haven't I been up twice on the night patrol?
I'm trying to do my share.
Of course you are now.
You...
You must be pretty well fed up with me after all this.
Oh, that's rot.
I
- I'm not yellow.
I'm not!
Oh, now, Monte.
Come on.
Pull yourself together.
Staff Colonel.
Everybody out.
Come on, Monte.
Stand easy.
Well, men, I don't like what I have to say, but let's face it, you all know the central munition dump at Spraug.
You've tried three times to bomb that depot without success.
No fault of yours, of course, they've guarded it too closely.
That munition depot at Spraug must be destroyed tomorrow morning.
Now, then, today a German bombing plane was forced down within our lines.
We were lucky enough to capture it before they had a chance to destroy it.
We've fixed it up so it'll fly.
We want to use this plane to bomb the Spraug depot.
There's no question that the venture will succeed this time.
The enemy won't suspect one of their own planes until after the depot is bombed.
Then when they discover the trick, well, you you may have a little difficulty in getting back.
I need two men to fly this plane.
I'll go, sir.
Are you sure you wanna go?
Quite sure, sir.
Very well.
I'll go with him, sir.
Who are these men?
Lieutenants Monte and Roy Rutledge, sir.
Brothers, eh?
Dismissed.
Now, young men,
I want you to realize how important this is.
The Seventh Brigade has been ordered to go over the top in a surprise attack tomorrow evening at dusk.
The brigade doesn't know it, but I
- I'm afraid they're going to be slaughtered.
There's too much artillery in front of us.
If you destroy that munition depot early tomorrow morning, it will weaken the enemy artillery, and we may be able to get through.
Hundreds of lives depend on you.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Now, another thing.
The plane you are to fly... is far too dangerous a piece of armament to let the enemy recapture it.
It must return or be destroyed.
If you were captured, you'd be shot as spies anyway.
Baldy.
Oh, Baldy?
You'll take the morning patrol in towards Spraug as far as you can.
You might possibly help them get back.
By all means.
Yes, sir.
You'll get your maps and final instructions just before taking off.
Report to the field at 3:00 a. m.
Until then, let them do as they please.
- Yes, sir. 3:00, you two.
- Yes, sir.
Good luck.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
- What time is it, Monte?
- Ten past 9:00.
Helen's canteen closes at 10:00.
We've just enough time to get there.
- Do you think they'll let us have the motorcycle?
- Why, of course.
We're "it" tonight.
Yeah.
We're "it" all right.
Not sorry, are you?
Oh, let's not talk about it.
I'm not even gonna think about it until 3:00.
What's your program?
Wine, women and song?
Oh, perhaps I'll do without the song tonight.
- See you at Grosson's?
- Either there or at Jacques across the street.
- Wherever you hear the most noise.
- Don't you wanna come in with me to see Helen?
Oh, I better not.
Righto.
Where's Helen?
She's gone out.
Oh.
Was she expecting you?
No.
Would you care to leave a note?
Yes, I think I will.
Pen and ink on the table.
You'll see that she gets this?
Oh, yes.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
Hello.
What's up?
She isn't in.
That's tough.
Wanna come along with me?
Where to?
Grosson's.
Righto.
Your switch on?
Will you close it a little?
- Helen.
- Well, if it isn't old Roy.
Old solemn Roy himself.
Sit down, Roy.
Sit on the floor and hang your legs over.
- Take your hands off her.
- Oh, I can't take my hands off.
You heard what I said.
Take your hands off her.
Who asked you to this party anyway?
Helen, let me take you home.
Home?
Who wants to go home?
I'm having a marvelous time.
I was until you came in.
I advise you to get out before you're kicked out.
Keep your...
Keep your filthy hands off of my girl.
Your girl.
You fool.
I wouldn't belong to you if you were the last man on Earth.
You're nothing to me.
Nothing.
Come on, Roy.
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
Oh, let's have it out.
I don't love you.
I never have.
I never had any fun with you anyway.
You and your high ideals.
You're too good to live.
You're just a stupid prig if you ask me.
You make me sick, do you hear?
Sick.
Now, get out here.
I hate the sight of you!
Come on, Roy.
Let's go across the street.
Sweet, sweet baby.
Handsome, big, strong baby.
N'est-ce pas?
Mmm, n'est-ce pas, kiss Papa, huh?
Oh, baby.
Hello, chèri.
Aw, don't take it so hard, Roy.
Forget it.
Is your friend sick?
No.
He'll be all right.
Drink up, Roy.
I still can't believe it.
You just don't know anything about women.
They're all the same.
I've been telling you that for years.
Maybe you'll believe me now.
- Oh, Helen's not that sort.
- Oh, nonsense.
- It's the war.
She's changed.
- You're wrong, Roy.
War doesn't change people.
It's...
It's like getting drunk.
It brings out what people really are.
You can't make me believe Helen was like that before.
Well, she was.
I've known it all along.
You too?
Oh, I'm sorry, Roy.
Don't take it so hard.
She isn't worth it.
- I suppose you're right.
- Of course I'm right.
Listen, Roy, never love a woman.
Just make love to her.
You see, like this.
Look.
Go ahead, Roy.
Try it.
That's the way.
Oh!
What you do, baby?
All wet!
No, no, no, no!
Imbecile!
Aw, baby.
Voilà.
Hey, listen, Monte.
Monte.
Go easy.
We gotta go up at 3:00.
Oh, listen, Roy.
To hell with this 3:00 business.
What do you mean?
Just that.
To hell with it.
Say, you're crazy, Monte.
We can't get out of it now.
Oh, why can't we?
Listen, Roy, all this idealistic stuff won't get you anywhere.
You tried it on Helen and what happened?
You got a kick in the face.
You can't go through life thinking the way you do.
People take advantage of you and make a fool of you the way she did.
- It's beginning to look as though you're right.
- Of course I'm right.
I was right about Helen, and now I'm right about this 3:00 business too.
This is another thing entirely, Monte.
Why is it?
They're just taking advantage of you in another way, that's all.
It's chaps like you that are meat for them.
All they gotta do is make it sound heroic, and you fall for it.
Listen, Roy, what's the difference if we don't go?
- But we can't get out of it now.
- Why can't we?
Listen, tell 'em...
tell 'em the motorcycle broke down.
Tell 'em anything.
What do you say, Roy?
Well...
Come on, old ooo-la-la.
Oh, no, no, no, chèri.
Oh, baby.
N'est-ce pas?
Oh, oui, oui, madam.
Oh, baby.
Oh, stop looking at your watch, Roy.
You're not going anywhere.
Yes, I am and so are you.
Who says I am?
Listen, Monte, we're a little drunk and we've been talking wildly.
There's no way out of this and we know it.
Come on, Monte.
No, no.
Let me alone.
Come on, old ooo-la-la.
Monte.
Why, they'd court-martial us in a minute if we didn't show up.
Why, that's desertion, Monte.
They shoot people for that.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
Come on.
I suppose you're right.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Monte.
What a pair of fools we are.
Let's go.
Easy, now.
Easy.
Look out for the firing pin.
Righto.
I got it.
Contactor.
Contact.
Ground speed here.
Keep this site trained on the target.
Then pull the release when you hit the stop.
Do you understand?
Don't forget the leveler.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Contactor.
Contact.
Remember this ship weighs 20,000 pounds.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Roy, the depot.
Roy, look there!
They've seen us.
They're coming on.
For Christ's sake.
Hey, Roy, look.
They hit our right motor.
I got him!
Roy!
Look over there.
It's our squadrons.
They're coming!
Roy, they've gone.
Jesus.
Son of a Boche.
Hey!
It's me!
Hey!
It's me!
Goddamn it!
It's old Baldy.
Hey!
Baldy.
Hello.
It's Baldy.
Look, Roy.
It's Baldy.
You see that guy?
Good old Baldy.
Good boy.
See that?
He's got him.
Hey, look.
He's got him.
He's got him.
Oh.
Look.
They've changed around.
Our strut's gone.
That son of a bitch.
Roy, he got us!
Roy!
Go down!
Go down!
Go down!
One more for Baldy!
No more control?
Pull her up!
Oh, my God!
We're on fire!
We're burning!
Roy, get down!
Do something!
Roy!
Ah, so.
We meet again.
It was you who bombed the depot at Spraug, nicht wahr?
Yes.
And you were flying a German plane, nicht wahr?
- Yes.
- Very clever.
It is a pity you must take your congratulations from me.
There are a few questions I must ask you.
If you answer them simply, it will be easy for you.
To what squadron of the Royal Flying Corps are you attached?
Just why were you sent to bomb that munition depot this morning?
It was our natural target.
But possibly it was to clear the way for a little surprise attack, huh?
You are surprised.
We know all about it, so you need not be afraid to talk.
Now, please, when and where is the attack to be made?
Oh, you are stupid not to tell.
It is nothing.
For you the war is over, nicht wahr?
We are friends.
Hmm.
Listen, if you tell me,
I will see that you are sent to a special camp reserved only for certain prisoners of war.
It's near Munich.
Far away from all this.
You will have every comfort.
And in a few months from now when the war is over, you will be alive and in good health, which is more than most of us will be able to say.
So, you see?
It can be easy for you.
Now, please.
So, you will not tell?
Possibly you do not know that flying a German plane... is the same as wearing a German uniform.
Any disguised soldier is a spy, nicht wahr?
And you know what happens to spies?
I think you two friends had better talk it over.
I will give you 15 minutes.
If you change your mind and tell, good.
If not, you will be shot.
Do you think he was bluffing?
No, he wasn't bluffing.
He's the man I was to fight that duel with.
Really?
Quite a coincidence.
He's got it in for me.
Nah, he's probably forgotten it by this time.
The brigade will be going over pretty soon, Monte.
Yes.
Roy, look.
Oh, save it to wipe your nose on.
God, what nerve.
Roy.
Roy, I can't face it.
I'm going to tell.
Don't be a fool, Monte.
Do you realize what it would mean if we told?
It would mean being alive when this bloody war's over.
But, Monte, you can't.
To hell with your heroic stuff.
I wanna live.
I'm not gonna be shot down like that.
I'm going to tell.
Wait a minute.
Monte.
But I...
Listen.
Let me go.
You?
Yes.
You're all upset.
I'll bargain with him, and perhaps I won't have to tell him everything.
I
- I'll come with you.
No.
You said he's got it in for you.
Now, let me do it alone.
All right.
Tell the general I'm ready to talk.
Good.
Come.
Ah, yes.
So, you have changed your mind?
Yes.
My friend will never tell, but I wanna live.
I'm ready to talk.
You are very wise.
Now, please, draw a rough map for me showing your positions, brigade numbers, disposition, hour of attack, purpose, number of men.
Wait a minute.
I'll tell only on one condition.
Ah, so, a condition.
Yes.
If I give this information, my friend will know it.
Back home after the war, he'll tell everyone that I was a traitor.
You leave that to me.
Why not let me have that satisfaction?
What do you mean?
I do not understand.
One does not kill a friend.
Friend.
He's not my friend.
He stole the girl I love and I hate him.
Huh.
History repeats itself.
You make rather hard terms.
I'll tell only on that condition.
One bullet.
What if I miss?
Give me two to make sure.
No.
A good soldier will need only one.
Very well.
Not so fast.
He will give you the bullet outside.
Well?
I didn't tell, Monte.
Why?
What happened?
Has he changed his mind?
No.
Don't you think you can go through with it now?
What do you mean?
Of course we can.
It won't even hurt.
It'll all be over in a second.
We can stand anything for a second.
No, no, Roy.
L-I can't do it.
I'm going to tell.
Listen, Monte.
We tell, the whole brigade will be wiped out.
Three thousand men, and they all want to live too.
You wouldn't spoil their chances, would you?
That's not my business.
I didn't start this war.
I didn't get them into this mess.
Let 'em take care of themselves.
They'll get wiped out sooner or later anyway.
I wanna live.
Live!
You won't tell, I'll tell.
Listen, Monte!
I'll tell!
I'll tell!
Let me out!
I'll tell everything I know.
The brigade is moving up.
They're going to attack...
Oh.
Roy.
Oh, Monte.
Monte.
Monte.
Monte.
Don't cry, Roy.
It was the only thing you could do.
The brigade, Roy.
Yes, Monte?
They'll be all right now, won't they?
Yes.
Who's that?
It's the general.
You...
You thought we'd tell, didn't you?
Good old Roy.
You won't tell, and I... forgotten... it all.
Oh, Roy.
Roy.
Yes?
Where are you?
Don't go away, Roy.
I'm here, Monte.
Can't you feel me holding you?
Hello, Karl.
Fig eights.
Cold up here in the night patrol.
Awful to be in the dark.
Oh.
I'm afraid.
Look out.
Look out!
We're falling!
We're going to crash!
Do something, Roy!
Quick!
Quick!
Quick!
It's all right, Monte.
Monte?
It's all right.
Monte?
Monte.
Oh.
Well?
You heard what my brother said.
Your brother?
I'll never tell you anything.
Achtung!
I'll be with you in just a minute, Monte.
Come on, you Seventh Brigade.
We got 'em now.
Ah!
Ja!
Wunderbar!
Look at that, Karl.
Well, Roy, you seem to like my country.
Like it?
I think it's marvellous.
Say, I wish we were staying here two years instead of just two weeks.
But you know, Karl, it does sound funny hearing you call it "your country. "
I keep forgetting you're not English.
Oh, sometimes I...
Well, I feel almost English myself.
Well, that's natural.
After all, you can't be at Oxford three years... without feeling slightly British.
I wish Helen were here.
After all you've said about her, I don't blame you.
Your brother is not coming today, Herr Rutledge?
Oh, yes, he'll be along soon, Gretchen.
Nothing can keep Monte away from this good beer.
Nothing except a good-looking woman.
Jawohl.
That brother of yours, he's a naughty boy, but I like him.
He has a way with them, hey, Gretchen?
You, you don't know half of it.
Another conquest for Monte.
Yes.
I don't know why he wants to mess about with every woman he meets.
Yeah, but you have Helen.
I'm not at all sure.
I'm not half good enough for her.
She must be a wonderful girl.
Oh, she is.
She's marvellous.
You'll have to meet her when we get back to Oxford.
- I'd like to.
- Would you like to see what she looks like?
Yes.
I didn't know you had a photograph of her.
Yeah, and neither does Helen.
I took it myself when she wasn't looking.
Really?
Oh.
Stunning, isn't she?
Why, she's marvellous.
Cheerio, you blighters.
Hello, it's Monte.
Meet the countess.
Step up, gents, to the one and only...
Now, Monte, don't, please.
Oh, it's all right.
This little pretzel doesn't understand a word of English.
No?
Gretchen!
Ja!
Found her at the museum.
Yeah, she's a work of art, all right.
You should have left her there.
Shh!
Quiet!
I say, Monte, why do you bring around this sort?
Bring her?
Good heavens, I can't get rid of her.
Go home, will you?
Go home.
You see, I'm stuck.
Hello.
Who's the dowager?
That's Helen.
Oh.
But, of course, that's only a snapshot.
Wait till you meet her.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Go away!
I say.
This is getting serious.
I've got to get rid of her.
Oh, you know, I have a very important engagement in just 15 minutes.
I say, you chaps, be... be sporting and take her off my hands.
But after all, Monte...
We may be sporting, but we're not feeble-minded.
Well, you can do what you please with her.
I'm going.
Hey, listen, Monte...
Auf Wiedersehen.
Here, just a minute now.
Please.
Leave her to me.
I'll get rid of her.
Please.
Yes.
Ja.
Nein.
Nein.
Nein.
Nein.
Roy!
No!
Roy!
No, carry on.
Carry on.
Pretty boy, you please me very much.
What's that?
It is nothing.
I am not at home to anyone except my husband.
And he is away on army business.
He will not be home for hours.
So, you see...
Charming.
But really, I-I say you mustn't think that...
Your name?
My name is, uh, Rutledge, sir.
You are stopping in Munich?
At the Hotel Bayrischer Hof, sir.
My seconds will call on you later.
But I say you...
There is nothing further to discuss.
Sailing, sailing over the bounding main
Where many a wintry wind shall blow 'ere Jack comes home again
Hello.
Where you going?
Sailing, sailing England.
England?
Why, we're not going back for 10 days.
What's wrong?
Baron Von Kranz.
Who's he?
Oh, he's just a friend of mine.
Really?
Quite a social success, aren't you?
How do you meet these barons?
Well, unfortunately, I met this one through his wife.
And this means...
A duel.
Can you imagine it?
Running away?
Oh, don't be an ass.
Roy.
You don't expect me to go through with a farce like this.
It's the only thing you can do.
Oh, there you go again.
I suppose when a woman's no good and her husband finds it out,
I've got to get shot, just because it's the honourable thing to do.
Well, what do you think people will say?
You'll never live it down.
What do I care what people say?
Well, you can talk all you like, Monte, but you can't walk out like this.
Can't I?
Good-bye.
See you at Oxford.
Hello, Roy.
Hello, Karl.
Well, what's up?
Where's Monte?
He's gone to England.
England?
Well, what's the matter?
Oh, nothing.
But I say...
Herr Rutledge?
Herr Rutledge?
Yes?
Von Richter.
Von Schlieben.
We represent Colonel Baron Von Kranz.
Yes.
Have you chosen your second?
According to custom, we have selected the time and place.
You have the choice of weapons.
What is your choice?
What is this?
Golden Ave.
Why, that's a famous duelling place near here.
It says at 4:00 tomorrow morning.
4:00 in the morning.
Well, how did this happen?
I
- I'm sorry, Karl.
I
- I lost my temper with one of your officers.
But, Roy...
Say, Karl, do you know how to be a second?
Wait here, Roy.
Bitte.
Good luck, Roy.
Did you ever see a lassie a lassie, a lassie
Did you ever see a lassie go this way and that
Hey, will you cut it out?
Hey, did anybody see my green socks?
Check in the garbage.
Hello there, Roy.
Hello, Elliot.
Glad to see you.
I'm certainly glad to see you back.
Thank you.
And where's your German accent?
Well, I couldn't get it past the Custom officials.
Oh, I say, what have you done to your arm?
Oh, nothing.
It's just a little scratch.
I was hunting in Germany.
I'll see you at dinner?
Righto.
Good.
See you later.
Why aren't you getting dressed?
Aren't you coming to meet Helen?
Oh, yes, but don't remind me of it.
Don't be foolish.
She expects us for tea.
Tea?
Listen, it'll do you good to meet a nice girl.
Oh, well, all right, but first we've gotta get you dressed.
Say, we've gotta get him dressed.
He's going to see his girl.
Now, now, wait a minute, now.
Listen, I've gotta have my shirt!
Wait a minute.
I...
Listen, I'm old enough to dress myself!
No, you're not.
Will you cut it out?
Say, listen, will you pl...
Will you...
Hey, my green socks!
Is Helen in?
Miss Helen is not at home, sir.
She's expecting us.
Would you care to wait?
Yes, thank you.
Fine reception.
Oh.
Roy, maybe she's forgotten.
Not Helen.
She's not that sort.
Oh.
Roy, I feel sick.
I
- I think I'd better go.
- Monte, will you sit down?
- Oh, I've got an awful headache.
I think I'll go to the chemist and get something for it.
Monte.
- Roy!
- Helen!
Oh, terribly sorry.
Mother's fault.
Shopping.
I simply flew My, isn't it hot?
You shouldn't have hurried so.
Oh, but I wanted to.
Roy, you've no right to look so cool.
I'm broiling.
Feel.
Yes, you are, aren't you?
No, not one.
Well, you're so marvellous, I
- I hardly dare.
Oh, silly.
Well, that's better.
Cigarette, Roy?
I thought your brother was coming.
Went out with a headache.
Poor boy.
It must be the heat.
Extra, extra!
All about the war!
Well, they've done it.
I never thought they would.
I still can't believe it.
Well, it must be true.
It's official.
Oh, shut up.
I'm trying to think.
It's terrible.
Karl, you won't have to go, will you?
Me?
Oh, Roy, I hope not.
Oh, they can't want me.
I'm not a soldier.
What use would I be to them?
I couldn't... kill anyone.
They couldn't make me do that, could they, Roy?
Oh, I think it'll all be over in a couple of weeks.
I'm not so sure.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Then suppose England comes in.
Why, Roy, that'd be horrible.
I never could do that.
Why, I love England.
Oh, will you shut up?
Monte, Germany's declared war on France.
Hmm?
Oh.
Oh, Roy, how do you spell "ecstatic"?
Hmm?
Special delivery letter for Karl Arnstedt.
What's the matter, Karl?
Someone ill?
Karl.
May I ask the Prime Minister if he has any information he can give us today.
Our ambassador at Berlin received his passport at 7:00 last evening.
And since 11:00 last night, a state of war has existed between Germany and ourselves.
Seven?
What size?
A seven and a half if you please.
I
- I'm afraid it's a bit small, sir.
Move along, there.
Move along.
You'll grow into it.
Present arms!
Come on there.
Come on.
Present arms!
Give it to him, you bloody fool.
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Sleeping sickness?
Here, here.
Let go of that gun, you clinging vine.
Let go, do you hear?
God, you're enough to turn a man's stomach.
Hey, you with the fallen arches...
I've enlisted, Monte, in the Royal Flying Corps.
You're a fool, Roy.
Really?
How lovely.
My grandfather was in the guard during the Revolution.
Oh, he was?
Oh, Roy, you look marvellous in uniform.
Thank you.
Doesn't he?
It's ripping.
Where?
Tell me, what have you joined?
The infantry?
No, the Royal Flying Corps.
Oh, of course.
And all the misery in this world has been caused... by and for capitalism!
Why should we fight this war?
For capitalism?
You will die!
You will die!
All your sons will die for capitalism!
Down with capitalism!
Down with war!
Down with the anarchists.
That's right.
Get back now.
Who do you think you're shoving?
There's the man I'd like to kiss.
What's the matter?
Afraid of a kiss?
Maybe he's yeller!
Go on, you.
Go on and fight for your country.
Slacker!
Come on.
But really, you don't understand.
I didn't mean to do anything.
Say, I'd rather marry the girl.
You'll never get your wings that way.
Hi.
How are you?
Oh, boy.
Say, listen, that first solo flight certainly is a great thrill.
It certainly felt great.
I will.
Wonder who that is out there.
That was a fine landing.
Look at him come out of there.
Look, boys, it's Monte.
Hey, how'd it go, Monte?
Oh, great.
Well, tonight's the night, Monte.
Yeah.
Say, listen, be more cheerful.
You have a treat in store meeting Helen.
Must be Friday the 13th.
Gee, I-I wonder if she'll wear her canteen uniform.
If she does, you can count me out.
Oh, she looks stunning in it.
Who wants to be stunned?
I'm only going as a favour to you.
You and I don't like the same kind of girls.
Hurry up, will you?
Oh, it's a waste of time to polish these.
She'll probably step all over them the first dance anyway.
Safer to sit it out.
Quiet little corner and a have a chat about votes for women.
Hello there.
Hello.
Whose window are you warbling under tonight?
Lady Randolph's Charity Ball.
Wash your neck and come along.
Oh, but I haven't been invited.
That's all right.
I'm on the committee.
No, I don't think I'll go.
A smart boy.
I wonder where Helen is.
She should be here by this time.
How do you do, sir?
There's she is.
Don't point.
It's rude.
Oh, Helen.
Roy!
Hello.
Hello, old thing.
You're frightfully late.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
Oh, Helen, this is Monte.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Well, that's done at last.
You know, you two have been avoiding each other for weeks.
Helen, may I have this next dance?
What?
Oh, of course.
Oh, Roy, there you are.
Good evening, Lady Randolph.
I must say, you take your duties on my committee very lightly.
I'm sorry.
Where have you been?
You've completely disarranged my program.
There are no end of things to be done.
Helen dear, you don't mind, do you?
Come along, Roy.
Come at once.
I'm sorry, Helen.
Uh, Monte, would you take this next dance with Helen?
Oh, how do you do, Monte?
How do you do?
Now come along.
Well?
Ahem.
Oh.
Hello, Roy.
I
- I really must go and find, uh, Jimmy Kerrigan.
He has something most important to tell me.
I...
Who is this Jimmy Kerrigan?
Kerrigan?
I've never heard of him.
Oh.
What are you thinking of?
If you must know, I was thinking of Monte.
Do you like him?
Yes, I like him.
He's a marvellous dancer.
Well, Monte does all those things well.
Helen.
What?
May I?
Oh, Monte.
Oh, hello there.
Come sit down.
You having a better time than you expected, Monte?
Marvellous.
Been dancing with a beautiful brunette, name of Eleanor.
She's perfect.
Oh, Eleanor Madden.
You don't really think she's beautiful?
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty?
Stop it.
I'm not a cat.
Yes, you are.
Well, if I'm a kitty, I'm a thirsty kitty.
Roy dear, will you please get me a glass of punch?
Why, of course I will.
No, I'll go, Roy.
No, I'm the committee.
You stay here and look after this wallflower.
But really, I...
Oh, if you'd rather not...
Well, I-I didn't mean...
Don't you like wallflowers?
I shouldn't have done that.
Oh, you're not sorry, Monte.
Awfully sorry.
I had no right to.
What if I'm glad?
But what about Roy?
Isn't that my business?
I suppose so, but...
Hush.
Compliments of the committee.
Thanks awfully, Roy.
Well, has he been properly charming?
Me?
More than charming.
Good for you, Monte.
Taste?
She loves me.
She blisters you.
It's worth it.
Is she worth it?
Depends on who she is.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Well, thank goodness Lady Randolph's lost sight of me for a minute.
Roy, you've been neglecting me shamefully.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
You see, it's this beastly committee.
Lady Randolph won't let me alone a minute.
Oh, Roy, there you are.
Yes, here I am.
Do you mind?
Where is that list?
Would you mind finding Sir John for me?
It's about my Canteen Unit.
I must have the queen's signature.
It's so important.
My dear, why don't you get into your uniform?
You look so pretty in it.
And, Monte, shouldn't you dance with Mary Blunt?
Yes, why don't you?
And, Roy.
Roy, will you find Sir John?
I want you to lead the grand dance for me.
And really, there are so many things you've got to do.
Yes.
L-I'm terribly sorry.
Uh, back soon.
You see, those girls have been looking for you.
But, Lady Randolph, I'm supposed to...
So, you've really joined Lady Lizzie's Canteen Unit?
Rather.
Chance of a lifetime.
We go to France in two weeks.
Two weeks?
Well, Roy says you're sailing the 15th.
Is that so?
Bored?
Tired.
Take me home, Monte.
Home?
It's not far.
I've taken a flat in town near Canteen Headquarters.
But, I mean, Roy will be quite upset to find you gone.
That's what he gets for being on committee.
But, really...
Very well.
I'll find someone else.
Oh, I didn't mean to be rude.
Well, come on then.
Are we here?
Well, it's number 27.
Wanna come up for a cigarette and a drink?
Oh, really, you must be awfully tired.
No, I'm not.
Come see my room.
I've only had a place of my own for a week.
It's a new toy.
What a baby you are.
Alley-oop.
All right.
Well, this is jolly.
Sit down and I'll get you a drink.
Thanks.
Say when.
Whoa.
When!
When!
Would you be shocked if I put on something more comfortable?
I'll try to survive.
Well, are you more comfortable now?
Yes, are you?
Oh, yes.
You know, it seems strange being here like this after hearing Roy rave about you for months.
Does Roy rave?
Oh, rather.
He idolizes you.
Oh, I do wish he wouldn't.
It makes me feel guilty.
I can understand his raving now.
Oh, don't be silly.
You're not a bit like Roy, are you?
I should say not.
Roy's frightfully high-minded.
He doesn't approve of me.
He wouldn't approve of me either if he knew what I'm really like.
Doesn't he know?
No.
When I'm with Roy, I'm the way Roy wants me to be.
That's caddish, isn't it?
But I can't help it.
I understand.
Roy wouldn't.
May I ask you a very personal question?
Yes.
Do you love Roy?
No, not really.
Not the way Roy wants me to love him.
I can't.
Roy's love means marriage and children... and never anyone but Roy.
I couldn't bear that.
I wanna be free.
I wanna be gay and have fun.
Life's short, and I wanna live while I'm alive.
I know, that...
that's the way I feel too.
I...
I think I'd better go.
Must you?
I really should.
Pull.
Cold in here now, isn't it?
Have you a match?
Why so gloomy?
God, I'm rotten.
I can't see it.
Can't you?
Well, then you're rotten too.
What do you mean?
And Roy worships you.
You!
Well?
Don't you make yourself sick...
you and Roy.
God, that's funny.
Get out of here!
Don't worry.
I can't get out fast enough.
Get out!
And stay out!
Where have you been?
Oh, I, uh...
I stopped at a... at a bar after I took Helen home.
Oh.
How'd you like her?
Oh, she's all right.
Pass in a crowd, eh?
I daresay she would.
Just what do you mean by that?
Listen, Roy, let me tell you something.
Even if it hurts.
Yes?
I wouldn't be so idealistic about Helen if I were you.
And why not?
Well, I...
I just wouldn't, that's all.
Well, why not?
Oh, I don't know.
Forget it.
Never mind crawling.
Out with it.
Listen, Roy, I tell you.
Women are all the same.
You look at every woman as a barmaid.
You don't know anything about decent women.
Oh, all right.
You know it all then.
Oh, you've said enough.
Shut up.
Karl.
Karl!
Zep overhead!
- South by east.
- Righto!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Right.
All lights out, sir.
Lights out, quick!
Zeppelin overhead!
Zeppelin overhead!
Everybody out!
Hey, come on, Monte.
Zeppelin overhead.
Come on, Monte.
What's the matter with you?
Get up.
We don't all have to go.
I'm tired.
Oh, shut up.
- Come on.
Let's go.
Hurry up.
Come on.
- Be right with you, Elliot.
Come on, Monte.
Get up.
Come on.
Let's go.
Hurry.
All right.
Karl...
Karl.
Danke.
Well, so long there, Tommy.
All right, old chap.
Good luck, Elliot.
Go get 'em, Monte.
Good-bye.
Good luck, Roy.
Right.
Perfect.
Look, Roy, there she goes.
Let's go.
Kapitän?
Kapitän.
Kapitän!
Kapitän!
Kapitän!
Jawohl!
Hey, Roy, they've hit our motor.
Cut the gas.
We'll burn to death!
Roy!
Oh, shut up!
Well, this is a mess, all right.
Yeah, just our luck.
Lucky we weren't both killed.
Well, we're through.
Herr Kapitän.
Look at it, Monte.
Roy, it's falling!
Look at that, Roy.
Great, isn't it?
They're done for.
Look out!
Run!
Just a minute.
Why the blazes don't you look where you're going, sir?
I'm sorry, sir.
Isn't it customary to salute one's superior officer?
Thank you.
What is your name, sir?
Lieutenant Roy Rutledge.
Make a note of that.
Yes, sir.
Would you like to try it and find out?
They are.
They glisten in the sun.
What the hell you trying to do?
It took me three hours to write that.
You're nothing but a pest anyhow.
Sit down.
Oh, don't, Bruce.
You shouldn't smoke so many.
What difference does it make?
You know it's bad for you.
Buy a chocolate, miss.
Change, miss.
Please.
That's a good boy.
What a life it would be married to you.
Oh, you don't fancy it?
Beastly.
No smokes.
Think of all the money we'd save.
What would we spend it on?
Oh, a diamond dog collar.
For me?
No.
I'd buy a muzzle for you.
You wouldn't spoil my beautiful moustache, would you?
No.
We'd keep that in the parlour under glass.
Hello, Helen.
Oh, hello, Roy.
Roy, I'd like you to meet Captain Redfield.
Lieutenant Rutledge.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Beastly weather.
Yes, isn't it.
- You'll get used to it.
- Thanks.
Gee, it's great to see you again, Helen.
It's been four whole days.
Really?
- Have you been over long?
- Three weeks.
Oh.
Three weeks.
Everything all right up your way?
Oh, yes.
Your squadron near here?
Twenty miles up the line.
Twenty miles.
That far.
- You chaps have it rather soft, haven't you?
- Do you think so?
Well, I mean to say being able to dash about the countryside and all that.
Wish I'd picked the R.F.C.
Well, why didn't you?
Roy.
Well, I must be going.
Oh.
Don't go.
I think I'd better.
Good-bye, Helen, and don't forget your promise.
I won't.
Who's that bag of wind?
Would you mind not talking about my friends like that?
Oh, now, Helen, please.
Oh, you were perfectly beastly to him.
I'm terribly sorry.
Guess my nerves are a bit raw.
Things haven't been so easy this last week.
Oh, you've been fighting?
Did you shoot down any Boche?
Yes.
I managed to get a couple.
Really?
How thrilling.
Tell me about it.
Well, there's really nothing much to tell.
Three bars of chocolate, miss.
Oh, Jymes.
Oh, Jymes.
Bread, Jymes.
We want bread.
We want bread!
Coming, sir.
Coming!
Did you ever try hurrying, Jymes?
Sorry, sir, but I stopped to dig a few of the cockroaches out of it, sir.
Well, put it down.
Well, where's the bread?
Did you ever try hurrying, sir?
Jymes, more bread.
Drown the cockroaches this time.
Yes, sir.
Jymes, what's the taste in this soup?
I can't say, sir.
It's not soup, it's soap.
I think it's shoe polish.
Sorry, sir.
Cook said the soup was a bit weak tonight.
Maybe you taste the disinfectant in the water, sir.
Oh.
Well, strike me blind, it's a hair.
Wash it off and wear it, Baldy.
Hello, you chaps.
Hello, Monte.
How goes it?
Still no news of Harry?
No.
Somebody always gets it on the night patrol.
What do you think, Marryat?
You saw it happen.
Is there any chance he got down alive?
No, I don't think so.
The searchlights got him.
We were flying low and they heard us.
We started to climb, but it was too late.
Shrapnel began bursting all around him.
Two bursts caught him and he started to drop.
It was awful to see him down there, twisting and diving... crippled, always dropping.
Trying every way to get clear of those lights.
Then another burst got him.
We could hear him screaming...
Stop!
I can't stand it.
Good thing he took your place, Rutledge.
You might've got it instead of him.
Oh, I'll get it sooner or later.
We'll all get it.
Isn't there any end to this?
Oh, shut up.
You're always whining.
Shut up yourself.
Who'll make me?
I'll make you.
Sit down, Jack, and be quiet.
All right.
What's the matter with you fellas?
Would anybody like to take Monte's place on tonight's patrol?
Lay off.
No more soup.
We need some.
No more soup.
We need some soup.
Jymes!
Hurry it up.
Splendid.
Splendid, Jymes.
Splendid.
That's what comes from hurrying.
What was dinner before you dropped it, Jymes?
A tasty bit of salmon, sir.
Sewer trout again?
Hasn't the cook anything else?
Well, sir, there's that tin of pork and beans.
No, we don't want that.
Can he do anything with the garbage?
Oh, well, never mind.
We aren't hungry, are we?
Coffee, Jymes.
Yes, sir.
And, Jymes.
Yes, sir?
Don't let anything hurry you.
No, sir.
Drinking again?
You dirty louse!
Hey, Baldy.
The sooner you get shot down, the better.
Baldy, darling.
Now that didn't hurt, Baldy.
Monte!
What's the matter with you?
Attention.
As you were.
The following officers will report for night patrol.
Drayton.
Yes, sir.
Fuller.
Here, sir.
Maloney.
Oh, no.
Not an old bald-headed man like me up there in the cold, cold air.
Perhaps Fritz will warm it up for you.
Neville.
Here, sir.
Monte Rutledge.
Monte Rutledge.
I don't feel very well tonight, sir.
That's all right, boy.
None of us feel well.
But you don't understand.
I think I do, Rutledge.
But I say, sir.
You don't understand.
Th-There seems to be something the matter with me.
I know what's the matter with him.
He's yellow.
Oh, shut up.
Oh, let's say it.
Didn't Harry go west last night because he took this man's place?
Keep quiet, Jack.
I will not keep quiet.
He's yellow and we all know it.
That's a lie!
I'm not yellow.
I can see things as they are, that's all.
I'm sick of this rotten business.
You fools.
Why do you let them kill you like this?
What are you fighting for?
Patriotism.
Duty.
Are you mad?
Can't you see they're just words?
Words coined by politicians and profiteers to trick you into fighting for them.
What's a word compared with life...
the only life you've got.
I'll give 'em a word.
Murder!
That's what this dirty rotten politician's war is.
Murder!
You know it as well as I do.
Yellow, am I?
You're the ones that are yellow.
I've got guts to say what I think.
You're afraid to say it.
So afraid to be called yellow, you'd rather be killed first.
You fools!
You poor, stupid fools.
Oh, Monte.
Now, pull yourself together, will ya?
Stand up, Rutledge!
I've taken a lot of shirking from you since we came out here, but this is a bit too much.
Sir, he really is ill.
You're a disgrace to your squadron.
Go to your quarters.
Yes, sir.
Have a cigarette.
You don't think I'm yellow, do you, Roy?
Why, of course not.
You're just more sensitive than the rest of us.
I wonder.
Well, stop thinking about it.
I wish I could.
Haven't I been up twice on the night patrol?
I'm trying to do my share.
Of course you are now.
You...
You must be pretty well fed up with me after all this.
Oh, that's rot.
I
- I'm not yellow.
I'm not!
Oh, now, Monte.
Come on.
Pull yourself together.
Staff Colonel.
Everybody out.
Come on, Monte.
Stand easy.
Well, men, I don't like what I have to say, but let's face it, you all know the central munitions dump at Spraug.
You've tried three times to bomb that depot without success.
No fault of yours, of course, they've guarded it too closely.
That munitions depot at Spraug must be destroyed tomorrow morning.
Now, then, today a German bombing plane was forced down within our lines.
We were lucky enough to capture it before they had a chance to destroy it.
We've fixed it up so it'll fly.
We want to use this plane to bomb the Spraug depot.
There's no question that the venture will succeed this time.
The enemy won't suspect one of their own planes until after the depot is bombed.
Then when they discover the trick, well, you you may have a little difficulty in getting back.
I need two men to fly this plane.
I'll go, sir.
Are you sure you wanna go?
Quite sure, sir.
Very well.
I'll go with him, sir.
Who are these men?
Lieutenants Monte and Roy Rutledge, sir.
Brothers, eh?
Dismissed.
Now, young men,
I want you to realize how important this is.
The Seventh Brigade has been ordered to go over the top in a surprise attack tomorrow evening at dusk.
The brigade doesn't know it, but I
- I'm afraid they're going to be slaughtered.
There's too much artillery in front of us.
If you destroy that munitions depot early tomorrow morning, it will weaken the enemy artillery, and we may be able to get through.
Hundreds of lives depend on you.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Now, another thing.
The plane you are to fly... is far too dangerous a piece of armament to let the enemy recapture it.
It must return or be destroyed.
If you were captured, you'd be shot as spies anyway.
Baldy.
Oh, Baldy?
You'll take the morning patrol in towards Spraug as far as you can.
You might possibly help them get back.
By all means.
Yes, sir.
You'll get your maps and final instructions just before taking off.
Report to the field at 3:00 a. m.
Until then, let them do as they please.
- Yes, sir. 3:00, you two.
- Yes, sir.
Good luck.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
- What time is it, Monte?
- Ten past 9:00.
Helen's canteen closes at 10:00.
We've just enough time to get there.
- Do you think they'll let us have the motorcycle?
- Why, of course.
We're "it" tonight.
Yeah.
We're "it" all right.
Not sorry, are you?
Oh, let's not talk about it.
I'm not even gonna think about it until 3:00.
What's your program?
Wine, women and song?
Oh, perhaps I'll do without the song tonight.
- See you at Grosson's?
- Either there or at Jacques across the street.
- Wherever you hear the most noise.
- Don't you wanna come in with me to see Helen?
Oh, I better not.
Righto.
Where's Helen?
She's gone out.
Oh.
Was she expecting you?
No.
Would you care to leave a note?
Yes, I think I will.
Pen and ink on the table.
You'll see that she gets this?
Oh, yes.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
Hello.
What's up?
She isn't in.
That's tough.
Wanna come along with me?
Where to?
Grosson's.
Righto.
Your switch on?
Will you close it a little?
- Helen.
- Well, if it isn't old Roy.
Old solemn Roy himself.
Sit down, Roy.
Sit on the floor and hang your legs over.
- Take your hands off her.
- Oh, I can't take my hands off.
You heard what I said.
Take your hands off her.
Who asked you to this party anyway?
Helen, let me take you home.
Home?
Who wants to go home?
I'm having a marvellous time.
I was until you came in.
I advise you to get out before you're kicked out.
Keep your...
Keep your filthy hands off of my girl.
Your girl.
You fool.
I wouldn't belong to you if you were the last man on Earth.
You're nothing to me.
Nothing.
Come on, Roy.
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
Oh, let's have it out.
I don't love you.
I never have.
I never had any fun with you anyway.
You and your high ideals.
You're too good to live.
You're just a stupid prig if you ask me.
You make me sick, do you hear?
Sick.
Now, get out here.
I hate the sight of you!
Come on, Roy.
Let's go across the street.
Sweet, sweet baby.
Handsome, big, strong baby.
N'est-ce pas?
Mmm, n'est-ce pas, kiss Papa, huh?
Oh, baby.
Hello, Chèri.
Aw, don't take it so hard, Roy.
Forget it.
Is your friend sick?
No.
He'll be all right.
Drink up, Roy.
I still can't believe it.
You just don't know anything about women.
They're all the same.
I've been telling you that for years.
Maybe you'll believe me now.
- Oh, Helen's not that sort.
- Oh, nonsense.
- It's the war.
She's changed.
- You're wrong, Roy.
War doesn't change people.
It's...
It's like getting drunk.
It brings out what people really are.
You can't make me believe Helen was like that before.
Well, she was.
I've known it all along.
You too?
Oh, I'm sorry, Roy.
Don't take it so hard.
She isn't worth it.
- I suppose you're right.
- Of course I'm right.
Listen, Roy, never love a woman.
Just make love to her.
You see, like this.
Look.
Go ahead, Roy.
Try it.
That's the way.
Oh!
What you do, baby?
All wet!
No, no, no, no!
Imbecile!
Aw, baby.
Voilà.
Hey, listen, Monte.
Monte.
Go easy.
We gotta go up at 3:00.
Oh, listen, Roy.
To hell with this 3:00 business.
What do you mean?
Just that.
To hell with it.
Say, you're crazy, Monte.
We can't get out of it now.
Oh, why can't we?
Listen, Roy, all this idealistic stuff won't get you anywhere.
You tried it on Helen and what happened?
You got a kick in the face.
You can't go through life thinking the way you do.
People take advantage of you and make a fool of you the way she did.
- It's beginning to look as though you're right.
- Of course I'm right.
I was right about Helen, and now I'm right about this 3:00 business too.
This is another thing entirely, Monte.
Why is it?
They're just taking advantage of you in another way, that's all.
It's chaps like you that are meat for them.
All they gotta do is make it sound heroic, and you fall for it.
Listen, Roy, what's the difference if we don't go?
- But we can't get out of it now.
- Why can't we?
Listen, tell 'em...
tell 'em the motorcycle broke down.
Tell 'em anything.
What do you say, Roy?
Well...
Come on, old ooh-la-la.
Oh, no, no, no, Chèri.
Oh, baby.
N'est-ce pas?
Oh, oui, oui, madam.
Oh, baby.
Oh, stop looking at your watch, Roy.
You're not going anywhere.
Yes, I am and so are you.
Who says I am?
Listen, Monte, we're a little drunk and we've been talking wildly.
There's no way out of this and we know it.
Come on, Monte.
No, no.
Let me alone.
Come on, old ooh-la-la.
Monte.
Why, they'd court-martial us in a minute if we didn't show up.
Why, that's desertion, Monte.
They shoot people for that.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
Come on.
I suppose you're right.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Monte.
What a pair of fools we are.
Let's go.
Easy, now.
Easy.
Look out for the firing pin.
Righto.
I got it.
Contactor.
Contact.
Ground speed here.
Keep this site trained on the target.
Then pull the release when you hit the stop.
Do you understand?
Don't forget the leveller.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Contactor.
Contact.
Remember this ship weighs 20,000 pounds.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Roy, the depot.
Roy, look there!
They've seen us.
They're coming on.
For Christ's sake.
Hey, Roy, look.
They hit our right motor.
I got him!
Roy!
Look over there.
It's our squadrons.
They're coming!
Roy, they've gone.
Jesus.
Son of a Boche.
Hey!
It's me!
Hey!
It's me!
Goddamn it!
It's old Baldy.
Hey!
Baldy.
Hello.
It's Baldy.
Look, Roy.
It's Baldy.
You see that guy?
Good old Baldy.
Good boy.
See that?
He's got him.
Hey, look.
He's got him.
He's got him.
Oh.
Look.
They've changed around.
Our strut's gone.
That son of a bitch.
Roy, he got us!
Roy!
Go down!
Go down!
Go down!
One more for Baldy!
No more control?
Pull her up!
Oh, my God!
We're on fire!
We're burning!
Roy, get down!
Do something!
Roy!
Ah, so.
We meet again.
It was you who bombed the depot at Spraug, nicht wahr?
Yes.
And you were flying a German plane, nicht wahr?
- Yes.
- Very clever.
It is a pity you must take your congratulations from me.
There are a few questions I must ask you.
If you answer them simply, it will be easy for you.
To what squadron of the Royal Flying Corps are you attached?
Just why were you sent to bomb that munitions depot this morning?
It was our natural target.
But possibly it was to clear the way for a little surprise attack, huh?
You are surprised.
We know all about it, so you need not be afraid to talk.
Now, please, when and where is the attack to be made?
Oh, you are stupid not to tell.
It is nothing.
For you the war is over, nicht wahr?
We are friends.
Hmm.
Listen, if you tell me,
I will see that you are sent to a special camp reserved only for certain prisoners of war.
It's near Munich.
Far away from all this.
You will have every comfort.
And in a few months from now when the war is over, you will be alive and in good health, which is more than most of us will be able to say.
So, you see?
It can be easy for you.
Now, please.
So, you will not tell?
Possibly you do not know that flying a German plane... is the same as wearing a German uniform.
Any disguised soldier is a spy, nicht wahr?
And you know what happens to spies?
I think you two friends had better talk it over.
I will give you 15 minutes.
If you change your mind and tell, good.
If not, you will be shot.
Do you think he was bluffing?
No, he wasn't bluffing.
He's the man I was to fight that duel with.
Really?
Quite a coincidence.
He's got it in for me.
Nah, he's probably forgotten it by this time.
The brigade will be going over pretty soon, Monte.
Yes.
Roy, look.
Oh, save it to wipe your nose on.
God, what nerve.
Roy.
Roy, I can't face it.
I'm going to tell.
Don't be a fool, Monte.
Do you realize what it would mean if we told?
It would mean being alive when this bloody war's over.
But, Monte, you can't.
To hell with your heroic stuff.
I wanna live.
I'm not gonna be shot down like that.
I'm going to tell.
Wait a minute.
Monte.
But I...
Listen.
Let me go.
You?
Yes.
You're all upset.
I'll bargain with him, and perhaps I won't have to tell him everything.
I
- I'll come with you.
No.
You said he's got it in for you.
Now, let me do it alone.
All right.
Tell the general I'm ready to talk.
Good.
Come.
Ah, yes.
So, you have changed your mind?
Yes.
My friend will never tell, but I wanna live.
I'm ready to talk.
You are very wise.
Now, please, draw a rough map for me showing your positions, brigade numbers, disposition, hour of attack, purpose, number of men.
Wait a minute.
I'll tell only on one condition.
Ah, so, a condition.
Yes.
If I give this information, my friend will know it.
Back home after the war, he'll tell everyone that I was a traitor.
You leave that to me.
Why not let me have that satisfaction?
What do you mean?
I do not understand.
One does not kill a friend.
Friend.
He's not my friend.
He stole the girl I love and I hate him.
Huh.
History repeats itself.
You make rather hard terms.
I'll tell only on that condition.
One bullet.
What if I miss?
Give me two to make sure.
No.
A good soldier will need only one.
Very well.
Not so fast.
He will give you the bullet outside.
Well?
I didn't tell, Monte.
Why?
What happened?
Has he changed his mind?
No.
Don't you think you can go through with it now?
What do you mean?
Of course we can.
It won't even hurt.
It'll all be over in a second.
We can stand anything for a second.
No, no, Roy.
L-I can't do it.
I'm going to tell.
Listen, Monte.
We tell, the whole brigade will be wiped out.
Three thousand men, and they all want to live too.
You wouldn't spoil their chances, would you?
That's not my business.
I didn't start this war.
I didn't get them into this mess.
Let 'em take care of themselves.
They'll get wiped out sooner or later anyway.
I wanna live.
Live!
You won't tell, I'll tell.
Listen, Monte!
I'll tell!
I'll tell!
Let me out!
I'll tell everything I know.
The brigade is moving up.
They're going to attack...
Oh.
Roy.
Oh, Monte.
Monte.
Monte.
Monte.
Don't cry, Roy.
It was the only thing you could do.
The brigade, Roy.
Yes, Monte?
They'll be all right now, won't they?
Yes.
Who's that?
It's the general.
You...
You thought we'd tell, didn't you?
Good old Roy.
You won't tell, and I... forgotten... it all.
Oh, Roy.
Roy.
Yes?
Where are you?
Don't go away, Roy.
I'm here, Monte.
Can't you feel me holding you?
Hello, Karl.
Fig eights.
Cold up here in the night patrol.
Awful to be in the dark.
Oh.
I'm afraid.
Look out.
Look out!
We're falling!
We're going to crash!
Do something, Roy!
Quick!
Quick!
Quick!
It's all right, Monte.
Monte?
It's all right.
Monte?
Monte.
Oh.
Well?
You heard what my brother said.
Your brother?
I'll never tell you anything.
Achtung!
I'll be with you in just a minute, Monte.
Come on, you Seventh Brigade.
We got 'em now.
[Lively] [Chattering]
We are good.
Ah!
[German]
Ja!
Wunderbar!
[Man Yelling In German]
[German]
Look at that, Karl.
[Chattering In German]
[Both Laughing]
Well, Roy, you seem to like my country.
Like it?
I think it's marvelous.
Say, I wish we were staying here two years instead of just two weeks.
But you know, Karl, it does sound funny hearing you call it "your country."
I keep forgetting you're not English.
Oh, sometimes I...
Well, I feel almost English myself.
Well, that's natural.
After all, you can't be at Oxford three years... without feeling slightly British.
[Band]
I wish Helen were here.
After all you've said about her, I don't blame you.
[German]
Your brother is not coming today, Herr Rutledge?
Oh, yes, he'll be along soon, Gretchen.
Nothing can keep Monte away from this good beer.
[Chuckles] Nothing except a good-looking woman.
[Laughs] Jawohl.
That brother of yours, he's a naughty boy, but I like him.
He has a way with them, hey, Gretchen?
[Laughs] You, you don't know half of it.
Another conquest for Monte.
Yes.
I don't know why he wants to mess about with every woman he meets.
Yeah, but you have Helen.
I'm not at all sure.
I'm not half good enough for her.
She must be a wonderful girl.
Oh, she is.
She's marvelous.
You'll have to meet her when we get back to Oxford.
- I'd like to.
- Would you like to see what she looks like?
Yes.
I didn't know you had a photograph of her.
Yeah, and neither does Helen.
I took it myself when she wasn't looking.
Really?
Oh.
Stunning, isn't she?
Why, she's marvelous.
Cheerio, you blighters.
Hello, it's Monte.
Meet the countess.
Step up, gents, to the one and only...
Now, Monte, don't, please.
Oh, it's all right.
This little pretzel doesn't understand a word of English.
No?
Gretchen!
[German] Ja!
[Gretchen, In German]
[Countess In German]
[Chuckling]
Found her at the museum.
Yeah, she's a work of art, all right.
You should have left her there.
[All Laughing]
[German] Shh!
Quiet!
I say, Monte, why do you bring around this sort?
Bring her?
Good heavens, I can't get rid of her.
Go home, will you?
Go home.
[German]
You see, I'm stuck.
Hello.
Who's the dowager?
That's Helen.
Oh.
But, of course, that's only a snapshot.
Wait till you meet her.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Go away!
[Laughs]
[German] [Men Laughing]
I say.
This is getting serious.
I've got to get rid of her.
Oh, you know, I have a very important engagement in just 15 minutes.
I say, you chaps, be... be sporting and take her off my hands.
But after all, Monte...
We may be sporting, but we're not feeble-minded.
Well, you can do what you please with her.
I'm going.
Hey, listen, Monte...
Auf Wiedersehen.
[Continues In German]
Here, just a minute now.
Please.
Leave her to me.
I'll get rid of her.
Please.
Yes.
[German]
[German] Ja.
[German] Nein.
Nein.
Nein.
Nein.
Roy!
No!
Roy!
[Roy] No, carry on.
Carry on.
Pretty boy, you please me very much.
[Doorbell Rings]
What's that?
It is nothing.
I am not at home to anyone except my husband.
And he is away on army business.
He will not be home for hours.
So, you see...
Charming.
[German] [German]
But really, l-I say you mustn't think that...
Your name?
My name is, uh, Rutledge, sir.
You are stopping in Munich?
At the Hotel Bayrischer Hof, sir.
[Clicks Heels Together]
My seconds will call on you later.
But I say you...
There is nothing further to discuss.
Sailing, sailing over the bounding main
Where many a wintery wind shall blow 'ere Jack comes home again
Hello.
Where you going?
Sailing, sailing England.
England?
Why, we're not going back for 10 days.
What's wrong?
[Clicks Heels Together]
Baron Von Kranz.
Who's he?
Oh, he's just a friend of mine.
Really?
Quite a social success, aren't you?
How do you meet these barons?
Well, unfortunately, I met this one through his wife.
And this means...
A duel.
Can you imagine it?
Running away?
Oh, don't be an ass.
Roy.
You don't expect me to go through with a farce like this.
It's the only thing you can do.
Oh, there you go again.
I suppose when a woman's no good and her husband finds it out,
I've got to get shot, just because it's the honorable thing to do.
Well, what do you think people will say?
You'll never live it down.
What do I care what people say?
Well, you can talk all you like, Monte, but you can't walk out like this.
Can't I?
Good-bye.
See you at Oxford.
Hello, Roy.
Hello, Karl.
Well, what's up?
Where's Monte?
He's gone to England.
England?
Well, what's the matter?
Oh, nothing.
But I say...
[Knocking]
Herr Rutledge?
Herr Rutledge?
Yes?
Von Richter.
Von Schlieben.
We represent Colonel Baron Von Kranz.
Yes.
Have you chosen your second?
According to custom, we have selected the time and place.
You have the choice of weapons.
What is your choice?
[German]
What is this?
Golden Aue.
Why, that's a famous dueling place near here.
It says at 4:00 tomorrow morning.
4:00 in the morning.
Well, how did this happen?
l-I'm sorry, Karl.
l-I lost my temper with one of your officers.
But, Roy...
Say, Karl, do you know how to be a second?
[Engine Running]
Wait here, Roy.
[German]
Bitte.

[All Yelling, Cheering]
Hey, did anybody see my green socks?
[Man] Check in the garbage.
Hello there, Roy.
Hello, Elliot.
Glad to see you.
I'm certainly glad to see you back.
Thank you.
And where's your German accent?
Well, I couldn't get it past the Custom officials.
Oh, I say, what have you done to your arm?
Oh, nothing.
It's just a little scratch.
I was hunting in Germany.
I'll see you at dinner?
Righto.
Good.
See you later.
Why aren't you getting dressed?
Aren't you coming to meet Helen?
Oh, yes, but don't remind me of it.
Don't be foolish.
She expects us for tea.
Tea?
Listen, it'll do you good to meet a nice girl.
Oh, well, all right, but first we've gotta get you dressed.
Say, we've gotta get him dressed.
He's going to see his girl.
Now, now, wait a minute, now.
Listen, I've gotta have my shirt!
[Overlapping Yelling]
Wait a minute.
L...
Listen, I'm old enough to dress myself!
No, you're not.
Will you cut it out?
Say, listen, will you pl...
[All Cheering]
Will you...
Hey, my green socks!
[Doorbell Rings]
[Ring]
Is Helen in?
Miss Helen is not at home, sir.
She's expecting us.
Would you care to wait?
Yes, thank you.
Fine reception.
Oh.
Roy, maybe she's forgotten.
Not Helen.
She's not that sort.
Oh.
Roy, I feel sick.
l-I think I'd better go.
- Monte, will you sit down?
- Oh, I've got an awful headache.
I think I'll go to the chemist and get something for it.
Monte.
[Door Closes]
- Roy!
- Helen!
Oh, terribly sorry.
Mother's fault.
Shopping.
I simply flew My, isn't it hot?
You shouldn't have hurried so.
Oh, but I wanted to.
Roy, you've no right to look so cool.
I'm broiling.
Feel.
Yes, you are, aren't you?
No, not one.
Well, you're so marvelous, l-I hardly dare.
Oh, silly.
Well, that's better.
Cigarette, Roy?
I thought your brother was coming.
Went out with a headache.
Poor boy.
It must be the heat.
[Paperboy] Extry, extry!
All about the war!
[Continues Yelling, Indistinct]
Well, they've done it.
I never thought they would.
I still can't believe it.
Well, it must be true.
It's official.
Oh, shut up.
I'm trying to think.
It's terrible.
Karl, you won't have to go, will you?
Me?
Oh, Roy, I hope not.
Oh, they can't want me.
I'm not a soldier.
What use would I be to them?
I couldn't... kill anyone.
They couldn't make me do that, could they, Roy?
Oh, I think it'll all be over in a couple of weeks.
I'm not so sure.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Then suppose England comes in.
Why, Roy, that'd be horrible.
I never could do that.
Why, I love England.
Oh, will you shut up?
Monte, Germany's declared war on France.
Hmm?
Oh.
Oh, Roy, how do you spell "ecstatic"?
Hmm?
[Knocking]
Special delivery letter for Karl Arnstedt.
What's the matter, Karl?
Someone ill?
Karl.
May I ask the Prime Minister if he has any information he can give us today.
Our ambassador at Berlin received his passport at 7:00 last evening.
And since 11:00 last night, a state of war has existed between Germany and ourselves.
[Murmuring]
Seven?
What size?
A seven and a half if you please.
l-I'm afraid it's a bit small, sir.
Move along, there.
Move along.
You'll grow into it.
Present arms!
Come on there.
Come on.
Present arms!
Give it to him, you bloody fool.
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Sleeping sickness?
Here, here.
Let go of that gun, you clinging vine.
Let go, do you hear?
God, you're enough to turn a man's stomach.
Hey, you with the fallen arches...
I've enlisted, Monte, in the Royal Flying Corps.
You're a fool, Roy.
[Chattering] Really?
How lovely.
My grandfather was in the guard during the Revolution.
Oh, he was?
Oh, Roy, you look marvelous in uniform.
Thank you.
Doesn't he?
It's ripping.
Where?
Tell me, what have you joined?
The infantry?
No, the Royal Flying Corps.
Oh, of course.
And all the misery in this world has been caused... by and for capitalism!
Why should we fight this war?
For capitalism?
You will die!
You will die!
All your sons will die for capitalism!
Down with capitalism!
Down with war!
Down with the anarchists.
[Man] That's right.
[Clamoring]
[Murmuring]
[Officer] Get back now.
Who do you think you're shoving?
There's the man I'd like to kiss.
What's the matter?
Afraid of a kiss?
[Man] Maybe he's yeller!
Go on, you.
Go on and fight for your country.
[Woman] Slacker!
[Crowd Yelling]
Come on.
But really, you don't understand.
I didn't mean to do anything.
Say, I'd rather marry the girl.
[Man, Indistinct] You'll never get your wings that way.
Hi.
How are you?
Oh, boy.
Say, listen, that first solo flight certainly is a great thrill.
It certainly felt great.
[Engine Sputtering]
I will.
[Man] Wonder who that is out there.
That was a fine landing.
Look at him come out of there.
[Continues Indistinct]
[Sighs]
Look, boys, it's Monte.
[Whistling "America"]
Hey, how'd it go, Monte?
Oh, great.
Well, tonight's the night, Monte.
Yeah.
Say, listen, be more cheerful.
You have a treat in store meeting Helen.
Must be Friday the 13th.
Gee, l-I wonder if she'll wear her canteen uniform.
If she does, you can count me out.
Oh, she looks stunning in it.
Who wants to be stunned?
I'm only going as a favor to you.
You and I don't like the same kind of girls.
[Guffaws] Hurry up, will you?
Oh, it's a waste of time to polish these.
She'll probably step all over them the first dance anyway.
Safer to sit it out.
Quiet little corner and a have a chat about votes for women.
Hello there.
Hello.
Whose window are you warbling under tonight?
Lady Randolph's Charity Ball.
Wash your neck and come along.
Oh, but I haven't been invited.
That's all right.
I'm on the committee.
No, I don't think I'll go.
A smart boy.
[Waltz]
I wonder where Helen is.
She should be here by this time.
How do you do, sir?
There's she is.
Don't point.
It's rude.
Oh, Helen.
Roy!
Hello.
Hello, old thing.
You're frightfully late.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
Oh, Helen, this is Monte.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Well, that's done at last.
You know, you two have been avoiding each other for weeks.
Helen, may I have this next dance?
What?
Oh, of course.
Oh, Roy, there you are.
Good evening, Lady Randolph.
I must say, you take your duties on my committee very lightly.
I'm sorry.
Where have you been?
You've completely disarranged my program.
There are no end of things to be done.
Helen dear, you don't mind, do you?
Come along, Roy.
Come at once.
I'm sorry, Helen.
Uh, Monte, would you take this next dance with Helen?
Oh, how do you do, Monte?
How do you do?
Now come along.
[Lady Randolph Continues, Indistinct]
Well?
[Waltz]
[Ends]
Ahem.
Oh.
Hello, Roy.
l-I really must go and find, uh, Jimmy Kerrigan.
He has something most important to tell me.
I...
Who is this Jimmy Kerrigan?
Kerrigan?
I've never heard of him.
Oh.
[Waltz]
What are you thinking of?
If you must know, I was thinking of Monte.
Do you like him?
Yes, I like him.
He's a marvelous dancer.
Well, Monte does all those things well.
Helen.
What?
May I?
Oh, Monte.
Oh, hello there.
Come sit down.
You having a better time than you expected, Monte?
Marvelous.
Been dancing with a beautiful brunette, name of Eleanor.
She's perfect.
Oh, Eleanor Madden.
You don't really think she's beautiful?
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty?
Stop it.
I'm not a cat.
Yes, you are.
Well, if I'm a kitty, I'm a thirsty kitty.
Roy dear, will you please get me a glass of punch?
Why, of course I will.
No, I'll go, Roy.
No, I'm the committee.
You stay here and look after this wallflower.
But really, I...
Oh, if you'd rather not...
Well, l-I didn't mean...
Don't you like wallflowers?
I shouldn't have done that.
Oh, you're not sorry, Monte.
Awfully sorry.
I had no right to.
What if I'm glad?
But what about Roy?
Isn't that my business?
I suppose so, but...
Hush.
Compliments of the committee.
Thanks awfully, Roy.
Well, has he been properly charming?
Me?
More than charming.
Good for you, Monte.
Taste?
[Waltz]
She loves me.
She blisters you.
It's worth it.
Is she worth it?
Depends on who she is.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Well, thank goodness Lady Randolph's lost sight of me for a minute.
Roy, you've been neglecting me shamefully.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
You see, it's this beastly committee.
Lady Randolph won't let me alone a minute.
Oh, Roy, there you are.
Yes, here I am.
Do you mind?
Where is that list?
Would you mind finding Sir John for me?
It's about my Canteen Unit.
I must have the queen's signature.
It's so important.
My dear, why don't you get into your uniform?
You look so pretty in it.
And, Monte, shouldn't you dance with Mary Blunt?
Yes, why don't you?
And, Roy.
Roy, will you find Sir John?
I want you to lead the grand dance for me.
And really, there are so many things you've got to do.
[Continues, Indistinct] Yes.
L-I'm terribly sorry.
Uh, back soon.
You see, those girls have been looking for you.
But, Lady Randolph, I'm supposed to...
So, you've really joined Lady Lizzie's Canteen Unit?
Rather.
Chance of a lifetime.
We go to France in two weeks.
Two weeks?
Well, Roy says you're sailing the 15th.
Is that so?
[Yawns] Bored?
Tired.
Take me home, Monte.
Home?
It's not far.
I've taken a flat in town near Canteen Headquarters.
But, I mean, Roy will be quite upset to find you gone.
That's what he gets for being on committee.
But, really...
Very well.
I'll find someone else.
Oh, I didn't mean to be rude.
Well, come on then.
[Engine Off]
Are we here?
Well, it's number 27.
Wanna come up for a cigarette and a drink?
Oh, really, you must be awfully tired.
No, I'm not.
Come see my room.
I've only had a place of my own for a week.
It's a new toy.
What a baby you are.
Alley-oop.
All right.
Well, this is jolly.
Sit down and I'll get you a drink.
Thanks.
Say when.
Whoa.
When!
When!
Would you be shocked if I put on something more comfortable?
I'll try to survive.
Well, are you more comfortable now?
Yes, are you?
Oh, yes.
You know, it seems strange being here like this after hearing Roy rave about you for months.
Does Roy rave?
Oh, rather.
He idolizes you.
Oh, I do wish he wouldn't.
It makes me feel guilty.
I can understand his raving now.
Oh, don't be silly.
You're not a bit like Roy, are you?
I should say not.
Roy's frightfully high-minded.
He doesn't approve of me.
He wouldn't approve of me either if he knew what I'm really like.
Doesn't he know?
No.
When I'm with Roy, I'm the way Roy wants me to be.
That's caddish, isn't it?
But I can't help it.
I understand.
Roy wouldn't.
May I ask you a very personal question?
Yes.
Do you love Roy?
No, not really.
Not the way Roy wants me to love him.
I can't.
Roy's love means marriage and children... and never anyone but Roy.
I couldn't bear that.
I wanna be free.
I wanna be gay and have fun.
Life's short, and I wanna live while I'm alive.
I know, that...
that's the way I feel too.
I...
I think I'd better go.
Must you?
I really should.
Pull.
Cold in here now, isn't it?
Have you a match?
Why so gloomy?
God, I'm rotten.
I can't see it.
Can't you?
Well, then you're rotten too.
What do you mean?
And Roy worships you.
You!
Well?
Don't you make yourself sick...
you and Roy.
God, that's funny.
Get out of here!
Don't worry.
I can't get out fast enough.
Get out!
[Door Closes] And stay out!
Where have you been?
Oh, I, uh...
I stopped at a... at a bar after I took Helen home.
Oh.
How'd you like her?
Oh, she's all right.
Pass in a crowd, eh?
I daresay she would.
Just what do you mean by that?
Listen, Roy, let me tell you something.
Even if it hurts.
Yes?
I wouldn't be so idealistic about Helen if I were you.
And why not?
Well, I...
I just wouldn't, that's all.
Well, why not?
Oh, I don't know.
Forget it.
Never mind crawling.
Out with it.
Listen, Roy, I tell you.
Women are all the same.
You look at every woman as a barmaid.
You don't know anything about decent women.
Oh, all right.
You know it all then.
Oh, you've said enough.
Shut up.

Yeah, just our luck.
Lucky we weren't both killed.
Well, we're through.

Roy, it's falling!
Look at that, Roy.
Great, isn't it?
They're done for.
Look out!
Run!
[Whistling]
Just a minute.
Why the blazes don't you look where you're going, sir?
I'm sorry, sir.
Isn't it customary to salute one's superior officer?
Thank you.
What is your name, sir?
Lieutenant Roy Rutledge.
Make a note of that.
Yes, sir.
[Helen] Would you like to try it and find out?
[Man] They are.
They glisten in the sun.
What the hell you trying to do?
It took me three hours to write that.
You're nothing but a pest anyhow.
Sit down.
Oh, don't, Bruce.
You shouldn't smoke so many.
What difference does it make?
You know it's bad for you.
Buy a chocolate, miss.
Change, miss.
Please.
That's a good boy.
What a life it would be married to you.
Oh, you don't fancy it?
Beastly.
No smokes.
Think of all the money we'd save.
What would we spend it on?
Oh, a diamond dog collar.
For me?
No.
I'd buy a muzzle for you.
You wouldn't spoil my beautiful mustache, would you?
No.
We'd keep that in the parlor under glass.
Hello, Helen.
Oh, hello, Roy.
Roy, I'd like you to meet Captain Redfield.
Lieutenant Rutledge.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Beastly weather.
Yes, isn't it.
- You'll get used to it.
- Thanks.
Gee, it's great to see you again, Helen.
It's been four whole days.
Really?
- Have you been over long?
- Three weeks.
Oh.
Three weeks.
Everything all right up your way?
Oh, yes.
Your squadron near here?
Twenty miles up the line.
Twenty miles.
That far.
- You chaps have it rather soft, haven't you?
- Do you think so?
Well, I mean to say being able to dash about the countryside and all that.
Wish I'd picked the R.F.C.
Well, why didn't you?
Roy.
Well, I must be going.
Oh.
Don't go.
I think I'd better.
Good-bye, Helen, and don't forget your promise.
I won't.
Who's that bag of wind?
Would you mind not talking about my friends like that?
Oh, now, Helen, please.
Oh, you were perfectly beastly to him.
I'm terribly sorry.
Guess my nerves are a bit raw.
Things haven't been so easy this last week.
Oh, you've been fighting?
Did you shoot down any Boche?
Yes.
I managed to get a couple.
Really?
How thrilling.
Tell me about it.
Well, there's really nothing much to tell.
Three bars of chocolate, miss.
[Piano:

Oh, Jymes.
Oh, Jymes.
Bread, Jymes.
We want bread.
[Chanting] We want bread!
Coming, sir.
Coming!
Did you ever try hurrying, Jymes?
Sorry, sir, but I stopped to dig a few of the cockroaches out of it, sir.
[Laughter] Well, put it down.
[Clamoring]
Well, where's the bread?
Did you ever try hurrying, sir?
- [Laughter]
- Jymes, more bread.
Drown the cockroaches this time.
Yes, sir.
Jymes, what's the taste in this soup?
I can't say, sir.
[Man] It's not soup, it's soap.
[Man #2] I think it's shoe polish.
Sorry, sir.
Cook said the soup was a bit weak tonight.
Maybe you taste the disinfectant in the water, sir.
Oh.
Well, strike me blind, it's a hair.
[Man] Wash it off and wear it, Baldy.
[Laughing]
Hello, you chaps.
Hello, Monte.
How goes it?
[Men Singing On Victrola]
Still no news of Harry?
No.
Somebody always gets it on the night patrol.
What do you think, Marryat?
You saw it happen.
Is there any chance he got down alive?
No, I don't think so.
The searchlights got him.
We were flying low and they heard us.
We started to climb, but it was too late.
Shrapnel began bursting all around him.
Two bursts caught him and he started to drop.
It was awful to see him down there, twisting and diving... crippled, always dropping.
Trying every way to get clear of those lights.
Then another burst got him.
We could hear him screaming...
Stop!
I can't stand it.
[Man] Good thing he took your place, Rutledge.
You might've got it instead of him.
Oh, I'll get it sooner or later.
We'll all get it.
Isn't there any end to this?
Oh, shut up.
You're always whining.
Shut up yourself.
Who'll make me?
I'll make you.
[Clamoring]
Sit down, Jack, and be quiet.
All right.
What's the matter with you fellas?
Would anybody like to take Monte's place on tonight's patrol?
[Jeering] Lay off.
[Man] No more soup.
We need some.
No more soup.
We need some soup.
[Men Shouting] [Man] Jymes!
Hurry it up.
[Laughter] [Man] Splendid.
Splendid, Jymes.
[Laughter Continues]
Splendid.
That's what comes from hurrying.
What was dinner before you dropped it, Jymes?
A tasty bit of salmon, sir.
Sewer trout again?
Hasn't the cook anything else?
Well, sir, there's that tin of pork and beans.
No, we don't want that.
Can he do anything with the garbage?
Oh, well, never mind.
We aren't hungry, are we?
[All Saying "No"] Coffee, Jymes.
Yes, sir.
And, Jymes.
Yes, sir?
Don't let anything hurry you.
No, sir.
[Man] Drinking again?
[Chattering]
You dirty louse!
Hey, Baldy.
The sooner you get shot down, the better.
Baldy, darling.
[Laughing] Now that didn't hurt, Baldy.
[Chattering]
Monte!
What's the matter with you?
Attention.
As you were.
The following officers will report for night patrol.
Drayton.
Yes, sir.
Fuller.
Here, sir.
Maloney.
Oh, no.
Not an old baldheaded man like me up there in the cold, cold air.
[Laughing] Perhaps Fritz will warm it up for you.
Neville.
Here, sir.
Monte Rutledge.
Monte Rutledge.
I don't feel very well tonight, sir.
That's all right, boy.
None of us feel well.
But you don't understand.
I think I do, Rutledge.
But I say, sir.
You don't understand.
Th-There seems to be something the matter with me.
I know what's the matter with him.
He's yellow.
Oh, shut up.
Oh, let's say it.
Didn't Harry go west last night because he took this man's place?
Keep quiet, Jack.
I will not keep quiet.
He's yellow and we all know it.
That's a lie!
I'm not yellow.
I can see things as they are, that's all.
I'm sick of this rotten business.
You fools.
Why do you let them kill you like this?
What are you fighting for?
Patriotism.
Duty.
Are you mad?
Can't you see they're just words?
Words coined by politicians and profiteers to trick you into fighting for them.
What's a word compared with life...
the only life you've got.
I'll give 'em a word.
Murder!
That's what this dirty rotten politician's war is.
Murder!
You know it as well as I do.
Yellow, am I?
You're the ones that are yellow.
I've got guts to say what I think.
You're afraid to say it.
So afraid to be called yellow, you'd rather be killed first.
You fools!
You poor, stupid fools.
Oh, Monte.
Now, pull yourself together, will ya?
[Murmuring]
Stand up, Rutledge!
I've taken a lot of shirking from you since we came out here, but this is a bit too much.
Sir, he really is ill.
You're a disgrace to your squadron.
Go to your quarters.
Yes, sir.
[Chattering]
Have a cigarette.
You don't think I'm yellow, do you, Roy?
Why, of course not.
You're just more sensitive than the rest of us.
I wonder.
[Sniffs] Well, stop thinking about it.
I wish I could.
Haven't I been up twice on the night patrol?
I'm trying to do my share.
Of course you are now.
You...
You must be pretty well fed up with me after all this.
Oh, that's rot.
l-I'm not yellow.
I'm not!
Oh, now, Monte.
Come on.
Pull yourself together.
[Whistle Blows] [Man Yells Orders]
Staff Colonel.
Everybody out.
Come on, Monte.
Stand easy.
Well, men, I don't like what I have to say, but let's face it, you all know the central munition dump at Spraug.
You've tried three times to bomb that depot without success.
No fault of yours, of course, they've guarded it too closely.
That munition depot at Spraug must be destroyed tomorrow morning.
Now, then, today a German bombing plane was forced down within our lines.
We were lucky enough to capture it before they had a chance to destroy it.
We've fixed it up so it'll fly.
We want to use this plane to bomb the Spraug depot.
There's no question that the venture will succeed this time.
The enemy won't suspect one of their own planes until after the depot is bombed.
Then when they discover the trick, well, you... you may have a little difficulty in getting back.
I need two men to fly this plane.
I'll go, sir.
Are you sure you wanna go?
Quite sure, sir.
Very well.
I'll go with him, sir.
Who are these men?
Lieutenants Monte and Roy Rutledge, sir.
Brothers, eh?
Dismissed.
Now, young men,
I want you to realize how important this is.
The Seventh Brigade has been ordered to go over the top in a surprise attack tomorrow evening at dusk.
The brigade doesn't know it, but I
- I'm afraid they're going to be slaughtered.
There's too much artillery in front of us.
If you destroy that munition depot early tomorrow morning, it will weaken the enemy artillery, and we may be able to get through.
Hundreds of lives depend on you.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Now, another thing.
The plane you are to fly... is far too dangerous a piece of armament to let the enemy recapture it.
It must return or be destroyed.
If you were captured, you'd be shot as spies anyway.
Baldy.
Oh, Baldy?
You'll take the morning patrol in towards Spraug as far as you can.
You might possibly help them get back.
By all means.
Yes, sir.
You'll get your maps and final instructions just before taking off.
Report to the field at 3:00 a.m. Until then, let them do as they please.
- Yes, sir. 3:00, you two.
- Yes, sir.
Good luck.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
- What time is it, Monte?
- Ten past 9:00.
Helen's canteen closes at 10:00.
We've just enough time to get there.
- Do you think they'll let us have the motorcycle?
- Why, of course.
We're "it" tonight.
Yeah.
We're "it" all right.
Not sorry, are you?
Oh, let's not talk about it.
I'm not even gonna think about it until 3:00.
[Chuckles]
What's your program?
Wine, women and song?
Oh, perhaps I'll do without the song tonight.
[Chuckles]
[Whistling]
- See you at Grosson's?
- Either there or at Jacques across the street.
- Wherever you hear the most noise.
- Don't you wanna come in with me to see Helen?
Oh, I better not.
Righto.
[Blowing] Where's Helen?
She's gone out.
Oh.
Was she expecting you?
No.
Would you care to leave a note?
Yes, I think I will.
Pen and ink on the table.
You'll see that she gets this?
Oh, yes.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
[Engine Cranks]
Hello.
What's up?
She isn't in.
That's tough.
Wanna come along with me?
Where to?
Grosson's.
Righto.
[Engine Cranks] Your switch on?
[Engine Revs]
[Chattering]
Will you close it a little?
[Speaking French]
- Helen.
- Well, if it isn't old Roy.
Old solemn Roy himself.
[Slurring] Sit down, Roy.
Sit on the floor and hang your legs over.
- Take your hands off her.
- Oh, I can't take my hands off.
You heard what I said.
Take your hands off her.
Who asked you to this party anyway?
Helen, let me take you home.
Home?
Who wants to go home?
I'm having a marvelous time.
I was until you came in.
I advise you to get out before you're kicked out.
Keep your...
Keep your filthy hands off of my girl.
Your girl.
You fool.
I wouldn't belong to you if you were the last man on Earth.
You're nothing to me.
Nothing.
Come on, Roy.
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
Oh, let's have it out.
I don't love you.
I never have.
I never had any fun with you anyway.
You and your high ideals.
You're too good to live.
You're just a stupid prig if you ask me.
You make me sick, do you hear?
Sick.
Now, get out here.
I hate the sight of you!
Come on, Roy.
Let's go across the street.
[Drunken Singing]
[Chattering]
[French Accent] Sweet, sweet baby.
Handsome, big, strong baby.
N'est-ce pas?
[Continues In French]
Mmm, n'est-ce pas, kiss Papa, huh?
Oh, baby.
[Squeals]
Hello, chèri.
[Continues In French]
Aw, don't take it so hard, Roy.
Forget it.
- Is your friend sick?
- [Laughs]
No.
He'll be all right.
Drink up, Roy.
I still can't believe it.
You just don't know anything about women.
They're all the same.
I've been telling you that for years.
Maybe you'll believe me now.
- Oh, Helen's not that sort.
- Oh, nonsense.
- It's the war.
She's changed.
- You're wrong, Roy.
War doesn't change people.
It's...
It's like getting drunk.
It brings out what people really are.
You can't make me believe Helen was like that before.
Well, she was.
I've known it all along.
You too?
Oh, I'm sorry, Roy.
Don't take it so hard.
She isn't worth it.
[Squeals]
- I suppose you're right.
- Of course I'm right.
Listen, Roy, never love a woman.
Just make love to her.
You see, like this.
Look.
[Woman In French]
[Loud Kiss] Go ahead, Roy.
Try it.
That's the way.
[Ticking Loudly]
Oh!
What you do, baby?
All wet!
No, no, no, no!
Imbecile!
Aw, baby.
Voilà.
Hey, listen, Monte.
Monte.
Go easy.
We gotta go up at 3:00.
[Slurring] Oh, listen, Roy.
To hell with this 3:00 business.
What do you mean?
Just that.
To hell with it.
Say, you're crazy, Monte.
We can't get out of it now.
Oh, why can't we?
Listen, Roy, all this idealistic stuff won't get you anywhere.
You tried it on Helen and what happened?
You got a kick in the face.
You can't go through life thinking the way you do.
People take advantage of you and make a fool of you the way she did.
- It's beginning to look as though you're right.
- Of course I'm right.
I was right about Helen, and now I'm right about this 3:00 business too.
This is another thing entirely, Monte.
Why is it?
They're just taking advantage of you in another way, that's all.
It's chaps like you that are meat for them.
All they gotta do is make it sound heroic, and you fall for it.
Listen, Roy, what's the difference if we don't go?
- But we can't get out of it now.
- Why can't we?
Listen, tell 'em...
tell 'em the motorcycle broke down.
Tell 'em anything.
What do you say, Roy?
Well...
[Slurring] Come on, old ooo-la-la.
Oh, no, no, no, chèri.
[Continues In French] [French]
Oh, baby.
N'est-ce pas?
Oh, oui, oui, madam.
Oh, baby.
Oh, stop looking at your watch, Roy.
You're not going anywhere.
Yes, I am and so are you.
Who says I am?
Listen, Monte, we're a little drunk and we've been talking wildly.
There's no way out of this and we know it.
Come on, Monte.
No, no.
Let me alone.
Come on, old ooo-la-la.
[French] Monte.
Why, they'd court-martial us in a minute if we didn't show up.
Why, that's desertion, Monte.
They shoot people for that.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
Come on.
I suppose you're right.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Monte.
What a pair of fools we are.
Let's go.
[Straining]
Easy, now.
Easy.
Look out for the firing pin.
Righto.
I got it.
[Roy] Contactor.
[Monte] Contact.
[Sputtering]
Ground speed here.
Keep this site trained on the target.
Then pull the release when you hit the stop.
Do you understand?
Don't forget the leveler.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
[Roy] Contactor.
Contact.
Remember this ship weighs 20,000 pounds.
Good luck.
Thank you.
[Chattering In German]
[Chattering]
[Cheering]
[Vehicle Approaching]
Roy, the depot.
Roy, look there!
They've seen us.
They're coming on.
For Christ's sake.
Hey, Roy, look.
They hit our right motor.
I got him!
Roy!
Look over there.
It's our squadrons.
They're coming!
[Yelling, Indistinct]
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Screams]
[Groaning]
Roy, they've gone.
Jesus.
Son of a Boche.
Hey!
It's me!
Hey!
It's me!
Goddamn it!
It's old Baldy.
Hey!
Baldy.
Hello.
It's Baldy.
Look, Roy.
It's Baldy.
You see that guy?
[Blows Raspberry]
Good old Baldy.
Good boy.
See that?
He's got him.
Hey, look.
He's got him.
He's got him.
Oh.
Look.
They've changed around.
Our strut's gone.
That son of a bitch.
Roy, he got us!
Roy!
Go down!
Go down!
Go down!
One more for Baldy!
No more control?
Pull her up!
Oh, my God!
We're on fire!
We're burning!
Roy, get down!
Do something!
Roy!
[Speaking German]
[Speaking German]
[German]
[Heavy German Accent] Ah, so.
We meet again.
It was you who bombed the depot at Spraug, nicht wahr?
Yes.
And you were flying a German plane, nicht wahr?
- Yes.
- Very clever.
It is a pity you must take your congratulations from me.
There are a few questions I must ask you.
If you answer them simply, it will be easy for you.
To what squadron of the Royal Flying Corps are you attached?
Just why were you sent to bomb that munition depot this morning?
It was our natural target.
But possibly it was to clear the way for a little surprise attack, huh?
[Laughs] You are surprised.
We know all about it, so you need not be afraid to talk.
Now, please, when and where is the attack to be made?
Oh, you are stupid not to tell.
It is nothing.
For you the war is over, nicht wahr?
We are friends.
Hmm.
Listen, if you tell me,
I will see that you are sent to a special camp reserved only for certain prisoners of war.
It's near Munich.
Far away from all this.
You will have every comfort.
And in a few months from now when the war is over, you will be alive and in good health, which is more than most of us will be able to say.
So, you see?
It can be easy for you.
Now, please.
So, you will not tell?
Possibly you do not know that flying a German plane... is the same as wearing a German uniform.
Any disguised soldier is a spy, nicht wahr?
And you know what happens to spies?
I think you two friends had better talk it over.
I will give you 15 minutes.
If you change your mind and tell, good.
If not, you will be shot.
[German]
[Lock Clicks]
Do you think he was bluffing?
No, he wasn't bluffing.
He's the man I was to fight that duel with.
Really?
Quite a coincidence.
He's got it in for me.
Nah, he's probably forgotten it by this time.
The brigade will be going over pretty soon, Monte.
Yes.
[Footsteps Marching]
[Officer Shouts Orders In German]
Roy, look.
Oh, save it to wipe your nose on.
[German]
[Guns Cocking]
[Gunfire]
God, what nerve.
Roy.
Roy, I can't face it.
I'm going to tell.
Don't be a fool, Monte.
Do you realize what it would mean if we told?
It would mean being alive when this bloody war's over.
But, Monte, you can't.
To hell with your heroic stuff.
I wanna live.
I'm not gonna be shot down like that.
I'm going to tell.
Wait a minute.
Monte.
But I...
Listen.
Let me go.
You?
Yes.
You're all upset.
I'll bargain with him, and perhaps I won't have to tell him everything.
l-I'll come with you.
No.
You said he's got it in for you.
Now, let me do it alone.
All right.
[Officer Shouting In German]
Tell the general I'm ready to talk.
Good.
Come.
[German]
[Together] Ah, yes.
[Telegraph Machine Clicking]
So, you have changed your mind?
Yes.
My friend will never tell, but I wanna live.
I'm ready to talk.
You are very wise.
Now, please, draw a rough map for me showing your positions, brigade numbers, disposition, hour of attack, purpose, number of men.
Wait a minute.
I'll tell only on one condition.
Ah, so, a condition.
Yes.
If I give this information, my friend will know it.
Back home after the war, he'll tell everyone that I was a traitor.
You leave that to me.
Why not let me have that satisfaction?
What do you mean?
I do not understand.
One does not kill a friend.
Friend.
He's not my friend.
He stole the girl I love and I hate him.
Huh.
History repeats itself.
You make rather hard terms.
I'll tell only on that condition.
One bullet.
What if I miss?
Give me two to make sure.
No.
A good soldier will need only one.
Very well.
Not so fast.
[German]
He will give you the bullet outside.
Well?
I didn't tell, Monte.
Why?
What happened?
Has he changed his mind?
No.
Don't you think you can go through with it now?
What do you mean?
Of course we can.
It won't even hurt.
It'll all be over in a second.
We can stand anything for a second.
No, no, Roy.
L-I can't do it.
I'm going to tell.
Listen, Monte.
We tell, the whole brigade will be wiped out.
Three thousand men, and they all want to live too.
You wouldn't spoil their chances, would you?
That's not my business.
I didn't start this war.
I didn't get them into this mess.
Let 'em take care of themselves.
They'll get wiped out sooner or later anyway.
I wanna live.
Live!
You won't tell, I'll tell.
Listen, Monte!
I'll tell!
I'll tell!
Let me out!
I'll tell everything I know.
The brigade is moving up.
They're going to attack...
[Grunts]
Oh.
Roy.
Oh, Monte.
Monte.
Monte.
Monte.
[Exhales]
Don't cry, Roy.
It was the only thing you could do.
[Groans]
The brigade, Roy.
Yes, Monte?
They'll be all right now, won't they?
Yes.
Who's that?
It's the general.
You...
You thought we'd tell, didn't you?
Good old Roy.
You won't tell, and I... forgotten... it all.
[Gasping] Oh, Roy.
Roy.
Yes?
Where are you?
Don't go away, Roy.
[Gasps] I'm here, Monte.
Can't you feel me holding you?
Hello, Karl.
Fig eights.
Cold up here in the night patrol.
Awful to be in the dark.
Oh.
I'm afraid.
Look out.
Look out!
We're falling!
We're going to crash!
Do something, Roy!
Quick!
Quick!
Quick!
[Crying] It's all right, Monte.
Monte?
[Gasps]
It's all right.
Monte?
Monte.
Oh.
[Crying]
Well?
[Crying]
You heard what my brother said.
Your brother?
I'll never tell you anything.
[German]
[German]
Achtung!
[German]
[German]
[Officer Shouts Orders In German]
[Roy] I'll be with you in just a minute, Monte.
[Officer In German]
[Guns Cocking]
[Gunfire]
[Explosions In Distance]
Come on, you Seventh Brigade.
We got 'em now.
Ah!
Ja!
Wunderbar!
Look at that, Karl.
Well, Roy, you seem to like my country.
Like it?
I think it's marvellous.
Say, I wish we were staying here two years instead of just two weeks.
But you know, Karl, it does sound funny hearing you call it "your country. "
I keep forgetting you're not English.
Oh, sometimes I...
Well, I feel almost English myself.
Well, that's natural.
After all, you can't be at Oxford three years... without feeling slightly British.
I wish Helen were here.
After all you've said about her, I don't blame you.
Your brother is not coming today, Herr Rutledge?
Oh, yes, he'll be along soon, Gretchen.
Nothing can keep Monte away from this good beer.
Nothing except a good-looking woman.
Jawohl.
That brother of yours, he's a naughty boy, but I like him.
He has a way with them, hey, Gretchen?
You, you don't know half of it.
Another conquest for Monte.
Yes.
I don't know why he wants to mess about with every woman he meets.
Yeah, but you have Helen.
I'm not at all sure.
I'm not half good enough for her.
She must be a wonderful girl.
Oh, she is.
She's marvellous.
You'll have to meet her when we get back to Oxford.
- I'd like to.
- Would you like to see what she looks like?
Yes.
I didn't know you had a photograph of her.
Yeah, and neither does Helen.
I took it myself when she wasn't looking.
Really?
Oh.
Stunning, isn't she?
Why, she's marvellous.
Cheerio, you blighters.
Hello, it's Monte.
Meet the countess.
Step up, gents, to the one and only...
Now, Monte, don't, please.
Oh, it's all right.
This little pretzel doesn't understand a word of English.
No?
Gretchen!
Ja!
Found her at the museum.
Yeah, she's a work of art, all right.
You should have left her there.
Shh!
Quiet!
I say, Monte, why do you bring around this sort?
Bring her?
Good heavens, I can't get rid of her.
Go home, will you?
Go home.
You see, I'm stuck.
Hello.
Who's the dowager?
That's Helen.
Oh.
But, of course, that's only a snapshot.
Wait till you meet her.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Go away!
I say.
This is getting serious.
I've got to get rid of her.
Oh, you know, I have a very important engagement in just 15 minutes.
I say, you chaps, be... be sporting and take her off my hands.
But after all, Monte...
We may be sporting, but we're not feeble-minded.
Well, you can do what you please with her.
I'm going.
Hey, listen, Monte...
Auf Wiedersehen.
Here, just a minute now.
Please.
Leave her to me.
I'll get rid of her.
Please.
Yes.
Ja.
Nein.
Nein.
Nein.
Nein.
Roy!
No!
Roy!
No, carry on.
Carry on.
Pretty boy, you please me very much.
What's that?
It is nothing.
I am not at home to anyone except my husband.
And he is away on army business.
He will not be home for hours.
So, you see...
Charming.
But really, I-I say you mustn't think that...
Your name?
My name is, uh, Rutledge, sir.
You are stopping in Munich?
At the Hotel Bayrischer Hof, sir.
My seconds will call on you later.
But I say you...
There is nothing further to discuss.
Sailing, sailing over the bounding main
Where many a wintry wind shall blow 'ere Jack comes home again
Hello.
Where you going?
Sailing, sailing England.
England?
Why, we're not going back for 10 days.
What's wrong?
Baron Von Kranz.
Who's he?
Oh, he's just a friend of mine.
Really?
Quite a social success, aren't you?
How do you meet these barons?
Well, unfortunately, I met this one through his wife.
And this means...
A duel.
Can you imagine it?
Running away?
Oh, don't be an ass.
Roy.
You don't expect me to go through with a farce like this.
It's the only thing you can do.
Oh, there you go again.
I suppose when a woman's no good and her husband finds it out,
I've got to get shot, just because it's the honourable thing to do.
Well, what do you think people will say?
You'll never live it down.
What do I care what people say?
Well, you can talk all you like, Monte, but you can't walk out like this.
Can't I?
Good-bye.
See you at Oxford.
Hello, Roy.
Hello, Karl.
Well, what's up?
Where's Monte?
He's gone to England.
England?
Well, what's the matter?
Oh, nothing.
But I say...
Herr Rutledge?
Herr Rutledge?
Yes?
Von Richter.
Von Schlieben.
We represent Colonel Baron Von Kranz.
Yes.
Have you chosen your second?
According to custom, we have selected the time and place.
You have the choice of weapons.
What is your choice?
What is this?
Golden Ave.
Why, that's a famous duelling place near here.
It says at 4:00 tomorrow morning.
4:00 in the morning.
Well, how did this happen?
I
- I'm sorry, Karl.
I
- I lost my temper with one of your officers.
But, Roy...
Say, Karl, do you know how to be a second?
Wait here, Roy.
Bitte.
Good luck, Roy.
Did you ever see a lassie a lassie, a lassie
Did you ever see a lassie go this way and that
Hey, will you cut it out?
Hey, did anybody see my green socks?
Check in the garbage.
Hello there, Roy.
Hello, Elliot.
Glad to see you.
I'm certainly glad to see you back.
Thank you.
And where's your German accent?
Well, I couldn't get it past the Custom officials.
Oh, I say, what have you done to your arm?
Oh, nothing.
It's just a little scratch.
I was hunting in Germany.
I'll see you at dinner?
Righto.
Good.
See you later.
Why aren't you getting dressed?
Aren't you coming to meet Helen?
Oh, yes, but don't remind me of it.
Don't be foolish.
She expects us for tea.
Tea?
Listen, it'll do you good to meet a nice girl.
Oh, well, all right, but first we've gotta get you dressed.
Say, we've gotta get him dressed.
He's going to see his girl.
Now, now, wait a minute, now.
Listen, I've gotta have my shirt!
Wait a minute.
I...
Listen, I'm old enough to dress myself!
No, you're not.
Will you cut it out?
Say, listen, will you pl...
Will you...
Hey, my green socks!
Is Helen in?
Miss Helen is not at home, sir.
She's expecting us.
Would you care to wait?
Yes, thank you.
Fine reception.
Oh.
Roy, maybe she's forgotten.
Not Helen.
She's not that sort.
Oh.
Roy, I feel sick.
I
- I think I'd better go.
- Monte, will you sit down?
- Oh, I've got an awful headache.
I think I'll go to the chemist and get something for it.
Monte.
- Roy!
- Helen!
Oh, terribly sorry.
Mother's fault.
Shopping.
I simply flew My, isn't it hot?
You shouldn't have hurried so.
Oh, but I wanted to.
Roy, you've no right to look so cool.
I'm broiling.
Feel.
Yes, you are, aren't you?
No, not one.
Well, you're so marvellous, I
- I hardly dare.
Oh, silly.
Well, that's better.
Cigarette, Roy?
I thought your brother was coming.
Went out with a headache.
Poor boy.
It must be the heat.
Extra, extra!
All about the war!
Well, they've done it.
I never thought they would.
I still can't believe it.
Well, it must be true.
It's official.
Oh, shut up.
I'm trying to think.
It's terrible.
Karl, you won't have to go, will you?
Me?
Oh, Roy, I hope not.
Oh, they can't want me.
I'm not a soldier.
What use would I be to them?
I couldn't... kill anyone.
They couldn't make me do that, could they, Roy?
Oh, I think it'll all be over in a couple of weeks.
I'm not so sure.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Then suppose England comes in.
Why, Roy, that'd be horrible.
I never could do that.
Why, I love England.
Oh, will you shut up?
Monte, Germany's declared war on France.
Hmm?
Oh.
Oh, Roy, how do you spell "ecstatic"?
Hmm?
Special delivery letter for Karl Arnstedt.
What's the matter, Karl?
Someone ill?
Karl.
May I ask the Prime Minister if he has any information he can give us today.
Our ambassador at Berlin received his passport at 7:00 last evening.
And since 11:00 last night, a state of war has existed between Germany and ourselves.
Seven?
What size?
A seven and a half if you please.
I
- I'm afraid it's a bit small, sir.
Move along, there.
Move along.
You'll grow into it.
Present arms!
Come on there.
Come on.
Present arms!
Give it to him, you bloody fool.
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Sleeping sickness?
Here, here.
Let go of that gun, you clinging vine.
Let go, do you hear?
God, you're enough to turn a man's stomach.
Hey, you with the fallen arches...
I've enlisted, Monte, in the Royal Flying Corps.
You're a fool, Roy.
Really?
How lovely.
My grandfather was in the guard during the Revolution.
Oh, he was?
Oh, Roy, you look marvellous in uniform.
Thank you.
Doesn't he?
It's ripping.
Where?
Tell me, what have you joined?
The infantry?
No, the Royal Flying Corps.
Oh, of course.
And all the misery in this world has been caused... by and for capitalism!
Why should we fight this war?
For capitalism?
You will die!
You will die!
All your sons will die for capitalism!
Down with capitalism!
Down with war!
Down with the anarchists.
That's right.
Get back now.
Who do you think you're shoving?
There's the man I'd like to kiss.
What's the matter?
Afraid of a kiss?
Maybe he's yeller!
Go on, you.
Go on and fight for your country.
Slacker!
Come on.
But really, you don't understand.
I didn't mean to do anything.
Say, I'd rather marry the girl.
You'll never get your wings that way.
Hi.
How are you?
Oh, boy.
Say, listen, that first solo flight certainly is a great thrill.
It certainly felt great.
I will.
Wonder who that is out there.
That was a fine landing.
Look at him come out of there.
Look, boys, it's Monte.
Hey, how'd it go, Monte?
Oh, great.
Well, tonight's the night, Monte.
Yeah.
Say, listen, be more cheerful.
You have a treat in store meeting Helen.
Must be Friday the 13th.
Gee, I-I wonder if she'll wear her canteen uniform.
If she does, you can count me out.
Oh, she looks stunning in it.
Who wants to be stunned?
I'm only going as a favour to you.
You and I don't like the same kind of girls.
Hurry up, will you?
Oh, it's a waste of time to polish these.
She'll probably step all over them the first dance anyway.
Safer to sit it out.
Quiet little corner and a have a chat about votes for women.
Hello there.
Hello.
Whose window are you warbling under tonight?
Lady Randolph's Charity Ball.
Wash your neck and come along.
Oh, but I haven't been invited.
That's all right.
I'm on the committee.
No, I don't think I'll go.
A smart boy.
I wonder where Helen is.
She should be here by this time.
How do you do, sir?
There's she is.
Don't point.
It's rude.
Oh, Helen.
Roy!
Hello.
Hello, old thing.
You're frightfully late.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
Oh, Helen, this is Monte.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Well, that's done at last.
You know, you two have been avoiding each other for weeks.
Helen, may I have this next dance?
What?
Oh, of course.
Oh, Roy, there you are.
Good evening, Lady Randolph.
I must say, you take your duties on my committee very lightly.
I'm sorry.
Where have you been?
You've completely disarranged my program.
There are no end of things to be done.
Helen dear, you don't mind, do you?
Come along, Roy.
Come at once.
I'm sorry, Helen.
Uh, Monte, would you take this next dance with Helen?
Oh, how do you do, Monte?
How do you do?
Now come along.
Well?
Ahem.
Oh.
Hello, Roy.
I
- I really must go and find, uh, Jimmy Kerrigan.
He has something most important to tell me.
I...
Who is this Jimmy Kerrigan?
Kerrigan?
I've never heard of him.
Oh.
What are you thinking of?
If you must know, I was thinking of Monte.
Do you like him?
Yes, I like him.
He's a marvellous dancer.
Well, Monte does all those things well.
Helen.
What?
May I?
Oh, Monte.
Oh, hello there.
Come sit down.
You having a better time than you expected, Monte?
Marvellous.
Been dancing with a beautiful brunette, name of Eleanor.
She's perfect.
Oh, Eleanor Madden.
You don't really think she's beautiful?
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty?
Stop it.
I'm not a cat.
Yes, you are.
Well, if I'm a kitty, I'm a thirsty kitty.
Roy dear, will you please get me a glass of punch?
Why, of course I will.
No, I'll go, Roy.
No, I'm the committee.
You stay here and look after this wallflower.
But really, I...
Oh, if you'd rather not...
Well, I-I didn't mean...
Don't you like wallflowers?
I shouldn't have done that.
Oh, you're not sorry, Monte.
Awfully sorry.
I had no right to.
What if I'm glad?
But what about Roy?
Isn't that my business?
I suppose so, but...
Hush.
Compliments of the committee.
Thanks awfully, Roy.
Well, has he been properly charming?
Me?
More than charming.
Good for you, Monte.
Taste?
She loves me.
She blisters you.
It's worth it.
Is she worth it?
Depends on who she is.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Well, thank goodness Lady Randolph's lost sight of me for a minute.
Roy, you've been neglecting me shamefully.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
You see, it's this beastly committee.
Lady Randolph won't let me alone a minute.
Oh, Roy, there you are.
Yes, here I am.
Do you mind?
Where is that list?
Would you mind finding Sir John for me?
It's about my Canteen Unit.
I must have the queen's signature.
It's so important.
My dear, why don't you get into your uniform?
You look so pretty in it.
And, Monte, shouldn't you dance with Mary Blunt?
Yes, why don't you?
And, Roy.
Roy, will you find Sir John?
I want you to lead the grand dance for me.
And really, there are so many things you've got to do.
Yes.
L-I'm terribly sorry.
Uh, back soon.
You see, those girls have been looking for you.
But, Lady Randolph, I'm supposed to...
So, you've really joined Lady Lizzie's Canteen Unit?
Rather.
Chance of a lifetime.
We go to France in two weeks.
Two weeks?
Well, Roy says you're sailing the 15th.
Is that so?
Bored?
Tired.
Take me home, Monte.
Home?
It's not far.
I've taken a flat in town near Canteen Headquarters.
But, I mean, Roy will be quite upset to find you gone.
That's what he gets for being on committee.
But, really...
Very well.
I'll find someone else.
Oh, I didn't mean to be rude.
Well, come on then.
Are we here?
Well, it's number 27.
Wanna come up for a cigarette and a drink?
Oh, really, you must be awfully tired.
No, I'm not.
Come see my room.
I've only had a place of my own for a week.
It's a new toy.
What a baby you are.
Alley-oop.
All right.
Well, this is jolly.
Sit down and I'll get you a drink.
Thanks.
Say when.
Whoa.
When!
When!
Would you be shocked if I put on something more comfortable?
I'll try to survive.
Well, are you more comfortable now?
Yes, are you?
Oh, yes.
You know, it seems strange being here like this after hearing Roy rave about you for months.
Does Roy rave?
Oh, rather.
He idolizes you.
Oh, I do wish he wouldn't.
It makes me feel guilty.
I can understand his raving now.
Oh, don't be silly.
You're not a bit like Roy, are you?
I should say not.
Roy's frightfully high-minded.
He doesn't approve of me.
He wouldn't approve of me either if he knew what I'm really like.
Doesn't he know?
No.
When I'm with Roy, I'm the way Roy wants me to be.
That's caddish, isn't it?
But I can't help it.
I understand.
Roy wouldn't.
May I ask you a very personal question?
Yes.
Do you love Roy?
No, not really.
Not the way Roy wants me to love him.
I can't.
Roy's love means marriage and children... and never anyone but Roy.
I couldn't bear that.
I wanna be free.
I wanna be gay and have fun.
Life's short, and I wanna live while I'm alive.
I know, that...
that's the way I feel too.
I...
I think I'd better go.
Must you?
I really should.
Pull.
Cold in here now, isn't it?
Have you a match?
Why so gloomy?
God, I'm rotten.
I can't see it.
Can't you?
Well, then you're rotten too.
What do you mean?
And Roy worships you.
You!
Well?
Don't you make yourself sick...
you and Roy.
God, that's funny.
Get out of here!
Don't worry.
I can't get out fast enough.
Get out!
And stay out!
Where have you been?
Oh, I, uh...
I stopped at a... at a bar after I took Helen home.
Oh.
How'd you like her?
Oh, she's all right.
Pass in a crowd, eh?
I daresay she would.
Just what do you mean by that?
Listen, Roy, let me tell you something.
Even if it hurts.
Yes?
I wouldn't be so idealistic about Helen if I were you.
And why not?
Well, I...
I just wouldn't, that's all.
Well, why not?
Oh, I don't know.
Forget it.
Never mind crawling.
Out with it.
Listen, Roy, I tell you.
Women are all the same.
You look at every woman as a barmaid.
You don't know anything about decent women.
Oh, all right.
You know it all then.
Oh, you've said enough.
Shut up.
Karl.
Karl!
Zep overhead!
- South by east.
- Righto!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Right.
All lights out, sir.
Lights out, quick!
Zeppelin overhead!
Zeppelin overhead!
Everybody out!
Hey, come on, Monte.
Zeppelin overhead.
Come on, Monte.
What's the matter with you?
Get up.
We don't all have to go.
I'm tired.
Oh, shut up.
- Come on.
Let's go.
Hurry up.
Come on.
- Be right with you, Elliot.
Come on, Monte.
Get up.
Come on.
Let's go.
Hurry.
All right.
Karl...
Karl.
Danke.
Well, so long there, Tommy.
All right, old chap.
Good luck, Elliot.
Go get 'em, Monte.
Good-bye.
Good luck, Roy.
Right.
Perfect.
Look, Roy, there she goes.
Let's go.
Kapitän?
Kapitän.
Kapitän!
Kapitän!
Kapitän!
Jawohl!
Hey, Roy, they've hit our motor.
Cut the gas.
We'll burn to death!
Roy!
Oh, shut up!
Well, this is a mess, all right.
Yeah, just our luck.
Lucky we weren't both killed.
Well, we're through.
Herr Kapitän.
Look at it, Monte.
Roy, it's falling!
Look at that, Roy.
Great, isn't it?
They're done for.
Look out!
Run!
Just a minute.
Why the blazes don't you look where you're going, sir?
I'm sorry, sir.
Isn't it customary to salute one's superior officer?
Thank you.
What is your name, sir?
Lieutenant Roy Rutledge.
Make a note of that.
Yes, sir.
Would you like to try it and find out?
They are.
They glisten in the sun.
What the hell you trying to do?
It took me three hours to write that.
You're nothing but a pest anyhow.
Sit down.
Oh, don't, Bruce.
You shouldn't smoke so many.
What difference does it make?
You know it's bad for you.
Buy a chocolate, miss.
Change, miss.
Please.
That's a good boy.
What a life it would be married to you.
Oh, you don't fancy it?
Beastly.
No smokes.
Think of all the money we'd save.
What would we spend it on?
Oh, a diamond dog collar.
For me?
No.
I'd buy a muzzle for you.
You wouldn't spoil my beautiful moustache, would you?
No.
We'd keep that in the parlour under glass.
Hello, Helen.
Oh, hello, Roy.
Roy, I'd like you to meet Captain Redfield.
Lieutenant Rutledge.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Beastly weather.
Yes, isn't it.
- You'll get used to it.
- Thanks.
Gee, it's great to see you again, Helen.
It's been four whole days.
Really?
- Have you been over long?
- Three weeks.
Oh.
Three weeks.
Everything all right up your way?
Oh, yes.
Your squadron near here?
Twenty miles up the line.
Twenty miles.
That far.
- You chaps have it rather soft, haven't you?
- Do you think so?
Well, I mean to say being able to dash about the countryside and all that.
Wish I'd picked the R.F.C.
Well, why didn't you?
Roy.
Well, I must be going.
Oh.
Don't go.
I think I'd better.
Good-bye, Helen, and don't forget your promise.
I won't.
Who's that bag of wind?
Would you mind not talking about my friends like that?
Oh, now, Helen, please.
Oh, you were perfectly beastly to him.
I'm terribly sorry.
Guess my nerves are a bit raw.
Things haven't been so easy this last week.
Oh, you've been fighting?
Did you shoot down any Boche?
Yes.
I managed to get a couple.
Really?
How thrilling.
Tell me about it.
Well, there's really nothing much to tell.
Three bars of chocolate, miss.
Oh, Jymes.
Oh, Jymes.
Bread, Jymes.
We want bread.
We want bread!
Coming, sir.
Coming!
Did you ever try hurrying, Jymes?
Sorry, sir, but I stopped to dig a few of the cockroaches out of it, sir.
Well, put it down.
Well, where's the bread?
Did you ever try hurrying, sir?
Jymes, more bread.
Drown the cockroaches this time.
Yes, sir.
Jymes, what's the taste in this soup?
I can't say, sir.
It's not soup, it's soap.
I think it's shoe polish.
Sorry, sir.
Cook said the soup was a bit weak tonight.
Maybe you taste the disinfectant in the water, sir.
Oh.
Well, strike me blind, it's a hair.
Wash it off and wear it, Baldy.
Hello, you chaps.
Hello, Monte.
How goes it?
Still no news of Harry?
No.
Somebody always gets it on the night patrol.
What do you think, Marryat?
You saw it happen.
Is there any chance he got down alive?
No, I don't think so.
The searchlights got him.
We were flying low and they heard us.
We started to climb, but it was too late.
Shrapnel began bursting all around him.
Two bursts caught him and he started to drop.
It was awful to see him down there, twisting and diving... crippled, always dropping.
Trying every way to get clear of those lights.
Then another burst got him.
We could hear him screaming...
Stop!
I can't stand it.
Good thing he took your place, Rutledge.
You might've got it instead of him.
Oh, I'll get it sooner or later.
We'll all get it.
Isn't there any end to this?
Oh, shut up.
You're always whining.
Shut up yourself.
Who'll make me?
I'll make you.
Sit down, Jack, and be quiet.
All right.
What's the matter with you fellas?
Would anybody like to take Monte's place on tonight's patrol?
Lay off.
No more soup.
We need some.
No more soup.
We need some soup.
Jymes!
Hurry it up.
Splendid.
Splendid, Jymes.
Splendid.
That's what comes from hurrying.
What was dinner before you dropped it, Jymes?
A tasty bit of salmon, sir.
Sewer trout again?
Hasn't the cook anything else?
Well, sir, there's that tin of pork and beans.
No, we don't want that.
Can he do anything with the garbage?
Oh, well, never mind.
We aren't hungry, are we?
Coffee, Jymes.
Yes, sir.
And, Jymes.
Yes, sir?
Don't let anything hurry you.
No, sir.
Drinking again?
You dirty louse!
Hey, Baldy.
The sooner you get shot down, the better.
Baldy, darling.
Now that didn't hurt, Baldy.
Monte!
What's the matter with you?
Attention.
As you were.
The following officers will report for night patrol.
Drayton.
Yes, sir.
Fuller.
Here, sir.
Maloney.
Oh, no.
Not an old bald-headed man like me up there in the cold, cold air.
Perhaps Fritz will warm it up for you.
Neville.
Here, sir.
Monte Rutledge.
Monte Rutledge.
I don't feel very well tonight, sir.
That's all right, boy.
None of us feel well.
But you don't understand.
I think I do, Rutledge.
But I say, sir.
You don't understand.
Th-There seems to be something the matter with me.
I know what's the matter with him.
He's yellow.
Oh, shut up.
Oh, let's say it.
Didn't Harry go west last night because he took this man's place?
Keep quiet, Jack.
I will not keep quiet.
He's yellow and we all know it.
That's a lie!
I'm not yellow.
I can see things as they are, that's all.
I'm sick of this rotten business.
You fools.
Why do you let them kill you like this?
What are you fighting for?
Patriotism.
Duty.
Are you mad?
Can't you see they're just words?
Words coined by politicians and profiteers to trick you into fighting for them.
What's a word compared with life...
the only life you've got.
I'll give 'em a word.
Murder!
That's what this dirty rotten politician's war is.
Murder!
You know it as well as I do.
Yellow, am I?
You're the ones that are yellow.
I've got guts to say what I think.
You're afraid to say it.
So afraid to be called yellow, you'd rather be killed first.
You fools!
You poor, stupid fools.
Oh, Monte.
Now, pull yourself together, will ya?
Stand up, Rutledge!
I've taken a lot of shirking from you since we came out here, but this is a bit too much.
Sir, he really is ill.
You're a disgrace to your squadron.
Go to your quarters.
Yes, sir.
Have a cigarette.
You don't think I'm yellow, do you, Roy?
Why, of course not.
You're just more sensitive than the rest of us.
I wonder.
Well, stop thinking about it.
I wish I could.
Haven't I been up twice on the night patrol?
I'm trying to do my share.
Of course you are now.
You...
You must be pretty well fed up with me after all this.
Oh, that's rot.
I
- I'm not yellow.
I'm not!
Oh, now, Monte.
Come on.
Pull yourself together.
Staff Colonel.
Everybody out.
Come on, Monte.
Stand easy.
Well, men, I don't like what I have to say, but let's face it, you all know the central munitions dump at Spraug.
You've tried three times to bomb that depot without success.
No fault of yours, of course, they've guarded it too closely.
That munitions depot at Spraug must be destroyed tomorrow morning.
Now, then, today a German bombing plane was forced down within our lines.
We were lucky enough to capture it before they had a chance to destroy it.
We've fixed it up so it'll fly.
We want to use this plane to bomb the Spraug depot.
There's no question that the venture will succeed this time.
The enemy won't suspect one of their own planes until after the depot is bombed.
Then when they discover the trick, well, you you may have a little difficulty in getting back.
I need two men to fly this plane.
I'll go, sir.
Are you sure you wanna go?
Quite sure, sir.
Very well.
I'll go with him, sir.
Who are these men?
Lieutenants Monte and Roy Rutledge, sir.
Brothers, eh?
Dismissed.
Now, young men,
I want you to realize how important this is.
The Seventh Brigade has been ordered to go over the top in a surprise attack tomorrow evening at dusk.
The brigade doesn't know it, but I
- I'm afraid they're going to be slaughtered.
There's too much artillery in front of us.
If you destroy that munitions depot early tomorrow morning, it will weaken the enemy artillery, and we may be able to get through.
Hundreds of lives depend on you.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Now, another thing.
The plane you are to fly... is far too dangerous a piece of armament to let the enemy recapture it.
It must return or be destroyed.
If you were captured, you'd be shot as spies anyway.
Baldy.
Oh, Baldy?
You'll take the morning patrol in towards Spraug as far as you can.
You might possibly help them get back.
By all means.
Yes, sir.
You'll get your maps and final instructions just before taking off.
Report to the field at 3:00 a. m.
Until then, let them do as they please.
- Yes, sir. 3:00, you two.
- Yes, sir.
Good luck.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
- What time is it, Monte?
- Ten past 9:00.
Helen's canteen closes at 10:00.
We've just enough time to get there.
- Do you think they'll let us have the motorcycle?
- Why, of course.
We're "it" tonight.
Yeah.
We're "it" all right.
Not sorry, are you?
Oh, let's not talk about it.
I'm not even gonna think about it until 3:00.
What's your program?
Wine, women and song?
Oh, perhaps I'll do without the song tonight.
- See you at Grosson's?
- Either there or at Jacques across the street.
- Wherever you hear the most noise.
- Don't you wanna come in with me to see Helen?
Oh, I better not.
Righto.
Where's Helen?
She's gone out.
Oh.
Was she expecting you?
No.
Would you care to leave a note?
Yes, I think I will.
Pen and ink on the table.
You'll see that she gets this?
Oh, yes.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
Hello.
What's up?
She isn't in.
That's tough.
Wanna come along with me?
Where to?
Grosson's.
Righto.
Your switch on?
Will you close it a little?
- Helen.
- Well, if it isn't old Roy.
Old solemn Roy himself.
Sit down, Roy.
Sit on the floor and hang your legs over.
- Take your hands off her.
- Oh, I can't take my hands off.
You heard what I said.
Take your hands off her.
Who asked you to this party anyway?
Helen, let me take you home.
Home?
Who wants to go home?
I'm having a marvellous time.
I was until you came in.
I advise you to get out before you're kicked out.
Keep your...
Keep your filthy hands off of my girl.
Your girl.
You fool.
I wouldn't belong to you if you were the last man on Earth.
You're nothing to me.
Nothing.
Come on, Roy.
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
Oh, let's have it out.
I don't love you.
I never have.
I never had any fun with you anyway.
You and your high ideals.
You're too good to live.
You're just a stupid prig if you ask me.
You make me sick, do you hear?
Sick.
Now, get out here.
I hate the sight of you!
Come on, Roy.
Let's go across the street.
Sweet, sweet baby.
Handsome, big, strong baby.
N'est-ce pas?
Mmm, n'est-ce pas, kiss Papa, huh?
Oh, baby.
Hello, Chèri.
Aw, don't take it so hard, Roy.
Forget it.
Is your friend sick?
No.
He'll be all right.
Drink up, Roy.
I still can't believe it.
You just don't know anything about women.
They're all the same.
I've been telling you that for years.
Maybe you'll believe me now.
- Oh, Helen's not that sort.
- Oh, nonsense.
- It's the war.
She's changed.
- You're wrong, Roy.
War doesn't change people.
It's...
It's like getting drunk.
It brings out what people really are.
You can't make me believe Helen was like that before.
Well, she was.
I've known it all along.
You too?
Oh, I'm sorry, Roy.
Don't take it so hard.
She isn't worth it.
- I suppose you're right.
- Of course I'm right.
Listen, Roy, never love a woman.
Just make love to her.
You see, like this.
Look.
Go ahead, Roy.
Try it.
That's the way.
Oh!
What you do, baby?
All wet!
No, no, no, no!
Imbecile!
Aw, baby.
Voilà.
Hey, listen, Monte.
Monte.
Go easy.
We gotta go up at 3:00.
Oh, listen, Roy.
To hell with this 3:00 business.
What do you mean?
Just that.
To hell with it.
Say, you're crazy, Monte.
We can't get out of it now.
Oh, why can't we?
Listen, Roy, all this idealistic stuff won't get you anywhere.
You tried it on Helen and what happened?
You got a kick in the face.
You can't go through life thinking the way you do.
People take advantage of you and make a fool of you the way she did.
- It's beginning to look as though you're right.
- Of course I'm right.
I was right about Helen, and now I'm right about this 3:00 business too.
This is another thing entirely, Monte.
Why is it?
They're just taking advantage of you in another way, that's all.
It's chaps like you that are meat for them.
All they gotta do is make it sound heroic, and you fall for it.
Listen, Roy, what's the difference if we don't go?
- But we can't get out of it now.
- Why can't we?
Listen, tell 'em...
tell 'em the motorcycle broke down.
Tell 'em anything.
What do you say, Roy?
Well...
Come on, old ooh-la-la.
Oh, no, no, no, Chèri.
Oh, baby.
N'est-ce pas?
Oh, oui, oui, madam.
Oh, baby.
Oh, stop looking at your watch, Roy.
You're not going anywhere.
Yes, I am and so are you.
Who says I am?
Listen, Monte, we're a little drunk and we've been talking wildly.
There's no way out of this and we know it.
Come on, Monte.
No, no.
Let me alone.
Come on, old ooh-la-la.
Monte.
Why, they'd court-martial us in a minute if we didn't show up.
Why, that's desertion, Monte.
They shoot people for that.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
Come on.
I suppose you're right.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Monte.
What a pair of fools we are.
Let's go.
Easy, now.
Easy.
Look out for the firing pin.
Righto.
I got it.
Contactor.
Contact.
Ground speed here.
Keep this site trained on the target.
Then pull the release when you hit the stop.
Do you understand?
Don't forget the leveller.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Contactor.
Contact.
Remember this ship weighs 20,000 pounds.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Roy, the depot.
Roy, look there!
They've seen us.
They're coming on.
For Christ's sake.
Hey, Roy, look.
They hit our right motor.
I got him!
Roy!
Look over there.
It's our squadrons.
They're coming!
Roy, they've gone.
Jesus.
Son of a Boche.
Hey!
It's me!
Hey!
It's me!
Goddamn it!
It's old Baldy.
Hey!
Baldy.
Hello.
It's Baldy.
Look, Roy.
It's Baldy.
You see that guy?
Good old Baldy.
Good boy.
See that?
He's got him.
Hey, look.
He's got him.
He's got him.
Oh.
Look.
They've changed around.
Our strut's gone.
That son of a bitch.
Roy, he got us!
Roy!
Go down!
Go down!
Go down!
One more for Baldy!
No more control?
Pull her up!
Oh, my God!
We're on fire!
We're burning!
Roy, get down!
Do something!
Roy!
Ah, so.
We meet again.
It was you who bombed the depot at Spraug, nicht wahr?
Yes.
And you were flying a German plane, nicht wahr?
- Yes.
- Very clever.
It is a pity you must take your congratulations from me.
There are a few questions I must ask you.
If you answer them simply, it will be easy for you.
To what squadron of the Royal Flying Corps are you attached?
Just why were you sent to bomb that munitions depot this morning?
It was our natural target.
But possibly it was to clear the way for a little surprise attack, huh?
You are surprised.
We know all about it, so you need not be afraid to talk.
Now, please, when and where is the attack to be made?
Oh, you are stupid not to tell.
It is nothing.
For you the war is over, nicht wahr?
We are friends.
Hmm.
Listen, if you tell me,
I will see that you are sent to a special camp reserved only for certain prisoners of war.
It's near Munich.
Far away from all this.
You will have every comfort.
And in a few months from now when the war is over, you will be alive and in good health, which is more than most of us will be able to say.
So, you see?
It can be easy for you.
Now, please.
So, you will not tell?
Possibly you do not know that flying a German plane... is the same as wearing a German uniform.
Any disguised soldier is a spy, nicht wahr?
And you know what happens to spies?
I think you two friends had better talk it over.
I will give you 15 minutes.
If you change your mind and tell, good.
If not, you will be shot.
Do you think he was bluffing?
No, he wasn't bluffing.
He's the man I was to fight that duel with.
Really?
Quite a coincidence.
He's got it in for me.
Nah, he's probably forgotten it by this time.
The brigade will be going over pretty soon, Monte.
Yes.
Roy, look.
Oh, save it to wipe your nose on.
God, what nerve.
Roy.
Roy, I can't face it.
I'm going to tell.
Don't be a fool, Monte.
Do you realize what it would mean if we told?
It would mean being alive when this bloody war's over.
But, Monte, you can't.
To hell with your heroic stuff.
I wanna live.
I'm not gonna be shot down like that.
I'm going to tell.
Wait a minute.
Monte.
But I...
Listen.
Let me go.
You?
Yes.
You're all upset.
I'll bargain with him, and perhaps I won't have to tell him everything.
I
- I'll come with you.
No.
You said he's got it in for you.
Now, let me do it alone.
All right.
Tell the general I'm ready to talk.
Good.
Come.
Ah, yes.
So, you have changed your mind?
Yes.
My friend will never tell, but I wanna live.
I'm ready to talk.
You are very wise.
Now, please, draw a rough map for me showing your positions, brigade numbers, disposition, hour of attack, purpose, number of men.
Wait a minute.
I'll tell only on one condition.
Ah, so, a condition.
Yes.
If I give this information, my friend will know it.
Back home after the war, he'll tell everyone that I was a traitor.
You leave that to me.
Why not let me have that satisfaction?
What do you mean?
I do not understand.
One does not kill a friend.
Friend.
He's not my friend.
He stole the girl I love and I hate him.
Huh.
History repeats itself.
You make rather hard terms.
I'll tell only on that condition.
One bullet.
What if I miss?
Give me two to make sure.
No.
A good soldier will need only one.
Very well.
Not so fast.
He will give you the bullet outside.
Well?
I didn't tell, Monte.
Why?
What happened?
Has he changed his mind?
No.
Don't you think you can go through with it now?
What do you mean?
Of course we can.
It won't even hurt.
It'll all be over in a second.
We can stand anything for a second.
No, no, Roy.
L-I can't do it.
I'm going to tell.
Listen, Monte.
We tell, the whole brigade will be wiped out.
Three thousand men, and they all want to live too.
You wouldn't spoil their chances, would you?
That's not my business.
I didn't start this war.
I didn't get them into this mess.
Let 'em take care of themselves.
They'll get wiped out sooner or later anyway.
I wanna live.
Live!
You won't tell, I'll tell.
Listen, Monte!
I'll tell!
I'll tell!
Let me out!
I'll tell everything I know.
The brigade is moving up.
They're going to attack...
Oh.
Roy.
Oh, Monte.
Monte.
Monte.
Monte.
Don't cry, Roy.
It was the only thing you could do.
The brigade, Roy.
Yes, Monte?
They'll be all right now, won't they?
Yes.
Who's that?
It's the general.
You...
You thought we'd tell, didn't you?
Good old Roy.
You won't tell, and I... forgotten... it all.
Oh, Roy.
Roy.
Yes?
Where are you?
Don't go away, Roy.
I'm here, Monte.
Can't you feel me holding you?
Hello, Karl.
Fig eights.
Cold up here in the night patrol.
Awful to be in the dark.
Oh.
I'm afraid.
Look out.
Look out!
We're falling!
We're going to crash!
Do something, Roy!
Quick!
Quick!
Quick!
It's all right, Monte.
Monte?
It's all right.
Monte?
Monte.
Oh.
Well?
You heard what my brother said.
Your brother?
I'll never tell you anything.
Achtung!
I'll be with you in just a minute, Monte.
Come on, you Seventh Brigade.
We got 'em now.
We are good.
Ah!
Ja!
Wunderbar!
Look at that, Karl.
Well, Roy, you seem to like my country.
Like it?
I think it's marvelous.
Say, I wish we were staying here two years instead of just two weeks.
But you know, Karl, it does sound funny hearing you call it "your country. "
I keep forgetting you're not English.
Oh, sometimes I...
Well, I feel almost English myself.
Well, that's natural.
After all, you can't be at Oxford three years... without feeling slightly British.
I wish Helen were here.
After all you've said about her, I don't blame you.
Your brother is not coming today, Herr Rutledge?
Oh, yes, he'll be along soon, Gretchen.
Nothing can keep Monte away from this good beer.
Nothing except a good-looking woman.
Jawohl.
That brother of yours, he's a naughty boy, but I like him.
He has a way with them, hey, Gretchen?
You, you don't know half of it.
Another conquest for Monte.
Yes.
I don't know why he wants to mess about with every woman he meets.
Yeah, but you have Helen.
I'm not at all sure.
I'm not half good enough for her.
She must be a wonderful girl.
Oh, she is.
She's marvelous.
You'll have to meet her when we get back to Oxford.
- I'd like to.
- Would you like to see what she looks like?
Yes.
I didn't know you had a photograph of her.
Yeah, and neither does Helen.
I took it myself when she wasn't looking.
Really?
Oh.
Stunning, isn't she?
Why, she's marvelous.
Cheerio, you blighters.
Hello, it's Monte.
Meet the countess.
Step up, gents, to the one and only...
Now, Monte, don't, please.
Oh, it's all right.
This little pretzel doesn't understand a word of English.
No?
Gretchen!
Ja!
Found her at the museum.
Yeah, she's a work of art, all right.
You should have left her there.
Shh!
Quiet!
I say, Monte, why do you bring around this sort?
Bring her?
Good heavens, I can't get rid of her.
Go home, will you?
Go home.
You see, I'm stuck.
Hello.
Who's the dowager?
That's Helen.
Oh.
But, of course, that's only a snapshot.
Wait till you meet her.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Go away!
I say.
This is getting serious.
I've got to get rid of her.
Oh, you know, I have a very important engagement in just 15 minutes.
I say, you chaps, be... be sporting and take her off my hands.
But after all, Monte...
We may be sporting, but we're not feeble-minded.
Well, you can do what you please with her.
I'm going.
Hey, listen, Monte...
Auf Wiedersehen.
Here, just a minute now.
Please.
Leave her to me.
I'll get rid of her.
Please.
Yes.
Ja.
Nein.
Nein.
Nein.
Nein.
Roy!
No!
Roy!
No, carry on.
Carry on.
Pretty boy, you please me very much.
What's that?
It is nothing.
I am not at home to anyone except my husband.
And he is away on army business.
He will not be home for hours.
So, you see...
Charming.
But really, I-I say you mustn't think that...
Your name?
My name is, uh, Rutledge, sir.
You are stopping in Munich?
At the Hotel Bayrischer Hof, sir.
My seconds will call on you later.
But I say you...
There is nothing further to discuss.
Sailing, sailing over the bounding main
Where many a wintery wind shall blow 'ere Jack comes home again
Hello.
Where you going?
Sailing, sailing England.
England?
Why, we're not going back for 10 days.
What's wrong?
Baron Von Kranz.
Who's he?
Oh, he's just a friend of mine.
Really?
Quite a social success, aren't you?
How do you meet these barons?
Well, unfortunately, I met this one through his wife.
And this means...
A duel.
Can you imagine it?
Running away?
Oh, don't be an ass.
Roy.
You don't expect me to go through with a farce like this.
It's the only thing you can do.
Oh, there you go again.
I suppose when a woman's no good and her husband finds it out,
I've got to get shot, just because it's the honorable thing to do.
Well, what do you think people will say?
You'll never live it down.
What do I care what people say?
Well, you can talk all you like, Monte, but you can't walk out like this.
Can't I?
Good-bye.
See you at Oxford.
Hello, Roy.
Hello, Karl.
Well, what's up?
Where's Monte?
He's gone to England.
England?
Well, what's the matter?
Oh, nothing.
But I say...
Herr Rutledge?
Herr Rutledge?
Yes?
Von Richter.
Von Schlieben.
We represent Colonel Baron Von Kranz.
Yes.
Have you chosen your second?
According to custom, we have selected the time and place.
You have the choice of weapons.
What is your choice?
What is this?
Golden Aue.
Why, that's a famous dueling place near here.
It says at 4:00 tomorrow morning.
4:00 in the morning.
Well, how did this happen?
I
- I'm sorry, Karl.
I
- I lost my temper with one of your officers.
But, Roy...
Say, Karl, do you know how to be a second?
Wait here, Roy.
Bitte.
Good luck, Roy.
Did you ever see a lassie a lassie, a lassie
Did you ever see a lassie go this way and that
Hey, will you cut it out?
Hey, did anybody see my green socks?
Check in the garbage.
Hello there, Roy.
Hello, Elliot.
Glad to see you.
I'm certainly glad to see you back.
Thank you.
And where's your German accent?
Well, I couldn't get it past the Custom officials.
Oh, I say, what have you done to your arm?
Oh, nothing.
It's just a little scratch.
I was hunting in Germany.
I'll see you at dinner?
Righto.
Good.
See you later.
Why aren't you getting dressed?
Aren't you coming to meet Helen?
Oh, yes, but don't remind me of it.
Don't be foolish.
She expects us for tea.
Tea?
Listen, it'll do you good to meet a nice girl.
Oh, well, all right, but first we've gotta get you dressed.
Say, we've gotta get him dressed.
He's going to see his girl.
Now, now, wait a minute, now.
Listen, I've gotta have my shirt!
Wait a minute.
L...
Listen, I'm old enough to dress myself!
No, you're not.
Will you cut it out?
Say, listen, will you pl...
Will you...
Hey, my green socks!
Is Helen in?
Miss Helen is not at home, sir.
She's expecting us.
Would you care to wait?
Yes, thank you.
Fine reception.
Oh.
Roy, maybe she's forgotten.
Not Helen.
She's not that sort.
Oh.
Roy, I feel sick.
I
- I think I'd better go.
- Monte, will you sit down?
- Oh, I've got an awful headache.
I think I'll go to the chemist and get something for it.
Monte.
- Roy!
- Helen!
Oh, terribly sorry.
Mother's fault.
Shopping.
I simply flew My, isn't it hot?
You shouldn't have hurried so.
Oh, but I wanted to.
Roy, you've no right to look so cool.
I'm broiling.
Feel.
Yes, you are, aren't you?
No, not one.
Well, you're so marvelous, I
- I hardly dare.
Oh, silly.
Well, that's better.
Cigarette, Roy?
I thought your brother was coming.
Went out with a headache.
Poor boy.
It must be the heat.
Extry, extry!
All about the war!
Well, they've done it.
I never thought they would.
I still can't believe it.
Well, it must be true.
It's official.
Oh, shut up.
I'm trying to think.
It's terrible.
Karl, you won't have to go, will you?
Me?
Oh, Roy, I hope not.
Oh, they can't want me.
I'm not a soldier.
What use would I be to them?
I couldn't... kill anyone.
They couldn't make me do that, could they, Roy?
Oh, I think it'll all be over in a couple of weeks.
I'm not so sure.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Then suppose England comes in.
Why, Roy, that'd be horrible.
I never could do that.
Why, I love England.
Oh, will you shut up?
Monte, Germany's declared war on France.
Hmm?
Oh.
Oh, Roy, how do you spell "ecstatic"?
Hmm?
Special delivery letter for Karl Arnstedt.
What's the matter, Karl?
Someone ill?
Karl.
May I ask the Prime Minister if he has any information he can give us today.
Our ambassador at Berlin received his passport at 7:00 last evening.
And since 11:00 last night, a state of war has existed between Germany and ourselves.
Seven?
What size?
A seven and a half if you please.
I
- I'm afraid it's a bit small, sir.
Move along, there.
Move along.
You'll grow into it.
Present arms!
Come on there.
Come on.
Present arms!
Give it to him, you bloody fool.
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Sleeping sickness?
Here, here.
Let go of that gun, you clinging vine.
Let go, do you hear?
God, you're enough to turn a man's stomach.
Hey, you with the fallen arches...
I've enlisted, Monte, in the Royal Flying Corps.
You're a fool, Roy.
Really?
How lovely.
My grandfather was in the guard during the Revolution.
Oh, he was?
Oh, Roy, you look marvelous in uniform.
Thank you.
Doesn't he?
It's ripping.
Where?
Tell me, what have you joined?
The infantry?
No, the Royal Flying Corps.
Oh, of course.
And all the misery in this world has been caused... by and for capitalism!
Why should we fight this war?
For capitalism?
You will die!
You will die!
All your sons will die for capitalism!
Down with capitalism!
Down with war!
Down with the anarchists.
That's right.
Get back now.
Who do you think you're shoving?
There's the man I'd like to kiss.
What's the matter?
Afraid of a kiss?
Maybe he's yeller!
Go on, you.
Go on and fight for your country.
Slacker!
Come on.
But really, you don't understand.
I didn't mean to do anything.
Say, I'd rather marry the girl.
You'll never get your wings that way.
Hi.
How are you?
Oh, boy.
Say, listen, that first solo flight certainly is a great thrill.
It certainly felt great.
I will.
Wonder who that is out there.
That was a fine landing.
Look at him come out of there.
Look, boys, it's Monte.
Hey, how'd it go, Monte?
Oh, great.
Well, tonight's the night, Monte.
Yeah.
Say, listen, be more cheerful.
You have a treat in store meeting Helen.
Must be Friday the 13th.
Gee, I-I wonder if she'll wear her canteen uniform.
If she does, you can count me out.
Oh, she looks stunning in it.
Who wants to be stunned?
I'm only going as a favor to you.
You and I don't like the same kind of girls.
Hurry up, will you?
Oh, it's a waste of time to polish these.
She'll probably step all over them the first dance anyway.
Safer to sit it out.
Quiet little corner and a have a chat about votes for women.
Hello there.
Hello.
Whose window are you warbling under tonight?
Lady Randolph's Charity Ball.
Wash your neck and come along.
Oh, but I haven't been invited.
That's all right.
I'm on the committee.
No, I don't think I'll go.
A smart boy.
I wonder where Helen is.
She should be here by this time.
How do you do, sir?
There's she is.
Don't point.
It's rude.
Oh, Helen.
Roy!
Hello.
Hello, old thing.
You're frightfully late.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
Oh, Helen, this is Monte.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Well, that's done at last.
You know, you two have been avoiding each other for weeks.
Helen, may I have this next dance?
What?
Oh, of course.
Oh, Roy, there you are.
Good evening, Lady Randolph.
I must say, you take your duties on my committee very lightly.
I'm sorry.
Where have you been?
You've completely disarranged my program.
There are no end of things to be done.
Helen dear, you don't mind, do you?
Come along, Roy.
Come at once.
I'm sorry, Helen.
Uh, Monte, would you take this next dance with Helen?
Oh, how do you do, Monte?
How do you do?
Now come along.
Well?
Ahem.
Oh.
Hello, Roy.
I
- I really must go and find, uh, Jimmy Kerrigan.
He has something most important to tell me.
I...
Who is this Jimmy Kerrigan?
Kerrigan?
I've never heard of him.
Oh.
What are you thinking of?
If you must know, I was thinking of Monte.
Do you like him?
Yes, I like him.
He's a marvelous dancer.
Well, Monte does all those things well.
Helen.
What?
May I?
Oh, Monte.
Oh, hello there.
Come sit down.
You having a better time than you expected, Monte?
Marvelous.
Been dancing with a beautiful brunette, name of Eleanor.
She's perfect.
Oh, Eleanor Madden.
You don't really think she's beautiful?
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty?
Stop it.
I'm not a cat.
Yes, you are.
Well, if I'm a kitty, I'm a thirsty kitty.
Roy dear, will you please get me a glass of punch?
Why, of course I will.
No, I'll go, Roy.
No, I'm the committee.
You stay here and look after this wallflower.
But really, I...
Oh, if you'd rather not...
Well, I-I didn't mean...
Don't you like wallflowers?
I shouldn't have done that.
Oh, you're not sorry, Monte.
Awfully sorry.
I had no right to.
What if I'm glad?
But what about Roy?
Isn't that my business?
I suppose so, but...
Hush.
Compliments of the committee.
Thanks awfully, Roy.
Well, has he been properly charming?
Me?
More than charming.
Good for you, Monte.
Taste?
She loves me.
She blisters you.
It's worth it.
Is she worth it?
Depends on who she is.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Well, thank goodness Lady Randolph's lost sight of me for a minute.
Roy, you've been neglecting me shamefully.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
You see, it's this beastly committee.
Lady Randolph won't let me alone a minute.
Oh, Roy, there you are.
Yes, here I am.
Do you mind?
Where is that list?
Would you mind finding Sir John for me?
It's about my Canteen Unit.
I must have the queen's signature.
It's so important.
My dear, why don't you get into your uniform?
You look so pretty in it.
And, Monte, shouldn't you dance with Mary Blunt?
Yes, why don't you?
And, Roy.
Roy, will you find Sir John?
I want you to lead the grand dance for me.
And really, there are so many things you've got to do.
Yes.
L-I'm terribly sorry.
Uh, back soon.
You see, those girls have been looking for you.
But, Lady Randolph, I'm supposed to...
So, you've really joined Lady Lizzie's Canteen Unit?
Rather.
Chance of a lifetime.
We go to France in two weeks.
Two weeks?
Well, Roy says you're sailing the 15th.
Is that so?
Bored?
Tired.
Take me home, Monte.
Home?
It's not far.
I've taken a flat in town near Canteen Headquarters.
But, I mean, Roy will be quite upset to find you gone.
That's what he gets for being on committee.
But, really...
Very well.
I'll find someone else.
Oh, I didn't mean to be rude.
Well, come on then.
Are we here?
Well, it's number 27.
Wanna come up for a cigarette and a drink?
Oh, really, you must be awfully tired.
No, I'm not.
Come see my room.
I've only had a place of my own for a week.
It's a new toy.
What a baby you are.
Alley-oop.
All right.
Well, this is jolly.
Sit down and I'll get you a drink.
Thanks.
Say when.
Whoa.
When!
When!
Would you be shocked if I put on something more comfortable?
I'll try to survive.
Well, are you more comfortable now?
Yes, are you?
Oh, yes.
You know, it seems strange being here like this after hearing Roy rave about you for months.
Does Roy rave?
Oh, rather.
He idolizes you.
Oh, I do wish he wouldn't.
It makes me feel guilty.
I can understand his raving now.
Oh, don't be silly.
You're not a bit like Roy, are you?
I should say not.
Roy's frightfully high-minded.
He doesn't approve of me.
He wouldn't approve of me either if he knew what I'm really like.
Doesn't he know?
No.
When I'm with Roy, I'm the way Roy wants me to be.
That's caddish, isn't it?
But I can't help it.
I understand.
Roy wouldn't.
May I ask you a very personal question?
Yes.
Do you love Roy?
No, not really.
Not the way Roy wants me to love him.
I can't.
Roy's love means marriage and children... and never anyone but Roy.
I couldn't bear that.
I wanna be free.
I wanna be gay and have fun.
Life's short, and I wanna live while I'm alive.
I know, that...
that's the way I feel too.
I...
I think I'd better go.
Must you?
I really should.
Pull.
Cold in here now, isn't it?
Have you a match?
Why so gloomy?
God, I'm rotten.
I can't see it.
Can't you?
Well, then you're rotten too.
What do you mean?
And Roy worships you.
You!
Well?
Don't you make yourself sick...
you and Roy.
God, that's funny.
Get out of here!
Don't worry.
I can't get out fast enough.
Get out!
And stay out!
Where have you been?
Oh, I, uh...
I stopped at a... at a bar after I took Helen home.
Oh.
How'd you like her?
Oh, she's all right.
Pass in a crowd, eh?
I daresay she would.
Just what do you mean by that?
Listen, Roy, let me tell you something.
Even if it hurts.
Yes?
I wouldn't be so idealistic about Helen if I were you.
And why not?
Well, I...
I just wouldn't, that's all.
Well, why not?
Oh, I don't know.
Forget it.
Never mind crawling.
Out with it.
Listen, Roy, I tell you.
Women are all the same.
You look at every woman as a barmaid.
You don't know anything about decent women.
Oh, all right.
You know it all then.
Oh, you've said enough.
Shut up.
Karl.
Karl!
Zep overhead!
- South by east.
- Righto!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Right.
All lights out, sir.
Lights out, quick!
Zeppelin overhead!
Zeppelin overhead!
Everybody out!
Hey, come on, Monte.
Zeppelin overhead.
Come on, Monte.
What's the matter with you?
Get up.
We don't all have to go.
I'm tired.
Oh, shut up.
- Come on.
Let's go.
Hurry up.
Come on.
- Be right with you, Elliot.
Come on, Monte.
Get up.
Come on.
Let's go.
Hurry.
All right.
Karl...
Karl.
Danke.
Well, so long there, Tommy.
All right, old chap.
Good luck, Elliot.
Go get 'em, Monte.
Good-bye.
Good luck, Roy.
Right.
Perfect.
Look, Roy, there she goes.
Let's go.
Kapitän?
Kapitän.
Kapitän!
Kapitän!
Kapitän!
Jawohl!
Hey, Roy, they've hit our motor.
Cut the gas.
We'll burn to death!
Roy!
Oh, shut up!
Well, this is a mess, all right.
Yeah, just our luck.
Lucky we weren't both killed.
Well, we're through.
Herr Kapitän.
Look at it, Monte.
Roy, it's falling!
Look at that, Roy.
Great, isn't it?
They're done for.
Look out!
Run!
Just a minute.
Why the blazes don't you look where you're going, sir?
I'm sorry, sir.
Isn't it customary to salute one's superior officer?
Thank you.
What is your name, sir?
Lieutenant Roy Rutledge.
Make a note of that.
Yes, sir.
Would you like to try it and find out?
They are.
They glisten in the sun.
What the hell you trying to do?
It took me three hours to write that.
You're nothing but a pest anyhow.
Sit down.
Oh, don't, Bruce.
You shouldn't smoke so many.
What difference does it make?
You know it's bad for you.
Buy a chocolate, miss.
Change, miss.
Please.
That's a good boy.
What a life it would be married to you.
Oh, you don't fancy it?
Beastly.
No smokes.
Think of all the money we'd save.
What would we spend it on?
Oh, a diamond dog collar.
For me?
No.
I'd buy a muzzle for you.
You wouldn't spoil my beautiful mustache, would you?
No.
We'd keep that in the parlor under glass.
Hello, Helen.
Oh, hello, Roy.
Roy, I'd like you to meet Captain Redfield.
Lieutenant Rutledge.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Beastly weather.
Yes, isn't it.
- You'll get used to it.
- Thanks.
Gee, it's great to see you again, Helen.
It's been four whole days.
Really?
- Have you been over long?
- Three weeks.
Oh.
Three weeks.
Everything all right up your way?
Oh, yes.
Your squadron near here?
Twenty miles up the line.
Twenty miles.
That far.
- You chaps have it rather soft, haven't you?
- Do you think so?
Well, I mean to say being able to dash about the countryside and all that.
Wish I'd picked the R.F.C.
Well, why didn't you?
Roy.
Well, I must be going.
Oh.
Don't go.
I think I'd better.
Good-bye, Helen, and don't forget your promise.
I won't.
Who's that bag of wind?
Would you mind not talking about my friends like that?
Oh, now, Helen, please.
Oh, you were perfectly beastly to him.
I'm terribly sorry.
Guess my nerves are a bit raw.
Things haven't been so easy this last week.
Oh, you've been fighting?
Did you shoot down any Boche?
Yes.
I managed to get a couple.
Really?
How thrilling.
Tell me about it.
Well, there's really nothing much to tell.
Three bars of chocolate, miss.
Oh, Jymes.
Oh, Jymes.
Bread, Jymes.
We want bread.
We want bread!
Coming, sir.
Coming!
Did you ever try hurrying, Jymes?
Sorry, sir, but I stopped to dig a few of the cockroaches out of it, sir.
Well, put it down.
Well, where's the bread?
Did you ever try hurrying, sir?
Jymes, more bread.
Drown the cockroaches this time.
Yes, sir.
Jymes, what's the taste in this soup?
I can't say, sir.
It's not soup, it's soap.
I think it's shoe polish.
Sorry, sir.
Cook said the soup was a bit weak tonight.
Maybe you taste the disinfectant in the water, sir.
Oh.
Well, strike me blind, it's a hair.
Wash it off and wear it, Baldy.
Hello, you chaps.
Hello, Monte.
How goes it?
Still no news of Harry?
No.
Somebody always gets it on the night patrol.
What do you think, Marryat?
You saw it happen.
Is there any chance he got down alive?
No, I don't think so.
The searchlights got him.
We were flying low and they heard us.
We started to climb, but it was too late.
Shrapnel began bursting all around him.
Two bursts caught him and he started to drop.
It was awful to see him down there, twisting and diving... crippled, always dropping.
Trying every way to get clear of those lights.
Then another burst got him.
We could hear him screaming...
Stop!
I can't stand it.
Good thing he took your place, Rutledge.
You might've got it instead of him.
Oh, I'll get it sooner or later.
We'll all get it.
Isn't there any end to this?
Oh, shut up.
You're always whining.
Shut up yourself.
Who'll make me?
I'll make you.
Sit down, Jack, and be quiet.
All right.
What's the matter with you fellas?
Would anybody like to take Monte's place on tonight's patrol?
Lay off.
No more soup.
We need some.
No more soup.
We need some soup.
Jymes!
Hurry it up.
Splendid.
Splendid, Jymes.
Splendid.
That's what comes from hurrying.
What was dinner before you dropped it, Jymes?
A tasty bit of salmon, sir.
Sewer trout again?
Hasn't the cook anything else?
Well, sir, there's that tin of pork and beans.
No, we don't want that.
Can he do anything with the garbage?
Oh, well, never mind.
We aren't hungry, are we?
Coffee, Jymes.
Yes, sir.
And, Jymes.
Yes, sir?
Don't let anything hurry you.
No, sir.
Drinking again?
You dirty louse!
Hey, Baldy.
The sooner you get shot down, the better.
Baldy, darling.
Now that didn't hurt, Baldy.
Monte!
What's the matter with you?
Attention.
As you were.
The following officers will report for night patrol.
Drayton.
Yes, sir.
Fuller.
Here, sir.
Maloney.
Oh, no.
Not an old baldheaded man like me up there in the cold, cold air.
Perhaps Fritz will warm it up for you.
Neville.
Here, sir.
Monte Rutledge.
Monte Rutledge.
I don't feel very well tonight, sir.
That's all right, boy.
None of us feel well.
But you don't understand.
I think I do, Rutledge.
But I say, sir.
You don't understand.
Th-There seems to be something the matter with me.
I know what's the matter with him.
He's yellow.
Oh, shut up.
Oh, let's say it.
Didn't Harry go west last night because he took this man's place?
Keep quiet, Jack.
I will not keep quiet.
He's yellow and we all know it.
That's a lie!
I'm not yellow.
I can see things as they are, that's all.
I'm sick of this rotten business.
You fools.
Why do you let them kill you like this?
What are you fighting for?
Patriotism.
Duty.
Are you mad?
Can't you see they're just words?
Words coined by politicians and profiteers to trick you into fighting for them.
What's a word compared with life...
the only life you've got.
I'll give 'em a word.
Murder!
That's what this dirty rotten politician's war is.
Murder!
You know it as well as I do.
Yellow, am I?
You're the ones that are yellow.
I've got guts to say what I think.
You're afraid to say it.
So afraid to be called yellow, you'd rather be killed first.
You fools!
You poor, stupid fools.
Oh, Monte.
Now, pull yourself together, will ya?
Stand up, Rutledge!
I've taken a lot of shirking from you since we came out here, but this is a bit too much.
Sir, he really is ill.
You're a disgrace to your squadron.
Go to your quarters.
Yes, sir.
Have a cigarette.
You don't think I'm yellow, do you, Roy?
Why, of course not.
You're just more sensitive than the rest of us.
I wonder.
Well, stop thinking about it.
I wish I could.
Haven't I been up twice on the night patrol?
I'm trying to do my share.
Of course you are now.
You...
You must be pretty well fed up with me after all this.
Oh, that's rot.
I
- I'm not yellow.
I'm not!
Oh, now, Monte.
Come on.
Pull yourself together.
Staff Colonel.
Everybody out.
Come on, Monte.
Stand easy.
Well, men, I don't like what I have to say, but let's face it, you all know the central munition dump at Spraug.
You've tried three times to bomb that depot without success.
No fault of yours, of course, they've guarded it too closely.
That munition depot at Spraug must be destroyed tomorrow morning.
Now, then, today a German bombing plane was forced down within our lines.
We were lucky enough to capture it before they had a chance to destroy it.
We've fixed it up so it'll fly.
We want to use this plane to bomb the Spraug depot.
There's no question that the venture will succeed this time.
The enemy won't suspect one of their own planes until after the depot is bombed.
Then when they discover the trick, well, you... you may have a little difficulty in getting back.
I need two men to fly this plane.
I'll go, sir.
Are you sure you wanna go?
Quite sure, sir.
Very well.
I'll go with him, sir.
Who are these men?
Lieutenants Monte and Roy Rutledge, sir.
Brothers, eh?
Dismissed.
Now, young men,
I want you to realize how important this is.
The Seventh Brigade has been ordered to go over the top in a surprise attack tomorrow evening at dusk.
The brigade doesn't know it, but I
- I'm afraid they're going to be slaughtered.
There's too much artillery in front of us.
If you destroy that munition depot early tomorrow morning, it will weaken the enemy artillery, and we may be able to get through.
Hundreds of lives depend on you.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Now, another thing.
The plane you are to fly... is far too dangerous a piece of armament to let the enemy recapture it.
It must return or be destroyed.
If you were captured, you'd be shot as spies anyway.
Baldy.
Oh, Baldy?
You'll take the morning patrol in towards Spraug as far as you can.
You might possibly help them get back.
By all means.
Yes, sir.
You'll get your maps and final instructions just before taking off.
Report to the field at 3:00 a. m.
Until then, let them do as they please.
- Yes, sir. 3:00, you two.
- Yes, sir.
Good luck.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
- What time is it, Monte?
- Ten past 9:00.
Helen's canteen closes at 10:00.
We've just enough time to get there.
- Do you think they'll let us have the motorcycle?
- Why, of course.
We're "it" tonight.
Yeah.
We're "it" all right.
Not sorry, are you?
Oh, let's not talk about it.
I'm not even gonna think about it until 3:00.
What's your program?
Wine, women and song?
Oh, perhaps I'll do without the song tonight.
- See you at Grosson's?
- Either there or at Jacques across the street.
- Wherever you hear the most noise.
- Don't you wanna come in with me to see Helen?
Oh, I better not.
Righto.
Where's Helen?
She's gone out.
Oh.
Was she expecting you?
No.
Would you care to leave a note?
Yes, I think I will.
Pen and ink on the table.
You'll see that she gets this?
Oh, yes.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
Hello.
What's up?
She isn't in.
That's tough.
Wanna come along with me?
Where to?
Grosson's.
Righto.
Your switch on?
Will you close it a little?
- Helen.
- Well, if it isn't old Roy.
Old solemn Roy himself.
Sit down, Roy.
Sit on the floor and hang your legs over.
- Take your hands off her.
- Oh, I can't take my hands off.
You heard what I said.
Take your hands off her.
Who asked you to this party anyway?
Helen, let me take you home.
Home?
Who wants to go home?
I'm having a marvelous time.
I was until you came in.
I advise you to get out before you're kicked out.
Keep your...
Keep your filthy hands off of my girl.
Your girl.
You fool.
I wouldn't belong to you if you were the last man on Earth.
You're nothing to me.
Nothing.
Come on, Roy.
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
Oh, let's have it out.
I don't love you.
I never have.
I never had any fun with you anyway.
You and your high ideals.
You're too good to live.
You're just a stupid prig if you ask me.
You make me sick, do you hear?
Sick.
Now, get out here.
I hate the sight of you!
Come on, Roy.
Let's go across the street.
Sweet, sweet baby.
Handsome, big, strong baby.
N'est-ce pas?
Mmm, n'est-ce pas, kiss Papa, huh?
Oh, baby.
Hello, chèri.
Aw, don't take it so hard, Roy.
Forget it.
Is your friend sick?
No.
He'll be all right.
Drink up, Roy.
I still can't believe it.
You just don't know anything about women.
They're all the same.
I've been telling you that for years.
Maybe you'll believe me now.
- Oh, Helen's not that sort.
- Oh, nonsense.
- It's the war.
She's changed.
- You're wrong, Roy.
War doesn't change people.
It's...
It's like getting drunk.
It brings out what people really are.
You can't make me believe Helen was like that before.
Well, she was.
I've known it all along.
You too?
Oh, I'm sorry, Roy.
Don't take it so hard.
She isn't worth it.
- I suppose you're right.
- Of course I'm right.
Listen, Roy, never love a woman.
Just make love to her.
You see, like this.
Look.
Go ahead, Roy.
Try it.
That's the way.
Oh!
What you do, baby?
All wet!
No, no, no, no!
Imbecile!
Aw, baby.
Voilà.
Hey, listen, Monte.
Monte.
Go easy.
We gotta go up at 3:00.
Oh, listen, Roy.
To hell with this 3:00 business.
What do you mean?
Just that.
To hell with it.
Say, you're crazy, Monte.
We can't get out of it now.
Oh, why can't we?
Listen, Roy, all this idealistic stuff won't get you anywhere.
You tried it on Helen and what happened?
You got a kick in the face.
You can't go through life thinking the way you do.
People take advantage of you and make a fool of you the way she did.
- It's beginning to look as though you're right.
- Of course I'm right.
I was right about Helen, and now I'm right about this 3:00 business too.
This is another thing entirely, Monte.
Why is it?
They're just taking advantage of you in another way, that's all.
It's chaps like you that are meat for them.
All they gotta do is make it sound heroic, and you fall for it.
Listen, Roy, what's the difference if we don't go?
- But we can't get out of it now.
- Why can't we?
Listen, tell 'em...
tell 'em the motorcycle broke down.
Tell 'em anything.
What do you say, Roy?
Well...
Come on, old ooo-la-la.
Oh, no, no, no, chèri.
Oh, baby.
N'est-ce pas?
Oh, oui, oui, madam.
Oh, baby.
Oh, stop looking at your watch, Roy.
You're not going anywhere.
Yes, I am and so are you.
Who says I am?
Listen, Monte, we're a little drunk and we've been talking wildly.
There's no way out of this and we know it.
Come on, Monte.
No, no.
Let me alone.
Come on, old ooo-la-la.
Monte.
Why, they'd court-martial us in a minute if we didn't show up.
Why, that's desertion, Monte.
They shoot people for that.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
Come on.
I suppose you're right.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Monte.
What a pair of fools we are.
Let's go.
Easy, now.
Easy.
Look out for the firing pin.
Righto.
I got it.
Contactor.
Contact.
Ground speed here.
Keep this site trained on the target.
Then pull the release when you hit the stop.
Do you understand?
Don't forget the leveler.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Contactor.
Contact.
Remember this ship weighs 20,000 pounds.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Roy, the depot.
Roy, look there!
They've seen us.
They're coming on.
For Christ's sake.
Hey, Roy, look.
They hit our right motor.
I got him!
Roy!
Look over there.
It's our squadrons.
They're coming!
Roy, they've gone.
Jesus.
Son of a Boche.
Hey!
It's me!
Hey!
It's me!
Goddamn it!
It's old Baldy.
Hey!
Baldy.
Hello.
It's Baldy.
Look, Roy.
It's Baldy.
You see that guy?
Good old Baldy.
Good boy.
See that?
He's got him.
Hey, look.
He's got him.
He's got him.
Oh.
Look.
They've changed around.
Our strut's gone.
That son of a bitch.
Roy, he got us!
Roy!
Go down!
Go down!
Go down!
One more for Baldy!
No more control?
Pull her up!
Oh, my God!
We're on fire!
We're burning!
Roy, get down!
Do something!
Roy!
Ah, so.
We meet again.
It was you who bombed the depot at Spraug, nicht wahr?
Yes.
And you were flying a German plane, nicht wahr?
- Yes.
- Very clever.
It is a pity you must take your congratulations from me.
There are a few questions I must ask you.
If you answer them simply, it will be easy for you.
To what squadron of the Royal Flying Corps are you attached?
Just why were you sent to bomb that munition depot this morning?
It was our natural target.
But possibly it was to clear the way for a little surprise attack, huh?
You are surprised.
We know all about it, so you need not be afraid to talk.
Now, please, when and where is the attack to be made?
Oh, you are stupid not to tell.
It is nothing.
For you the war is over, nicht wahr?
We are friends.
Hmm.
Listen, if you tell me,
I will see that you are sent to a special camp reserved only for certain prisoners of war.
It's near Munich.
Far away from all this.
You will have every comfort.
And in a few months from now when the war is over, you will be alive and in good health, which is more than most of us will be able to say.
So, you see?
It can be easy for you.
Now, please.
So, you will not tell?
Possibly you do not know that flying a German plane... is the same as wearing a German uniform.
Any disguised soldier is a spy, nicht wahr?
And you know what happens to spies?
I think you two friends had better talk it over.
I will give you 15 minutes.
If you change your mind and tell, good.
If not, you will be shot.
Do you think he was bluffing?
No, he wasn't bluffing.
He's the man I was to fight that duel with.
Really?
Quite a coincidence.
He's got it in for me.
Nah, he's probably forgotten it by this time.
The brigade will be going over pretty soon, Monte.
Yes.
Roy, look.
Oh, save it to wipe your nose on.
God, what nerve.
Roy.
Roy, I can't face it.
I'm going to tell.
Don't be a fool, Monte.
Do you realize what it would mean if we told?
It would mean being alive when this bloody war's over.
But, Monte, you can't.
To hell with your heroic stuff.
I wanna live.
I'm not gonna be shot down like that.
I'm going to tell.
Wait a minute.
Monte.
But I...
Listen.
Let me go.
You?
Yes.
You're all upset.
I'll bargain with him, and perhaps I won't have to tell him everything.
I
- I'll come with you.
No.
You said he's got it in for you.
Now, let me do it alone.
All right.
Tell the general I'm ready to talk.
Good.
Come.
Ah, yes.
So, you have changed your mind?
Yes.
My friend will never tell, but I wanna live.
I'm ready to talk.
You are very wise.
Now, please, draw a rough map for me showing your positions, brigade numbers, disposition, hour of attack, purpose, number of men.
Wait a minute.
I'll tell only on one condition.
Ah, so, a condition.
Yes.
If I give this information, my friend will know it.
Back home after the war, he'll tell everyone that I was a traitor.
You leave that to me.
Why not let me have that satisfaction?
What do you mean?
I do not understand.
One does not kill a friend.
Friend.
He's not my friend.
He stole the girl I love and I hate him.
Huh.
History repeats itself.
You make rather hard terms.
I'll tell only on that condition.
One bullet.
What if I miss?
Give me two to make sure.
No.
A good soldier will need only one.
Very well.
Not so fast.
He will give you the bullet outside.
Well?
I didn't tell, Monte.
Why?
What happened?
Has he changed his mind?
No.
Don't you think you can go through with it now?
What do you mean?
Of course we can.
It won't even hurt.
It'll all be over in a second.
We can stand anything for a second.
No, no, Roy.
L-I can't do it.
I'm going to tell.
Listen, Monte.
We tell, the whole brigade will be wiped out.
Three thousand men, and they all want to live too.
You wouldn't spoil their chances, would you?
That's not my business.
I didn't start this war.
I didn't get them into this mess.
Let 'em take care of themselves.
They'll get wiped out sooner or later anyway.
I wanna live.
Live!
You won't tell, I'll tell.
Listen, Monte!
I'll tell!
I'll tell!
Let me out!
I'll tell everything I know.
The brigade is moving up.
They're going to attack...
Oh.
Roy.
Oh, Monte.
Monte.
Monte.
Monte.
Don't cry, Roy.
It was the only thing you could do.
The brigade, Roy.
Yes, Monte?
They'll be all right now, won't they?
Yes.
Who's that?
It's the general.
You...
You thought we'd tell, didn't you?
Good old Roy.
You won't tell, and I... forgotten... it all.
Oh, Roy.
Roy.
Yes?
Where are you?
Don't go away, Roy.
I'm here, Monte.
Can't you feel me holding you?
Hello, Karl.
Fig eights.
Cold up here in the night patrol.
Awful to be in the dark.
Oh.
I'm afraid.
Look out.
Look out!
We're falling!
We're going to crash!
Do something, Roy!
Quick!
Quick!
Quick!
It's all right, Monte.
Monte?
It's all right.
Monte?
Monte.
Oh.
Well?
You heard what my brother said.
Your brother?
I'll never tell you anything.
Achtung!
I'll be with you in just a minute, Monte.
Come on, you Seventh Brigade.
We got 'em now.
Ah!
Ja!
Wunderbar!
Look at that, Karl.
Well, Roy, you seem to like my country.
Like it?
I think it's marvelous.
Say, I wish we were staying here two years instead of just two weeks.
But you know, Karl, it does sound funny hearing you call it "your country. "
I keep forgetting you're not English.
Oh, sometimes I...
Well, I feel almost English myself.
Well, that's natural.
After all, you can't be at Oxford three years... without feeling slightly British.
I wish Helen were here.
After all you've said about her, I don't blame you.
Your brother is not coming today, Herr Rutledge?
Oh, yes, he'll be along soon, Gretchen.
Nothing can keep Monte away from this good beer.
Nothing except a good-looking woman.
Jawohl.
That brother of yours, he's a naughty boy, but I like him.
He has a way with them, hey, Gretchen?
You, you don't know half of it.
Another conquest for Monte.
Yes.
I don't know why he wants to mess about with every woman he meets.
Yeah, but you have Helen.
I'm not at all sure.
I'm not half good enough for her.
She must be a wonderful girl.
Oh, she is.
She's marvelous.
You'll have to meet her when we get back to Oxford.
- I'd like to.
- Would you like to see what she looks like?
Yes.
I didn't know you had a photograph of her.
Yeah, and neither does Helen.
I took it myself when she wasn't looking.
Really?
Oh.
Stunning, isn't she?
Why, she's marvelous.
Cheerio, you blighters.
Hello, it's Monte.
Meet the countess.
Step up, gents, to the one and only...
Now, Monte, don't, please.
Oh, it's all right.
This little pretzel doesn't understand a word of English.
No?
Gretchen!
Ja!
Found her at the museum.
Yeah, she's a work of art, all right.
You should have left her there.
Shh!
Quiet!
I say, Monte, why do you bring around this sort?
Bring her?
Good heavens, I can't get rid of her.
Go home, will you?
Go home.
You see, I'm stuck.
Hello.
Who's the dowager?
That's Helen.
Oh.
But, of course, that's only a snapshot.
Wait till you meet her.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Go away!
I say.
This is getting serious.
I've got to get rid of her.
Oh, you know, I have a very important engagement in just 15 minutes.
I say, you chaps, be... be sporting and take her off my hands.
But after all, Monte...
We may be sporting, but we're not feeble-minded.
Well, you can do what you please with her.
I'm going.
Hey, listen, Monte...
Auf Wiedersehen.
Here, just a minute now.
Please.
Leave her to me.
I'll get rid of her.
Please.
Yes.
Ja.
Nein.
Nein.
Nein.
Nein.
Roy!
No!
Roy!
No, carry on.
Carry on.
Pretty boy, you please me very much.
What's that?
It is nothing.
I am not at home to anyone except my husband.
And he is away on army business.
He will not be home for hours.
So, you see...
Charming.
But really, I-I say you mustn't think that...
Your name?
My name is, uh, Rutledge, sir.
You are stopping in Munich?
At the Hotel Bayrischer Hof, sir.
My seconds will call on you later.
But I say you...
There is nothing further to discuss.
Sailing, sailing over the bounding main
Where many a wintery wind shall blow 'ere Jack comes home again
Hello.
Where you going?
Sailing, sailing England.
England?
Why, we're not going back for 10 days.
What's wrong?
Baron Von Kranz.
Who's he?
Oh, he's just a friend of mine.
Really?
Quite a social success, aren't you?
How do you meet these barons?
Well, unfortunately, I met this one through his wife.
And this means...
A duel.
Can you imagine it?
Running away?
Oh, don't be an ass.
Roy.
You don't expect me to go through with a farce like this.
It's the only thing you can do.
Oh, there you go again.
I suppose when a woman's no good and her husband finds it out,
I've got to get shot, just because it's the honorable thing to do.
Well, what do you think people will say?
You'll never live it down.
What do I care what people say?
Well, you can talk all you like, Monte, but you can't walk out like this.
Can't I?
Good-bye.
See you at Oxford.
Hello, Roy.
Hello, Karl.
Well, what's up?
Where's Monte?
He's gone to England.
England?
Well, what's the matter?
Oh, nothing.
But I say...
Herr Rutledge?
Herr Rutledge?
Yes?
Von Richter.
Von Schlieben.
We represent Colonel Baron Von Kranz.
Yes.
Have you chosen your second?
According to custom, we have selected the time and place.
You have the choice of weapons.
What is your choice?
What is this?
Golden Aue.
Why, that's a famous dueling place near here.
It says at 4:00 tomorrow morning.
4:00 in the morning.
Well, how did this happen?
I
- I'm sorry, Karl.
I
- I lost my temper with one of your officers.
But, Roy...
Say, Karl, do you know how to be a second?
Wait here, Roy.
Bitte.
Good luck, Roy.
Did you ever see a lassie a lassie, a lassie
Did you ever see a lassie go this way and that
Hey, will you cut it out?
Hey, did anybody see my green socks?
Check in the garbage.
Hello there, Roy.
Hello, Elliot.
Glad to see you.
I'm certainly glad to see you back.
Thank you.
And where's your German accent?
Well, I couldn't get it past the Custom officials.
Oh, I say, what have you done to your arm?
Oh, nothing.
It's just a little scratch.
I was hunting in Germany.
I'll see you at dinner?
Righto.
Good.
See you later.
Why aren't you getting dressed?
Aren't you coming to meet Helen?
Oh, yes, but don't remind me of it.
Don't be foolish.
She expects us for tea.
Tea?
Listen, it'll do you good to meet a nice girl.
Oh, well, all right, but first we've gotta get you dressed.
Say, we've gotta get him dressed.
He's going to see his girl.
Now, now, wait a minute, now.
Listen, I've gotta have my shirt!
Wait a minute.
L...
Listen, I'm old enough to dress myself!
No, you're not.
Will you cut it out?
Say, listen, will you pl...
Will you...
Hey, my green socks!
Is Helen in?
Miss Helen is not at home, sir.
She's expecting us.
Would you care to wait?
Yes, thank you.
Fine reception.
Oh.
Roy, maybe she's forgotten.
Not Helen.
She's not that sort.
Oh.
Roy, I feel sick.
I
- I think I'd better go.
- Monte, will you sit down?
- Oh, I've got an awful headache.
I think I'll go to the chemist and get something for it.
Monte.
- Roy!
- Helen!
Oh, terribly sorry.
Mother's fault.
Shopping.
I simply flew My, isn't it hot?
You shouldn't have hurried so.
Oh, but I wanted to.
Roy, you've no right to look so cool.
I'm broiling.
Feel.
Yes, you are, aren't you?
No, not one.
Well, you're so marvelous, I
- I hardly dare.
Oh, silly.
Well, that's better.
Cigarette, Roy?
I thought your brother was coming.
Went out with a headache.
Poor boy.
It must be the heat.
Extry, extry!
All about the war!
Well, they've done it.
I never thought they would.
I still can't believe it.
Well, it must be true.
It's official.
Oh, shut up.
I'm trying to think.
It's terrible.
Karl, you won't have to go, will you?
Me?
Oh, Roy, I hope not.
Oh, they can't want me.
I'm not a soldier.
What use would I be to them?
I couldn't... kill anyone.
They couldn't make me do that, could they, Roy?
Oh, I think it'll all be over in a couple of weeks.
I'm not so sure.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Then suppose England comes in.
Why, Roy, that'd be horrible.
I never could do that.
Why, I love England.
Oh, will you shut up?
Monte, Germany's declared war on France.
Hmm?
Oh.
Oh, Roy, how do you spell "ecstatic"?
Hmm?
Special delivery letter for Karl Arnstedt.
What's the matter, Karl?
Someone ill?
Karl.
May I ask the Prime Minister if he has any information he can give us today.
Our ambassador at Berlin received his passport at 7:00 last evening.
And since 11:00 last night, a state of war has existed between Germany and ourselves.
Seven?
What size?
A seven and a half if you please.
I
- I'm afraid it's a bit small, sir.
Move along, there.
Move along.
You'll grow into it.
Present arms!
Come on there.
Come on.
Present arms!
Give it to him, you bloody fool.
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Sleeping sickness?
Here, here.
Let go of that gun, you clinging vine.
Let go, do you hear?
God, you're enough to turn a man's stomach.
Hey, you with the fallen arches...
I've enlisted, Monte, in the Royal Flying Corps.
You're a fool, Roy.
Really?
How lovely.
My grandfather was in the guard during the Revolution.
Oh, he was?
Oh, Roy, you look marvelous in uniform.
Thank you.
Doesn't he?
It's ripping.
Where?
Tell me, what have you joined?
The infantry?
No, the Royal Flying Corps.
Oh, of course.
And all the misery in this world has been caused... by and for capitalism!
Why should we fight this war?
For capitalism?
You will die!
You will die!
All your sons will die for capitalism!
Down with capitalism!
Down with war!
Down with the anarchists.
That's right.
Get back now.
Who do you think you're shoving?
There's the man I'd like to kiss.
What's the matter?
Afraid of a kiss?
Maybe he's yeller!
Go on, you.
Go on and fight for your country.
Slacker!
Come on.
But really, you don't understand.
I didn't mean to do anything.
Say, I'd rather marry the girl.
You'll never get your wings that way.
Hi.
How are you?
Oh, boy.
Say, listen, that first solo flight certainly is a great thrill.
It certainly felt great.
I will.
Wonder who that is out there.
That was a fine landing.
Look at him come out of there.
Look, boys, it's Monte.
Hey, how'd it go, Monte?
Oh, great.
Well, tonight's the night, Monte.
Yeah.
Say, listen, be more cheerful.
You have a treat in store meeting Helen.
Must be Friday the 13th.
Gee, I-I wonder if she'll wear her canteen uniform.
If she does, you can count me out.
Oh, she looks stunning in it.
Who wants to be stunned?
I'm only going as a favor to you.
You and I don't like the same kind of girls.
Hurry up, will you?
Oh, it's a waste of time to polish these.
She'll probably step all over them the first dance anyway.
Safer to sit it out.
Quiet little corner and a have a chat about votes for women.
Hello there.
Hello.
Whose window are you warbling under tonight?
Lady Randolph's Charity Ball.
Wash your neck and come along.
Oh, but I haven't been invited.
That's all right.
I'm on the committee.
No, I don't think I'll go.
A smart boy.
I wonder where Helen is.
She should be here by this time.
How do you do, sir?
There's she is.
Don't point.
It's rude.
Oh, Helen.
Roy!
Hello.
Hello, old thing.
You're frightfully late.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
Oh, Helen, this is Monte.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Well, that's done at last.
You know, you two have been avoiding each other for weeks.
Helen, may I have this next dance?
What?
Oh, of course.
Oh, Roy, there you are.
Good evening, Lady Randolph.
I must say, you take your duties on my committee very lightly.
I'm sorry.
Where have you been?
You've completely disarranged my program.
There are no end of things to be done.
Helen dear, you don't mind, do you?
Come along, Roy.
Come at once.
I'm sorry, Helen.
Uh, Monte, would you take this next dance with Helen?
Oh, how do you do, Monte?
How do you do?
Now come along.
Well?
Ahem.
Oh.
Hello, Roy.
I
- I really must go and find, uh, Jimmy Kerrigan.
He has something most important to tell me.
I...
Who is this Jimmy Kerrigan?
Kerrigan?
I've never heard of him.
Oh.
What are you thinking of?
If you must know, I was thinking of Monte.
Do you like him?
Yes, I like him.
He's a marvelous dancer.
Well, Monte does all those things well.
Helen.
What?
May I?
Oh, Monte.
Oh, hello there.
Come sit down.
You having a better time than you expected, Monte?
Marvelous.
Been dancing with a beautiful brunette, name of Eleanor.
She's perfect.
Oh, Eleanor Madden.
You don't really think she's beautiful?
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty?
Stop it.
I'm not a cat.
Yes, you are.
Well, if I'm a kitty, I'm a thirsty kitty.
Roy dear, will you please get me a glass of punch?
Why, of course I will.
No, I'll go, Roy.
No, I'm the committee.
You stay here and look after this wallflower.
But really, I...
Oh, if you'd rather not...
Well, I-I didn't mean...
Don't you like wallflowers?
I shouldn't have done that.
Oh, you're not sorry, Monte.
Awfully sorry.
I had no right to.
What if I'm glad?
But what about Roy?
Isn't that my business?
I suppose so, but...
Hush.
Compliments of the committee.
Thanks awfully, Roy.
Well, has he been properly charming?
Me?
More than charming.
Good for you, Monte.
Taste?
She loves me.
She blisters you.
It's worth it.
Is she worth it?
Depends on who she is.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Well, thank goodness Lady Randolph's lost sight of me for a minute.
Roy, you've been neglecting me shamefully.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
You see, it's this beastly committee.
Lady Randolph won't let me alone a minute.
Oh, Roy, there you are.
Yes, here I am.
Do you mind?
Where is that list?
Would you mind finding Sir John for me?
It's about my Canteen Unit.
I must have the queen's signature.
It's so important.
My dear, why don't you get into your uniform?
You look so pretty in it.
And, Monte, shouldn't you dance with Mary Blunt?
Yes, why don't you?
And, Roy.
Roy, will you find Sir John?
I want you to lead the grand dance for me.
And really, there are so many things you've got to do.
Yes.
L-I'm terribly sorry.
Uh, back soon.
You see, those girls have been looking for you.
But, Lady Randolph, I'm supposed to...
So, you've really joined Lady Lizzie's Canteen Unit?
Rather.
Chance of a lifetime.
We go to France in two weeks.
Two weeks?
Well, Roy says you're sailing the 15th.
Is that so?
Bored?
Tired.
Take me home, Monte.
Home?
It's not far.
I've taken a flat in town near Canteen Headquarters.
But, I mean, Roy will be quite upset to find you gone.
That's what he gets for being on committee.
But, really...
Very well.
I'll find someone else.
Oh, I didn't mean to be rude.
Well, come on then.
Are we here?
Well, it's number 27.
Wanna come up for a cigarette and a drink?
Oh, really, you must be awfully tired.
No, I'm not.
Come see my room.
I've only had a place of my own for a week.
It's a new toy.
What a baby you are.
Alley-oop.
All right.
Well, this is jolly.
Sit down and I'll get you a drink.
Thanks.
Say when.
Whoa.
When!
When!
Would you be shocked if I put on something more comfortable?
I'll try to survive.
Well, are you more comfortable now?
Yes, are you?
Oh, yes.
You know, it seems strange being here like this after hearing Roy rave about you for months.
Does Roy rave?
Oh, rather.
He idolizes you.
Oh, I do wish he wouldn't.
It makes me feel guilty.
I can understand his raving now.
Oh, don't be silly.
You're not a bit like Roy, are you?
I should say not.
Roy's frightfully high-minded.
He doesn't approve of me.
He wouldn't approve of me either if he knew what I'm really like.
Doesn't he know?
No.
When I'm with Roy, I'm the way Roy wants me to be.
That's caddish, isn't it?
But I can't help it.
I understand.
Roy wouldn't.
May I ask you a very personal question?
Yes.
Do you love Roy?
No, not really.
Not the way Roy wants me to love him.
I can't.
Roy's love means marriage and children... and never anyone but Roy.
I couldn't bear that.
I wanna be free.
I wanna be gay and have fun.
Life's short, and I wanna live while I'm alive.
I know, that...
that's the way I feel too.
I...
I think I'd better go.
Must you?
I really should.
Pull.
Cold in here now, isn't it?
Have you a match?
Why so gloomy?
God, I'm rotten.
I can't see it.
Can't you?
Well, then you're rotten too.
What do you mean?
And Roy worships you.
You!
Well?
Don't you make yourself sick...
you and Roy.
God, that's funny.
Get out of here!
Don't worry.
I can't get out fast enough.
Get out!
And stay out!
Where have you been?
Oh, I, uh...
I stopped at a... at a bar after I took Helen home.
Oh.
How'd you like her?
Oh, she's all right.
Pass in a crowd, eh?
I daresay she would.
Just what do you mean by that?
Listen, Roy, let me tell you something.
Even if it hurts.
Yes?
I wouldn't be so idealistic about Helen if I were you.
And why not?
Well, I...
I just wouldn't, that's all.
Well, why not?
Oh, I don't know.
Forget it.
Never mind crawling.
Out with it.
Listen, Roy, I tell you.
Women are all the same.
You look at every woman as a barmaid.
You don't know anything about decent women.
Oh, all right.
You know it all then.
Oh, you've said enough.
Shut up.
Karl.
Karl!
Zep overhead!
- South by east.
- Righto!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Right.
All lights out, sir.
Lights out, quick!
Zeppelin overhead!
Zeppelin overhead!
Everybody out!
Hey, come on, Monte.
Zeppelin overhead.
Come on, Monte.
What's the matter with you?
Get up.
We don't all have to go.
I'm tired.
Oh, shut up.
- Come on.
Let's go.
Hurry up.
Come on.
- Be right with you, Elliot.
Come on, Monte.
Get up.
Come on.
Let's go.
Hurry.
All right.
Karl...
Karl.
Danke.
Well, so long there, Tommy.
All right, old chap.
Good luck, Elliot.
Go get 'em, Monte.
Good-bye.
Good luck, Roy.
Right.
Perfect.
Look, Roy, there she goes.
Let's go.
Kapitän?
Kapitän.
Kapitän!
Kapitän!
Kapitän!
Jawohl!
Hey, Roy, they've hit our motor.
Cut the gas.
We'll burn to death!
Roy!
Oh, shut up!
Well, this is a mess, all right.
Yeah, just our luck.
Lucky we weren't both killed.
Well, we're through.
Herr Kapitän.
Look at it, Monte.
Roy, it's falling!
Look at that, Roy.
Great, isn't it?
They're done for.
Look out!
Run!
Just a minute.
Why the blazes don't you look where you're going, sir?
I'm sorry, sir.
Isn't it customary to salute one's superior officer?
Thank you.
What is your name, sir?
Lieutenant Roy Rutledge.
Make a note of that.
Yes, sir.
Would you like to try it and find out?
They are.
They glisten in the sun.
What the hell you trying to do?
It took me three hours to write that.
You're nothing but a pest anyhow.
Sit down.
Oh, don't, Bruce.
You shouldn't smoke so many.
What difference does it make?
You know it's bad for you.
Buy a chocolate, miss.
Change, miss.
Please.
That's a good boy.
What a life it would be married to you.
Oh, you don't fancy it?
Beastly.
No smokes.
Think of all the money we'd save.
What would we spend it on?
Oh, a diamond dog collar.
For me?
No.
I'd buy a muzzle for you.
You wouldn't spoil my beautiful mustache, would you?
No.
We'd keep that in the parlor under glass.
Hello, Helen.
Oh, hello, Roy.
Roy, I'd like you to meet Captain Redfield.
Lieutenant Rutledge.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Beastly weather.
Yes, isn't it.
- You'll get used to it.
- Thanks.
Gee, it's great to see you again, Helen.
It's been four whole days.
Really?
- Have you been over long?
- Three weeks.
Oh.
Three weeks.
Everything all right up your way?
Oh, yes.
Your squadron near here?
Twenty miles up the line.
Twenty miles.
That far.
- You chaps have it rather soft, haven't you?
- Do you think so?
Well, I mean to say being able to dash about the countryside and all that.
Wish I'd picked the R.F.C.
Well, why didn't you?
Roy.
Well, I must be going.
Oh.
Don't go.
I think I'd better.
Good-bye, Helen, and don't forget your promise.
I won't.
Who's that bag of wind?
Would you mind not talking about my friends like that?
Oh, now, Helen, please.
Oh, you were perfectly beastly to him.
I'm terribly sorry.
Guess my nerves are a bit raw.
Things haven't been so easy this last week.
Oh, you've been fighting?
Did you shoot down any Boche?
Yes.
I managed to get a couple.
Really?
How thrilling.
Tell me about it.
Well, there's really nothing much to tell.
Three bars of chocolate, miss.
Oh, Jymes.
Oh, Jymes.
Bread, Jymes.
We want bread.
We want bread!
Coming, sir.
Coming!
Did you ever try hurrying, Jymes?
Sorry, sir, but I stopped to dig a few of the cockroaches out of it, sir.
Well, put it down.
Well, where's the bread?
Did you ever try hurrying, sir?
Jymes, more bread.
Drown the cockroaches this time.
Yes, sir.
Jymes, what's the taste in this soup?
I can't say, sir.
It's not soup, it's soap.
I think it's shoe polish.
Sorry, sir.
Cook said the soup was a bit weak tonight.
Maybe you taste the disinfectant in the water, sir.
Oh.
Well, strike me blind, it's a hair.
Wash it off and wear it, Baldy.
Hello, you chaps.
Hello, Monte.
How goes it?
Still no news of Harry?
No.
Somebody always gets it on the night patrol.
What do you think, Marryat?
You saw it happen.
Is there any chance he got down alive?
No, I don't think so.
The searchlights got him.
We were flying low and they heard us.
We started to climb, but it was too late.
Shrapnel began bursting all around him.
Two bursts caught him and he started to drop.
It was awful to see him down there, twisting and diving... crippled, always dropping.
Trying every way to get clear of those lights.
Then another burst got him.
We could hear him screaming...
Stop!
I can't stand it.
Good thing he took your place, Rutledge.
You might've got it instead of him.
Oh, I'll get it sooner or later.
We'll all get it.
Isn't there any end to this?
Oh, shut up.
You're always whining.
Shut up yourself.
Who'll make me?
I'll make you.
Sit down, Jack, and be quiet.
All right.
What's the matter with you fellas?
Would anybody like to take Monte's place on tonight's patrol?
Lay off.
No more soup.
We need some.
No more soup.
We need some soup.
Jymes!
Hurry it up.
Splendid.
Splendid, Jymes.
Splendid.
That's what comes from hurrying.
What was dinner before you dropped it, Jymes?
A tasty bit of salmon, sir.
Sewer trout again?
Hasn't the cook anything else?
Well, sir, there's that tin of pork and beans.
No, we don't want that.
Can he do anything with the garbage?
Oh, well, never mind.
We aren't hungry, are we?
Coffee, Jymes.
Yes, sir.
And, Jymes.
Yes, sir?
Don't let anything hurry you.
No, sir.
Drinking again?
You dirty louse!
Hey, Baldy.
The sooner you get shot down, the better.
Baldy, darling.
Now that didn't hurt, Baldy.
Monte!
What's the matter with you?
Attention.
As you were.
The following officers will report for night patrol.
Drayton.
Yes, sir.
Fuller.
Here, sir.
Maloney.
Oh, no.
Not an old baldheaded man like me up there in the cold, cold air.
Perhaps Fritz will warm it up for you.
Neville.
Here, sir.
Monte Rutledge.
Monte Rutledge.
I don't feel very well tonight, sir.
That's all right, boy.
None of us feel well.
But you don't understand.
I think I do, Rutledge.
But I say, sir.
You don't understand.
Th-There seems to be something the matter with me.
I know what's the matter with him.
He's yellow.
Oh, shut up.
Oh, let's say it.
Didn't Harry go west last night because he took this man's place?
Keep quiet, Jack.
I will not keep quiet.
He's yellow and we all know it.
That's a lie!
I'm not yellow.
I can see things as they are, that's all.
I'm sick of this rotten business.
You fools.
Why do you let them kill you like this?
What are you fighting for?
Patriotism.
Duty.
Are you mad?
Can't you see they're just words?
Words coined by politicians and profiteers to trick you into fighting for them.
What's a word compared with life...
the only life you've got.
I'll give 'em a word.
Murder!
That's what this dirty rotten politician's war is.
Murder!
You know it as well as I do.
Yellow, am I?
You're the ones that are yellow.
I've got guts to say what I think.
You're afraid to say it.
So afraid to be called yellow, you'd rather be killed first.
You fools!
You poor, stupid fools.
Oh, Monte.
Now, pull yourself together, will ya?
Stand up, Rutledge!
I've taken a lot of shirking from you since we came out here, but this is a bit too much.
Sir, he really is ill.
You're a disgrace to your squadron.
Go to your quarters.
Yes, sir.
Have a cigarette.
You don't think I'm yellow, do you, Roy?
Why, of course not.
You're just more sensitive than the rest of us.
I wonder.
Well, stop thinking about it.
I wish I could.
Haven't I been up twice on the night patrol?
I'm trying to do my share.
Of course you are now.
You...
You must be pretty well fed up with me after all this.
Oh, that's rot.
I
- I'm not yellow.
I'm not!
Oh, now, Monte.
Come on.
Pull yourself together.
Staff Colonel.
Everybody out.
Come on, Monte.
Stand easy.
Well, men, I don't like what I have to say, but let's face it, you all know the central munition dump at Spraug.
You've tried three times to bomb that depot without success.
No fault of yours, of course, they've guarded it too closely.
That munition depot at Spraug must be destroyed tomorrow morning.
Now, then, today a German bombing plane was forced down within our lines.
We were lucky enough to capture it before they had a chance to destroy it.
We've fixed it up so it'll fly.
We want to use this plane to bomb the Spraug depot.
There's no question that the venture will succeed this time.
The enemy won't suspect one of their own planes until after the depot is bombed.
Then when they discover the trick, well, you... you may have a little difficulty in getting back.
I need two men to fly this plane.
I'll go, sir.
Are you sure you wanna go?
Quite sure, sir.
Very well.
I'll go with him, sir.
Who are these men?
Lieutenants Monte and Roy Rutledge, sir.
Brothers, eh?
Dismissed.
Now, young men,
I want you to realize how important this is.
The Seventh Brigade has been ordered to go over the top in a surprise attack tomorrow evening at dusk.
The brigade doesn't know it, but I
- I'm afraid they're going to be slaughtered.
There's too much artillery in front of us.
If you destroy that munition depot early tomorrow morning, it will weaken the enemy artillery, and we may be able to get through.
Hundreds of lives depend on you.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Now, another thing.
The plane you are to fly... is far too dangerous a piece of armament to let the enemy recapture it.
It must return or be destroyed.
If you were captured, you'd be shot as spies anyway.
Baldy.
Oh, Baldy?
You'll take the morning patrol in towards Spraug as far as you can.
You might possibly help them get back.
By all means.
Yes, sir.
You'll get your maps and final instructions just before taking off.
Report to the field at 3:00 a. m.
Until then, let them do as they please.
- Yes, sir. 3:00, you two.
- Yes, sir.
Good luck.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
- What time is it, Monte?
- Ten past 9:00.
Helen's canteen closes at 10:00.
We've just enough time to get there.
- Do you think they'll let us have the motorcycle?
- Why, of course.
We're "it" tonight.
Yeah.
We're "it" all right.
Not sorry, are you?
Oh, let's not talk about it.
I'm not even gonna think about it until 3:00.
What's your program?
Wine, women and song?
Oh, perhaps I'll do without the song tonight.
- See you at Grosson's?
- Either there or at Jacques across the street.
- Wherever you hear the most noise.
- Don't you wanna come in with me to see Helen?
Oh, I better not.
Righto.
Where's Helen?
She's gone out.
Oh.
Was she expecting you?
No.
Would you care to leave a note?
Yes, I think I will.
Pen and ink on the table.
You'll see that she gets this?
Oh, yes.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
Hello.
What's up?
She isn't in.
That's tough.
Wanna come along with me?
Where to?
Grosson's.
Righto.
Your switch on?
- Helen.
- Well, if it isn't old Roy.
Old solemn Roy himself.
Sit down, Roy.
Sit on the floor and hang your legs over.
- Take your hands off her.
- Oh, I can't take my hands off.
You heard what I said.
Take your hands off her.
Who asked you to this party anyway?
Helen, let me take you home.
Home?
Who wants to go home?
I'm having a marvelous time.
I was until you came in.
I advise you to get out before you're kicked out.
Keep your...
Keep your filthy hands off of my girl.
Your girl.
You fool.
I wouldn't belong to you if you were the last man on Earth.
You're nothing to me.
Nothing.
Come on, Roy.
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
Oh, let's have it out.
I don't love you.
I never have.
I never had any fun with you anyway.
You and your high ideals.
You're too good to live.
You're just a stupid prig if you ask me.
You make me sick, do you hear?
Sick.
Now, get out here.
I hate the sight of you!
Come on, Roy.
Let's go across the street.
Sweet, sweet baby.
Handsome, big, strong baby.
N'est-ce pas?
Mmm, n'est-ce pas, kiss Papa, huh?
Oh, baby.
Hello, chèri.
Aw, don't take it so hard, Roy.
Forget it.
Is your friend sick?
No.
He'll be all right.
Drink up, Roy.
I still can't believe it.
You just don't know anything about women.
They're all the same.
I've been telling you that for years.
Maybe you'll believe me now.
- Oh, Helen's not that sort.
- Oh, nonsense.
- It's the war.
She's changed.
- You're wrong, Roy.
War doesn't change people.
It's...
It's like getting drunk.
It brings out what people really are.
You can't make me believe Helen was like that before.
Well, she was.
I've known it all along.
You too?
Oh, I'm sorry, Roy.
Don't take it so hard.
She isn't worth it.
- I suppose you're right.
- Of course I'm right.
Listen, Roy, never love a woman.
Just make love to her.
You see, like this.
Look.
Go ahead, Roy.
Try it.
That's the way.
Oh!
What you do, baby?
All wet!
No, no, no, no!
Imbecile!
Aw, baby.
Voilà.
Hey, listen, Monte.
Monte.
Go easy.
We gotta go up at 3:00.
Oh, listen, Roy.
To hell with this 3:00 business.
What do you mean?
Just that.
To hell with it.
Say, you're crazy, Monte.
We can't get out of it now.
Oh, why can't we?
Listen, Roy, all this idealistic stuff won't get you anywhere.
You tried it on Helen and what happened?
You got a kick in the face.
You can't go through life thinking the way you do.
People take advantage of you and make a fool of you the way she did.
- It's beginning to look as though you're right.
- Of course I'm right.
I was right about Helen, and now I'm right about this 3:00 business too.
This is another thing entirely, Monte.
Why is it?
They're just taking advantage of you in another way, that's all.
It's chaps like you that are meat for them.
All they gotta do is make it sound heroic, and you fall for it.
Listen, Roy, what's the difference if we don't go?
- But we can't get out of it now.
- Why can't we?
Listen, tell 'em...
tell 'em the motorcycle broke down.
Tell 'em anything.
What do you say, Roy?
Well...
Come on, old ooo-la-la.
Oh, no, no, no, chèri.
Oh, baby.
N'est-ce pas?
Oh, oui, oui, madam.
Oh, baby.
Oh, stop looking at your watch, Roy.
You're not going anywhere.
Yes, I am and so are you.
Who says I am?
Listen, Monte, we're a little drunk and we've been talking wildly.
There's no way out of this and we know it.
Come on, Monte.
No, no.
Let me alone.
Come on, old ooo-la-la.
Monte.
Why, they'd court-martial us in a minute if we didn't show up.
Why, that's desertion, Monte.
They shoot people for that.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
Come on.
I suppose you're right.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Monte.
What a pair of fools we are.
Let's go.
Easy, now.
Easy.
Look out for the firing pin.
Righto.
I got it.
Contactor.
Contact.
Ground speed here.
Keep this site trained on the target.
Then pull the release when you hit the stop.
Do you understand?
Don't forget the leveler.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Contactor.
Contact.
Remember this ship weighs 20,000 pounds.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Roy, the depot.
Roy, look there!
They've seen us.
They're coming on.
For Christ's sake.
Hey, Roy, look.
They hit our right motor.
I got him!
Roy!
Look over there.
It's our squadrons.
They're coming!
Roy, they've gone.
Jesus.
Son of a Boche.
Hey!
It's me!
Hey!
It's me!
Goddamn it!
It's old Baldy.
Hey!
Baldy.
Hello.
It's Baldy.
Look, Roy.
It's Baldy.
You see that guy?
Good old Baldy.
Good boy.
See that?
He's got him.
Hey, look.
He's got him.
He's got him.
Oh.
Look.
They've changed around.
Our strut's gone.
That son of a bitch.
Roy, he got us!
Roy!
Go down!
Go down!
Go down!
One more for Baldy!
No more control?
Pull her up!
Oh, my God!
We're on fire!
We're burning!
Roy, get down!
Do something!
Roy!
Ah, so.
We meet again.
It was you who bombed the depot at Spraug, nicht wahr?
Yes.
And you were flying a German plane, nicht wahr?
- Yes.
- Very clever.
It is a pity you must take your congratulations from me.
There are a few questions I must ask you.
If you answer them simply, it will be easy for you.
To what squadron of the Royal Flying Corps are you attached?
Just why were you sent to bomb that munition depot this morning?
It was our natural target.
But possibly it was to clear the way for a little surprise attack, huh?
You are surprised.
We know all about it, so you need not be afraid to talk.
Now, please, when and where is the attack to be made?
Oh, you are stupid not to tell.
It is nothing.
For you the war is over, nicht wahr?
We are friends.
Hmm.
Listen, if you tell me,
I will see that you are sent to a special camp reserved only for certain prisoners of war.
It's near Munich.
Far away from all this.
You will have every comfort.
And in a few months from now when the war is over, you will be alive and in good health, which is more than most of us will be able to say.
So, you see?
It can be easy for you.
Now, please.
So, you will not tell?
Possibly you do not know that flying a German plane... is the same as wearing a German uniform.
Any disguised soldier is a spy, nicht wahr?
And you know what happens to spies?
I think you two friends had better talk it over.
I will give you 15 minutes.
If you change your mind and tell, good.
If not, you will be shot.
Do you think he was bluffing?
No, he wasn't bluffing.
He's the man I was to fight that duel with.
Really?
Quite a coincidence.
He's got it in for me.
Nah, he's probably forgotten it by this time.
The brigade will be going over pretty soon, Monte.
Yes.
Roy, look.
Oh, save it to wipe your nose on.
God, what nerve.
Roy.
Roy, I can't face it.
I'm going to tell.
Don't be a fool, Monte.
Do you realize what it would mean if we told?
It would mean being alive when this bloody war's over.
But, Monte, you can't.
To hell with your heroic stuff.
I wanna live.
I'm not gonna be shot down like that.
I'm going to tell.
Wait a minute.
Monte.
But I...
Listen.
Let me go.
You?
Yes.
You're all upset.
I'll bargain with him, and perhaps I won't have to tell him everything.
I
- I'll come with you.
No.
You said he's got it in for you.
Now, let me do it alone.
All right.
Tell the general I'm ready to talk.
Good.
Come.
Ah, yes.
So, you have changed your mind?
Yes.
My friend will never tell, but I wanna live.
I'm ready to talk.
You are very wise.
Now, please, draw a rough map for me showing your positions, brigade numbers, disposition, hour of attack, purpose, number of men.
Wait a minute.
I'll tell only on one condition.
Ah, so, a condition.
Yes.
If I give this information, my friend will know it.
Back home after the war, he'll tell everyone that I was a traitor.
You leave that to me.
Why not let me have that satisfaction?
What do you mean?
I do not understand.
One does not kill a friend.
Friend.
He's not my friend.
He stole the girl I love and I hate him.
Huh.
History repeats itself.
You make rather hard terms.
I'll tell only on that condition.
One bullet.
What if I miss?
Give me two to make sure.
No.
A good soldier will need only one.
Very well.
Not so fast.
He will give you the bullet outside.
Well?
I didn't tell, Monte.
Why?
What happened?
Has he changed his mind?
No.
Don't you think you can go through with it now?
What do you mean?
Of course we can.
It won't even hurt.
It'll all be over in a second.
We can stand anything for a second.
No, no, Roy.
L-I can't do it.
I'm going to tell.
Listen, Monte.
We tell, the whole brigade will be wiped out.
Three thousand men, and they all want to live too.
You wouldn't spoil their chances, would you?
That's not my business.
I didn't start this war.
I didn't get them into this mess.
Let 'em take care of themselves.
They'll get wiped out sooner or later anyway.
I wanna live.
Live!
You won't tell, I'll tell.
Listen, Monte!
I'll tell!
I'll tell!
Let me out!
I'll tell everything I know.
The brigade is moving up.
They're going to attack...
Oh.
Roy.
Oh, Monte.
Monte.
Monte.
Monte.
Don't cry, Roy.
It was the only thing you could do.
The brigade, Roy.
Yes, Monte?
They'll be all right now, won't they?
Yes.
Who's that?
It's the general.
You...
You thought we'd tell, didn't you?
Good old Roy.
You won't tell, and I... forgotten... it all.
Oh, Roy.
Roy.
Yes?
Where are you?
Don't go away, Roy.
I'm here, Monte.
Can't you feel me holding you?
Hello, Karl.
Fig eights.
Cold up here in the night patrol.
Awful to be in the dark.
Oh.
I'm afraid.
Look out.
Look out!
We're falling!
We're going to crash!
Do something, Roy!
Quick!
Quick!
Quick!
It's all right, Monte.
Monte?
It's all right.
Monte?
Monte.
Oh.
Well?
You heard what my brother said.
Your brother?
I'll never tell you anything.
Achtung!
I'll be with you in just a minute, Monte.
Come on, you Seventh Brigade.
We got 'em now.

Out this way.
I hate to see a young fellow like you in here for manslaughter.
It was an accident, sir.
Yes, I remember your case very well.
-You ran a man down with your car...
-Yes, sir, It was New Year's Eve...
You were drunk.
-Yes, sir.
-Now you're here to pay for that crime... with ten years of your life.
Do you realize that?
Yes, sir.
Your sentence can be reduced by good behavior and close observance of the prison rules.
While you're not in the common sense of the word a criminal,
I want to warn you against the influences you'll encounter here... or In any other prison.
Yes, sir.
So you be careful of your conduct... and your associations.
Yes, sir.
And remember this.
Prison does not give a man a yellow streak.
but if he has one, it brings it out.
That's all.
Well, Raggart, what is it?
Do you know who they're putting that boy in with?
No.
Who?
Morgan.
The slickest crook we ever had here.
And Machine Gun Butch.
Yes?
A weak kid like that thrown in with a murderer and a gun man?
Now, now, Pop, don't you get chicken-hearted again.
He might have a chance in a cell alone.
Yes, I warned them at the last governor's council.
We have 3,000 here and cell accommodations for 1800.
They all want to throw people into prison but they don't want to provide for them after they are in.
And you mark my word, Pop.
Someday we're going to pay for this shortsightedness.
Sure, the whole prison system is cockeyed.
-Yeah?
-Here's a peach for you, Sandy.
-Goes In 265 with Butch and Morgan.
-Okay.
Come on, boy.
Upstairs to the left.
Here we are.
Hello, Jim.
Take off your ear muffs.
I said hello.
Hello.
Make yourself at home.
That's your flop up there.
Thank you.
What's your name?
I said what's your name?
Kent Marlowe.
Mine's Schmidt.
I'm known the world over as Machine Gun Butch.
You heard of me.
That's a cinch.
You never heard of the Delancey gang being wiped out?
Well, I done the wiping'.
$500 bucks for bumping off three.
That ain't much, it's cheap.
What's your racket?
What you in for?
-Manslaughter.
-Manslaughter!
Well, you ain't no morning glory after all.
Press the flesh.
Who did you croak?
-It was an accident.
-An accident?
Yeah, I was driving a car...
-Oh, you're all wet ears.
Your nose ain't even dry.
-What do you mean?
-I'll show you what I mean, kid.
I'll learn you a lot of things before we're through with you in here.
Morg, there's company in the parlor.
Morgan is my name.
Kent's mine.
How are you?
Don't you ever have any air in here?
Sure, plenty.
All hot.
How long have you been here?
Three years.
-What for?
-Robbery.
I can't stand thieves.
-Hey, my cigarettes.
-What?
You took my cigarettes.
Why, you dirty little liar, you didn't have no cigarettes.
Yes, I did, and you stole them.
Stop your belly aching before I slough you one.
Come on, give me back those cigarettes.
You're dingy, you didn't have no cigarettes.
Give me those cigarettes!
-Oh, get out!
-I'll show you crooks
I won't stand for treatment like this.
Hey, guards!
Stop your squawking.
Crooks, are we?
-Well, Mr. High Hat, I'll show...
-Let go of me!
Pipe down, pipe down...
Hey, hey, what's wrong in here?
-He took my cigarettes.
-Did he, Morgan?
I don't know, sir.
I was asleep.
Did you take the kid's cigarettes?
No, sir...
They're both lying!
Less noise or you'll spend your first night in the dungeon.
Aw, don't put the kid in the cooler.
He's clean.
He just went off his nuts.
He won't do it again.
Well, you watch your stuff, understand?
Well, mister yellowbelly, you're gonna get your first lesson right now.
You can't squeal and in stir.
That's that.
Now lay off that stuff, Butch, do you hear?
Aw, he's only stunned.
I didn't bat him hard.
-Put him in his bunk.
-Yeah?
Yeah.
Okay.
Now give him back his cigarettes.
-What?
-You heard me.
Why, I ain't got his old weeds.
Don't lie to me, Butch.
Say, listen, I bumped off guys for calling me a liar.
Yeah, and look where you are now.
-Who me?
-Yes, you.
Well, look where you are too.
That's right, Butch, both of us.
The quick and the dead, the clever and the dumb.
What?
You know, from the neck down you're a regular guy, Butch.
Now give the kid back his cigarettes.
-Who me?
-Yes, you.
Okay.
I was only kidding.
-Just kidding, that's all.
-Sure, I knew that all the time.
Now put them up in his pocket.
I said put them up in his pocket.
Gee!
It reminds me of Sadie.
Gee, Sadie was a good old skirt.
I shouldn't have slipped her that ant poison.
I should've just battered her in the jaw a few times.
-Get off of my stones, will ya?
-Get back into line there.
You got everything all set?
Sure, this time...
We heard you're slated to get out soon.
What do you mean?
Who told you that?
Jim, the trusty over at the warden's office.
He's in on everything.
And he heard something about me?
Yeah, the warden said you're too nice a kid to keep here.
-They're gonna let me go?
-Sure they are.
How soon?
Just as soon as the warden gets the ok from the governor.
-Gee, you're a lucky guy.
-Are you Kent Marlowe?
-Yeah.
-Wallace wants to see you.
What does he want to see me for?
To tell you the good news, that you've been pardoned.
Gee, that's great.
Wait a minute.
Aren't you gonna say good bye?
Sure, good bye.
Be good, Kent.
So long, kid.
Hey, where are you heading?
-Captain Wallace wants to see me.
-You can't go in there.
Get back.
What's going on out here?
They said you wanted to see me, sir, about my parole.
Who said that?
They did, that trusty over there...
It's true, isn't It?
They weren't ribbing me, were they?
Sure, they're kidding you, Kent.
Then I'm not going out.
No, you're going to be with us for a long time.
Go on, beat it.
Sore are you?
What's the matter, boy?
Are you going home?
Hey, you.
No ganging up here.
Come on, keep this place clear.
Scatter out.
Hey, Pop, any letters for me?
Move on, now.
If there was, I wouldn't give them to you.
Oh, go on, be a sport, will you?
Are there any letters for Morgan?
You know, Pop, if all screws were like you...
Oh, you cut out the apple sauce.
And don't be calling the guards screws.
Yes, sir.
No letters for you, Morgan.
But I've got one for Butch and Kent.
Fine, I'll take them to them.
Thanks, Pop.
-I used to milk a cow all the time.
-Letter for you, Butch.
-Letter for me?
-Yes, you.
Gee, why don't those dames let me alone?
You're such a deal, Butch.
You can't blame them.
Where's Kent?
Haven't seen him.
Hey, stick around.
I'll bet this is a hot one.
Oh, boy.
Look at that.
Why, it's from Myrtle.
-Myrtle?
-Yeah.
-I thought you croaked her.
-No, that was Sadie.
This girl is nuts about me.
-About you?
-Yes, me.
Wait a minute, I'll show you.
"Dear sweetheart..."
"How I miss my great big boy."
"You have it."
Hot doggy.
"The only fun I get is sleeping... because then I dream about you every night."
The rest of this is too juicy for you guys.
Nobody gets to read this but me and my pal Morg.
Come on, Morg.
Aw, come on.
Go on, dream about it.
I'm going to read this.
You and me, Morg.
Hey, come on, scram.
-Hey, what's the big idea?
-Get out of here, go on, go on.
Say, Morg...
Who do you suppose would write me a letter?
I'll read It to you, Butch.
Say, if I even knew a dame called Myrtle,
I'd kick her teeth out.
Go on, read it.
Who's it from?
Well, it's about your mother, Butch.
-My old lady?
-Yeah.
Gee, she's been holding out on me.
I didn't even know she could write.
Well, It isn't from her, Butch.
It's from a guy named Tony Loop.
-It's about...
-Nothing wrong.
Go on, read it.
"Dear Butch, when your mother was sick,
"She didn't want me to write no letter and tell you,
"Even when they took her to the county hospital.
"I went to see her a couple of times,
"And she said you had enough to worry
"Without having to think about her.
"Anyway, she...
"She died yesterday.
"And as we couldn't get enough money to give her a send-off,
"we had to let the hospital take care of it.
"Anyway, we sent her a bunch of flowers,
"And I guess that's all.
Yours truly, Tony Loop."
Gee, I can't believe it, Morg.
Ma's dead.
-I wonder if it hurt her much.
-Oh, I don't think so, Butch.
-She probably just dropped off quietly.
-Yeah?
Yeah, she was pretty old, wasn't she?
About 70...
And as big as a minute...
And game.
And, say, the last time I was arrested,
She fought like a wildcat.
It took two bulls to hold her, and she almost bit the thumb off of one of them.
Gee, she was a swell old lady.
I wish you would have met her, Morg.
So do I, Butch.
Say, Morg...
I'm going to make a break.
I'm going to get out of here, and I'm going to give that little old lady the swellest funeral she ever had.
Pipe down, will you?
Here comes Oliver.
Hello, Morgan.
Got a match?
Sure.
Thanks.
Good news, Butch?
Bad news whenever you come around.
Great kidder, isn't he, Morg?
Yes, and he's not always kidding.
You know, that guy's a stool pigeon if ever there was one.
I wish I could get the lowdown on him.
I'll knife him someday.
Aw, that kind of talk won't get you anywheres.
I'm going to break this place wide open.
Yeah, and then what will happen to you?
Down in the dungeon with the rats.
No, we got to take our medicine, Butch.
It's all right for you to talk, you'll be going out of here in a few years.
But what do I gain eating this dirt?
I'd go nuts if I didn't start trouble once in a while.
I'd rather stand up and fight, and even if I got the rope,
It's better than sitting here rotting in this stinking hole.
Aw, cut out that talk, Butch, do you hear?
-Who, me?
-Yes, you.
Okay.
I was only kidding.
Sure.
Hey, listen, Butch.
How about that hot number of yours?
The gang wants to hear it again.
Go on, read it.
All right, I'll read it once more.
Seen Kent around anywhere?
Yeah.
He's around the corner with Oliver.
What about Morgan?
Morgan?
Who knows anything about him?
But Butch...
listen, Oliver.
That guy will kill me someday.
-He packs a knife.
-Oh, he packs a knife, does he?
Don't let that worry you.
That knife's gonna get him into trouble.
Say, listen, you guys.
If I ever catch either one of you double-crossing Butch,
I'm going to get you.
Do you understand?
-Now, Kent, you keep away from this rat.
-What do you mean?
He's the only guy that's been decent to me since I've been here.
I was only trying to give him some good advice.
Yeah?
Well, beat it, do you hear?
I'll give you some good advice, Kent.
You're in a tough spot.
But you've got to learn that whining and double-crossing isn't going to get you anywhere.
I'm not whining.
I won't stand for your ribbing.
What right have they got to poke at me...
And you, a robber, bragging about it?
Oh, I see.
Too good for the rest of us, huh?
Well, if you're wise, you'll stand up and take your joe like a regular guy.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Here's a letter for you.
Get wise, kid.
Play up to Morgan and Butch.
They run the joint here, and if they're off you, they'll make it tough for you.
If you're friends with them, they'll let you in on their plans.
What do you mean?
I'll tell you later.
Oh, I wouldn't do that.
Kid, you trust me.
I'm your friend.
These three dames were crazy about me, see.
Say, Butch...
Butch, I had a dream last night.
Aw, cut It out.
You're full of hop.
A dame said to me, she said, "if you'll come up...
I...
I...
I was sitting on a velvet cushion,
And--and about a thousand beautiful blue-eyed blondes was dancing all around me.
Aw, gee, I'd go nutty over a rag doll.
Hey, look.
Ohh...
look!
Look.
A beautiful butterfly!
Aw, you're crazy.
That's a racehorse.
Look at that sucker run.
I bet he'll make to the top of the wall in 10 seconds.
Say, look at the build on that filly.
I'll take the thin one, Butch.
This is mine.
Say, what'll you bet my racehorse can't trim that one of yours?
You're on.
Hey, Mr. Butch, I'll hold the stakes.
Yeah, who's gonna hold you?
Come on, get up your cigarettes.
Let's have a race here.
Come on, put them out there.
All right, you boys, make your bets.
I'll cover all your bets.
Two packs of weeds on my thin one.
All right, make all your bets.
Cover this, Butch.
I'm betting on Morgan's bug.
Come on.
Get in there.
I'm covering.
Say, listen, you... what about these?
No, you...you can't because The Hawk gave me this to buy him a pair of s-s-suspenders with, and if I don't bring them back, he'll tear my head off.
Aw, come on.
Get in there with them.
Oh, yeah. s-s-s-sure.
All right.
Come on, now.
All right, come on, now, give me the bugs.
I'll warm them up.
All right.
Here you go.
Watch them run.
You all ready?
You all set?
All right, there they go.
Look at him go.
Look at that bug go.
Hey, Butch, your b-b-b-bug
There he goes.
Over the line, over the line.
I win.
I win.
That's just too bad.
Chewing gum.
I say, no wonder that bug couldn't run.
Chewing gum, eh?
Who done that?
Come on.
What porch-climbing crook done that?
You did.
-Who, me?
-Yes, you.
What's the big idea?
You wouldn't double-cross a pal, would you, Butch?
Any more of you guys think I pulled a phony?
-You, Joe?
-Not me.
-You, Putnam?
-N-No.
-You can't get away with that, Butch.
-No?
You're asking for it, ain't you?
One wiggle out of you and I'll give it to you.
Listen, you guys are liable to get the hole for this.
Yeah, you'll get the hole, just 5' 10".
They'll have to dig it big enough for two.
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah!
Look out, Butch!
Ditch that knife.
Here comes Wallace.
Well, what's coming off here?
Me and Morgan was just rassling a bit, sir.
Sure you weren't mixing up a little fighting with it, huh?
Who, me?
No, sir.
You better not, or I'll fix up a lot of dark days for you.
-Gambling, huh?
-No, sir.
Not me.
How did those cigarettes and tobacco get here?
Well, uh...
I was packing them in my shirt, sir, and Morgan and me starts rassling, and I get sweaty, so I lay them out on the ground to dry.
-Don't lie to me.
-I wouldn't lie, no, sir.
-Let them alone.
-What's that you said?
I said, yes, sir.
Another move out of you, and you'll go to the dungeon.
-Who did that?
-I did, wrestling with Butch.
Well, the next time I see you, you better have it fixed.
You get me?
Bring that stuff.
I hate his guts.
It's a good thing I warned you.
If Wallace had seen that knife...
Yeah.
You ain't such a bad skunk as I thought you was.
-Get a move on, all of you!
-I'll move.
I'll move.
I'll move...
Fish again.
-That dirty, rotten, stinkin' codfish.
-Yeah.
It's spoiled.
Oh, look!
It's so terrible it's even killed one of our poor little b-b-bu-- ...cockroaches.
Ohh...
Nice tenderloin steak with mushrooms all over it, gee!
I'd like to ram it down their throat.
-Pipe down, Wallace.
You talking, Butch?
Who, me?
No, sir.
-I'll get him someday.
-He's on the hunt, Butch.
Tell the guys to pipe down.
Pipe down.
Pipe down.
I can't eat that stuff!
Who did that?
Me!
What do you think of that?
I want some food.
I don't want any more of this swill!
-Shut up!
-You give me some food to eat!
-I'm not going to eat that junk!
-Shut up, all of you!
Come on, now!
Come on!
Give us some food!
I ain't afraid of your guns!
I ain't afraid of nobody!
Come on, you yellowbellies!
Let's show 'em!
That volley went against the wall.
The next time, shoot to kill!
Butch, sit down!
-Yellowbellies!
Cowards!
-Sit down, Butch!
It's your last chance!
Cover all the entrances.
Listen to me, you men.
I have treated you squarely, and you know it.
If you got any grievances within my power to correct,
You can't gain anything by starting a row like this.
So I'm warning you for the last time.
I'm running this show, and I'm ready for you.
That's all.
Wallace!
Who started this?
Butch.
Take him out!
The knife...
What?
The knife.
Butch, in the aisle.
-Search him!
-I ain't got nothin'.
No hard feelings, see?
-Nothing on him, sir.
-You had a knife.
-Who, me?
-Yes, you!
-No, sir.
Someone's been stringing you.
-In the dungeon!
What for?
I was only kidding.
Sure, I understand.
Well, that little joke will just cost you... 30 days on bread and water in the dark!
Come on.
Move on!
I'm sorry about Butch.
-You're what?
-I say, I'm sorry about Butch.
Yeah?
-Who is it?
-Your lawyer.
-Hello, John.
-Hello, Canton.
What's up?
-Got a little surprise for you.
-Yeah?
Kid, I got good news for you.
You're gonna be paroled.
Yeah?
When?
20 years from now?
Don't be funny.
You're gonna leave this joint tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Aw, quit your kidding.
I'm not kidding.
It's all settled.
Just came from the warden's office.
Yeah?
The next time you'll play it smart.
You say...
Hello, sis.
What's the matter?
You look so pale.
You're not ill, are you?
No, no, but you don't know how terrible it is here.
What have they done to get me out?
I'm sorry, dear.
What do you mean?
We've done everything.
I saw the governor myself.
He was very kind.
He said he couldn't do anything.
What kind of a dame would you like to have me get for you?
Any kind.
How'd you like a little gal like that?
Say, you're a lawyer, not a magician.
Okay, kid.
I'll be around here with a car in the morning to pick you up.
-Fine.
-So long.
Oh, Kent, please.
I know you're big enough to see it through.
You've got to.
But you don't know what It's like In here.
Every hour, every minute...
It's torture.
I'll go crazy.
Honey, but, listen.
You've got to...
Anne, listen.
Tell them to try again.
All right.
All visitors out!
Good-Bye, good-bye, good-bye..
Good-bye.
Bad news, kid?
I got to serve out my full time.
No, you haven't.
If you get the goods on somebody, you get plenty of time off.
And if you block a big job, it may open the gates for you.
Thanks.
How are you?
[Speaking Russian]
Oh, you're going to be a great comfort around here.
-Who's that?
-New guy to take Butch's place.
Doesn't speak any English.
What are you doing?
I'm going out of here tomorrow.
I thought you had another year.
Yeah, I did, but good behavior got me off.
And that's a very good thing for you to remember.
Think of it.
Bright lights, good food, women!
Say, I saw that sister of yours in the visitors' room just now.
Yeah?
Yeah.
That the girl that owns the bookstore?
-Yeah.
-Swell-Looking kid.
You know, I think it's great, Kent, the way your family stick by you.
Gee, I wish I had a family.
I haven't even got a home.
Outside, all of you.
Come on, Rasputin.
Frisking party.
[Speaking Russian]
-[Speaking Russian]
-Shut up!
This your coat, Morgan?
Yes, sir, but that's not my knife.
No.
It's Butch's knife.
You know that.
Smart, eh?
-Trying to cover up Butch.
-No, I wasn't, sir.
You don't think I'd be crazy enough to do a thing like that
-...the day before I go out, do you?
-Shut up!
Well, this'll just cost you your parole.
-Oh, you can't do that, sir.
I tell you, I never saw that knife before.
It was planted on me.
-Ahh...
-I came In the cell, took off my coat, laid it on the bunk.
There was no one In there but this fellow and... and then Kent...
You did that.
-I didn't do it!
-Don't lie to me!
I didn't do it...
I guess the dungeon will cool him off a bit.
Strip him!
I'll get you for this, Kent!
Do you hear me?
I'll get you for this!
-On your way.
-Do you hear me?
I'll get you!
Shut up.
Cell 48.
Hello!
Who are you?
Morgan.
Morgan, they got you?
Yeah.
Where are you, Butch?
Second hole away from you.
What happened?
They found your knife on me.
-My knife?
-Yeah.
You mean it was planted on you.
Who done it?
-Never mind who.
-You tell me, old pal.
I'll get him the first day I'm outside.
I'll get him myself.
Oh!
I knocked over my cup of water!
Oh, forget it, kid!
They'll bring you another cup tomorrow night, the bighearted buzzards!
Can that noise, will you?
Hey, Morg!
When I get out of here, I'm gonna make a break, do you hear me?
Yeah?
Yeah, I'll do it if I have to kill a flock of screws.
How?
-I'm going to use my brains.
-Ha!
Your what?
Well, maybe I ain't got no brains, but I got strength, you hear me?
Sure.
Hey, when my time's up, I'll bet you I'll still be standing on my feet.
-You hear that, Morg?
-Yeah.
And you...
I bet you'll travel out of here feet first.
You know, that's a swell idea.
-Oh, what do you mean, a swell idea?
Use your brain!
# Goin' home...
I'm a goin' home. #
I wish you would go home.
# Quiet life... #
Gee, but he was a s-s-swell guy,
And s-s-smart, too.
One time he d-d-dug himself out from underneath a w-w-wall,
And It took him 18 months to do it in.
Yeah?
What did he do with the dirt?
Oh, he... he ate it.
Well, he s-s-said he did.
Aw, dry up.
That plan of mine would be all right if we had somebody to work it out.
Yeah, Morgan's the guy to do it.
You know, he and Butch finish their stretch in the hole today.
Come out of there, Butch.
Come on, come on, get out of there.
Oh, I'm coming out.
I'm...
Well, I'm still on my feet.
Get Morgan out.
I ain't heard his voice now for a week.
I told him he'd come out of there feet first.
He's flat on his back.
Bring in a stretcher.
Get Tony out.
You dirty screws!
You croaked my pal.
I'll get you for this.
Shut up, or you'll spend 30 days more in the hole.
Morg...
I was only kidding... just kidding, that's all.
Son of a...
-He's just a weak-kneed guy.
-He ain't got no backbone.
But me, I'm on my feet.
-Shut up!
-Take Morgan to the hospital.
Come on.
Let's go.
96.
100.
Slight congestion.
-Doctor?
-Yes?
-Carter has just passed away.
-Carter?
Oh, yes.
Put him in the morgue.
Have the wagon take him away tonight.
Yes, sir.
-Will he be all right, doctor?
-Oh, yes.
Yes, I think so.
Number's 44789.
Watch the Canadian border.
Watch the best hotels.
That's his racket.
That's the first break we've had here in five years.
-We'll get him, though.
-How did he make his getaway?
-Went out in the dead wagons.
-Well done.
I beg your pardon.
Good evening.
Good evening.
If you'll just look around, I'll be with you in a minute.
Thanks.
I'm in no hurry.
-Here's your book, Mr. Garrett.
-How much is that?
$2.00.
$2.00.
-Thank you.
Good night.
-Good night.
Have you found what you wanted?
No, I haven't.
-Well, just what were you looking for?
-A book on the Pacific Islands.
A romance?
No, no.
Something that would give me an idea of the life there.
Oh.
I'm quite sure I have something in a new shipment that came today.
I'll go and get it if you don't mind waiting a few minutes.
Not a bit, no.
May I help?
Why, yes.
Thank you.
I was just going to look in these boxes.
I think the picture... the, uh, travel books are in the bottom one.
Here, let's have a look.
Here. let me help.
Well, thank you.
You don't mind, do you?
Why, no.
Of course not.
It's lovely of you to go to all this... all this trouble.
Not at all.
I'm glad to help.
-You know, it's a fun--
-Stay where you are!
I thought I recognized you, Mr. Morgan.
I saw you in the visitors' room at the prison.
Yes, I remember you, too.
Hello... hello.
Give me... give me Police Headquarters.
Yes, please.
Never mind.
Well, why didn't you go through with it?
Because...
Well, because I just couldn't send you back there, that's all.
You may go now, Mr. Morgan.
I'll take that gun.
Thanks.
Oh, good evening.
Hello, Miss Marlowe.
Oh, excuse me.
I didn't know you had company.
Oh, that's quite all right.
My friend, Mr. Everett, Sergeant Donlin.
-Glad to meet you, Mr. Everett.
-Same here, Sergeant.
Face is kind of familiar.
-Haven't I met you somewhere?
-No, I don't think so, Sergeant.
-No?
-No.
No.
Well, maybe not.
Mr. Everett is one of my best customers.
Is that so?
I thought it was past your closing time till I saw the lights.
Well, it is, but we were unpacking some books.
Oh, I see.
Mrs. Donlin like the book I sent her?
Huh?
Yes.
Well, I have another one that I'm sure she'll be crazy about.
Fine.
I'll get it for you.
It's In the next room.
Don't bother.
She'll drive in tomorrow.
Oh, what's that?
The boys are after someone, I guess.
Well, I'll be running along.
-I'm glad to have met you, Mr...
-Everett.
-Good night, Mr. Everett.
-Good night, Sergeant.
-Good night, Miss Marlowe.
-Good night.
Thanks.
Why did you come here?
To square a bad deal I got from someone in prison.
What do you mean?
Well, I was framed.
They took my parole away from me the day before I was to go free.
Do you know who framed you?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think I know.
Well, good night, Miss Marlowe.
I won't bother you again.
-Are you going away?
-Perhaps.
I don't know.
I think I understand your bitterness.
If you're ever around here again... drop in.
-Oh, you don't mean that.
-Of course I do.
Gee, you're a peach of a girl.
I picked him up one night and trailed him to a bookstore.
-He goes under the name of Everett.
-Everett?
Who is she?
Is she blond?
He's Morgan, all right, all right.
Plenty smart, too.
I lost track of him for a couple of weeks.
When I found him, he was actually working.
I sent out a man to spot him.
That night he quit his job.
Working?
Must be a woman in the case.
Yeah.
I know the woman, too.
Then you got a line on him.
Sure.
I haven't lost one yet, have I?
All right, Eddie.
Let's go.
Hello, Dick, how are you?
Glad to see you.
Where's your sister?
She's in the backyard.
-Hello, Anne.
-Hello, darling.
-How are you?
-Fine.
Good afternoon, everyone.
How are you, Mr. Marlowe?
Oh, fit as a fiddle.
Younger than ever.
Me, too.
-Mrs.
Marlowe, how are you today?
-I'm fine, thank you.
Anne tells me you're going away, Mr. Everett.
-We're going to miss you.
-That's awfully nice of you.
You know, coming here has meant a great deal to me.
Oh, you must stay for dinner.
We're going to have corn bread and fried chicken.
-And strawberry shortcake.
-Better stop.
I'm liable to miss that train.
- Oh, you're not going that soon.
-Yes.
Leaving in an hour.
-Oh, that's too bad.
-Oh...
I know somebody that's going to miss you.
Why, dad!
Don't "why, dad" me.
I wasn't born yesterday.
No.
Me, neither.
She's been sighing around all morning.
I wondered what was the matter.
Now, Dad, I'm ashamed of you.
Come on, John.
Don't listen to him.
-You're so subtle, Dad.
-Yeah, I can't help It.
I...
Oh, now, don't pick on me, Ma.
You love it!
Oh, I'm glad to see Anne happy again.
Well, Anne, I hate to go.
Oh, you'll come back someday.
I don't think so.
The minute that dick walked into that place where I was working
I knew there was no chance for me to continue on here.
Wouldn't it be better if you went back to prison and served out your time?
No.
They'd give me seven more years of it.
I've got a pretty good grip on myself, Anne, and I'd like to make a new start.
And my only hope is in some other country where they can't get me.
Well, I suppose you're right.
But I... we'll miss you.
Will you really?
You know I will.
Anne, I have no right to tell you this, but... you know, I get sort of a choky feeling... every time I think I'm never going to see you again.
Oh, don't be angry at me for saying that, will you?
I'm not angry.
You see, It's the only way I have of telling you how much your friendship has done for me.
Thanks.
What are you going to do?
-Work.
Does that please you?
-Hm-Hmm.
You know, as soon as I get to the islands...
I'm going to get a little plantation.
I've heard of a chap who made a fortune out there.
Oh, that sounds marvelous.
Doesn't it?
You know, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't mind going.
And yet, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't be going.
Gosh, how are you going to figure that one out?
I don't know.
Hello, Morgan.
Let's see what you've got on you.
I guess you didn't know who this fellow really was, Miss Marlowe.
That's too bad.
Sergeant, please.
Wait a minute.
I'm sorry this had to happen here, Anne.
But I...
Now let's get going.
Oh, mother!
I love him!
Oh, if they'd only give him another chance!
You're going to find things tougher than ever here.
The state has closed the mill.
You know what idleness does to a man.
So you'd better watch your step.
Yes, sir.
All right, Morgan.
Let's go.
Yes, sir.
We're gonna have a lot more trouble with that bird, you'll see.
I think you're wrong, Wallace.
I believe he wants to go straight.
Straight?
Two weeks with the old gang and he'll be right back where he was.
Maybe.
I hope not.
Hello, Morg.
Get back over that deadline or I'll knock your block off.
-Who, me?
-Yes, you.
Pop's getting tough.
How's all the dames outside?
See my initials carved on many bedposts, Morg?
-How have you been, Butch, huh?
-Oh, okay.
You know, the food's getting worse here, too.
Hello, Morg.
How are you?
Well, what's the gang been up to, Butch?
Planning.
Six of us is going right out through that gate.
You aren't kidding me, are you?
No, I'm giving it to you straight.
-Me and the gopher framed it.
-The gopher?
Why, he's been the prison gardener for seven years.
Sure.
He's had an idea in the back of his bean, though.
There he goes now.
For three months, every day he's been going to that gate.
The screw's used to it, don't pay no attention to him.
Yeah?
Every once in a while, why, he has an extra big bunch of flowers, and the screw opens the gate, savvy?
I see.
And you six guys go through, is that it?
-Sure.
Simple, ain't it?
-Sure.
What happens when you get through the inner gate?
We crash that outer gate and there's a car waiting.
-When does it come off?
-Thanksgiving Day at noon.
Most of the screws go home to turkey dinner.
We'll give them a bellyful.
You know it means the rope, Butch, if they catch you.
Who's in on it?
Well, me, and Olsen, and Joe. and The Hawk.
-The Hawk?
That means blood.
-No... he promised me he wouldn't bump nobody off.
-Why, he croaked his own mother.
-Sure he did.
He cut her throat.
He was sorry for her.
He's all right.
Anybody else in on it?
Well, there's that big Swede and Kent...
Kent?
Say, listen, you're all wrong about that Kent guy.
It was a Russian that planted that knife on you, not Kent.
We caught him doing the same thing to another guy.
Yeah?
Sure.
I was sure it was Kent.
No.
After you made your getaway, they put the gopher in the same cell with me and Kent, see?
Kent ain't in on the plans, but he's got to go out with us.
We ain't telling' nobody till we get ready to make the break, outside of you.
Not for me, Butch.
I'm going straight.
You wouldn't kid an old friend, would you?
- You got me all wrong, Butch...
-Hello, Morgan!
But I just don't play a sucker's game, that's all.
-How are you?
-Hey, listen... don't let that gang know that you're going straight.
They used to have a lot of respect for you.
Hello, Morg.
Welcome b-b-back home.
Hello, Morg.
Hey, listen, don't gang up here.
Come on.
Take a powder, take a powder.
See you later, Butch.
Hey, you.
Come here, you.
Let's see that book.
Where's that Bride's Confession I told you to get me?
-Well... well, you see, it's wor-worn out.
-Well, you get me Sappho.
Say, you don't mind if I take a powder, do you, Mr. B-B-B-Butch?
Oh, go on, scram.
Scram.
Hey, Kent.
I want to talk to you.
Morgan, I want to explain to you about that knife...
Yeah, Butch told me all about it.
What you've done doesn't interest me.
It's what you're going to do.
Are you in on this break?
-Yeah, they took me in on it.
-I know.
It's dynamite.
They haven't told me all their plans yet.
You keep out of it, do you hear?
Not that I care about you.
But I met that family of yours, Kent.
They think the world of you.
Now, you've caused them enough trouble, and if anything more happens to you, they'd never get over it.
So you keep out of this break.
It's murder, and you'll hang for it.
Hey, you.
Morgan trying to turn you against the gang?
Yeah, that's what he was doing, all right.
You wouldn't think it of him, would you?
Aw, he's a rat.
I wonder what Butch will say.
Think I'd better go and tell him.
All right.
You tell him.
This guy could catch fish with his hands.
He'd reach under the rocks and get a hold of the fish...
Hey, Butch, you take Morgan in?
Morg?
Sure.
-You sure he's going with us?
-Sure, he is.
He can't wait.
-Don't lie to me.
-Who, me?
-Why, I never told a lie in my life.
-You know he's not going with us.
I just heard him telling Kent to keep out of it.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
Said it looked like a trap to him.
Get me?
You suppose Morgan will go yellow?
-Who, Morg?
-Well, something's changed him.
Yeah, something's changed him.
You don't suppose he'd rat on us?
-What's that you said?
-You don't think he'd squeal?
Say, listen, he wouldn't squeal on nobody.
He's changed.
That's all right.
But I'll croak the first guy that says he's a double-crosser.
So Kent's got his ear to the ground, and he'll soon have plenty to tell us.
He thinks the gang have guns, but he doesn't know where they're hidden.
I promised him we'd cut his time in half if he brought us this information.
Stool pigeons.
I wish we could run this place without them.
-Yeah, well, we can't.
-Who's in on it?
All of Butch's gang.
How about giving them solitary?
That would only keep them quiet for a few weeks.
It isn't any one group.
It's 3,000 idle men with nothing to do but brood and plot.
You can't put them all in solitary.
We can crush them.
That's what's happening to them right now.
We've tried to crush them, with this result.
You search every corner of this prison, but you find those guns.
Don't worry, sir.
If those guns are here,
I'll have them on your desk before Thanksgiving Day.
And now to record our thankfulness on this glad Thanksgiving Day, let us rise and sing hymn number 84.
Ring the bells of heaven.
There is joy today.
A lost lamb is returning
From his sinful way.
Glory, glory.
How the angels sing.
Glory, glory.
Loud hosannas ring... with songs of thanksgiving...
Let our voices ring.
Today's the day.
Hear the angels sing.
Open the gates, Open the gates
Open the gates and let the king of glory in.
Open the gates, open the gates, open the gates and let the King of Glory in.
And now let us kneel in prayer.
Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever and ever.
Amen.
The Lord bless you and keep you, both now and forevermore.
Amen.
Noon.
Noon, Swede.
Noon.
Come on, scram.
-Butch, what's the dope?
-Noon.
Watch me.
Don't go through with it, Butch.
It's a trap.
They'll get you.
We'll get through, if someone don't double-cross us.
They'll mow you down.
Wallace.
- Morgan?
-Yes, sir?
I want to see you in my office.
Yes, sir.
Who's in on this break?
I don't know anything about a break.
Morgan, you're a liar.
They've got guns hidden somewhere.
You know where they are.
If I did, I wouldn't tell you.
What kind of a rat do you think I am?
Not even if we opened the gates for you?
Is that all you've got to say to me?
I'll have plenty to say to you later.
Hold him here.
I can't get anything out of Morgan, sir.
Don't worry.
I've got the dope from Kent.
-The break is set for noon.
-Noon?
Just one minute.
What are they going to do?
Kent couldn't tell me.
I've doubled the gun guards.
Don't you worry.
Where is he?
Why doesn't he come?
There he is.
Frost is beginning to kill the flowers, so I picked a whole lot today.
-Make a big bunch, don't they?
-Fine.
Thank you.
Grab all those guns.
Get those screws and take them to the cellar.
Joe!
Joe!
-What do you want, Butch?
-We've been double-crossed!
Yes!
Morgan done it.
Morgan!
I'll get that guy if it's the last thing I do.
Joe!
Get those screws, put them in the hole.
We'll need them later.
Come on, you guys.
Come on.
Get in there!
Any of you guys not with us, come on, clear out of here!
Come on, get out of here.
They're making it hot for us.
We'll fix them.
Go and get Sandy!
Come here, Sandy.
Come out of there.
Come on.
Get over there.
Over there.
Come on.
You go to the warden.
Tell him to open those gates and let us go through.
If he don't, we're going to bump off every screw in here and throw them out in the yard.
-Beginning with Wallace?
-Yes, beginning with Wallace, yes.
Here, take that gun.
Hang that out that gate.
All right.
Open it just a little bit.
That much?
All right.
Come on.
Put it through there.
All right.
Come on.
Come out.
Get to moving, you.
Go on, Wallace, get out there.
Butch said if you didn't open the gate and let the gang out, they're going to kill all the guards beginning with Wallace.
I'll see him in hell first.
Let them have it.
Come on out of there, Wallace.
Come on!
Shake it up!
Wallace, you said your prayers?
I don't know any prayers.
Go ahead, shoot.
Aah!
Wallace!
Miller!
Miller!
Give them the gas bomb.
Open those gates and let us go through, or we'll send the rest of these screws straight to hell!
You dirty double-crosser!
They'll get you for this!
Shut up!
Butch!
Joe!
Get me another screw out of there!
What's the matter, kid?
Morgan locked the door.
He's got the key!
Butch!
Butch, come here.
Morgan's got the key.
He's locked the door.
They'll kill me.
They'll kill me!
I didn't mean to squeal!
I didn't mean to...
They made me do it!
They made me!
Don't tell Butch.
He'll kill me!
So you double-crossed the gang, huh?
-You turned them in!
-Don't let them get me, Morgan!
Don't let them get me!
I guess you're not to blame at that.
You stay where you are.
I'll attend to this gang.
Don't tell, don't tell Butch.
I didn't mean to do it!
The army tanks are here, sir.
All right.
Send them in.
What's that?
We'll get the rope for this, but I'm going to get that rat Morgan if it's the last thing I do.
Where's Morgan?
Morgan, you in there?
Come out of there, you rat!
Come out of there, you rats!
Is Morgan there?
-No!
-All right.
Is Morgan in there?
I know what you're coming for, Butch.
But I'm not going to be killed for something I didn't do.
If you come one step nearer...
He shot me in the arm, Butch!
I warned you, Joe!
I didn't double-cross the gang.
You stick your head out of that door, and I'll throw a slug between your horns.
-Stand back, Pop!
-Shut up!
I'll tell him.
Butch, this Is Pop Riker.
You're all wrong, Butch.
Morgan didn't turn you in.
Even the screws are protecting him.
Come on.
Let's go in and get him.
Wait, Butch.
My eyes!
I must be losing my sight.
I'm going blind!
You're all right.
It's only the gas.
Morgan, we're coming after you, you snake.
I warn you, Butch.
Stay where you are!
Stay where you are!
Joe!
Joe!
Bring me some more bullets, Joe.
Oh!
Sorry, Butch.
Did I get you?
-I'm on my feet, see?
-Don't lie to me.
-Who, me?
-Yes, you.
Listen, Butch, it was Kent who sold out the gang, not Morgan.
Kent?
You know I wouldn't double-cross you, Butch.
Sure, I know you wouldn't.
I was only kidding, that's all.
Just kidding.
Just...
Sure.
I knew that all the time.
I want to thank you, Warden, for all you've done.
All ready for a new start, Morgan?
Yes, sir, I am.
Have you made any plans for your future?
Yes, sir.
I thought I'd go to the islands of some new country
- and take up government lands.
-Good idea.
New friends, new surroundings, hard work.
That's a man's salvation.
Are you going alone?
Well, I don't know, sir.
Well, I wish you luck.
You deserve it.
Thank you, Warden.
-Well, so long, Pop.
-So long, Morgan.
See that you don't get homesick again.

OH, YOU CUT OUT THE APPLESAUCE

NO LETTERS FOR YOU, MORGAN,

FINE.
I'LL TAKE THEM TO THEM.
THANKS, POP.
I USED TO MILK A COW ALL THE TIME.
LETTER FOR YOU, BUTCH.

YES, YOU.
GEE, WHY DON'T THOSE DAMES LET ME ALONE?
YOU'RE SUCH A DEAL, BUTCH,
YOU CAN'T BLAME THEM.
WHERE'S KENT?

HEY, STICK AROUND.
I'LL BET THIS IS A HOT ONE.
OH, BOY.
LOOK AT THAT.
WHY, IT'S FROM MYRTLE.

YES, ME!
WAIT A MINUTE.
I'LL SHOW YOU.
"DEAR SWEETHEART..."
"HOW I MISS MY GREAT BIG BOY.
YOU HAVE IT."
[LAUGHTER]
[BUTCH] HOT DOGGY.
"THE ONLY FUN I GET IS SLEEPING
BECAUSE THEN I DREAM ABOUT YOU EVERY NIGHT."
[LAUGHTER]
THE REST OF THIS IS TOO JUICY FOR YOU GUYS.
NOBODY GETS TO READ THIS
BUT ME AND MY PAL MORG.
COME ON, MORG.
[MEN COMPLAINING]
AW, COME ON.
OH, GO ON.
OH, GO ON.
I'M GOING TO READ THIS.
YOU AND ME, MORG.
HEY, COME ON.
SCRAM.
[MAN] HEY, WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA?
GET OUT OF HERE.
GO ON.
GO ON.
SAY, MORG...
WHO DO YOU SUPPOSE WOULD WRITE ME A LETTER?
I'LL READ IT TO YOU, BUTCH.
SAY, IF I EVEN KNEW A DAME CALLED MYRTLE,
I'D KICK HER TEETH OUT.
GO ON.
READ IT.
WHO'S IT FROM?
WELL, IT'S ABOUT YOUR MOTHER, BUTCH.
MY OLD LADY?
YEAH.
GEE, SHE'S BEEN HOLDING OUT ON ME.
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW SHE COULD WRITE.
WELL, IT ISN'T FROM HER, BUTCH.
IT'S FROM A GUY NAMED TONY LOOP.
IT'S ABOUT--
NOTHING WRONG.
GO ON.
READ IT.
"DEAR BUTCH, WHEN YOUR MOTHER WAS SICK,
"SHE DIDN'T WANT ME TO WRITE NO LETTER AND TELL YOU,
"EVEN WHEN THEY TOOK HER TO THE COUNTY HOSPITAL.
"I WENT TO SEE HER A COUPLE OF TIMES,
"AND SHE SAID YOU HAD ENOUGH TO WORRY
"WITHOUT HAVING TO THINK ABOUT HER.
ANYWAY, SHE..."
"SHE DIED YESTERDAY.
"AND AS WE COULDN'T GET ENOUGH MONEY
"TO GIVE HER A SEND-OFF,
"WE HAD TO LET THE HOSPITAL TAKE CARE OF IT.
"ANYWAY, WE SENT HER A BUNCH OF FLOWERS,
"AND I GUESS THAT'S ALL.
YOURS TRULY...
TONY LOOP."
[SNIFFS]
[SNIFFS]
GEE, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT, MORG.
MA'S DEAD.
I WONDER IF IT HURT HER MUCH.
OH, I DON'T THINK SO, BUTCH.
SHE PROBABLY JUST DROPPED OFF QUIETLY.
YEAH?
YEAH.
SHE WAS PRETTY OLD, WASN'T SHE?
ABOUT 70...
AND AS BIG AS A MINUTE...
AND GAME.
AND, SAY, THE LAST TIME I WAS ARRESTED,
SHE FOUGHT LIKE A WILDCAT.
IT TOOK TWO BULLS TO HOLD HER,
AND SHE ALMOST BIT THE THUMB OFF OF ONE OF THEM.
GEE, SHE WAS A SWELL OLD LADY.
I WISH YOU WOULD HAVE MET HER, MORG.
SO DO I, BUTCH.
SAY, MORG...
I'M GOING TO MAKE A BREAK.
I'M GOING TO GET OUT OF HERE,
AND I'M GOING TO GIVE THAT LITTLE OLD LADY
THE SWELLEST FUNERAL SHE EVER HAD.
PIPE DOWN, WILL YOU?
HERE COMES OLIVER.
HELLO, MORGAN.
GOT A MATCH?
SURE.
THANKS.
GOOD NEWS, BUTCH?
BAD NEWS WHENEVER YOU COME AROUND.
GREAT KIDDER, ISN'T HE, MORGAN?
[MORGAN] YES, AND HE'S NOT ALWAYS KIDDING.
YOU KNOW, THAT GUY'S A STOOL PIGEON IF EVER THERE WAS ONE.
I WISH I COULD GET THE LOWDOWN ON HIM.
I'LL KNIFE HIM SOMEDAY.
AW, THAT KIND OF TALK WON'T GET YOU ANYWHERES.
I'M GOING TO BREAK THIS PLACE WIDE OPEN.
YEAH, AND THEN WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOU?
DOWN IN THE DUNGEON WITH THE RATS.
HUH.
NO.
WE GOT TO TAKE OUR MEDICINE, BUTCH.
IT'S ALL RIGHT FOR YOU TO TALK.
YOU'LL BE GOING OUT OF HERE IN A FEW YEARS.
BUT WHAT DO I GAIN EATING THIS DIRT?
I'D GO NUTS IF I DIDN'T START TROUBLE ONCE IN A WHILE.
I'D RATHER STAND UP AND FIGHT,
AND EVEN IF I GOT THE ROPE,
IT'S BETTER THAN SITTING HERE ROTTING IN THIS STINKING HOLE.
AW, CUT OUT THAT TALK, BUTCH.
DO YOU HEAR?
WHO, ME?
YES, YOU.
O.K.
[LAUGHS]
I WAS ONLY KIDDING.
SURE.
[MAN] HEY, LISTEN, BUTCH.
HOW ABOUT THAT HOT NUMBER OF YOURS?
THE GANG WANTS TO HEAR IT AGAIN.
[MORGAN] GO ON.
READ IT.
[BUTCH] ALL RIGHT.
I'LL READ IT ONCE MORE.
SEEN KENT AROUND ANYWHERE?
YEAH.
HE'S AROUND THE CORNER WITH OLIVER.
WHAT ABOUT MORGAN?
MORGAN?
WHO KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT HIM?
BUT BUTCH-- LISTEN, OLIVER.
THAT GUY WILL KILL ME SOMEDAY.
HE PACKS A KNIFE.
OH, HE PACKS A KNIFE, DOES HE?
DON'T LET THAT WORRY YOU.
THAT KNIFE'S GOING TO GET HIM INTO TROUBLE.
SAY, LISTEN, YOU GUYS.
IF I EVER CATCH EITHER ONE OF YOU DOUBLE-CROSSING BUTCH,
I'M GOING TO GET YOU.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
NOW, KENT, YOU KEEP AWAY FROM THIS RAT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
HE'S THE ONLY GUY THAT'S BEEN DECENT TO ME SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE.
I WAS ONLY TRYING TO GIVE HIM SOME GOOD ADVICE.
YEAH?
WELL, BEAT IT.
DO YOU HEAR?
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME GOOD ADVICE, KENT.
YOU'RE IN A TOUGH SPOT,
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN THAT WHINING AND DOUBLE-CROSSING
ISN'T GOING TO GET YOU ANYWHERE.
I'M NOT WHINING, AND I WON'T STAND FOR YOUR RIBBING.
WHAT RIGHT HAVE THEY GOT TO POKE ME IN A CELL
WITH BUTCH AND YOU, A ROBBER, BRAGGING ABOUT IT?
OH, I SEE.
TOO GOOD FOR THE REST OF US, HUH?
WELL, IF YOU'RE WISE, YOU'LL STAND UP AND TAKE YOUR JOE
LIKE A REGULAR GUY.
YEAH?
YEAH.
HERE'S A LETTER FOR YOU.
GET WISE, KID.
PLAY UP TO MORGAN AND BUTCH.
THEY RUN THE JOINT HERE,
AND IF THEY'RE AFTER YOU,
THEY'LL MAKE IT TOUGH FOR YOU,
BUT IF YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH THEM,
THEY'LL LET YOU IN ON THEIR PLANS.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I'LL TELL YOU LATER.
OH, I WOULDN'T DO THAT.
KID, YOU TRUST ME.
I'M YOUR FRIEND.
THESE THREE DAMES WERE CRAZY ABOUT ME, SEE.
SAY, HEY, BUTCH.
BUTCH, I HAD A DREAM LAST NIGHT.

YOU, PUTNAM?
YOU CAN'T GET AWAY WITH THAT, BUTCH.
NO?
YOU'RE ASKING FOR IT, AIN'T YOU?
ONE WIGGLE OUT OF YOU,
AND I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU.
[MAN] LISTEN, YOU GUYS ARE LIABLE TO GET THE HOLE FOR THIS.

WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO GET ME OUT?
OHH...
I'M SORRY, DEAR.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING.
I SAW THE GOVERNOR MYSELF.
HE WAS VERY KIND.
HE SAID HE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING.
WHAT KIND OF A DAME WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME GET FOR YOU?
ANY KIND.
HOW'D YOU LIKE A LITTLE GAL LIKE THAT?
SAY, YOU'RE A LAWYER, NOT A MAGICIAN.
O.K., KID.
I'LL BE AROUND HERE WITH A CAR IN THE MORNING TO PICK YOU UP.
FINE.

OH, KENT, PLEASE.
I KNOW YOU'RE BIG ENOUGH TO SEE IT THROUGH.

YOU DON'T THINK I'D BE CRAZY ENOUGH TO DO A THING LIKE THAT
THE DAY BEFORE I GO OUT, DO YOU?
SHUT UP.
WELL, THIS WILL JUST COST YOU YOUR PAROLE.
OH, YOU CAN'T DO THAT, SIR.
I TELL YOU, I NEVER SAW THAT KNIFE BEFORE.
IT WAS PLANTED ON ME.
AHH--
I CAME IN THE CELL, TOOK OFF MY COAT, LAID IT ON THE BUNK.
THERE WAS NO ONE IN THERE BUT THIS FELLOW AND...
AND THEN KENT--
YOU DID THAT.
I DIDN'T DO IT!
DON'T LIE TO ME!

I GUESS THE DUNGEON WILL COOL HIM OFF A BIT.

THANKS.
WHY DID YOU COME HERE?
TO SQUARE A BAD DEAL I GOT FROM SOMEONE IN PRISON.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WELL, I WAS FRAMED,
AND THEY TOOK MY PAROLE AWAY FROM ME
THE DAY BEFORE I WAS TO GO FREE.
DO YOU KNOW WHO FRAMED YOU?
YEAH.
YEAH, I THINK I KNOW.
WELL, GOOD NIGHT, MISS MARLOWE.
I WON'T BOTHER YOU AGAIN.
ARE YOU GOING AWAY?
PERHAPS.
I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK I UNDERSTAND YOUR BITTERNESS.
IF YOU'RE EVER AROUND HERE AGAIN...
DROP IN.
OH, YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.
OF COURSE I DO.
GEE, YOU'RE A PEACH OF A GIRL.
I PICKED HIM UP ONE NIGHT AND TRAILED HIM TO A BOOKSTORE.
HE GOES UNDER THE NAME OF EVERETT.
[MAN] EVERETT?
HOW IS SHE?
IS SHE BLOND?
YEAH.
HE'S MORGAN, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
PLENTY SMART, TOO.
I LOST TRACK OF HIM FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.
WHEN I FOUND HIM, HE WAS ACTUALLY WORKING.
I SENT OUT A MAN TO SPOT HIM.
THAT NIGHT HE QUIT HIS JOB.
WORKING?
MUST BE A WOMAN IN THE CASE.
YEAH.
I KNOW THE WOMAN, TOO.
THEN YOU GOT A LINE ON HIM.

I HAVEN'T LOST ONE YET, HAVE I?
ALL RIGHT, EDDIE.
LET'S GO.
HELLO, DICK.

MRS. MARLOWE, HOW ARE YOU TODAY?
I'M FINE, THANK YOU.
ANNE TELLS ME YOU'RE GOING AWAY, MR. EVERETT.
WE ARE GOING TO MISS YOU.
WELL, THAT'S AWFULLY NICE OF YOU.
YOU KNOW, COMING HERE HAS MEANT A GREAT DEAL TO ME.
[MR. MARLOWE] OH, YOU MUST STAY FOR DINNER.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE CORN BREAD AND FRIED CHICKEN.
AND STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE.
BETTER STOP.
I'M LIABLE TO MISS THAT TRAIN.
[MRS. MARLOWE] OH, YOU'RE NOT GOING THAT SOON.
YES.
LEAVING IN AN HOUR.
OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.
OH...
I KNOW SOMEBODY THAT'S GOING TO MISS YOU.
WHY, DAD!
DON'T "WHY, DAD" ME.
I WASN'T BORN YESTERDAY.
NO.
ME, NEITHER.
HEH!
SHE'S BEEN SIGHING AROUND ALL MORNING.
I WONDERED WHAT WAS THE MATTER.
NOW, DAD.
I'M ASHAMED OF YOU.
COME ON, JOHN.
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.
YOU'RE SO SUBTLE, DAD.
YEAH.
I CAN'T HELP IT.
I--
OH, NOW, DON'T PICK ON ME, MA.
HA HA!
YOU LOVE IT!
OH, I'M GLAD TO SEE ANNE HAPPY AGAIN.
WELL, ANNE, I HATE TO GO.
OH, YOU'LL COME BACK SOMEDAY.
I DON'T THINK SO.
THE MINUTE THAT DICK WALKED INTO THAT PLACE WHERE I WAS WORKING,
I KNEW THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR ME TO CONTINUE ON HERE.
WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER IF YOU WENT BA TO PRISON
AND SERVED OUT YOUR TIME?
NO.
THEY'D GIVE ME SEVEN MORE YEARS OF IT.
I'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD GRIP ON MYSELF, ANNE,
AND I'D LIKE TO MAKE A NEW START,
AND MY ONLY HOPE IS IN SOME OTHER COUNTRY WHERE THEY CAN'T GET ME.
WELL, I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT,
BUT I'LL-- WE'LL MISS YOU.
WILL YOU REALLY?
YOU KNOW I WILL.
ANNE, I HAVE NO RIGHT TO TELL YOU THIS,
BUT, YOU KNOW, I GET SORT OF A CHOKY FEELING
EVERY TIME I THINK I'M NEVER GOING TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
OH, DON'T BE ANGRY AT ME FOR SAYING THAT, WILL YOU?
I'M NOT ANGRY.
YOU SEE, IT'S THE ONLY WAY I HAVE OF TELLING YOU
HOW MUCH YOUR FRIENDSHIP HAS DONE FOR ME.
THANKS.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
WORK.
DOES THAT PLEASE YOU?
MM-HMM.
YOU KNOW, AS SOON AS I GET TO THE ISLANDS,
I'M GOING TO GET A LITTLE PLANTATION.
I'VE HEARD OF A CHAP WHO MADE A FORTUNE OUT THERE.
OH, THAT SOUNDS MARVELOUS.
DOESN'T IT?
YOU KNOW, IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU,
I WOULDN'T MIND GOING,
AND YET, IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU, I WOULDN'T BE GOING.
GOSH, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FIGURE THAT ONE OUT?
I DON'T KNOW.
HELLO, MORGAN.
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT ON YOU.
I GUESS YOU DIDN'T KNOW
WHO THIS FELLOW REALLY WAS, MISS MARLOWE.
THAT'S TOO BAD.
SERGEANT, PLEASE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
I'M SORRY THIS HAD TO HAPPEN HERE, ANNE.
BUT I...
[SERGEANT] NOW, LET'S GET GOING.
[SOBBING]
OH, MOTHER!
I LOVE HIM!
OH, IF THEY'D ONLY GIVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE!
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND THINGS
TOUGHER THAN EVER HERE.
THE STATE HAS CLOSED THE MILL.
YOU KNOW WHAT IDLENESS DOES TO A MAN,
SO YOU BETTER WATCH YOUR STEP.
YES, SIR.
[POP] ALL RIGHT, MORGAN.
LET'S GO.
YES, SIR.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT MORE TROUBLE WITH THAT BIRD.
YOU'LL SEE.
I THINK YOU'RE WRONG, WALLACE.
I BELIEVE HE WANTS TO GO STRAIGHT.
STRAIGHT?
TWO WEEKS WITH THE OLD GANG,
AND HE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WHERE HE WAS.
MAYBE.
I HOPE NOT.
HELLO, MORG.
GET BACK OVER THAT DEADLINE,
OR I'LL KNOCK YOUR BLOCK OFF.
WHO, ME?
YES, YOU.
POP'S GETTING TOUGH.
HOW'S ALL THE DAMES OUTSIDE?
SEE MY INITIALS
CARVED ON MANY BEDPOSTS, MORG?
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN, BUTCH, HUH?
OH, O.K. YOU KNOW, THE FOOD'S GETTING WORSE HERE, TOO.

HOW ARE YOU?
WELL, WHAT'S THE GANG BEEN UP TO, BUTCH?
PLANNING.
SIX OF US IS GOING
RIGHT OUT THROUGH THAT GATE.
YOU AREN'T KIDDING ME, ARE YOU?
NO.
I'M GIVING IT TO YOU STRAIGHT.
ME AND THE GOPHER FRAMED IT.
THE GOPHER?
WHY, HE'S BEEN THE PRISON GARDENER FOR SEVEN YEARS.
SURE.
HE'S HAD AN IDEA IN THE BACK OF HIS BEAN, THOUGH.
THERE HE GOES NOW.
FOR THREE MONTHS, EVERY DAY,
HE'S BEEN GOING TO THAT GATE.
THE SCREW'S USED TO IT,
DON'T PAY NO ATTENTION TO HIM.
YEAH?
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,
WHY, HE HAS AN EXTRA BIG BUNCH OF FLOWERS,
AND THE SCREW OPENS THE GATE, SAVVY?
I SEE.
AND YOU SIX GUYS GO THROUGH, IS THAT IT?
SURE.
SIMPLE, AIN'T IT?
SURE.
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET THROUGH THE INNER GATE?
WE CRASH THAT OUTER GATE,
AND THERE'S A CAR WAITING OUTSIDE.
WHEN DOES IT COME OFF?
THANKSGIVING DAY AT NOON.
MOST OF THE SCREWS GO HOME TO TURKEY DINNER.
WE'LL GIVE THEM A BELLYFUL.
YOU KNOW IT MEANS THE ROPE, BUTCH, IF THEY CATCH YOU.
WHO'S IN ON IT?
WELL, ME AND OLSEN AND JOE AND THE HAWK.
THE HAWK?
THAT MEANS BLOOD.
NO.
HE PROMISED ME HE WOULDN'T BUMP NOBODY OFF.
WHY, HE CROAKED HIS OWN MOTHER.
SURE, HE DID.
HE CUT HER THROAT.
HE WAS SORRY FOR IT.
HE'S ALL RIGHT.
ANYBODY ELSE IN ON IT?
WELL, THERE'S THAT BIG SWEDE AND KENT.
KENT?
SAY, LISTEN, YOU'RE ALL WRONG ABOUT THAT KENT GUY.
IT WAS A RUSSIAN THAT PLANTED THAT KNIFE ON YOU,
NOT KENT.
WE CAUGHT HIM DOING THE SAME THING TO ANOTHER GUY.
YEAH?
SURE.
I WAS SURE IT WAS KENT.
NO.
AFTER YOU MADE YOUR GETAWAY,
THEY PUT THE GOPHER IN THE SAME CELL WITH ME AND KENT,
SEE?
KENT AIN'T IN ON THE PLANS,
BUT HE'S GOT TO GO OUT WITH US.
WE AIN'T TELLIN' NOBODY
TILL WE GET READY TO MAKE THE BREAK-
- OUTSIDE OF YOU.
NOT FOR ME, BUTCH.
I'M GOING STRAIGHT.
YOU WOULDN'T KID AN OLD FRIEND, WOULD YOU?
[MAN] HELLO, MORGAN.
YOU GOT ME ALL WRONG, BUTCH,
BUT I JUST DON'T PLAY A SUCKER'S GAME, THAT'S ALL.
HOW ARE YOU?
HEY, LISTEN.
DON'T LET THAT GANG KNOW
THAT YOU'RE GOING STRAIGHT.
THEY USED TO HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR YOU.
HELLO, MORG.
WELCOME B-B-BACK HOME.
HELLO, MORG.
HEY, LISTEN, DON'T GANG UP HERE.
COME ON.
TAKE A POWDER.
TAKE A POWDER.
SEE YOU LATER, BUTCH.
HEY, YOU.
COME HERE, YOU.
LET'S SEE THAT BOOK.
WHERE IS THAT BRIDE'S CONFESSION
I TOLD YOU TO GET ME?
WELL--WELL, YOU SEE, IT'S WOR-WORN OUT.
WELL, YOU GET ME SAPPHO.
SAY, YOU DON'T MIND IF I TAKE A POWDER, DO YOU, MR. BU-UTCH?
NO.
GO ON.
SCRAM.
SCRAM.
[MORGAN] HEY, KENT.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
MORGAN, I WANT TO EXPLAIN TO YOU ABOUT THAT KNIFE--
YEAH, BUTCH TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT.
WHAT YOU'VE DONE DOESN'T INTEREST ME.
IT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO.
ARE YOU IN ON THIS BREAK?
YEAH.
THEY TOOK ME IN ON IT.
I KNOW.
IT'S DYNAMITE.
THEY HAVEN'T TOLD ME ALL THEIR PLANS YET.
YOU KEEP OUT OF IT, DO YOU HEAR?
NOT THAT I CARE ABOUT YOU,
BUT I MET THAT FAMILY OF YOURS, KENT.
THEY THINK THE WORLD OF YOU.
NOW, YOU'VE CAUSED THEM ENOUGH TROUBLE,
AND IF ANYTHING MORE HAPPENS TO YOU, THEY'D NEVER GET OVER IT,
SO YOU KEEP OUT OF THIS BREAK.
IT'S MURDER, AND YOU'LL HANG FOR IT.
HEY, YOU.
MORGAN TRYING TO TURN YOU AGAINST THE GANG?
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HE WAS DOING, ALL RIGHT.
YOU WOULDN'T THINK IT OF HIM, WOULD YOU?
AW, HE'S A RAT.
I WONDER WHAT BUTCH WILL SAY.
THINK I'D BETTER GO AND TELL HIM.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU TELL HIM.
THIS GUY COULD CATCH FISH WITH HIS HANDS.
HE'D REACH UNDER THE ROCKS
AND GET AHOLD OF A FISH...
SAY, BUTCH, YOU TAKE MORGAN IN?
MORG?
SURE.
YOU SURE HE'S GOING WITH US?
SURE, HE IS.
HE CAN'T WAIT.
DON'T LIE TO ME.
WHO, ME?
WHY, I NEVER TOLD A LIE IN MY LIFE.
YOU KNOW HE'S NOT GOING WITH US.
I JUST HEARD HIM TELLING KENT TO KEEP OUT OF IT.
YEAH?
YEAH.
SAID IT LOOKED LIKE A TRAP TO HIM.
GET ME?
YOU SUPPOSE MORGAN WILL GO YELLOW?
WHO, MORG?
WELL, SOMETHING'S CHANGED HIM.
YEAH, SOMETHING'S CHANGED HIM.
YOU DON'T SUPPOSE HE'D RAT ON US?
WHAT'S THAT YOU SAID?
YOU DON'T THINK HE'D SQUEAL?
SAY, LISTEN, HE WOULDN'T SQUEAL ON NOBODY.
HE'S CHANGED, THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
BUT I'LL CROAK THE FIRST GUY
THAT SAYS HE'S A DOUBLE-CROSSER.
SO KENT'S GOT HIS EAR TO THE GROUND,
AND HE'LL SOON HAVE PLENTY TO TELL US.
HE THINKS THE GANG HAVE GUNS,
BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE HIDDEN.
I PROMISED HIM WE'D CUT HIS TIME IN HALF
IF HE BROUGHT US THIS INFORMATION.
STOOL PIGEONS.
I WISH WE COULD RUN THIS PLACE WITHOUT THEM.
YEAH, WELL, WE CAN'T.
WHO'S IN ON IT?
ALL OF BUTCH'S GANG.
HOW ABOUT GIVING THEM SOLITARY?
THAT WOULD ONLY KEEP THEM QUIET FOR A FEW WEEKS.
IT ISN'T ANY ONE GROUP.
IT'S 3,000 IDLE MEN WITH NOTHING TO DO BUT BROOD AND PLOT.
YOU CAN'T PUT THEM ALL IN SOLITARY.
WE CAN CRUSH THEM.
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM RIGHT NOW.
WE'VE TRIED TO CRUSH THEM, WITH THIS RESULT.
SEARCH EVERY CORNER OF THIS PRISON,
BUT YOU FIND THOSE GUNS.
DON'T WORRY, SIR.
IF THOSE GUNS ARE HERE,
I'LL HAVE THEM ON YOUR DESK
BEFORE THANKSGIVING DAY.
AND NOW TO RECORD OUR THANKFULNESS
ON THIS GLAD THANKSGIVING DAY,
LET US RISE AND SING HYMN NUMBER 84.
[ORGAN PLAYING]

DON'T GO THROUGH WITH IT, BUTCH.
IT'S A TRAP.
THEY'LL GET YOU.
WE'LL GET THROUGH, IF SOMEONE DON'T DOUBLE-CROSS US.
THEY'LL MOW YOU DOWN.
WALLACE.
[WALLACE] MORGAN?
YES, SIR.
I WANT TO SEE YOU IN MY OFFICE.
YES, SIR.
WHO'S IN ON THIS BREAK?
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT A BREAK.
MORGAN, YOU'RE A LIAR.
THEY'VE GOT GUNS HIDDEN SOMEWHERE.
YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.
IF I DID, I WOULDN'T TELL YOU.
WHAT KIND OF A RAT DO YOU THINK I AM?
NOT EVEN IF WE OPENED THE GATES FOR YOU?
IS THAT ALL YOU'VE GOT TO SAY TO ME?
I'LL HAVE PLENTY TO SAY TO YOU LATER.
HOLD HIM HERE.
I CAN'T GET ANYTHING OUT OF MORGAN, SIR.
DON'T WORRY.
I'VE GOT THE DOPE FROM KENT.
THE BREAK IS SET FOR NOON.
NOON?
JUST ONE MINUTE.
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO?
KENT COULDN'T TELL ME.
I'VE DOUBLED THE GUN GUARD.
DON'T YOU WORRY.
WE'VE GOT THEM.
WHERE IS HE?
WHY DOESN'T HE COME?
THERE HE IS.
FROST IS KILLING THE FLOWERS,
SO I PICKED A WHOLE LOT TODAY.
MAKE A BIG BUNCH, DON'T THEY?
FINE.
THANK YOU.

COME ON.
YOU GO TO THE WARDEN.
TELL HIM TO OPEN THOSE GATES AND LET US GO THROUGH.
IF HE DON'T,
WE'RE GOING TO BUMP OFF EVERY SCREW IN HERE
AND THROW THEM OUT IN THE YARD.
BEGINNING WITH WALLACE.
YES, BEGINNING WITH WALLACE.
HERE, TAKE THAT GUN.
HANG THAT OUT THAT GATE.
ALL RIGHT.
OPEN IT JUST A LITTLE BIT.
NOT MUCH!
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON.
PUT IT THROUGH THERE.
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON.
COME OUT.
GET TO MOVING, YOU.
GET OUT THERE.
BUTCH SAID IF YOU DIDN'T OPEN THE GATE AND LET THE GANG OUT,
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO KILL ALL THE GUARDS BEGINNING WITH WALLACE.
I'LL SEE THEM IN HELL FIRST.
LET THEM HAVE IT.
[GUNFIRE]
[GUNFIRE CONTINUES]
[MAN] COME ON OUT OF THERE, WALLACE.
COME ON!
SHAKE IT UP!
[BUTCH] WALLACE, YOU SAID YOUR PRAYERS?
[WALLACE] I DON'T KNOW ANY PRAYERS.
GO AHEAD, SHOOT.
[GUNFIRE]
[WALLACE] AAH!
[GUNFIRE CONTINUES]
[GUNFIRE STOPS]
WALLACE!
MILLER!
MILLER!
GIVE THEM THE GAS BOMB.

THEY'LL GET YOU FOR THIS!
SHUT UP!
BUTCH!
JOE!
[GUNFIRE CONTINUES]
JOE!
JOE!

WHAT'S THE MATTER, KID?
MORGAN LOCKED THE DOOR.
HE'S GOT THE KEY!
BUTCH!
BUTCH, COME HERE.
MORGAN'S GOT THE KEY.
HE'S LOCKED THE DOOR.
THEY'LL KILL ME.
THEY'LL KILL ME!
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SQUEAL!
I DIDN'T MEAN TO--
THEY MADE ME DO IT!
THEY MADE ME!
DON'T TELL BUTCH.
HE'LL KILL ME!
SO YOU DOUBLE-CROSSED THE GANG, HUH?
YOU TURNED THEM IN?
DON'T LET THEM GET ME, MORGAN!
DON'T LET THEM GET ME!
I GUESS YOU'RE NOT TO BLAME, AT THAT.
YOU STAY WHERE YOU ARE.
I'LL ATTEND TO THIS GANG.
DON'T TELL BUTCH.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO IT!
[GUNFIRE CONTINUES]
[GUNFIRE]
[GUNFIRE]
THE ARMY TANKS ARE HERE, SIR.
ALL RIGHT.
SEND THEM IN.
[TANKS FIRING]
WHAT'S THAT?
WE'LL GET THE ROPE FOR THIS,
BUT I'M GOING TO GET THAT RAT MORGAN
IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO.
WHERE'S MORGAN?
[BUTCH] MORGAN, YOU IN THERE?
COME OUT OF THERE, YOU RAT!
COME OUT OF THERE, YOU RATS!
GET OUT OF THERE!
COME ON!
IS MORGAN THERE?
[MAN] NO!
[BUTCH] ALL RIGHT.
IS MORGAN IN THERE?
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE COMING FOR, BUTCH,
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO BE KILLED
FOR SOMETHING I DIDN'T DO.
IF YOU COME ONE STEP NEARER...
[GUNSHOT]
HE SHOT ME IN THE ARM, BUTCH!
I WARNED YOU, JOE!
I DIDN'T DOUBLE-CROSS THE GANG.
YOU STICK YOUR HEAD OUT OF THAT DOOR,
AND I'LL THROW A SLUG BETWEEN YOUR HORNS.
STAND BACK, POP!
SHUT UP!
I'LL TELL HIM.
BUTCH, THIS IS POP RIKER.
YOU'RE ALL WRONG, BUTCH.
MORGAN DIDN'T TURN YOU IN.
EVEN THE SCREWS ARE PROTECTING HIM.
COME ON.
LET'S GO IN AND GET HIM.
[JOE] WAIT, BUTCH.
MY EYES!
I MUST BE LOSING MY SIGHT.
I'M GOING BLIND!
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ONLY THE GAS.
MORGAN, WE'RE COMING AFTER YOU, YOU SNAKE.
I WARN YOU, BUTCH.
STAY WHERE YOU ARE!
STAY WHERE YOU ARE!
JOE!
JOE!
BRING ME SOME MORE BULLETS, JOE.
OH!
SORRY, BUTCH.
DID I GET YOU?
I'M ON MY FEET, SEE?
DON'T LIE TO ME.
WHO, ME?
YES, YOU.
[POP] LISTEN, BUTCH.
IT WAS KENT WHO SOLD OUT THE GANG, NOT MORGAN.
KENT?
YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T DOUBLE-CROSS YOU, BUTCH.
SURE, I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T.
I WAS ONLY KIDDING, THAT'S ALL.
JUST KIDDING.
JUST...
SURE.
I KNEW THAT ALL THE TIME.
I WANT TO THANK YOU, WARDEN, FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE.
ALL READY FOR A NEW START, MORGAN?
YES, SIR, I AM.
HAVE YOU MADE ANY PLANS FOR YOUR FUTURE?
YES, SIR.
I THOUGHT I'D GO TO THE ISLANDS OF SOME NEW COUNTRY
AND TAKE UP GOVERNMENT LANDS.
GOOD IDEA.
NEW FRIENDS,
NEW SURROUNDINGS, HARD WORK-
- THAT'S A MAN'S SALVATION.
ARE YOU GOING ALONE?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW, SIR.
GOOD-BYE.
I WISH YOU LUCK.
YOU DESERVE IT.
THANK YOU, WARDEN.
WELL, SO LONG, POP.
SO LONG, MORGAN.
SEE THAT YOU DON'T GET HOMESICK AGAIN.

Ugliest, laziest, smartest man in New Salem.
- Ain't yuh, Abe?

It's the people in front that get jarred.
Whip any man in shoo leather I At least, I hope he can.
Offut does the braggin' I do the runnin'
You better dust off them shoes then, stranger, 'cause you ain't here for long.
Well, I was aimin' to settle here awhile.

Wait till Jack Armstrong gets hold o' yuh.
He'll throw yuh out that door like yuh was a sack o' meal!

And when he sees you...
Folks can't even spit without his sayso.
Chuck me outa that door, you say?
Like a sack o' meal.
Well, that's a pretty long chuck for a peaceful man.
Whar be he?
Now, Armstrong, cain't you leave us be?
Yuh just busted up old man Simpson's place and scattered his new place all over the county.
Man, don't you ever rest?
Whare be he?

I come from lndianny, but not that part.
Well, get down!
Let's see what bones I wants to crack first!
Get a good hold, Jack!

Watch 'im, boy!
Come on, git 'im!
Now, come on, all o' you.
I'm the big tuck of thisn lick!
Yuh are, eh?
Hold on, boys!
He throwed me fair.
What's your name?
Lincoln,...
Abraham Lincoln.
Well, we're goin' to make yuh one of us.
Come on, boys, I'll set 'em up!
It's about time you set 'em up.
Let's have some o' that rattlesnake bite.
He said he was a peaceful man.
He meant peaceful like a wildcat!
Yeh, that's what he thought.
Looks like good corn liquor.
That is corn liquor.
Come on, Abe.
Where's yours?
No, I don't care much for it.
Come on, have a drink, Abe.
Well, I'll drink if you'll take it like I do.
How's that?
Lift up the barrel, and drink it outa the bung.
Well, I'll show you boys.
Maybe can, maybe can't.
Try it, anyway.
Whew!
He's the strongest man in Salem!
I told you he was the strongest man.
I've seen him lift 500 pounds in each hand.
- Ain't yuh drinking?
- No.
- Teetotal?
- No.
Reformer?
No, I don't regulate nobody's drinkin' just my own.
I've seen him lift a thousand...
- ln this sense, the term "law" includes any edict, decree, order, ordinance, statute, resolutión,- rule, etcetera.-
¡Uff!
, etcetera...
Well, my old Daddy taught me how to work, but he never taught me how to like it.
I reckon I better keep on with the lesson.
I'd rather keep on with something else.
You made a bad bargain making me the professor.
Well he told me about that too.
He said:
"When you make a bad bargain, hug it all the tighter."
But he didn't mean this kind of a bargain.
Well, don't you like it, Ann, when I hold you tight?
I guess every girl sorta likes that...
Now, Abe, what is law?
Well, professor, law is a rule of human conduct governing
Whoa!
Abe, I'ain't paying' you no forty cents a day to spark a pretty gal!
Well, Uncle Jimmie, I don't charge nothing extra for it just throw it in.
I'm expectin' a sight of rails cut of you.
He's the best rail-splitter in the country.
He'll be more than a rail-splitter.
How old are you, Uncle Jimmie?
Oh nearing' forty.
I'll get you out forty more rails than you expected.
Giddap!
Maybe you'd better make it nearing' seventy!
Now, Abe, your professor needs a seat where's there's more law and less temptatión.
Oh, Abe!
Ohhh!
Ohhhh!
- Are you all right, Anne?
- l think so.
- Are you hurt?
- My legs are still on me.
Scared me worse than it did you.
Did it, Abe?
You know, Anne, if anything happened to you, I don't think I could live.
Funny, Abe, I feel the same about you.
You taught me how to love.
Have I taught you to like it?
In the gloaming, oh, my darling,-
When the lights are dim and low,-
And the quiet shadows falling.-
Softly come and softly go.- lt's awful nice this time of day.
Yes, Abe.
Can I tell you a sort of a story, Anne?
Why of course, Abe.
Well, there was a town in Illinois called... called...
- New Salem?
- Yeh, that's it.
And in that town lived the prettiest girl in the world.
What was her name?
Anne Rutledge.
Oh, Abe...
What I'd like to find out about that girl is, she ever take a little time off to think about gettin' married?
Well, maybe.
'Cause there's an Abe Lincoln hanging around that's a pretty good catch.
What's he like?
Oh, he's a big merchant, owner of three stores all bankrupt.
Well, is he handsome?
His pa said that Abe had been cut out with an axe.
Politician too, I hear.
Yes, he's got less property and owes more debts than anybody ever running for the legislature.
Oh, Abe, you'll do all right when you get started.
There's something I'd like to start right now if I thought I could finish it.
You know, Anne, I... I've always done a lot of dreamin'
and lately it seems when I dream, your face gets mixed up in it.
Does it really, Abe?
Tell me about the mixin' I feel as though I'm going to be seeing your face till the day I die.
'Course I know that would be pretty hard for you to have to look at my face that long.
Everybody to their own opinión
Meaning?
I think... it's the dearest, kindest, most beautiful face in the whole world!
Oh, Anne...
Anne... I know that's just flattery but I love it.
You know I feel like little Jimmie Watkins, he got a hunk of gingerbread the other day and says:
"l guess there's nobody likes ginger bread like I does and gets so little of it".
Oh, Abe!
Anne, will you... will you marry me?
I mean, of course when I... when I...
get out of debt and can support you?
Well, you know, Abe, I've intended to for a long while that is, of course, if you asked me.
You... you mean?
Yes, Abe, you've got your gingerbread.
Oh, Anne!
Will you think of me and love me-
As you did once long ago?
-
How is she, Doctor?
Pretty bad.
She's been asking for you, Abe.
I came as soon as I could.
I had the fever pretty bad myself.
I've got to tell you the truth, Abe, lt's hopeless... perhaps by tomorrow... no longer.
I'm so glad you came, Abe.
Are you all right now?
Now, don't bother about me, dear.
I'm all right now.
I know the truth, dear.
It's good-bye.
No, no, Anne dear, you're not going to leave me!
I won't let you!
We must be brave, dear...
Don't take me away!
Don't take me away!
It's so dark and lonesome going!
Anne, you mustn't let go!
If they'd sing, I wouldn't be so afraid.
In the sweet by and by,-
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.-
We will meet there, dear.
Oh...
I love you so!
I love you so!
Feeling any better, Bowling?
No, not much.
I'll tell you, Doctor, he's just like a sick child...
He was lost for five days before we found him.
Yeh, I know.
We took his pocket-knife away from him, we were so afeard something might happen.
Good gracious, Abe, you're looking better!
No use trying to talk to him, he just cain't answer.
If we could only think of something that would just bring him back.
I guess time's the only thing.
Why should the spirit of mortal be proud, like a swift-fleeting meteor, fast-flying cloud?
Flash of the lightning, break of the wave,
He passes from life to his rest in the grave.
My goodness, Mary Todd, just think!
He'll be here in a few minutes the catch of America!
Stephen A. Douglas!
Just think of being his wife!
Don't be in such a hurry, sister.
I'm not even engaged much less married.
But if he should propose?
How do I know he's going further than anyone else in Springfield?
When I pick a husband, sister, I'll pick a man!
But I don't know what you're talking about.
A lot of people seem to think a man named Abraham Lincoln is going even further than Mr. Douglas.
Why, Mary Todd, have you gone crazy?
You compare an unknown cornfield lawyer with a brilliant cultured gentleman like Stephen A. Douglas!
Why, if you just saw the two of them together.
Oh, he's here!
Mr. Douglas is down in the parlor and he's asking for Mary!
Now, Mary, you must be very careful, and remember he doesn't like to have girls too bold.
Don't get so excited, sister, and don't hurry me.
I'll take care of myself.
You glide through the dance like grace itself Miss Todd.
Always the politician, Mr. Douglas!
Who wouldn't be a politician with so fair a constituent to win?
- Exquisite!
- The fan, Mr. Douglas?
No, the fair owner herself.
- May I look?
- Sr. Douglas... I wonder if you'd do me a great favor?
Yes.
Then, pray present me to this young lady.
- Miss Todd?
- Yes?
May I present one of the leading lawyers of Springfield
Mr. Abraham Lincoln?
Mr. Lincoln!
Miss Todd I wonder if you'd honor me with the next dance?
Why,... why... I'd be delighted.
Miss Todd, you thought my face was funny, and the way I dressed even funnier, but the joke's on you.
Why, I don't understand.
Wait till you dance with me.
Have you got the license, Mr. Lincoln?
Well, she got you.
I knew she would when she started out the first time for you.
Now, Billie, don't bother me.
I'm going to be married and I'm scared to death.
Oh, don't be alarmed.
There's many a bite that's worse than a bride's.
But, Billie, that woman scares me.
She's even got the ridiculous idea that I could get to be president.
Oh, don't take that seriously.
Every spunky girl thinks that her husband ought to be president.
I know, Billie, but it's a pity to fool her.
And she's a fine woman, smart as pepper and pretty too.
She'll be a great help to you, Mr. Lincoln, but you've got to keep climbing with her.
Yes... yes, I know.
I've got the best supper you've ever tasted and the cake... wait till you see that cake!
What can have happened to Mr.Lincoln?
It's long after the...
He would be late at his own wedding.
Now, never mind, Mary, if he doesn't come soon, I'll send John after him.
But he's hours late already!
Think of that!
Sister, calm yourself.
For heaven's sakes, you've got to hurry!
Billie, you... you go ahead.
You go on over and I'll come later.
I doubt if there's a word in the dictionary that could tell how I feel!
Billie, what does a man do if his head's all right but his legs are cowardly?
My cure is to get drunk.
My legs are too frightened to pay any attentión to liquor.
I'll go ahead and tell them that you're coming.
Anne!
Anne!
Anne!
We looked, everywhere, tort we can't find him.
No, can't find him...
not at the office.
What on earth happened to him?
He was in a terrible state when I left him.
He was so frightened and upset.
I imagine he just ran away.
Ran away... from me!
On our weddin' day!
Now sistern dear...
Don't 'sister' me!
Can you imagine!
That's what a Todd gets for engaging' herself to a country baboon!
- Listen, dear, you mustn't...
- You may as well all go home!
You hear me?
You may as well all go home!
Not goin' to be any wedding' here.
You can all go home as far as I'm concerned!
But this is so distressing!
You certainly are a matchmaker to reconcile those two after what happened two years ago.
We all like Mr. Lincoln, and Mary is just the girl to push him along.
Oh, Mary, how sweet you look!
What a lovely dress!
Yes, and so becoming to her too.
Maybe that's Mr. Lincoln now.
Julia it all seems so strange having things end this way.
It's just as it should end.
You and Mr. Lincoln will make a great man.
Good morning, Mr. Lincoln.
Good morning.
Come, my dear we'll leave the happy pair alone.
Good morning, Mary.
I,...
I...
Mary, you don't have to bother about me any more.
I think I've settled down at last.
I hope I can make your future all you desire.
We'll say no more about it, Mr. Lincoln.
I really think, after all, you need me.
You'll need a lot of patience to put up with me, Mary, but if anyone can do it, I'm sure you're the one.
Oh, Mary!
Douglas is a prize speaker, but just wait till old Abe gets ahold of him on slavery!
You're crazy!
Lincoln has no more chance of beating Douglas for Senate than I have.
He only went to school for three months.
There must be no issue of slavery.
We must face the facts.
I'll run Mr. Lincoln out of this campaign.
I will not throw mud.
Let each State mind its own business and this Republic can exist forever... divided into free and slave states.
We will not allow the extensión of slavery to any State.
We will not allow the secessión of any State.
Above all and before all, the Unión must be preserved.
A house divided against itself must fall!
- Douglas elected!
-
- Hurrah for Douglas!
-
- Douglas elected!
-
- Hurrah for Douglas!
-
- Douglas elected!
-
- Hurrah for Douglas!
-
Mary... I'm home, Mary.
You must be tired, Mr, Lincoln.
Sit down.
You just alt right here.
I'll get your supper for you in a minute.
Billy, I feel like the little boy who stubbed his toe.
It hurt too bad to laugh, and he was too big to cry.
I'm fifty years old, Billy, and a failure in everything.
If I died today, nobody'd ever know I'd lived.
Come in.
Mr. Lincoln, I want you to meet Mr. Pell one of the most important men in Eastern politics.
- l'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Pell.
- l'm honored, indeed, Mr. Lincoln.
- Meet my partner, Mr, Herndon.
- How do you do, Mr. Herndon?
Happy to meet you, sir.
- Won't you sit down, gentlemen?
- Thank you.
Mr. Lincoln, your campaign against Douglas has made you a national figure.
I'm here to ask you if you will consider being the Republican party's candidate for the presidency.
Did you say a failure in everything?
- A telegram for you, Mr. Fell.
- Oh thank you.
Mr. Lincoln, you know ever since John Brown's raid, the South has been infuriated, the East on the verge of revolt, and now New York threatens to quit the Unión.
No, no New York mustn't do that.
We must keep the front door on the hinge.
There can be no secessión.
The Unión must be preserved.
The crisis is at hand, Mr.Lincoln, and we believe you are the man.
Gentlemen, I feel deeply grateful.
Paw, Maw says if you don't come on home, you won't get no supper.
"l have another crisis; the soup and the country are boiling over together!"
Maw's boiling too!
It needs deep consideratión.
Well, Mr.Lincoln, mayn't we meet you at our hotel later?
- l'll be there within the hour?
- Thank you.
Come on, Paw, we're hungry.
They've started it.
This is gonna mean war!
This darkio saw it himself.
Brown and a gang of Abolxitionists have captured the armory at Harper's Ferry!
They're arming the slaves to rise up and murder us all.
They gived us all rifles.
And what'd you do with yours?
What'd I do?
I trowed it down, and I say, 'Feet, you travel'
- They can't invade Virginia.
- No!
Boys, go home and git your guns.
What's all this talk about guns?
This thing has gone far enough.
We'll be murdered in our beds by our own slaves.
Pardon me, ladies, while I find out about this desecratión.
- John Brown, eh?
- Abolitionists!
It's an outrage!
Outrage isn't the word.
I'll shoot on sight every Abolitionist who dares defile the soil of old Virginia.
- Who's he?
- That's the actor, John Wilkes Booth.
He can't act but the women don't know it.
All right, men, get your guns and we'll meet at the square!
At the square!
Can't say much for her dispositión!
Hush!
She may hear you.
Soldiers, indeed!
They can't even carry trunks.
Here you no, the stupid-looking one put that over there...
and you... idiot don't look at me like a duck in a thunderstorm!
Hurry... hurry!
Will you put them in there?
I never saw such a lot of incompetents.
And as for you with the whiskers, I told you to put it in there.
Oh, is it going to take forever?
Thank heavens, that's the last!
Imbeciles!
Well, Mary, we're here.
Thanks to me!
If it wasn't for my advice, you'd be out in Oregon, chopping trees.
Yes, you're always right, Mary.
I've found out one thing, Lincoln.
Servants here are no better than they are in Springfield.
This place hasn't been cleaned in a year.
Why, Mr. President!
Huh?
Then we agree that the situatión of our country is ominous.
- Most alarming.
- Certainly.
We agree that we must yield to the demands of the South and evacuate Fort Sumter.
- Absolutely.
- lt's the only solutión.
That must be done.
We agree that our President must be firmly guided by us.
That we must make every effort to control his inexperienced judgment.
- We certainly must.
- Yes.
Gentlemen...
- Mr. President.
- Good morning, Mr. President.
Thank you, Hay.
Thank you, gentlemen... I will shoulder all responsibilities.
The relief shall go to Fort Sumter.
That means war.
Mr. Seward, I am a man of peace, but the Unión shall be preserved.
Seventy-five thousand... lt might be difficult to get that many volunteers.
- Glory, glory Hallelujah,-
- Glory, glory Hallelujah!
-
- Glory, glory Hallelujah!
-
- His soul is marching on!
-
- Glory, glory Hallelujah,-
- Glory, glory Hallelujah!
-
Glory, glory Hallelujah!
-
- l wish I was in Dixie,-
- Hooray!
Hooray!
- - ln Dixieland I'll take my stand-
- To live and die in Dixie.-
- Away, away, away down South in Dixie,-
- Away, away, away down South in Dixie.-
- l wish I was in Dixie,-
- Hooray!
Hooray!
- - ln Dixieland I'll take my stand-
- To live and die in Dixie.-
- Away, away, away down South in Dixie,-
- Away, away, away down South in Dixie.-
President, the people demand a victory, and we've got to take Richmond.
The country is discouraged.
We must do something.
That reminds me of a story... about a man building a boat to cross a river.
He got impatient building the boat and started swimming.
Well, sir, what happened?
He drowned.
We've got to be careful not to drown this country.
Ready here!
Ready here!
- Quartermaster General.
- Yes, sir.
Ready here!
Ready here!
- Ready here!
- Sergeant, I'm going out.
- How did you make out?
- Make out?
He darned near kissed me.
- Who?
- The Secretary of War.
We're just licking the tar out of thorn all along the line.
- Who's next?
- l am.
I hope it's for the President.
I'd like to sec his face when he gets the good news.
Ready here!
Commissary.
For General Scott.
Marked private.
Rush it it's victory!
General Scott, what news?
We're winning, sir. I'm sure of it.
- l wish...
- Come in.
Rebel resistance broken at Bulll Run,- our army sweeping everything before it.-
President, if we can capture Richmond now, it means the end of the war.
- Ah, thank God.
- And you, sir... this victory will silence your enemies forever and you will be the greatest president in our history.
It doesn't matter what they think of me, General.
- We will have saved the Unión.
- Yes.
General, would you mind letting me have that telegram?
I'd like to show it to Mrs. Lincoln myself.
Why, certainly, not, Mr. President.
And would you mind not calling me 'Mr.President'..
just Lincoln.
All right, Lincoln.
Ready here!
Headquarters!
Sergeant, all messages for General Scott, hold.
All messages for General Scott hold.
All messages for General Scott hold.
Attentión!
Commanding officer.
At ease!
Ready here!
Bad news?
Give it to me.
Attentión the President!
At ease!
Well, General, what news now?
And the first reports?
Over-confidence.
Yes, I should have known.
lmpossible to reform lines.-
The men are a confused mob,- entirely demoralized.-
You must make every effort to save Washington.

Well, they're gathering.
The reserves are gathering, sir.
- How many regulars can we muster?
- About five thousand.
- Volunteers?
- Doubtful, sir.
Can we hold Washington?
We'll do our best sir.
Mr. Hay, is it true we have to get out of Washington?
It is very serious, madam.
For heaven's sake, what sort of an army have we anyhow?
They did the best they could, Mrs.Lincoln.
They might have considered us.
It'll take forever to get those trunks packed.
I'm sorry, madam, for all of us.
Mr.Lincoln, I hear we're leaving.
Just a moment, Mary, please.
After all the trouble we had getting here, I must say we've had a very short stay.
Mary, I've hung up my hat right here, and here it stays till they knock it off with a bayonet.
From now on, Mary, I'm going to run this war.
March!
Halt!
Headquarters, Post Number Four.
Halt!
Guard.
Forward March!
Counsel of the accused, have you nothing further to say in defense of the prisoner?
The court finds you guilty and the sentence death.
- Just a minute.
- The President... attentión!
You must pardon me, gentlemen, for this intrusión.
I overheard one of our soldiers sentenced to death.
Yes, Mr.President. A bad example of cowardice and desertión.
Well, young man, tell me about it.
I think the findings of the court were just, sir.
That all you have to say?
Sire, it was our first big battle.
We were trying to take a stone wall.
We'd been trying, it seems, for years...
Go on.
Finally, though, we got there.
I was fighting bayonets.
We were all crazy... on top of the wall...
Yes?
There was my boyhood chum, looking up at me from the ground.
Not alive, we had killed him a long time ago, but I knew him.
And then?
I guess I went really crazy, sir.
That's all.
The captain reports that you threw your rifle away.
Yes, sir.
That must be right, sir.
Making excuses, Colton?
No, sir only... get it over with, quick!
Hanging, killing, blood.
I'm tired.
But my generals are right, we must maintain discipline.
That's all.
Wait a minute.
Bring that young man back.
I have it!
- lt's a leg case.
- l beg your pardon, sir?
Leg case... yes, yes, my shelves are full of them, but not quite like this one.
If the Lord Almighty gives a man a cowardly pair of legs, and that man gets frightened,
he can't help his legs running away with him, can he?
Young man, I'm going to pardon you.
Go back and do your duty.
Oh, I will, sir!
I will!
I'm trusting you.
Well, Senator?
Mr. President, my state of New York is crying out against this endless slaughter.
And mine, sir.
They're holding services here today for those who were sacrificed, as they are everywhere.
From the East to the West, sir.
It can't go on, sir.
New England,the West, the entire country are in mourning for this useless waste of lives.
Let the Southern States go there wat, Mr. President, and we will go ours.
But I tell you, Mr. President...
- ...out of the wilderness,- - out of the wilderness.-
- Old Abe Lincoln- - came out of the wilderness,- down in lllinois.-
Daddy, mother won't let me stay up.
She wants me to go to bed, and I don't want to.
Don't you think it's time for little boys to be in bed, Tad?
- But I want to stay with you.
- But your mother?
If you say so, she can't make me.
You're the President.
You're the only person in the country who thinks I should have any authority.
- Run along now.
- No.
I want to stay with you.
Please, can't I, daddy?
No, we're very busy here now, Tad.
Run along.
All right, daddy.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Sleep tight.
Goodnight...
Gentlemen, don't you suppose my heart bleeds for all the sorrows this war has brought upon us?
Do you suppose there is a human being who wants peace more than I do.
But we want lasting peace, and we can have that only by preserving the Unión.
And, gentlemen... the Unión is going to be preserved!
- And by virtue of the power, and for the purpose aforesaid, l do order and declare that all persons held as slaves within said designated states and parts of states-
- are henceforward- - and forever shall be...- free.-
Well, gentlemen, it is done.
- More bad news, Hay?
- l'm afraid there is.
Well, let's have it.
The Secret Service reports that there are 600.000 pperheads in the North and under cath and arme
- To get me?
- Yes.
That many ought to keep me dodging.
We're taking every precautión to guard you.
Where are they mostly?
Ohio has one 100.000 armed men ready to rise up and depose you.
Illionois, 135.000.
Illinois, my old stamping ground...
That makes me feel badly.
You mustn't tell Mary.
But Mr. President, we are worried about you.
Don't mind me, Hay.
Go on to bed, you're tired.
Lincoln, come on to bed.
I'm worried, Mary.
You can't win this war worrying and walking around in your stocking feet.
I can't sleep.
Neither can I.
At least we could sleep in Springfield, couldn't we?
Did we ever sleep?
Now, stand still.
I've got it, Mary.
I've found the man to win this war and his name is Grant.
I'm sorry, Mr. President, but smoking is one of my most persistent habits.
And winning victories is another.
Thank you.
Then you do believe in me, Sir?
I sent for you.
General, the North is desperate.
We need you.
And, should I assume command, there will be no interference?
None. I promise you that.
Grant,...
Lieutenant-General is the highest army command the President can bestow.
We haven't had one since General Washington.
He was a fair sort of a soldier too.
Lieutenant-General Grant,... my orders are:
Win the War.
I'll give my best, Mr. President.
I know you will.
Unfortunately many of us have failed to recognize a great Confederate Soldier.
Lee.
On the other hand, we have thus far failed to take advantage of a great Northern Soldier.
I hope I am not too late in correcting the error.
Mr. President, I think it only fair to warn you that many people, don't approve of me.
Nor of me.
But rest assured there will be no interference, no intrusión.
Well, of all things!
Who locked this door?
My wife!
All right, Mary.
Land sakes!
Where did all the smoke come from?
Mary, meet General Grant.
Mrs. Lincoln.
- lt's a pleasure to meet the first lady.
- Thank you.
- l want to talk to you.
Mr. Lincoln.
- But Mary, we... I want to talk to you about discharging some of the servants in this house.
I don't see how anybody could talk in here with all this smoke.
Why don't you open the window?
I can't stand it!
Pardon me, General.
I'll have to talk to you later.
- l'm very sorry if...
- There no apoligies, General.
You've given me an idea.
I may take up smoking myself.
But to resume, General.
We will give you all the help you need.
Every man capable of bearing arms shall go.
We've got to win this war.
It is a duty we owe the South as well as the North.
It's a big job, Mr. President...
a big job.
but thy will be done.
Thy will be done.
We're in a tight place now.
Yes, we generally are, Stanton.
Everything depends upon Sheridan.
He's a fighting Irishman.
Then why doesn't he fight?
- One división Sheridan's - - army routed.-
Now trying to hold left flank.-
Oh, the blood it takes to hold this Unión together.
It will undo everything Grant has done. lt's hopeless.
I don't think so...
Before each victory I've had a visión of a ship with white sails.
That visión has just conic to me.
With all respect, I'd rather trade your ship for good news from Sheridan.
is that General Sheridan in there?
Sure 'tis General Sheridan.
Doesn't that sound like cannon fire?
I don't hear anything, sir.
Hey, come here.
Have you good ears?
Pretty good when they're washed.
Then try them.
Do you hear anything like cannon fire?
It's cannon all right, over by the swamp.
They may have caught General Wright by surprise!
Mount those shorses!
- Sheridan's entire army- - has met an overwhelming defeat.-
Incredible.
And no word from Sheridan.
I'm afraid he was away.
It means the defeat of all our plans.
Yes, for we'll have to withdraw Grant from Richmond to protect Washington.
Come on, boys!
Come on!
General, the right wing is in full retreat.
lmpossible to hold our positión, sir.
Tell Colonel Tolliver to reform and hold at all costs.
We're going back!
Officers, reform your men!
We're going back!
- Come on boys, let's go!
- Let's go, boys!
Forward!
Forward to victory!
- Down with, the traitor,- - up with the star!
-
- While we rally- - 'round the flag boys,-
- We'll rally- - once again,- shouting the battle cry of freedom!
-
Yes, we'll rally 'round the flag, boys-
We'll rally once again,-
Shouting the battle cry of freedom,-
- We will rally from the hillside,-
- We'll gather from the plain.-
Shouting the battle cry of freedom,-
- The Unión forever,- - hurrah, boys, hurrah!
-
- Sown with the traitor,- - up with the star.-
While we rally round the flag boys,-
We'll rally once again,-
Shouting the battle cry of freedom,-
Arrived in time to reform forces.-
Have struck the enemy and have won an overwhelming victory.
Sheridan.- l knew it.
Better and better.
Look!
Here.
Tremendous number of prisoners.
Prisoners?
I hope there's nothing but prisoners from now on.
The ship, Stanton!
Yes, Mr. President, and Sheridan!
Surrender... my poor army!
I'd rather die a thousand deaths than do that to them.
There, General, you must lie down and rest.
Rest... that's a beautiful word...
They've caught a spy and they want the order for his executión approved.
Colonel Marshall... who was that?
- Only a courier, sir.
- What did he want?
They've caught a spy.
I approved the executión order, sir.
Colonel,... the only reason for shooting a spy is the protectión of an army, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
Well,... you and I know that this army can't exist much longer.
Isn't that right?
Yes, sir.
That is why I am unwilling that there shall be a single life lost unnecessarily.
Colonel... I wonder if you'd mind countermanding that order.
I will.
Yes, sir.
Tired, Grant?
Not much.
Mr. President, we have them.
It can only last a few days more.
General Sherman and I are glad of this chance to talk with you.
The Unión...
we've saved it at last.
They must surrender soon.
The Unión...
We'll have 'em all back...
United, free...
one Country.
And meanwhile, Mr. President?
I've heard the country wishes all rebel property confiscated and the rebel generals, such as Lee, shot for treason.
He's put up a grand battle.
And they've robbed the cradle and the grave, sir.
Lee is fighting with his last breath.
Shoot Robert E. Lee?
Someone will have to shoot Abraham Lincoln first.
They're rebels, not traitors.
And their horses and baggage, sir?
They'll need them for the spring plowing.
Let 'em keep 'em and get to work.
Very good, sir.
Just one thing more, Mr.President... the head of the rebel government Jefferson Davis?
Jefferson Davis...
Do you wish his capture?
That reminds me of a story.
We had a terrible drunkard once in Springfield.
Finally he signed the pledge.
Next day he got thirsty and went to a bar and ordered a lemonade.
While the bartender was fixing it, the old drunk got sadder and sadder.
Finally he leaned over and said to the bartender,
"Mike, while you're fixin' that, couldn't you put a nice little shot of whiskey in, unbeknownst to meself?"
Well, sir?
Couldn't you sort of lot Jeff Davis escape, unbeknownst to yourselves?
We'll do our part, sir.
We're going to take them back as though they'd never been away.
Lincoln...
He freed the negroes.
He's supressed the right of a trail by jury.
He muzzled the press!
Now, wiht the oid of this "butternuts", his army and his negroes, he make himself
King of the América.
Lincoln!
I drink to him... and his domatión!
Right,... you're right.
On my part...
Go on, you're among friends...
The man who kills Abraham Lincoln will be inmortal.
Now, listen... I have a plan... and I'm going in.
Do you mind my smoking, Mrs. Lincoln?
No, not much.
You don't know how glad we all are that you were reelected, Mr. President.
I'm sure this lady will be glad to spend four more years in the White House.
Glad?
I've just hired two new maids.
Lincoln, will you ever learn to keep your feet in shoes?
Mrs. Lincoln, have you met General Grant?
I met him. lt took us a week to get the smoke out of the curtains.
Yes, Oglesby, he's one human being who has faults.
A party of prohibitionists, called on me the other day and complained about Grant's drinking.
I told 'em if I knew what brand he uses, I'd send barrels of it to my other generals.
Two new maids... lf we're going to be here four more years...
Four years...
four more years...
Mr. Lincoln, don't you go thinking about of those dreams again.
You'll live two hundred and after we'll celebrate it right over here, we'll travel around the world and have a nice long rest.
Oh, Daddy!
, Would that be fun?
- You're not going without me...?
- Why, of course not, Tad.
You can depend on Mother Surratt, and everything is straight with me.
I said I'd go through with it, and I will.
Tonight will be remembered throughout the ages.
I play my best part.
How much better a dagger would look,
Cassius used a dagger,
but this is safer.
- Speech!
- Speech!
- Speech!
- Speech!
Again I say, with malice toward none,
with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right,
we shall bind up the natión's wounds and cherish peace.
That government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.
Thank you.
God bless you all.
Mr. Lincoln, I'm just proud of you!
- Peanuts, hold the horse for me?
- Yes.
Will you be long, sir?
No, not very long.
Dundreary, would you mind bringing me a wrap?
I feel a draught.
I'm afraid you must be mistaken.
Mr. Lincoln... has just stopped the draft.
I reckon I'm going to feel right to home here, b'gosh!
I would be too if it wasn't for that 'ternal servant-critter with brass buttons on his coat.
He just swells out his big bosom like a turkey cock in laying' time, looks at me as if I meant to esquatulate with the spoons.
I reckon they don't know who they're dealin' with, but I'll show 'em.
I'm as obstinate as Deacon Stumpp's forelock.
"lt wouldn't lie down; it couldn't stand up,"
wouldn't point forward and couldn't go backward.
I don't know what they're going to do with me, but whatever they do do and wherever they put me, I hope it's outa the reach of that jackass.
I'm a real hoss, I am, and I get kinda riley with them critters.
They say I don't know the manners of good society too, but I guess I know enough to turn that old gal inside out,
the sock-dollaging old mantrap.
But I dare no more kill her than I dare ask Queen Victoria to dance a Cape Cod reel.
Sic semper tyrannis!
Mr. Lincoln, Mr. Lincoln has been shot!
Get a doctor!
Somebody get a doctor!
Glory, glory Hallelujah!
-
Glory, glory Hallelujah!
-
Glory, glory Hallelujah!
-
His soul is marching on!
-

Shucks, he'never amount to nothin' nohow!

Abraham.
There he is.
Ugliest, laziest, smartest man in New Salem.
- Ain't yuh, Abe?
- I don't mind my face, I'm behind it.
It's the people in front that get jarred.
Whip any man in shoo leather I At least, I hope he can.
Offut does the braggin' I do the runnin'
You better dust off them shoes then, stranger, 'cause you ain't here for long.
Well, I was aimin' to settle here awhile.

- Well, I'm a peaceable man.
Wait till Jack Armstrong gets hold o' yuh.
He'll throw yuh out that door like yuh was a sack o' meal!
- Big fellow?
- No bigger'n you, but he's champeen o' this country he ain' never been licked.
And when he sees you...
Folks can't even spit without his sayso.
Chuck me outa that door, you say?
Like a sack o' meal.
Well, that's a pretty long chuck for a peaceful man.
Whar be he?
Now, Armstrong, cain't you leave us be?
Yuh just busted up old man Simpson's place and scattered his new place all over the county.
Man, don't you ever rest?
Whare be he?
That yellow-livered baboon from Indianny!
I come from Indianny, but not that part.
Well, get down!
Let's see what bones I wants to crack first!
Get a good hold, Jack!
Come on, an' get yer neck broke!
This is the neatest wrestle you've ever had.
Go to him, Champ!

Abraham Lincoln.
Well, we're goin' to make yuh one of us.
Come on, boys, I'll set 'em up!
It's about time you set 'em up.
Let's have some o' that rattlesnake bite.
He said he was a peaceful man.
He meant peaceful like a wildcat!
Yeh, that's what he thought.
Looks like good corn liquor.
That is corn liquor.
Come on, Abe.
Where's yours?
No, I don't care much for it.
Come on, have a drink, Abe.
Well, I'll drink if you'll take it like I do.
How's that?
Lift up the barrel, and drink it outa the bung.
Well, I'll show you boys.
Maybe can, maybe can't.
Try it, anyway.
Whew!
He's the strongest man in Salem!
I told you he was the strongest man.
I've seen him lift 500 pounds in each hand.
- Ain't yuh drinking?
- No.
- Teetotal?
- No.
Reformer?
No, I don't regulate nobody's drinkin' just my own.
I've seen him lift a thousand...
- In this sense, the term "law" includes any edict, decree, order, ordinance, statute, resolutión,- rule, etcetera. -
¡Uff!
, etcetera...
Well, my old Daddy taught me how to work, but he never taught me how to like it.
I reckon I better keep on with the lesson.
I'd rather keep on with something else.
You made a bad bargain making me the professor.
Well he told me about that too.
He said:
"When you make a bad bargain, hug it all the tighter".
But he didn't mean this kind of a bargain.
Well, don't you like it, Ann, when I hold you tight?
I guess every girl sorta likes that...
Now, Abe, what is law?
Well, professor, law is a rule of human conduct governing
Whoa!
Abe, I'ain't paying' you no forty cents a day to spark a pretty gal!
Well, Uncle Jimmie, I don't charge nothing extra for it just throw it in.
I'm expectin' a sight of rails cut of you.
He's the best rail-splitter in the country.
He'll be more than a rail-splitter.
How old are you, Uncle Jimmie?
Oh nearing' forty.
I'll get you out forty more rails than you expected.
Giddap!
Maybe you'd better make it nearing' seventy!
Now, Abe, your professor needs a seat where's there's more law and less temptatión.
Oh, Abe!
Ohhh!
Ohhhh!
- Are you all right, Anne?
- I think so.
- Are you hurt?
- My legs are still on me.
Scared me worse than it did you.
Did it, Abe?
You know, Anne, if anything happened to you, I don't think I could live.
Funny, Abe, I feel the same about you.
You taught me how to love.
Have I taught you to like it?
In the gloaming, oh, my darling,-
When the lights are dim and low,-
And the quiet shadows falling. -
Softly come and softly go. -
It's awful nice this time of day.
Yes, Abe.
Can I tell you a sort of a story, Anne?
Why of course, Abe.
Well, there was a town in Illinois called... called...
- New Salem?
- Yeh, that's it.
And in that town lived the prettiest girl in the world.
What was her name?
Anne Rutledge.
Oh, Abe...
What I'd like to find out about that girl is, she ever take a little time off to think about gettin' married?
Well, maybe.
'Cause there's an Abe Lincoln hanging around that's a pretty good catch.
What's he like?
Oh, he's a big merchant, owner of three stores all bankrupt.
Well, is he handsome?
His pa said that Abe had been cut out with an axe.
Politician too, I hear.
Yes, he's got less property and owes more debts than anybody ever running for the legislature.
Oh, Abe, you'll do all right when you get started.
There's something I'd like to start right now if I thought I could finish it.
You know, Anne, I...
I've always done a lot of dreamin' and lately it seems when I dream,
your face gets mixed up in it.
Does it really, Abe?
Tell me about the mixin'
I feel as though I'm going to be seeing your face till the day I die.
'Course I know that would be pretty hard for you to have to look at my face that long.
Everybody to their own opinión
Meaning?
I think... it's the dearest, kindest, most beautiful face in the whole world!
Oh, Anne...
Anne...
I know that's just flattery but I love it.
You know I feel like little Jimmie Watkins, he got a hunk of gingerbread the other day and says:
"I guess there's nobody likes ginger bread like I does and gets so little of it".
Oh, Abe!
Anne, will you... will you marry me?
I mean, of course when I... when I...
get out of debt and can support you?
Well, you know, Abe, I've intended to for a long while that is, of course, if you asked me.
You... you mean?
Yes, Abe, you've got your gingerbread.
Oh, Anne!
Will you think of me and love me-
As you did once long ago?
-
How is she, Doctor?
Pretty bad.
She's been asking for you, Abe.
I came as soon as I could.
I had the fever pretty bad myself.
I've got to tell you the truth, Abe,
It's hopeless... perhaps by tomorrow... no longer.
I'm so glad you came, Abe.
Are you all right now?
Now, don't bother about me, dear.
I'm all right now.
I know the truth, dear.
It's good-bye.
No, no, Anne dear, you're not going to leave me!
I won't let you!
We must be brave, dear...
Don't take me away!
Don't take me away!
It's so dark and lonesome going!
Anne, you mustn't let go!
If they'd sing, I wouldn't be so afraid.
In the sweet by and by,-
We shall meet on that beautiful shore. -
We will meet there, dear.
Oh...
I love you so!
I love you so!
Feeling any better, Bowling?
No, not much.
I'll tell you, Doctor, he's just like a sick child...
He was lost for five days before we found him.
Yeh, I know.
We took his pocket-knife away from him, we were so afeard something might happen.
Good gracious, Abe, you're looking better!
No use trying to talk to him, he just cain't answer.
If we could only think of something that would just bring him back.
I guess time's the only thing.
Why should the spirit of mortal be proud, like a swift-fleeting meteor, fast-flying cloud?
Flash of the lightning, break of the wave,
He passes from life to his rest in the grave.
My goodness, Mary Todd, just think!
He'll be here in a few minutes the catch of America!
Stephen A. Douglas!
Just think of being his wife!
Don't be in such a hurry, sister.
I'm not even engaged much less married.
But if he should propose?
How do I know he's going further than anyone else in Springfield?
When I pick a husband, sister, I'll pick a man!
But I don't know what you're talking about.
A lot of people seem to think a man named Abraham Lincoln is going even further than Mr. Douglas.
Why, Mary Todd, have you gone crazy?
You compare an unknown cornfield lawyer with a brilliant cultured gentleman like Stephen A. Douglas!
Why, if you just saw the two of them together.
Oh, he's here!
Mr. Douglas is down in the parlor and he's asking for Mary!
Now, Mary, you must be very careful, and remember he doesn't like to have girls too bold.
Don't get so excited, sister, and don't hurry me.
I'll take care of myself.
You glide through the dance like grace itself Miss Todd.
Always the politician, Mr. Douglas!
Who wouldn't be a politician with so fair a constituent to win?
- Exquisite!
- The fan, Mr. Douglas?
No, the fair owner herself.
- May I look?
- Sr. Douglas...
I wonder if you'd do me a great favor?
Yes.
Then, pray present me to this young lady.
- Miss Todd?
- Yes?
May I present one of the leading lawyers of Springfield
Mr. Abraham Lincoln?
Mr. Lincoln!
Miss Todd I wonder if you'd honor me with the next dance?
Why,... why...
I'd be delighted.
Miss Todd, you thought my face was funny, and the way I dressed even funnier, but the joke's on you.
Why, I don't understand.
Wait till you dance with me.
Have you got the license, Mr. Lincoln?
Well, she got you.
I knew she would when she started out the first time for you.
Now, Billie, don't bother me.
I'm going to be married and I'm scared to death.
Oh, don't be alarmed.
There's many a bite that's worse than a bride's.
But, Billie, that woman scares me.
She's even got the ridiculous idea that I could get to be president.
Oh, don't take that seriously.
Every spunky girl thinks that her husband ought to be president.
I know, Billie, but it's a pity to fool her.
And she's a fine woman, smart as pepper and pretty too.
She'll be a great help to you, Mr. Lincoln, but you've got to keep climbing with her.
Yes... yes, I know.
I've got the best supper you've ever tasted and the cake... wait till you see that cake!
What can have happened to Mr. Lincoln?
It's long after the...
He would be late at his own wedding.
Now, never mind, Mary, if he doesn't come soon, I'll send John after him.
But he's hours late already!
Think of that!
Sister, calm yourself.
For heaven's sakes, you've got to hurry!
Billie, you... you go ahead.
You go on over and I'll come later.
I doubt if there's a word in the dictionary that could tell how I feel!
Billie, what does a man do if his head's all right but his legs are cowardly?
My cure is to get drunk.
My legs are too frightened to pay any attentión to liquor.
I'll go ahead and tell them that you're coming.
Anne!
Anne!
Anne!
We looked, everywhere, tort we can't find him.
No, can't find him...
not at the office.
What on earth happened to him?
He was in a terrible state when I left him.
He was so frightened and upset.
I imagine he just ran away.
Ran away... from me!
On our weddin' day!
Now sistern dear...
Don't 'sister' me!
Can you imagine!
That's what a Todd gets for engaging' herself to a country baboon!
- Listen, dear, you mustn't...
- You may as well all go home!
You hear me?
You may as well all go home!
Not goin' to be any wedding' here.
You can all go home as far as I'm concerned!
But this is so distressing!
You certainly are a matchmaker to reconcile those two after what happened two years ago.
We all like Mr. Lincoln, and Mary is just the girl to push him along.
Oh, Mary, how sweet you look!
What a lovely dress!
Yes, and so becoming to her too.
Maybe that's Mr. Lincoln now.
Julia it all seems so strange having things end this way.
It's just as it should end.
You and Mr. Lincoln will make a great man.
Good morning, Mr. Lincoln.
Good morning.
Come, my dear we'll leave the happy pair alone.
Good morning, Mary.
I,...
I...
Mary, you don't have to bother about me any more.
I think I've settled down at last.
I hope I can make your future all you desire.
We'll say no more about it, Mr. Lincoln.
I really think, after all, you need me.
You'll need a lot of patience to put up with me, Mary, but if anyone can do it, I'm sure you're the one.
Oh, Mary!
Douglas is a prize speaker, but just wait till old Abe gets ahold of him on slavery!
You're crazy!
Lincoln has no more chance of beating Douglas for Senate than I have.
He only went to school for three months.
There must be no issue of slavery.
We must face the facts.
I'll run Mr. Lincoln out of this campaign.
I will not throw mud.
Let each State mind its own business and this Republic can exist forever... divided into free and slave states.
We will not allow the extensión of slavery to any State.
We will not allow the secessión of any State.
Above all and before all, the Unión must be preserved.
A house divided against itself must fall!
- Douglas elected!
-
- Hurrah for Douglas!
-
- Douglas elected!
-
- Hurrah for Douglas!
-
- Douglas elected!
-
- Hurrah for Douglas!
-
Mary...
I'm home, Mary.
You must be tired, Mr, Lincoln.
Sit down.
You just alt right here.
I'll get your supper for you in a minute.
Billy, I feel like the little boy who stubbed his toe.
It hurt too bad to laugh, and he was too big to cry.
I'm fifty years old, Billy, and a failure in everything.
If I died today, nobody'd ever know I'd lived.
Come in.
Mr. Lincoln, I want you to meet Mr. Pell one of the most important men in Eastern politics.
- I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Pell.
- I'm honored, indeed, Mr. Lincoln.
- Meet my partner, Mr, Herndon.
- How do you do, Mr. Herndon?
Happy to meet you, sir.
- Won't you sit down, gentlemen?
- Thank you.
Mr. Lincoln, your campaign against Douglas has made you a national figure.
I'm here to ask you if you will consider being the Republican party's candidate for the presidency.
Did you say a failure in everything?
- A telegram for you, Mr. Fell.
- Oh thank you.
Mr. Lincoln, you know ever since John Brown's raid, the South has been infuriated, the East on the verge of revolt, and now New York threatens to quit the Unión.
No, no New York mustn't do that.
We must keep the front door on the hinge.
There can be no secessión.
The Unión must be preserved.
The crisis is at hand, Mr. Lincoln, and we believe you are the man.
Gentlemen, I feel deeply grateful.
Paw, Maw says if you don't come on home, you won't get no supper.
"I have another crisis; the soup and the country are boiling over together!"
Maw's boiling too!
It needs deep consideratión.
Well, Mr. Lincoln, mayn't we meet you at our hotel later?
- I'll be there within the hour?
- Thank you.
Come on, Paw, we're hungry.
They've started it.
This is gonna mean war!
This darkio saw it himself.
Brown and a gang of Abolxitionists have captured the armory at Harper's Ferry!
They're arming the slaves to rise up and murder us all.
They gived us all rifles.
And what'd you do with yours?
What'd I do?
I trowed it down, and I say, 'Feet, you travel'
- They can't invade Virginia.
- No!
Boys, go home and git your guns.
What's all this talk about guns?
This thing has gone far enough.
We'll be murdered in our beds by our own slaves.
Pardon me, ladies, while I find out about this desecratión.
- John Brown, eh?
- Abolitionists!
It's an outrage!
Outrage isn't the word.
I'll shoot on sight every Abolitionist who dares defile the soil of old Virginia.
- Who's he?
- That's the actor, John Wilkes Booth.
He can't act but the women don't know it.
All right, men, get your guns and we'll meet at the square!
At the square!
Can't say much for her dispositión!
Hush!
She may hear you.
Soldiers, indeed!
They can't even carry trunks.
Here you no, the stupid-looking one put that over there...
and you... idiot don't look at me like a duck in a thunderstorm!
Hurry... hurry!
Will you put them in there?
I never saw such a lot of incompetents.
And as for you with the whiskers, I told you to put it in there.
Oh, is it going to take forever?
Thank heavens, that's the last!
Imbeciles!
Well, Mary, we're here.
Thanks to me!
If it wasn't for my advice, you'd be out in Oregon, chopping trees.
Yes, you're always right, Mary.
I've found out one thing, Lincoln.
Servants here are no better than they are in Springfield.
This place hasn't been cleaned in a year.
Why, Mr. President!
Huh?
Then we agree that the situatión of our country is ominous.
- Most alarming.
- Certainly.
We agree that we must yield to the demands of the South and evacuate Fort Sumter.
- Absolutely.
- It's the only solutión.
That must be done.
We agree that our President must be firmly guided by us.
That we must make every effort to control his inexperienced judgment.
- We certainly must.
- Yes.
Gentlemen...
- Mr. President.
- Good morning, Mr. President.
Thank you, Hay.
Thank you, gentlemen...
I will shoulder all responsibilities.
The relief shall go to Fort Sumter.
That means war.
Mr. Seward, I am a man of peace, but the Unión shall be preserved.
Seventy-five thousand...
It might be difficult to get that many volunteers.
- Glory, glory Hallelujah,-
- Glory, glory Hallelujah!
-
- Glory, glory Hallelujah!
-
- His soul is marching on!
-
- Glory, glory Hallelujah,-
- Glory, glory Hallelujah!
-
Glory, glory Hallelujah!
-
- I wish I was in Dixie,-
- Hooray!
Hooray!
-
- In Dixieland I'll take my stand-
- To live and die in Dixie. -
- Away, away, away down South in Dixie,-
- Away, away, away down South in Dixie. -
- I wish I was in Dixie,-
- Hooray!
Hooray!
-
- In Dixieland I'll take my stand-
- To live and die in Dixie. -
- Away, away, away down South in Dixie,-
- Away, away, away down South in Dixie. -
President, the people demand a victory, and we've got to take Richmond.
The country is discouraged.
We must do something.
That reminds me of a story... about a man building a boat to cross a river.
He got impatient building the boat and started swimming.
Well, sir, what happened?
He drowned.
We've got to be careful not to drown this country.
Ready here!
Ready here!
- Quartermaster General.
- Yes, sir.
Ready here!
Ready here!
- Ready here!
- Sergeant, I'm going out.
- How did you make out?
- Make out?
He darned near kissed me.
- Who?
- The Secretary of War.
We're just licking the tar out of thorn all along the line.
- Who's next?
- I am.
I hope it's for the President.
I'd like to sec his face when he gets the good news.
Ready here!
Commissary.
For General Scott.
Marked private.
Rush it it's victory!
General Scott, what news?
We're winning, sir.
I'm sure of it.
- I wish...
- Come in.
Rebel resistance broken at Bulll Run,- our army sweeping everything before it. -
President, if we can capture Richmond now, it means the end of the war.
- Ah, thank God.
- And you, sir... this victory will silence your enemies forever and you will be the greatest president in our history.
It doesn't matter what they think of me, General.
- We will have saved the Unión.
- Yes.
General, would you mind letting me have that telegram?
I'd like to show it to Mrs. Lincoln myself.
Why, certainly, not, Mr. President.
And would you mind not calling me 'Mr. President'..
just Lincoln.
All right, Lincoln.
Ready here!
Headquarters!
Sergeant, all messages for General Scott, hold.
All messages for General Scott hold.
All messages for General Scott hold.
Attentión!
Commanding officer.
At ease!
Ready here!
Bad news?
Give it to me.
Attentión the President!
At ease!
Well, General, what news now?
And the first reports?
Over-confidence.
Yes, I should have known.
Impossible to reform lines. -
The men are a confused mob,- entirely demoralized. -
You must make every effort to save Washington.

Battalion!
On right into line, March!
Company, halt!
Left turn!
Right turn!
Halt!
First Company, right by fours.
Halt!
Forward!
Halt!
Forward!
Well, they're gathering.
The reserves are gathering, sir.
- How many regulars can we muster?
- About five thousand.
- Volunteers?
- Doubtful, sir.
Can we hold Washington?
We'll do our best sir.
Mr. Hay, is it true we have to get out of Washington?
It is very serious, madam.
For heaven's sake, what sort of an army have we anyhow?
They did the best they could, Mrs. Lincoln.
They might have considered us.
It'll take forever to get those trunks packed.
I'm sorry, madam, for all of us.
Mr. Lincoln, I hear we're leaving.
Just a moment, Mary, please.
After all the trouble we had getting here,
I must say we've had a very short stay.
Mary, I've hung up my hat right here, and here it stays till they knock it off with a bayonet.
From now on, Mary, I'm going to run this war.
March!
Halt!
Headquarters, Post Number Four.
Halt!
Guard.
Forward March!
Counsel of the accused, have you nothing further to say in defense of the prisoner?
The court finds you guilty and the sentence death.
- Just a minute.
- The President... attentión!
You must pardon me, gentlemen, for this intrusión.
I overheard one of our soldiers sentenced to death.
Yes, Mr. President.
A bad example of cowardice and desertión.
Well, young man, tell me about it.
I think the findings of the court were just, sir.
That all you have to say?
Sire, it was our first big battle.
We were trying to take a stone wall.
We'd been trying, it seems, for years...
Go on.
Finally, though, we got there.
I was fighting bayonets.
We were all crazy... on top of the wall...
Yes?
There was my boyhood chum, looking up at me from the ground.
Not alive, we had killed him a long time ago, but I knew him.
And then?
I guess I went really crazy, sir.
That's all.
The captain reports that you threw your rifle away.
Yes, sir.
That must be right, sir.
Making excuses, Colton?
No, sir only... get it over with, quick!
Hanging, killing, blood.
I'm tired.
But my generals are right, we must maintain discipline.
That's all.
Wait a minute.
Bring that young man back.
I have it!
- It's a leg case.
- I beg your pardon, sir?
Leg case... yes, yes, my shelves are full of them, but not quite like this one.
If the Lord Almighty gives a man a cowardly pair of legs, and that man gets frightened,
he can't help his legs running away with him, can he?
Young man, I'm going to pardon you.
Go back and do your duty.
Oh, I will, sir!
I will!
I'm trusting you.
Well, Senator?
Mr. President, my state of New York is crying out against this endless slaughter.
And mine, sir.
They're holding services here today for those who were sacrificed, as they are everywhere.
From the East to the West, sir.
It can't go on, sir.
New England,the West, the entire country are in mourning for this useless waste of lives.
Let the Southern States go there wat, Mr. President, and we will go ours.
But I tell you, Mr. President...
- ... out of the wilderness,- - out of the wilderness. -
- Old Abe Lincoln- - came out of the wilderness,- down in Illinois. -
Daddy, mother won't let me stay up.
She wants me to go to bed, and I don't want to.
Don't you think it's time for little boys to be in bed, Tad?
- But I want to stay with you.
- But your mother?
If you say so, she can't make me.
You're the President.
You're the only person in the country who thinks I should have any authority.
- Run along now.
- No.
I want to stay with you.
Please, can't I, daddy?
No, we're very busy here now, Tad.
Run along.
All right, daddy.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Sleep tight.
Goodnight...
Gentlemen, don't you suppose my heart bleeds for all the sorrows this war has brought upon us?
Do you suppose there is a human being who wants peace more than I do.
But we want lasting peace, and we can have that only by preserving the Unión.
And, gentlemen... the Unión is going to be preserved!
- And by virtue of the power,- - and for the purpose aforesaid,-
- I do order and declare that all persons held as slaves within said designated states and parts of states are henceforward and forever shall be... - free. -
Well, gentlemen, it is done.
- More bad news, Hay?
- I'm afraid there is.
Well, let's have it.
The Secret Service reports that there are 600.000 pperheads in the North and under cath and arme
- To get me?
- Yes.
That many ought to keep me dodging.
We're taking every precautión to guard you.
Where are they mostly?
Ohio has one 100.000 armed men ready to rise up and depose you.
Illionois, 135.000.
Illinois, my old stamping ground...
That makes me feel badly.
You mustn't tell Mary.
But Mr. President, we are worried about you.
Don't mind me, Hay.
Go on to bed, you're tired.
Lincoln, come on to bed.
I'm worried, Mary.
You can't win this war worrying and walking around in your stocking feet.
I can't sleep.
Neither can I. At least we could sleep in Springfield, couldn't we?
Did we ever sleep?
Now, stand still.
I've got it, Mary.
I've found the man to win this war and his name is Grant.
I'm sorry, Mr. President, but smoking is one of my most persistent habits.
And winning victories is another.
Thank you.
Then you do believe in me, Sir?
I sent for you.
General, the North is desperate.
We need you.
And, should I assume command, there will be no interference?
None.
I promise you that.
Grant,...
Lieutenant-General is the highest army command the President can bestow.
We haven't had one since General Washington.
He was a fair sort of a soldier too.
Lieutenant-General Grant,... my orders are:
Win the War.
I'll give my best, Mr. President.
I know you will.
Unfortunately many of us have failed to recognize a great Confederate Soldier.
Lee.
On the other hand, we have thus far failed to take advantage of a great Northern Soldier.
I hope I am not too late in correcting the error.
Mr. President, I think it only fair to warn you that many people, don't approve of me.
Nor of me.
But rest assured there will be no interference, no intrusión.
Well, of all things!
Who locked this door?
My wife!
All right, Mary.
Land sakes!
Where did all the smoke come from?
Mary, meet General Grant.
Mrs. Lincoln.
- It's a pleasure to meet the first lady.
- Thank you.
- I want to talk to you.
Mr. Lincoln.
- But Mary, we...
I want to talk to you about discharging some of the servants in this house.
I don't see how anybody could talk in here with all this smoke.
Why don't you open the window?
I can't stand it!
Pardon me, General.
I'll have to talk to you later.
- I'm very sorry if...
- There no apoligies, General.
You've given me an idea.
I may take up smoking myself.
But to resume, General.
We will give you all the help you need.
Every man capable of bearing arms shall go.
We've got to win this war.
It is a duty we owe the South as well as the North.
It's a big job, Mr. President...
a big job.
but thy will be done.
Thy will be done.
We're in a tight place now.
Yes, we generally are, Stanton.
Everything depends upon Sheridan.
He's a fighting Irishman.
Then why doesn't he fight?
- One división Sheridan's - - army routed. -
Now trying to hold left flank. -
Oh, the blood it takes to hold this Unión together.
It will undo everything Grant has done.
It's hopeless.
I don't think so...
Before each victory I've had a visión of a ship with white sails.
That visión has just conic to me.
With all respect, I'd rather trade your ship for good news from Sheridan.
Is that General Sheridan in there?
Sure 'tis General Sheridan.
Doesn't that sound like cannon fire?
I don't hear anything, sir.
Hey, come here.
Have you good ears?
Pretty good when they're washed.
Then try them.
Do you hear anything like cannon fire?
It's cannon all right, over by the swamp.
They may have caught General Wright by surprise!
Mount those shorses!
- Sheridan's entire army- - has met an overwhelming defeat. -
Incredible.
And no word from Sheridan.
I'm afraid he was away.
It means the defeat of all our plans.
Yes, for we'll have to withdraw Grant from Richmond to protect Washington.
Come on, boys!
Come on!
General, the right wing is in full retreat.
Impossible to hold our positión, sir.
Tell Colonel Tolliver to reform and hold at all costs.
We're going back!
Officers, reform your men!
We're going back!
- Come on boys, let's go!
- Let's go, boys!
Forward!
Forward to victory!
- Down with, the traitor,- - up with the star!
-
- While we rally- - 'round the flag boys,-
- We'll rally- - once again,- shouting the battle cry of freedom!
-
Yes, we'll rally 'round the flag, boys-
We'll rally once again,-
Shouting the battle cry of freedom,-
- We will rally from the hillside,-
- We'll gather from the plain. -
Shouting the battle cry of freedom,-
- The Unión forever,- - hurrah, boys, hurrah!
-
- Sown with the traitor,- - up with the star. -
While we rally round the flag boys,-
We'll rally once again,-
Shouting the battle cry of freedom,-
Arrived in time to reform forces. -
Have struck the enemy and have won an overwhelming victory.
Sheridan. -
I knew it.
Better and better.
Look!
Here.
Tremendous number of prisoners.
Prisoners?
I hope there's nothing but prisoners from now on.
The ship, Stanton!
Yes, Mr. President, and Sheridan!
Surrender... my poor army!
I'd rather die a thousand deaths than do that to them.
There, General, you must lie down and rest.
Rest... that's a beautiful word...
They've caught a spy and they want the order for his executión approved.
Colonel Marshall... who was that?
- Only a courier, sir.
- What did he want?
They've caught a spy.
I approved the executión order, sir.
Colonel,... the only reason for shooting a spy is the protectión of an army, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
Well,... you and I know that this army can't exist much longer.
Isn't that right?
Yes, sir.
That is why I am unwilling that there shall be a single life lost unnecessarily.
Colonel...
I wonder if you'd mind countermanding that order.
I will.
Yes, sir.
Tired, Grant?
Not much.
Mr. President, we have them.
It can only last a few days more.
General Sherman and I are glad of this chance to talk with you.
The Unión...
we've saved it at last.
They must surrender soon.
The Unión...
We'll have 'em all back...
United, free...
one Country.
And meanwhile, Mr. President?
I've heard the country wishes all rebel property confiscated and the rebel generals, such as Lee, shot for treason.
He's put up a grand battle.
And they've robbed the cradle and the grave, sir.
Lee is fighting with his last breath.
Shoot Robert E. Lee?
Someone will have to shoot Abraham Lincoln first.
They're rebels, not traitors.
And their horses and baggage, sir?
They'll need them for the spring plowing.
Let 'em keep 'em and get to work.
Very good, sir.
Just one thing more, Mr. President... the head of the rebel government Jefferson Davis?
Jefferson Davis...
Do you wish his capture?
That reminds me of a story.
We had a terrible drunkard once in Springfield.
Finally he signed the pledge.
Next day he got thirsty and went to a bar and ordered a lemonade.
While the bartender was fixing it, the old drunk got sadder and sadder.
Finally he leaned over and said to the bartender,
"Mike, while you're fixin' that, couldn't you put a nice little shot of whiskey in, unbeknownst to meself?"
Well, sir?
Couldn't you sort of lot Jeff Davis escape, unbeknownst to yourselves?
We'll do our part, sir.
We're going to take them back as though they'd never been away.
Lincoln...
He freed the negroes.
He's supressed the right of a trail by jury.
He muzzled the press!
Now, wiht the oid of this "butternuts", his army and his negroes, he make himself
King of the América.
Lincoln!
I drink to him... and his domatión!
Right,... you're right.
On my part...
Go on, you're among friends...
The man who kills Abraham Lincoln will be inmortal.
Now, listen...
I have a plan... and I'm going in.
Do you mind my smoking, Mrs. Lincoln?
No, not much.
You don't know how glad we all are that you were reelected, Mr. President.
I'm sure this lady will be glad to spend four more years in the White House.
Glad?
I've just hired two new maids.
Lincoln, will you ever learn to keep your feet in shoes?
Mrs. Lincoln, have you met General Grant?
I met him.
It took us a week to get the smoke out of the curtains.
Yes, Oglesby, he's one human being who has faults.
A party of prohibitionists, called on me the other day and complained about Grant's drinking.
I told 'em if I knew what brand he uses,
I'd send barrels of it to my other generals.
Two new maids...
If we're going to be here four more years...
Four years...
four more years...
Mr. Lincoln, don't you go thinking about of those dreams again.
You'll live two hundred and after we'll celebrate it right over here, we'll travel around the world and have a nice long rest.
Oh, Daddy!
, Would that be fun?
- You're not going without me...?
- Why, of course not, Tad.
You can depend on Mother Surratt, and everything is straight with me.
I said I'd go through with it, and I will.
Tonight will be remembered throughout the ages.
I play my best part.
How much better a dagger would look,
Cassius used a dagger,
but this is safer.
- Speech!
- Speech!
- Speech!
- Speech!
Again I say, with malice toward none,
with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right,
we shall bind up the natión's wounds and cherish peace.
That government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.
Thank you.
God bless you all.
Mr. Lincoln, I'm just proud of you!
- Peanuts, hold the horse for me?
- Yes.
Will you be long, sir?
No, not very long.
Dundreary, would you mind bringing me a wrap?
I feel a draught.
I'm afraid you must be mistaken.
Mr. Lincoln... has just stopped the draft.
I reckon I'm going to feel right to home here, b'gosh!
I would be too if it wasn't for that 'ternal servant-critter with brass buttons on his coat.
He just swells out his big bosom like a turkey cock in laying' time, looks at me as if I meant to esquatulate with the spoons.
I reckon they don't know who they're dealin' with, but I'll show 'em.
I'm as obstinate as Deacon Stumpp's forelock.
"It wouldn't lie down; it couldn't stand up,"
wouldn't point forward and couldn't go backward.
I don't know what they're going to do with me, but whatever they do do and wherever they put me,
I hope it's outa the reach of that jackass.
I'm a real hoss, I am, and I get kinda riley with them critters.
They say I don't know the manners of good society too, but I guess I know enough to turn that old gal inside out,
the sock-dollaging old mantrap.
But I dare no more kill her than I dare ask Queen Victoria to dance a Cape Cod reel.
Sic semper tyrannis!
Mr. Lincoln, Mr. Lincoln has been shot!
Get a doctor!
Somebody get a doctor!
Glory, glory Hallelujah!
-
Glory, glory Hallelujah!
-
Glory, glory Hallelujah!
-
His soul is marching on!
-
Tom, come on up here and pack this thing.
Let's get going.
I'll be right up.
Hurry.
Okay, I'm gonna put some of these things in your bag.
Can I?
Okay.
- Say, Helen?
- Yeah?
I have everything packed but my sweater.
May I put it in your bag?
You better leave it out.
It's a long ride back.
- It gets cold around midnight.
- All right.
Oh, we'll make New York by 10:30 if we get started on time.
- Three hearts.
- Five spades.
- Pass.
- Little slam in spades.
- Pass.
- I hope you make it.
Your ex-husband says he divorced you because of overbidding.
Yeah?
Well, you take it from me, my ex-husband's ex-wife divorced him because he sang in his bathtub.
You ought to double six spades, Dr. Bernard.
Come on, Dot.
Get hot.
Step on it.
Loosen up, Dot.
Loosen up.
This is a foxtrot, not an Australian crawl.
Looseness is your specialty, not mine.
No, no.
Open your clubs.
Open your clubs.
Hannah, will you attend to your dinner?
It's all ready, if Miss Jerry'd come back with the fish she promised me.
I'll leave you the spades.
Confound that daughter of mine, she and Ted have been gone ages.
Come on, Dot.
Put more "uh" into it.
Good gracious, Don.
You're dancing with me, not giving me an osteopathic treatment.
Nothing personal, I assure you.
And if you would take your mind off Paul and concentrate more on your own left leg, I think we'd do a lot better.
We make it.
Oh, Doctor, you should've played your queen instead of the ten-spot.
I'm sorry.
I can't keep my mind on my cards.
- I'm worried about those two.
- Now, let's see here.
- I wonder could anything be wrong.
- Dinner's ready.
Oh, thank goodness, I'm starved.
Hey!
Upstairs, there.
Dinner!
Come on down and let's eat.
Will you please stop gazing at that man and come and have some food?
Blow the horn again.
That doesn't sound like Jerry.
Could be Ted.
Oh, now look here.
You're taking this thing too seriously.
I'm sure Ted was spectacular in college, but you don't go through life on a lot of touchdowns.
You wait a little while, she'll come to her senses.
I hope you're right, Doctor.
You better come now, Doctor, if you want to get anything.
All right.
Come ahead, Paul.
Let's have some dinner.
My head's going round like a pin wheel.
My heart's beating like a steam engine.
Feel.
When did you first start having heart troubles?
From the first moment I met you.
Then why have you been holding out on me?
Well, you see, darling, I'm only a poor newspaper man and we don't make much money.
But from now on, I'm keeping track of the overhead.
And when I've saved enough money, we're going to be married.
You sound as if you were proposing to my grandmother.
What am I going to be doing while you're saving the first million?
Waiting for me.
Waiting isn't my idea of the king of indoor sports.
I've no intention of waiting around for three or four years while you harvest an additional crop of wild oats.
Now see here, darling, I'm not as bad as that.
No, but you're no Saint Anthony.
You're just human, so am I. That's why I don't want to wait.
Jerry, you certainly say it straight.
Sure.
Isn't that the way we're going to be?
Straight from the shoulder, open, above board?
Oh, you're a great girl.
And you know, you've got a man's point of view.
That's why we're gonna make a go of it.
Everything equal.
- You bet.
- 75/25.
Shake.
When will you marry me?
Tomorrow?
- Oh, gracious, no.
- Next week?
- Oh, I couldn't.
- What, next month?
Well, maybe.
Oh, the first, Jerry, huh?
That's three whole, long weeks off.
Oh, please the first, huh?
Say yes.
I won't let you go until you say yes.
Say yes, darling, say yes.
For the love of Mike, lady, say yes so I can get out of here.
You're not eating a thing, Paul.
Buck up, there's nothing to worry about.
I'm not so sure.
I wish you'd have a look for them.
Right-o, Doctor.
I know right where she fishes.
It'll only take a minute.
- Well, for the love of Pete.
- No, for the love of Ted.
Where have you been and why?
Remember anything you say will be used against you.
Answer yes or no.
I've already said yes.
Yes.
- Yes.
- Well!
Hope you don't mind?
Would it make any difference whether I do or not?
No.
You rascal.
- I'm simply thrilled.
Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Hey, customers.
Boy and girl take big leap.
Hear it and weep.
- Sorry, old man.
- So am I.
- It may be possible that...
- Oh, it's all right, let's forget it, Doctor.
Attaboy.
Well, aren't you gonna congratulate me, Don?
Ted's the one I'm congratulating.
Lucky dog.
And to think that you brought us together.
My mistake.
Why, you're not suggesting that your slightly shopworn emotions were ever centered on me, are you?
And why not?
You're a fascinating wench, Jerry.
- Well, it's too late.
- Never too late to yearn.
You'll never die yearning.
Here we are.
Great Scott, I thought you said a drink.
Oh, it'll do you good.
- A place for the future bride and groom.
- That's awfully sweet of you.
Now, darling, I want you to eat something.
Here.
You two have a pickle.
It's good for those in love.
- Mary?
- What?
You're not ever going to marry, are you?
- Is this a proposition?
- No, no.
No.
Why not?
Of course, you haven't a moral to your back, but you're young and good-looking and rich.
Millions for defense but not one cent for alimony.
What a lot of heathen you are!
Oh, Dad, don't let them worry you.
Anyway, Ted and I are gonna be married and stay married, aren't we, darling?
Yes, we're going to stay married.
How unpatriotic.
A man should be willing to lay down more than one wife for his country.
You know what time it is?
We must be on our way.
Got to pack that toothbrush.
Got to take this on the run.
I might stay here and finish this, darling.
I want a great big helping of that.
Well, I'm a big engaged man, you know, I've got to eat.
- Paul, I thought...
- Hello, Jerry.
- We were just drinking to your happiness.
- Oh, thanks.
And I was binding up the wounds.
Never thought of myself, of course.
Wounds?
Nonsense.
Why, Paul and I have always been friends.
We're gonna stay friends, aren't we?
I'm afraid so, Jerry.
I wish you all the luck in the world.
Of course you do.
Hey, Romeo, are you packed?
Coming up to finish, Juliet.
I can't let you out of my sight a minute.
Oh, you sweet darling.
Soon you'll be wondering how to get rid of me.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Stop your fooling.
You funny little man.
- Here, time.
- Great!
- Marvelous time, Doc.
- Goodbye.
I had a marvelous time.
See you at the wedding.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Doctor, we had a perfectly grand time.
- I'm awfully glad.
Most marvelous party I ever attended.
- See you in town, Doctor.
- Hey!
Excuse me.
You coming with me, Dot?
- Try and get rid of me.
- Yeah, well, come along.
Come on, we gotta get going.
- Dorothy?
- Yeah.
Listen, dear, do you think Paul ought to drive?
Oh, don't be such a crab.
You'd think you were my mother instead of my sister.
Come on.
See you down the car.
- All right.
- Come on, darling.
- There we are.
- Now, Paul.
Hadn't you better let Hank drive?
Oh, say, I'm all right, Mary.
I'm fit as a fiddle.
- Is it all right with you, Dot?
- Anything you do is okay with me.
There you are.
Come on, let's go.
- Everything all right, Paul?
- Sure, get aboard, Hank.
- Come on, put your bag in there.
- All right.
I'll do that.
Wait a minute, Doctor.
Did you remember to lock the cellar door?
- Paul.
Paul, please be careful.
- Who said careful?
Let's go.
Paul, please be careful.
Paul, please drive slower.
Oh, you hear me!
Will you stop?
Please!
My God.
They've turned over!
Here, come on, boys.
Get my case, there.
Oh, Mary.
I'm all right.
I'm all right.
Dorothy!
Oh, Ted, let me see her.
No, please let me see her.
Well, I want to see her.
I've got to see her.
Where is she?
Oh, God, please don't stop me.
Don't!
Dorothy!
Oh, she's dead.
Oh, she's dead.
Father, she's not...
No, no.
She's still alive.
We must get her to the hospital quick.
No, she's not, she's dead.
You're lying to me.
Let me see her face.
Mary.
Mary, come up here.
Don't look at her.
Oh, I never thought it'd be so horrible, Jerry.
- Just come away.
Don't look at her.
- Oh, I hope she dies.
- Jerry, I hope she dies.
- You don't know what you're saying, Mary.
She was so pretty.
I hope she dies.
You!
You!
You dirty rotten beast!
I told you not to drive.
I tell you, if you've killed my sister, you'll pay for this.
Mary, you don't know what you're saying.
Got drunk, just because Jerry turned you down.
You quitter.
You rotten, rotten quitter.
You hear me on this, you'll pay for this.
If you've wrecked my sister's life, I'll make you pay for this.
I'll make you pay for it.
I'll make you pay for it.
Oh, that rotten beast!
- With this ring...
- With this ring I thee wed.
...I thee wed.
- In the name of the Father...
- In the name of the Father and of the Son...
...and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
...and of the Holy Ghost.
- Amen.
- Amen.
God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost.
Bless, preserve and keep you.
The Lord mercifully with his favor look upon you and fill you with all spiritual benediction and grace that ye may so live together in this life that in the world to come ye may have life everlasting.
Amen.
Well, it ain't my place to say it, Miss Jerry, but if I had a boss that was so hard-boiled he wasn't satisfied with my working all day at the office without slaving home at night,
I'd tell him to go to...
The place he's heading for, and moreover...
Thank you, Hannah.
Have you got Mr. Ted's bag packed?
Just going to.
No offense is intended and I hope none will be took, but if I had a husband that went to Chicago on the third anniversary of his wedding, leaving me behind, I wouldn't consider it natural.
But he has to go, Hannah.
It's on business.
Well, I suppose so.
Oh, Miss Jerry, if you don't need me anymore,
I've got a date to go to the second show with the butcher.
Are his intentions honorable, Hannah?
I'm afraid they are.
He just wants to keep a good customer.
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, Ted.
- Many happy returns.
- Same to you, darling.
I brought you something.
- Surprise.
- Ted.
- Go ahead, open it.
- Oh, you darling.
Just to remind you that you married me three years ago today.
Ted, you adorable, extravagant wretch, you.
- You must've robbed a bank.
- No, it belonged to my mother.
- I had it reset for you.
- Oh, it's lovely, darling.
- You like it?
- Mmm.
It's to keep your wedding ring company.
You dear.
It's lovely.
Will you think of me every time you look at it?
As though I didn't think of you every second of every minute, of every hour, of every day.
You darling.
- Gee, that's slick.
- You really like it, darling, huh?
I'm glad.
Did I ever happen to mention what a wonderful girl I think you are?
Well, not for a long time.
I'd like to make love to you till you scream for help.
Can't scream.
Three whole years and I love you more than ever.
That goes double, sweetheart.
And every anniversary is going to be just that much better.
How long are you going to be gone?
Well, not any longer than I can help, sweetheart.
But I'm afraid it'll spoil a week.
I'll miss you like the mischief.
A New York nightingale.
No romance complete without one.
Come on, you're going upstairs.
Where do I go, upstairs?
Yeah, up the stairs.
Thanks, you're too much.
Oh, what a nice baby.
Sure, I go upstairs.
Come on, baby.
I'm gonna take you upstairs.
We'll make a nice time.
Ladies and gentlemen, make way for the wild and wicked wop.
Thrills the ladies for nothing at all.
From the old country.
What a man!
He eats them alive.
Hello, Jerry.
How are you?
Don!
I love everybody.
I am the great big lover.
You don't know what...
Oh, what a grand, beautiful baby.
Oh, hi!
All my life I look for such a beautiful bambina.
Hey, you bust up my big moment.
What's the matter you?
Come to me, I am the great, big, Italian lover.
Stop it, now I'm ticklish.
Come to my arms, kiddo.
Come to my arms.
Say, I come all to pieces.
What's a matter you?
- Well, you can quit right now.
- Is that so?
When he was a child...
Oh, my dear, I'm so sorry.
I forgot all about you.
This is Janice.
- I don't know your last name.
- Meredith.
Mrs. Dickson Meredith.
- Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Meredith?
- Just a floating grass widow.
Floats them and gets them.
Oh, please.
We found her in a little restaurant where we stopped off.
She said she knew Ted and was lonesome, so we brought her along.
Hello, Ted.
Hello, Janice.
Well, she does seem to know you.
You know Bill, Jerry.
Oh, hello, Bill.
You know Bill Baldwin.
- I've heard of him.
- How are you?
He owns Arkansas and Texas.
No, no, wait.
Only Arkansas.
Listen, everybody.
Silence in the court, please.
I rap for order.
Oh, what a cranium.
I wish to announce on this happy occasion...
How's that?
I can't tell yet.
Because of the excellent example set by our young friends here,
I shall, one week from today, go tripping and blushing up the aisle with a gentleman from Arkansas.
Nice work, Bill.
Congratulations.
- And me, too.
- Much obliged.
That's all right.
Well, if we're going anywhere, let's get under way.
I'm sorry, Don, I can't.
I'm taking the late train to Chicago.
- Chicago?
- Yeah, it's just one of those things.
- Business, you know.
- Isn't that a shame?
Jerry's going to be awfully lonesome.
You can celebrate without me.
- Take her along.
- Why, certainly, I'd be only too glad to.
That's sweet of you.
Anyway, darling, we're all going down to the train to see you off.
- Aren't we, kids?
- Sure we are.
- You'll be back for our wedding, Ted?
- Well, you bet you.
I wouldn't miss it.
Hey, let's do a little celebrating.
Sweetie, out in the refrigerator...
Well, you know.
- I got you.
- Make it snappy.
Helen, I'm so excited about you getting married.
And me, too.
I'm thrilled to death.
Oh, don't get excited, it's all right.
I'll take them right off.
My Italian blood, she is very excited.
I must sing, that's all.
I've got to sing.
All right.
Hurry up, Jerry.
Get the pennies.
Hurry up, get some more pennies.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Hey, what you do...
Ted.
Say, what the deuce did you horn in on this party for?
I wanted to see the woman that stood between us.
Do you realize that this is my wedding anniversary?
It's not decent.
Why haven't I heard from you in a month?
- Conscience.
- You're not that old-fashioned, are you?
Now see here, Janice.
I was plastered, and you know it.
Oh, but you're not such a sterling character when my arms are around you.
- Be true to me in Chicago?
- Cut it out, Janice.
Cut it...
A little cramped for room, weren't you?
If I could think as fast as that I might have stayed married.
Think of all the fun you'd have missed.
Ted, you have a train to catch.
- I hadn't forgotten, dear.
- Oh, really?
Good.
And some guests who are only thirsty.
I'm going to dress.
- That gal's real opposition.
- Well, you're not.
Get that straight.
- Ted.
- Open that door.
- Now, Ted...
- I said open that door.
- Here we are, folks.
- The drought's broken.
Tell Jerry to hurry, will you, dear?
We haven't much time.
Yes, I'll tell her.
She'll be out in a minute.
- Excuse me, Bill.
- Okay.
- You ready, Jerry?
- Just about.
You know, it's a darn shame I've got to get on that train tonight, isn't it?
Yes, Janice and I will both miss you.
Oh, now see here, Jerry.
How do you like this little pose?
Don't you think it's rather fetching?
- Now, what are you driving at?
- Nothing.
Except that Janice seemed to be rather enjoying herself when I came into the kitchen just now.
Nonsense.
It was something in the way she looked at you that made me want to kill her.
Am I right, Ted?
Am I right?
You know I won't lie to you.
Jerry.
Then...
She has a right to look at you any way she likes?
Now see here, Jerry.
I'm sorry, darling.
Of course.
But there's no sense in over-playing it.
There's nothing to it.
Come on.
Snap out of it.
It isn't the end of the world, darling.
Why gosh, I don't care a snap of my fingers for any woman in the world but you.
If I'd killed somebody, you'd go all the way and back again for me.
I'd ask you to try and forgive me if I thought it was the right thing to do.
But that isn't the point.
Darling, you've got to get a broader look at things, that's all.
Well, you're out in the world doing a man's work.
Was that just a lot of talk about a man's point of view?
Please believe, me, darling.
It doesn't mean a thing.
Not a thing.
Doesn't make the slightest difference.
Come on, snap out of it.
Now, pull yourself together.
Yes, of course.
We're...
We're celebrating our third anniversary, aren't we?
All right, Ted, I won't spoil it.
We'll think another time.
That's fine.
And that, too.
We'll do that another time.
What could've happened to those kids?
Here, cut out the private farewells and come on out here.
Don't you realize that we have a lot of catching up to do?
Jerry's awfully upset, Don.
Yes, I know, about your going to Chicago.
Well, never mind.
I'll cheer her up.
There's nothing I like better than taking care of lonesome wives who talk exclusively about their husbands.
Come, come.
A little cheer for the departing host.
Here you are.
Thank you.
Here you are, Ted.
- Oh, thanks, old boy.
- Not at all.
Oh, sorry to have held up the party.
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, there you are.
Here you are, darling.
Thank you, Helen.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the bride and groom.
May they never be less happy than they are at this moment.
- Cheerio.
- Skoal.
May we never be less happy than we are at this moment.
Why, Jerry!
- What's the idea?
- What did you do that for?
Just an old Spanish custom.
- Come on, everybody, let's go.
- Get my coat, will you, dear?
Jerry!
I always did like saying goodbye to husbands.
Well, I guess we'd better be off.
Well, that's all right.
Here you are, Ted.
Here's your hat and coat.
Now, you're sure you have everything packed?
You've got your pajamas, your toothbrush and everything?
Everything set?
Now, hurry up, come on.
Well, well, come on, hurry up, Jerry.
We've got to get some business.
Hurry up, hurry up.
Make it quick.
Hurry up.
That's it, baby.
- Oh, porter?
- Yes, sir.
Porter, how long do we stop at the next station?
Long enough to telephone?
Yes, sir.
If you ain't gonna talk to nobody too far.
We're supposed to stop there in about six minutes.
- I see.
Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Same old plight I've always had with keyholes.
You stick with me and I'll win this one.
I'm going to invent a key for leaping keyholes.
- Thanks, Don.
- Don't mention it.
- Nice of you to bring me home.
- Oh, it's all right, it's all right.
Sorry to be such a nuisance and drag you away.
- Smarty, smarty had a party.
- And everybody stayed but smarty, I know.
Yeah.
Sure.
What's the matter with you, Jerry?
I'm just trying to hang onto the marvelous latitude of a man's point of view.
But I find I can't do it and rub elbows with Janice.
- What do you mean, Janice?
- Oh, don't stall, Don.
I know all about it.
Ted told me tonight.
And I suppose I'm the last one to find it out.
Listen, how could any man who ever held you in his arms be serious about Janice?
I know, Don.
It doesn't mean a thing.
Ted told me that.
Not a thing.
Well, how could it?
You're too marvelous.
You're a wonderful girl, Jerry.
Thanks, Don.
But nevertheless, I couldn't stand the party.
Oh, it doesn't mean a thing.
Janice?
Not a thing.
That's funny.
Very funny.
Let me in on the joke.
It doesn't mean a thing, not a thing.
What's the matter with me?
Jerry.
I'm sorry.
You know, I can't understand it.
Oh, come on now.
Pull yourself together.
Please, Don.
Oh, now, darling.
It doesn't mean a thing.
Not a thing.
Now, now, now.
There.
Hello?
Hello?
Can't you get it?
I know, but keep on trying, will you, please?
This is very important.
I've only got a few minutes, you know.
There, there, there, don't you worry your little head about Janice.
Janice, my hat!
Why, you're the grandest girl.
You got everything.
Most wonderful girl in the world.
Feel better now.
Thanks for being so sympathetic.
Been awfully sweet, Don.
I guess I'm all right now.
You'd better run along like a good fellow.
- Oh, somebody forgot something.
- What is it?
- What's that letter?
- Which one?
There's only one.
Looks like a "J" when it stops dancing.
"J" for Janice.
I wonder why she left that?
She took everything else.
Oh, I've got to get out of here.
I can't stand it.
This place is haunted.
Come on, Don.
Okay, where do you wanna go?
Oh, anywhere as long as it isn't here and I'm not alone.
Okay by me.
I got plenty of places to go and lots of things to do.
We'll go all the places and do all the things.
Jerry?
Jerry?
Hello, Jerry.
Hello, Ted.
- You'll upset a perfectly good breakfast.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I...
- I brought you something.
- Oh, how lovely, Ted.
That's sweet of you.
Well, aren't you going to kiss me?
Well, I love you, so why not?
Where's Hannah?
Oh, she had to go to the dentist.
That tooth that's been bothering her for the last eight years.
Oh, really?
That's too bad.
Nice trip?
Oh, no, awful nuisance.
A lot of big dinners, and bald heads and double chins.
You know, stupid.
Too bad.
- Smells good.
- Oh, this is great, Jerry.
So, why didn't you answer the wires I sent you?
Oh, there was a lot to think about.
And the longer you wait, the more sense you get.
You know, letting things ride the way you did certainly whipped me plenty.
Boy.
You know, I imagined all sorts of receptions when I got home.
- This is great.
- You'll spill it.
Well, believe me, I've done all the spilling I want to do.
Yes?
- Anything new?
- No.
Oh, Helen and Bill are going to get married today.
Oh, really?
I suppose we'll have to go to that.
- I'm best man.
- Oh, yeah?
And after the wedding tonight, there's going to be a jamboree.
- A get-together of all their friends.
- Thanks.
Oh, gosh.
I suppose we'll have to go to that, too.
Well, they'll expect us to.
You know, it was our blissful example that made them do it.
Was there an overtone of sarcasm in that remark, Jerry?
Or am I looking for trouble?
Hmm?
No, Ted.
Your cheeriness is amazing.
Well, what do you mean?
You're like a little boy that's stolen some jam, been spanked, and kissed, and is happy again.
You know, that's just the way I feel.
You know, Jerry, darling,
I was afraid of my life we wouldn't hurdle this.
Gosh, you'll never know what an awful week I've spent without you.
I can't live without you, Jerry.
I never knew how much I loved you.
Darling, please.
Now, don't do that.
Well, for heaven's sake, Jerry, you'll have to make up your mind, you know, one way or the other.
Gosh, I thought you'd already done it.
Ted, let me understand something.
When you say that being unfaithful doesn't mean anything, you mean just that, don't you?
- Well, what I said was...
- Yes.
I remember what you said.
"It doesn't mean a thing."
I wish I could cover up things and forget them, Ted.
I'll answer that.
Hello.
- Hello, Jerry?
- Yes.
This is Don.
I've been trying to get in touch with you ever since...
Well, for the last week.
I understand Ted's getting back in town today.
I realize how you feel and I sympathize with all your ideas about truth, honesty and ethics.
I want you to give me your word that you won't say anything to Ted.
- Will you do that?
- No.
For heaven's sake.
Don't you realize it will be all up with you if you tell Ted?
Perhaps.
Well, if you won't consider yourself, will you consider me?
After all, I'm supposed to be his best friend.
And...
Hello?
Hello?
Don't hang...
Hello, Jerry?
Oh, Lawson?
Lawson?
- Yes, sir?
- Find out what boats are sailing today.
- Where to, sir?
- I don't care, the further the better.
Yes, sir.
What were you saying when the telephone rang?
That I've balanced our accounts.
That's all.
I didn't really intend to, but that's how it is.
I had to tell you.
Don't look at me like that, Ted.
- You don't mean that, Jerry.
- I'm telling you the truth.
- Who's the man?
- Oh, Ted, don't be conventional.
Who's the man?
I want to see him.
Isn't it a rather good time to remember what you said?
- That it doesn't mean a thing?
- Shut up, you!
It can't be true.
Why, I always thought you were the most decent thing in the world.
Can't be true.
Well, it is.
I'm going to work, Ted.
I'm late.
See you tonight.
Great party.
- Hello, Jerry.
- Hello, Hank.
- Ted back from Chicago?
- Yes.
Is he coming tonight?
I don't know.
I haven't seen him since the morning.
What's the idea?
Well, you're a full-fledged married man now.
- You certainly have a fine girl, there.
- Sure.
I hope you'll be very happy.
We're bound to be, aren't we, darling?
Say, let me tell you something.
All you have to do to get a free sandwich here,
- is to wish them health and happiness.
- This is a private party.
I understand all that.
- Hello, Ted.
- Helen.
- I told you they knew me.
- Yes, sir.
- Hello, Arkansas.
- How are you?
I'm sorry I'm late, Helen.
Husbands should never be late.
No, sir.
You never know who's sitting on the bench waiting to take your place when you fall out of the game.
Oh, don't be silly, Ted.
What made you so late?
Well, I...
- This little hand, you hand it over?
- Oh, pull yourself together, Ted.
"I weep for you," the walrus cried.
"I deeply sympathize."
I bet you haven't had any dinner?
Dinner?
No, I don't believe I have.
You better have some food, son.
I haven't seen my wife since she welcomed me home this morning.
Don't worry about her.
Have some food first.
- We'll find her later.
- No!
I'll find her.
I'm all right.
- Hi, Ted.
Where've you been?
- Hello.
How are you?
What's the matter, Ted?
Hello, Ted.
- Help yourself, son.
- Help myself, huh?
All right, I'll take the blonde.
- I beg your pardon?
- It's all right.
Ted.
Look at the hero.
Just a fool, that's all.
There isn't a woman in the world worth that.
Love, honor and obey, huh?
Don't make me laugh.
- Ted!
- Where's my wife?
- Ted.
- Oh, there you are.
Oh, so you're the white-haired boy, huh?
Murderer returns to the scene of his crime.
- Ted, you don't know what you're saying.
- Wait a minute!
But I don't know whether you are or not, but just for luck...
- Ted, stop it.
Cut it out!
- Let go of me!
I'll go through this crowd like a high wind.
- Ted, pull yourself together!
- Get away from me!
Come here, come here.
Get him out!
Does this mean that you're leaving me, Ted?
It's rather apparent, don't you think?
Oh, don't let's make a mess of things like this.
Spoil our happiness.
Happiness?
Don't you think it's a little late to talk about that?
Well, you didn't think of that when...
Oh, I see.
You're going to put all the blame on me, huh?
Oh, Ted, no.
I didn't mean to say that.
Well, listen, I'm not the first man in the world who's made a...
Oh, Ted.
Don't let's talk about men and women.
They do all sorts of things.
We've got to live our own life, dear.
There's so much of it ahead.
I'll never do anything you don't like.
I'll never make you sorry, really.
I'll forgive you anything, dear.
Can't you please forgive me?
When I try to look ahead without you, why, everything goes black.
I love you, dear.
I can't go on without you.
Oh, you'll get along all right.
You've made a pretty good beginning.
Oh, Ted, don't.
We both made a horrible mistake but that doesn't mean we can't try again.
Try again?
With all our friends laughing at me?
- Laughing at you?
- Yes.
Someplace among the people we know, there's a man.
Maybe men, I don't know.
But from now on, I'll wonder which one.
And how many of them are laughing at me?
Well, couldn't I have said that the day you asked me to marry you?
Supposing I had said,
"No, Ted.
I'm afraid I may meet the women that you've known."
And why not?
I waited for you.
You were my first love.
But this is entirely different.
All right, then, but tonight I come back here, ready to humiliate myself, beg for your forgiveness.
Ready to forgive you anything because I love you.
And you say that's different?
- You tell me your vanity is hurt?
- Oh, call it anything you like.
Vanity!
I'll never forget that.
Let's not talk anymore about it.
And I thought your heart was breaking like mine.
But instead, you tell me your man's pride can't stand the gaffe.
- Now, wait a minute, Jerry.
Listen...
- No, I don't want to listen.
I'm glad I discovered there's more than one man in the world while I'm young and they want me.
Believe me, I'm not missing anything from now on.
I don't doubt it.
Once a woman throws down her fences...
Oh, print it on a motto and hang it where Janice can see it.
- Stop that!
- Oh, loose women, great,
- but not in the home, eh, Ted?
- Cut it, do you hear?
The looser they are, the more they get.
The best in the world.
No responsibility!
Well, my dear, I'm gonna find out how they do it.
So look for me in the future where the prim roses grow and pack your man's pride with the rest.
And from now on, you're the only man in the world that my door is closed to.
That is all.
Counsel will prepare the decree.
This decree is interlocutory and becomes final in three months.
Congratulations, my darling, you're free.
You're exactly as you were before you were married.
Exactly.
All I need is a complete set of young illusions and an innocent expression.
Oh, cheer up.
I had a very good time as an ex-wife.
Why shouldn't you?
- All men are fair game.
- Yes, but I guess there's only one...
Oh, nonsense.
I'll show you a flock of them.
Friends of Bill's.
They're as rich as mud.
In a year, you'll have forgotten the color of Ted's hair.
- I hope so.
- My dear, I know so.
All right, Helen.
From now on,
I take all the hurdles, see all the scenery and listen to the band play.
Come along.
- Ted.
- Yeah?
I just want to wish you a happy New Year.
Thank you.
Same to you.
Don't let me keep you from your friend.
Oh, I couldn't think of accepting such a valuable gift.
But, my dear, my feeling for you is purely platonic.
Really?
I've heard of platonic love, but I didn't know there was such a thing as platonic jewelry.
My dear, Jerry.
You American women are so cold.
Are you sure you can tell whether a woman is cold or careful?
I don't understand French, but I know the symptoms of high blood pressure in any language.
By the way, Jerry, I see your husband around quite a lot.
Oh, yeah?
Well, the next time you see him, you tell him I'm still holding my own.
I didn't know you had a husband, Jerry.
I had, but I haven't.
Let's drink to his health, the infernal fool.
When you have grown old, you will be very, very sorry.
Yes, I know.
I shall most likely push back the gray hair, curse at the wrinkles, and say, "You did not allow the great Ivan to make love to you,
"and now look at you."
Jerry, darling, what you need is a great romance.
Oh, one more would be the death of me.
What are you doing in my train, anyway?
International peace conference at Boston.
Stop off a day or so.
It might amuse you, eh?
Why not?
Two reasons.
One, I am, after all, a businesswoman on my way to a convention in Toronto.
And the other reason?
You are much too fascinating.
Jerry, darling, I have madly loved you for a year or so.
What you feel for me is not love.
It's the call of the gorilla to its mate.
Funny picture.
Ivan swinging through the tree tops.
Oh, am I cramping your style?
- I am serious.
- Oh, you mean you're proposing to me?
Jerry, you are too clever to be provincial.
Much too clever.
Do I not interest you?
- Possibly.
- Tell me the truth.
The truth?
The last thing any man wants to hear from any woman.
That's a lesson I learned from my husband.
And what you learn at your husband's knee, you never forget.
You shall not amuse yourself with me.
Only the bell saved me.
Come in.
Porter, will you open the window?
It seems a bit warm in here.
Yes, ma'am.
- That's all, ma'am?
- Yes, that's all.
Thank you.
Yes.
Why, Paul.
Come in here!
Hello, Jerry.
How are you?
Oh, it's so long since I've seen you.
You should have a long gray beard.
Not at all.
I just happen to catch a glimpse of you through the door.
Oh, do you know...
Oh, how do you do?
I met you once at the press club.
Yes, of course.
Well, listen, what are you doing up so late and so far from home?
Oh, you are old friends, eh?
Oh, yes, we're very old friends.
In fact, I'm the man she should've married.
But that would have been not so fortunate for some of us.
Yes, I'd have been particular about some of her friends.
- I beg your pardon?
- Why...
Pardon me.
I have so many things to talk over with Paul.
Will you excuse us a few moments, Ivan?
Just a few moments?
Look here, young man.
I've been bumped five times between New Haven and Springfield and it's got to stop.
Sorry.
Rather dangerous playmate, isn't he?
Oh, well, perhaps that's what makes him amusing.
- Paul, I am so glad to see you.
- Then you haven't forgotten me?
Far from it.
In fact, I'm trembling like a leaf.
You bring back so much, so suddenly.
You've been trying to forget quite a lot, haven't you, Jerry?
- Who told you that?
- Oh, nobody.
I've been around New York most of the time.
And heard the echo of my misdeeds as I thundered up and down Broadway?
Why haven't I seen you?
I understand several were killed in the rush.
Well, you don't exactly take the veil when your decree is granted, you know.
- So I understand.
- Oh, that sounds disapproving.
What should an ex-wife do?
Spend her days doing good deeds?
Going to bed at night with suitable books?
Great Scott, Jerry.
I'm not criticizing.
Why, whatever you do, as far as I'm concerned, is all right, because you do it.
That's sweet of you, Paul.
Where are you bound for?
- Away from New York.
- Oh, yeah?
Tomorrow will find me on my boat in some quiet little cove.
No office, no telephone, no neighbors.
It's good for the nerves.
You ought to try something like that, Jerry.
It'd do you good.
Sounds wonderful.
But not for me.
It's too late for that sort of thing.
I've worked too hard and played too hard.
I take my outings in the subway and my exercise in the nightclub.
I belong to the sweet, pure air of 42nd Street and Broadway.
Not you, Jerry.
I know better.
Well, don't let's talk about me.
Tell me about Dorothy, Paul.
Well, we're still married.
Oh, just that?
I've heard your name quite often, Jerry.
- From whom?
- Dorothy.
Oh, why?
She knows that I loved you, Jerry.
That I always have and always will.
My dear, you don't mean that.
You're not going to tell me that love is anything lasting.
I've tried to forget that.
Forever and a day, Jerry.
And after that.
I've made such a mess of it, Paul.
I'm so tired.
Forgive me, Jerry.
I didn't mean to upset you.
I'm so tired.
You brought back so much.
Oh, I...
I'm so fed up.
I've made such a wreck of things.
Such a good for nothing mess.
Well, what is it, dear.
What's the matter?
I'm just dizzy.
I can't see.
Oh, I'm not going to faint, but I'm just...
Jerry, take it easy, please.
It's all right, dear.
Oh, you mustn't let yourself go this way.
Come on, dear.
It's all right.
It's all right, Jerry.
You're just worn out, you're tired.
It's all right, Jerry.
It's all right, dear.
I'll see you in the morning.
Oh, listen, old man.
Jerry's pretty tired and she's not feeling well, but I think she'll sleep.
So if I were you, I wouldn't go back.
You assume some rights, do you not?
You are not her guardian.
- No, but you're not going back.
- No?
- We shall see.
- I mean it.
Good old American custom, eh, minding other people's business?
What sentimental slop!
You are not protecting an innocent girl.
- She is nothing more...
- Why, you...
That's another good old American custom.
- Oh, porter?
- Yes?
There's only supposed to be one person in Drawing Room A, isn't there?
- Yes, boss.
- Well, see that's how it is.
Get me?
I get you.
Did he hurt you, boy?
Go away!
He's got a kick on him like a Missouri mule.
What are you thinking of?
Oh, how nice it is.
And how much you can shake off with just a little change in environment.
Happy?
You look great.
I told you what a couple of weeks would do for you.
- Oh, it's been lovely, Paul.
- It's yours for the rest of your life, Jerry.
- With my compliments.
- Thank you.
Oh, Jerry,
I have here the confirmation of my appointment to the Far East from my firm.
You like the idea, don't you?
If I can take you.
There's nothing anywhere without you.
What about Dorothy?
She'll be much happier, Jerry.
Our marriage hasn't meant anything.
She's always bitter and morbid.
Never lets me forget for a minute the accident that disfigured her.
Oh, well, you know.
Poor Dorothy.
It hasn't been easy for you either, has it, dear?
Oh, it's been fair enough, Jerry.
It's just that it hasn't mattered very much, but now things are different.
I have this offer, it's interesting.
And most important, I found you.
Dorothy'll give me a divorce.
You and I can be married and...
And we'll be happy.
- You think so, Paul?
- I'm crazy about you, Jerry.
Always have been.
I believe you.
I really do.
They want me to spend five years in Japan.
You know, we can have a beautiful time.
Leave all our mistakes 7,000 miles behind us.
7,000 miles.
It sounds grand.
We deserve a little happiness, don't you think?
I think you do, Paul.
I think you deserve anything you can get.
Beg pardon.
Lunch will be ready in just a minute, Miss Jerry.
Good news, Hannah.
- Nice here, eh?
- It's just heaven.
Of course I ain't heard any angels singing, but aside from that...
Well, we've got to eat anyway.
Hey, come on.
Don't you know it's 4:00 in the morning?
The night is young and we are practically children.
- Hello, Joe.
- How are you?
How about a table for six?
Harry, table for six in the other room.
Right this way, please.
I want four specials and two orders of turkey legs.
Oh, here we are.
Right here.
Well, isn't New York a wonderful place?
You go to shows and you see legs.
You go to restaurants, and they give you legs.
Don't laugh, Joe.
It's a serious matter.
- Don.
- Well, this is luck.
Well, you old son of a sea cook.
I didn't even know you were in New York.
I've been in Europe for the last few months.
Just got back.
Well, you're doing a lot of that sort of thing, aren't you?
Gee, I'm glad to see you.
Same here.
How've you been?
Oh, fine.
Lost my job yesterday.
And I'm nursing a pretty, little hangover today.
- Outside of that, I'm great.
- That's tough.
Anything I can do?
No, thanks.
I'll work it out all right.
Say, it seems ages since I've seen you.
Seen any of the old mob?
I suppose you heard about Jerry and me?
- Yeah.
Too bad.
- Oh, well.
That's life.
Say, I'd like to get together with you, Don.
- Fine.
- How about tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
I'm off again tomorrow.
- Canada, for a couple of weeks.
- Really?
- When I get back.
- Sure, if I'm here.
- Oh, you leaving town?
- Yes.
New York's bad medicine.
A lot of things I want to forget.
I can't seem to do it very well around here.
I know exactly how you feel.
You see, I keep thinking what a sad, little fellow I am, and brooding over the man that ruined my life.
- What would you do if you found him?
- Kill him, I suppose.
Funny, isn't it, how one girl can be bigger than all the tall buildings?
Well, I'll look you up.
When you get settled, let me know.
I may start and never stop.
That's my specialty.
Well, so long.
So long, Don.
She'll be in any minute now, Miss Helen.
She knows you're here.
- You going to Japan with them, Hannah?
- Oh, sure.
I want to see where the money's gone.
I've gave to foreign missions for the heathen.
How soon are they starting?
Oh, I forget you've been honeymooning so long you don't know anything.
His wife's going to let him loose.
It'll be soon, now.
Miss Jerry's gave up her job.
Really?
She's resigned?
And her firm come right back with an offer of $7,500 a year to go to London.
- They have branches in Europe.
- Hooray for Jerry.
Personally, I'd a darn sight rather go to London than to Yokohokohamie.
- Hello there, darling!
- Jerry.
Well, globetrotter bride and what have you.
Hello, yourself, you stormy petrel.
It's about time I came back.
Gee whiz, but I'm glad to see you.
Say, I've missed you like the dickens, Helen.
You, getting yourself out of one upheaval into another all the time.
Let me take a look at you.
Better be careful, darling.
My sea legs are still wobbly.
Now tell me, are you happy?
Yes, sure.
Bill's a big shot in his way.
He stands without hitching.
Nice and secure, eh?
Yes, but...
That other business.
You know, when you stand at the altar with someone you're wild about and the organ makes you dizzy and you say,
"This is heaven and we'll last forever."
Of course, that's gone forever.
- I wish you hadn't said that, Helen.
- But why?
Well, that brings my leaping mind back to its big news.
Big news?
We ran across Ted.
- Where?
- In Paris.
Saw quite a lot of him.
What's he doing?
Trying to wreck a fairly good mind and an A-1 body.
Really?
He's doing newspaper work, for the time being.
Of course, it won't last.
Ask about me?
My dear, he hates you so hard, I think he's still mad about you.
Oh, no, he's not.
Making a fool of himself, eh?
Oh, well, you know what Americans do in Paris.
When they meet someone who speaks American and knows Paris.
Ted was taking bets to see how many nights in succession he could stay drunk without spending a cent for it.
He'd gone six weeks when we started.
You know, Bill's been crazy about him ever since he broke up our wedding party.
It seems in the West where men are so and so, that, that's considered a pretty good piece of work.
Well, anyhow, I've been busting to tell you.
What a girl.
The lad I divorced is married again, has a baby and arrives in Wall Street every morning at 9:00.
Helen!
Oh, I guess that's Paul now.
- He'll be delighted to see you, Helen.
- I'll be very glad to see him.
It's Dorothy, Jerry.
Oh, yes, of course.
Come in, Dorothy.
I suppose I should have called you and made a date.
Well, for heaven's sake, Dorothy.
Hello, Helen.
I hear you've married again.
Yes, a big cattle and horse man.
Thanks for the tea, darling.
I must be going.
Buffalo Bill is waiting.
- I hope I didn't interrupt.
- Oh, no, not at all.
We're at the Ritz, dear.
Why don't you come over and have dinner with us?
Sorry, I have a date for dinner.
- Helen!
- Hello, Paul.
Hello.
Well, Jerry...
If anything happens to your date, dear, come on over.
Thanks.
- Goodbye, Paul, see you later.
- Goodbye, Helen.
- Have some tea, Paul, won't you?
- No, thanks, Jerry.
Well, Dot, what are you doing here?
I just wanted to see Jerry for a few minutes.
What did you want to say to her?
I guess I was going to ask her not to take you from me.
But I've told you that Jerry has no responsibility in the matter, Dot.
I thought that everything was all settled.
And besides, you said that we...
I know I said I'd set you free.
When you told me, my pride revolted at holding you against your will.
But now that I've had time to think it over, I have no pride, Paul.
Maybe our marriage hasn't meant much, but there's nothing at all without it.
It does give me an excuse for living, being married to you.
- There isn't anything else.
- Wait a minute, Dot.
You know that I'm not planning to desert you.
I've made certain definite arrangements to take care of you.
And that's everything in the world I have for you, my dear.
I have a right to a chance at some kind of personal life, haven't I?
Like anyone else?
Well, how about it, Dot?
Just a minute.
- Can't we talk afterwards?
- I'm afraid not.
I'm afraid she's right, Paul.
I couldn't do it.
I wouldn't dare expect to be happy.
Please, Paul, it hit me.
It brought back something.
Devastation just like this.
Only I deserved it.
Let me say it, Paul.
She married the man she loved.
So did I.
Every woman does, if she can.
But Dorothy is just trying to hang on.
I didn't.
I see my way.
I see it so clearly now, Paul.
I've never given my word and broken it before, except once.
And that was the promise I made on the altar with all my heart and soul.
Jerry I...
This is just a storm.
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Oh, please.
You've saved us both from a horrible mistake.
I'm really grateful.
This is right, Paul, and in our hearts we've known it, haven't we?
Marriage is the one thing in the world I thought ought to be perfect.
Nothing else is.
And when mine wasn't, I quit.
I don't know whether Ted could ever give me another chance.
But wherever he is, I'm going to find him and find out.
Jerry, if Ted doesn't come here, we'll go over to Zelly's.
We may find him there.
We'll wait a while, Hank.
What do you think he'll do when he finds you're in Paris?
Who can tell?
Why, there he is now!
- Is he alone?
- No.
Quite a party.
Jerry, don't you want to talk to him?
- Hank, will you take me over there?
- Why, certainly, Jerry.
Ted!
Come on, Ted.
Come on.
- Ted!
- Jerry!
What are you doing here?
Surprised?
Well, I thought when I put the Atlantic Ocean between us,
I wouldn't be seeing you.
You should have found a wider ocean.
Don't you think it would be more Christian if you'd give me a chance to forget you?
Do you still hate me that much, Ted?
Where's your husband?
Oh, he's not far away.
You do keep track of me, don't you?
That's why I left New York, because I couldn't think of anything else.
I'm still a little groggy, Jerry, but with time out I think I'll be able to finish the game.
You deserve the best in the world, Ted.
There's no one that wishes it for you more than I do.
Sure, I know.
And there's no reason on Earth why we can't still be friends.
No, of course not.
I hope that, that other fellow gives you the break you deserve.
I certainly didn't.
Well, here's everything, Jerry.
And happy New Year.
I'm working in London, Ted.
This is the third time I've been in Paris looking for you.
- For me?
- Yes.
Why?
You see, I had to leave New York, too.
Couldn't forget that little church and a lot of other things.
You're the only husband I've ever had and ever want.
It's New Year in a minute, Ted.
All the world gets a new chance.
Don't kid me, Jerry.
I'd give my right arm for another chance.
I like that right arm.
How about putting it around me?
(SINGIN' IN THE RAIN PLA YING ON RADIO)
(PLAYING UKULELE)
Tom, come on up here and pack this thing.
Let's get going.
I'll be right up.
Hurry.
Okay, I'm gonna put some of these things in your bag.
Can I?
Okay.
- Say, Helen?
- Yeah?
I have everything packed but my sweater.
May I put it in your bag?
You better leave it out.
It's a long ride back.
- It gets cold around midnight.
- All right.
Oh, we'll make New York by 10:30 if we get started on time.
- Three hearts.
- Five spades.
- Pass.
- Little slam in spades.
- Pass.
- I hope you make it.
Your ex-husband says he divorced you because of overbidding.
Yeah?
Well, you take it from me, my ex-husband's ex-wife divorced him because he sang in his bathtub.
You ought to double six spades, Dr. Bernard.
Huh?
Come on, Dot.
Get hot.
Step on it.
Loosen up, Dot.
Loosen up.
This is a foxtrot, not an Australian crawl.
Looseness is your specialty, not mine.
Oh?
No, no.
Open your clubs.
Open your clubs.
Hannah, will you attend to your dinner?
It's all ready, if Miss Jerry'd come back with the fish she promised me.
I'll leave you the spades.
Confound that daughter of mine, she and Ted have been gone ages.
Come on, Dot.
Put more "uh" into it.
Good gracious, Don.
You're dancing with me, not giving me an osteopathic treatment.
Nothing personal, I assure you.
And if you would take your mind off Paul and concentrate more on your own left leg, I think we'd do a lot better.
We make it.
Oh, Doctor, you should've played your queen instead of the ten-spot.
I'm sorry.
I can't keep my mind on my cards.
- I'm worried about those two.
- Now, let's see here.
- I wonder could anything be wrong.
- Dinner's ready.
Oh, thank goodness, I'm starved.
Hey!
Upstairs, there.
Dinner!
Come on down and let's eat.
Will you please stop gazing at that man and come and have some food?
Blow the horn again.
(BLOWING HORN)
(DONKEY BRAYING)
That doesn't sound like Jerry.
Could be Ted.
Oh, now look here.
You're taking this thing too seriously.
I'm sure Ted was spectacular in college, but you don't go through life on a lot of touchdowns.
You wait a little while, she'll come to her senses.
I hope you're right, Doctor.
You better come now, Doctor, if you want to get anything.
All right.
Come ahead, Paul.
Let's have some dinner.
Oh!
My head's going round like a pin wheel.
My heart's beating like a steam engine.
Feel.
(GIGGLING)
When did you first start having heart troubles?
From the first moment I met you.
Then why have you been holding out on me?
Well, you see, darling, I'm only a poor newspaper man and we don't make much money.
But from now on, I'm keeping track of the overhead.
And when I've saved enough money, we're going to be married.
You sound as if you were proposing to my grandmother.
What am I going to be doing while you're saving the first million?
Waiting for me.
Waiting isn't my idea of the king of indoor sports.
I've no intention of waiting around for three or four years while you harvest an additional crop of wild oats.
Now see here, darling, I'm not as bad as that.
No, but you're no Saint Anthony.
You're just human, so am I. That's why I don't want to wait.
Jerry, you certainly say it straight.
Sure.
Isn't that the way we're going to be?
Straight from the shoulder, open, above board?
Oh, you're a great girl.
And you know, you've got a man's point of view.
That's why we're gonna make a go of it.
Everything equal.
- You bet.
- 75/25.
Hmm?
Shake.
When will you marry me?
Tomorrow?
- Oh, gracious, no.
- Next week?
- Oh, I couldn't.
- What, next month?
Well, maybe.
Oh, the first, Jerry, huh?
That's three whole, long weeks off.
Oh, please the first, huh?
Say yes.
I won't let you go until you say yes.
Say yes, darling, say yes.
For the love of Mike, lady, say yes so I can get out of here.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
You're not eating a thing, Paul.
Buck up, there's nothing to worry about.
I'm not so sure.
I wish you'd have a look for them.
Right-o, Doctor.
I know right where she fishes.
It'll only take a minute.
- Well, for the love of Pete.
- No, for the love of Ted.
Where have you been and why?
Remember anything you say will be used against you.
Answer yes or no.
I've already said yes.
Yes.
- Yes.
- Well!
Hope you don't mind?
Would it make any difference whether I do or not?
No.
You rascal.
- I'm simply thrilled.
Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Hey, customers.
(ALL RESPONDING)
Boy and girl take big leap.
Hear it and weep.
(ALL CONGRATULATING)
- Sorry, old man.
- So am I.
- It may be possible that...
- Oh, it's all right, let's forget it, Doctor.
Attaboy.
Well, aren't you gonna congratulate me, Don?
Ted's the one I'm congratulating.
Lucky dog.
And to think that you brought us together.
My mistake.
Why, you're not suggesting that your slightly shopworn emotions were ever centered on me, are you?
And why not?
You're a fascinating wench, Jerry.
- Well, it's too late.
- Never too late to yearn.
You'll never die yearning.
Here we are.
Great Scott, I thought you said a drink.
Oh, it'll do you good.
- A place for the future bride and groom.
- That's awfully sweet of you.
Now, darling, I want you to eat something.
Here.
You two have a pickle.
It's good for those in love.
- Mary?
- What?
You're not ever going to marry, are you?
- Is this a proposition?
- No, no.
No.
Why not?
Of course, you haven't a moral to your back, but you're young and good-looking and rich.
Millions for defense but not one cent for alimony.
What a lot of heathen you are!
Oh, Dad, don't let them worry you.
Anyway, Ted and I are gonna be married and stay married, aren't we, darling?
Yes, we're going to stay married.
How unpatriotic.
A man should be willing to lay down more than one wife for his country.
You know what time it is?
We must be on our way.
Got to pack that toothbrush.
Got to take this on the run.
I might stay here and finish this, darling.
TED:
I want a great big helping of that.
Well, I'm a big engaged man, you know, I've got to eat.
- Paul, I thought...
- Hello, Jerry.
- We were just drinking to your happiness.
- Oh, thanks.
And I was binding up the wounds.
Never thought of myself, of course.
Wounds?
Nonsense.
Why, Paul and I have always been friends.
We're gonna stay friends, aren't we?
I'm afraid so, Jerry.
I wish you all the luck in the world.
Of course you do.
Hey, Romeo, are you packed?
Coming up to finish, Juliet.
I can't let you out of my sight a minute.
Oh, you sweet darling.
Soon you'll be wondering how to get rid of me.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
TED:
Stop your fooling.
Ha, ha.
You funny little man.
- Here, time.
- ALL:
Great!
(ALL APPLAUDING)
- Marvelous time, Doc.
- Goodbye.
I had a marvelous time.
See you at the wedding.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Doctor, we had a perfectly grand time.
- I'm awfully glad.
Most marvelous party I ever attended.
- See you in town, Doctor.
- Hey!
Excuse me.
You coming with me, Dot?
- Try and get rid of me.
- Yeah, well, come along.
PAUL:
Come on, we gotta get going.
- MARY:
Dorothy?
- Yeah.
Listen, dear, do you think Paul ought to drive?
Oh, don't be such a crab.
You'd think you were my mother instead of my sister.
Come on.
See you down the car.
- All right.
- Come on, darling.
- There we are.
- Now, Paul.
Hadn't you better let Hank drive?
Oh, say, I'm all right, Mary.
I'm fit as a fiddle.
- Is it all right with you, Dot?
- Anything you do is okay with me.
There you are.
Come on, let's go.
- Everything all right, Paul?
- Sure, get aboard, Hank.
- PAUL:
Come on, put your bag in there.
- All right.
I'll do that.
HANNAH:
Wait a minute, Doctor.
Did you remember to lock the cellar door?
- Paul.
Paul, please be careful.
- Who said careful?
Let's go.
Paul, please be careful.
Paul, please drive slower.
Oh, you hear me!
Will you stop?
Please!
(SCREAMING)
(MARY SCREAMING)
My God.
They've turned over!
Here, come on, boys.
Get my case, there.
JERRY:
Oh, Mary.
I'm all right.
I'm all right.
Dorothy!
Oh, Ted, let me see her.
No, please let me see her.
Well, I want to see her.
I've got to see her.
Where is she?
Oh, God, please don't stop me.
Don't!
Dorothy!
Oh, she's dead.
Oh, she's dead.
Father, she's not...
No, no.
She's still alive.
We must get her to the hospital quick.
No, she's not, she's dead.
You're lying to me.
Let me see her face.
(SCREAMS)
Mary.
Mary, come up here.
Don't look at her.
Oh, I never thought it'd be so horrible, Jerry.
- Just come away.
Don't look at her.
- Oh, I hope she dies.
- Jerry, I hope she dies.
- You don't know what you're saying, Mary.
She was so pretty.
I hope she dies.
You!
You!
You dirty rotten beast!
I told you not to drive.
I tell you, if you've killed my sister, you'll pay for this.
Mary, you don't know what you're saying.
Got drunk, just because Jerry turned you down.
You quitter.
You rotten, rotten quitter.
You hear me on this, you'll pay for this.
If you've wrecked my sister's life, I'll make you pay for this.
I'll make you pay for it.
I'll make you pay for it.
Oh, that rotten beast!
(BRIDAL CHORUS PLAYING ON ORGAN)
- With this ring...
- TED:
With this ring I thee wed.
...I thee wed.
- In the name of the Father...
- In the name of the Father and of the Son...
...and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
...and of the Holy Ghost.
- Amen.
- Amen.
God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost.
Bless, preserve and keep you.
The Lord mercifully with his favor look upon you and fill you with all spiritual benediction and grace that ye may so live together in this life that in the world to come ye may have life everlasting.
Amen.
Well, it ain't my place to say it, Miss Jerry, but if I had a boss that was so hard-boiled he wasn't satisfied with my working all day at the office without slaving home at night,
I'd tell him to go to...
The place he's heading for, and moreover...
Thank you, Hannah.
Have you got Mr. Ted's bag packed?
Just going to.
No offense is intended and I hope none will be took, but if I had a husband that went to Chicago on the third anniversary of his wedding, leaving me behind, I wouldn't consider it natural.
But he has to go, Hannah.
It's on business.
Well, I suppose so.
Oh, Miss Jerry, if you don't need me anymore,
I've got a date to go to the second show with the butcher.
Are his intentions honorable, Hannah?
(SIGHS)
I'm afraid they are.
He just wants to keep a good customer.
(MAN WHISTLING)
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, Ted.
- Many happy returns.
- Same to you, darling.
I brought you something.
- Surprise.
- Ted.
- Go ahead, open it.
- Oh, you darling.
Just to remind you that you married me three years ago today.
Ted, you adorable, extravagant wretch, you.
- You must've robbed a bank.
- No, it belonged to my mother.
- I had it reset for you.
- Oh, it's lovely, darling.
- You like it?
- Mmm.
It's to keep your wedding ring company.
You dear.
It's lovely.
Will you think of me every time you look at it?
As though I didn't think of you every second of every minute, of every hour, of every day.
You darling.
- Gee, that's slick.
- You really like it, darling, huh?
I'm glad.
Did I ever happen to mention what a wonderful girl I think you are?
Well, not for a long time.
I'd like to make love to you till you scream for help.
Can't scream.
(SIGHS)
Three whole years and I love you more than ever.
That goes double, sweetheart.
And every anniversary is going to be just that much better.
Mmm.
How long are you going to be gone?
Well, not any longer than I can help, sweetheart.
But I'm afraid it'll spoil a week.
Oh.
I'll miss you like the mischief.
(HURD Y-GURD Y PLAYING)
Ah.
A New York nightingale.
No romance complete without one.
(HORN BLARING)
(PEOPLE CLAMORING)
Come on, you're going upstairs.
(IN ITALIAN ACCENT) Where do I go, upstairs?
Yeah, up the stairs.
Thanks, you're too much.
Oh, what a nice baby.
Sure, I go upstairs.
Come on, baby.
(EX CLAIMS)
I'm gonna take you upstairs.
We'll make a nice time.
Ladies and gentlemen, make way for the wild and wicked wop.
Thrills the ladies for nothing at all.
From the old country.
What a man!
He eats them alive.
Hello, Jerry.
How are you?
Don!
HANK:
I love everybody.
I am the great big lover.
You don't know what...
Oh, what a grand, beautiful baby.
Oh, hi!
All my life I look for such a beautiful bambina.
Hey, you bust up my big moment.
What's the matter you?
Come to me, I am the great, big, Italian lover.
Stop it, now I'm ticklish.
Come to my arms, kiddo.
Come to my arms.
Say, I come all to pieces.
What's a matter you?
- Well, you can quit right now.
- Is that so?
HELEN:
When he was a child...
Oh, my dear, I'm so sorry.
I forgot all about you.
This is Janice.
- I don't know your last name.
- Meredith.
Mrs. Dickson Meredith.
- Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Meredith?
- Just a floating grass widow.
Floats them and gets them.
Oh, please.
We found her in a little restaurant where we stopped off.
She said she knew Ted and was lonesome, so we brought her along.
Hello, Ted.
Hello, Janice.
Well, she does seem to know you.
HELEN:
You know Bill, Jerry.
Oh, hello, Bill.
You know Bill Baldwin.
- I've heard of him.
- How are you?
He owns Arkansas and Texas.
No, no, wait.
Only Arkansas.
Listen, everybody.
Silence in the court, please.
I rap for order.
(PLAYS PIANO)
Oh, what a cranium.
I wish to announce on this happy occasion...
How's that?
I can't tell yet.
Because of the excellent example set by our young friends here,
I shall, one week from today, go tripping and blushing up the aisle with a gentleman from Arkansas.
(PLAYING BRIDAL CHORUS ON PIANO)
Nice work, Bill.
Congratulations.
- And me, too.
- Much obliged.
That's all right.
Well, if we're going anywhere, let's get under way.
I'm sorry, Don, I can't.
I'm taking the late train to Chicago.
- Chicago?
- Yeah, it's just one of those things.
- Business, you know.
- Isn't that a shame?
Jerry's going to be awfully lonesome.
You can celebrate without me.
- Take her along.
- Why, certainly, I'd be only too glad to.
That's sweet of you.
Anyway, darling, we're all going down to the train to see you off.
- Aren't we, kids?
- Sure we are.
- You'll be back for our wedding, Ted?
- Well, you bet you.
I wouldn't miss it.
Hey, let's do a little celebrating.
Sweetie, out in the refrigerator...
Well, you know.
- I got you.
- Make it snappy.
Helen, I'm so excited about you getting married.
And me, too.
I'm thrilled to death.
(EX CLAIMS)
Oh, don't get excited, it's all right.
I'll take them right off.
My Italian blood, she is very excited.
I must sing, that's all.
I've got to sing.
All right.
(PLAYING HURD Y-GURD Y)
Hurry up, Jerry.
Get the pennies.
Hurry up, get some more pennies.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
HANK:
Hey, what you do...
Ted.
Say, what the deuce did you horn in on this party for?
I wanted to see the woman that stood between us.
Do you realize that this is my wedding anniversary?
It's not decent.
Why haven't I heard from you in a month?
- Conscience.
- You're not that old-fashioned, are you?
Now see here, Janice.
I was plastered, and you know it.
Oh, but you're not such a sterling character when my arms are around you.
- Be true to me in Chicago?
- Cut it out, Janice.
Cut it... (WHISTLING)
A little cramped for room, weren't you?
If I could think as fast as that I might have stayed married.
Think of all the fun you'd have missed.
Ted, you have a train to catch.
- I hadn't forgotten, dear.
- Oh, really?
Good.
And some guests who are only thirsty.
I'm going to dress.
Ah.
- That gal's real opposition.
- Well, you're not.
Get that straight.
- Ted.
- Open that door.
- Now, Ted...
- I said open that door.
- Here we are, folks.
- The drought's broken.
Tell Jerry to hurry, will you, dear?
We haven't much time.
Yes, I'll tell her.
She'll be out in a minute.
- Excuse me, Bill.
- Okay.
- You ready, Jerry?
- Just about.
You know, it's a darn shame I've got to get on that train tonight, isn't it?
Yes, Janice and I will both miss you.
Oh, now see here, Jerry.
How do you like this little pose?
Don't you think it's rather fetching?
- Now, what are you driving at?
- Nothing.
Except that Janice seemed to be rather enjoying herself when I came into the kitchen just now.
(CHUCKLING)
Nonsense.
(WHISTLING)
It was something in the way she looked at you that made me want to kill her.
Am I right, Ted?
(WHISTLING)
Am I right?
You know I won't lie to you.
Oh.
Jerry.
Then...
She has a right to look at you any way she likes?
Now see here, Jerry.
I'm sorry, darling.
Of course.
But there's no sense in over-playing it.
There's nothing to it.
Come on.
Snap out of it.
It isn't the end of the world, darling.
Why gosh, I don't care a snap of my fingers for any woman in the world but you.
If I'd killed somebody, you'd go all the way and back again for me.
I'd ask you to try and forgive me if I thought it was the right thing to do.
But that isn't the point.
Darling, you've got to get a broader look at things, that's all.
Well, you're out in the world doing a man's work.
Was that just a lot of talk about a man's point of view?
Please believe, me, darling.
It doesn't mean a thing.
Not a thing.
Doesn't make the slightest difference.
Come on, snap out of it.
Now, pull yourself together.
Yes, of course.
We're... (CHUCKLES)
We're celebrating our third anniversary, aren't we?
All right, Ted, I won't spoil it.
We'll think another time.
That's fine.
And that, too.
We'll do that another time.
What could've happened to those kids?
Here, cut out the private farewells and come on out here.
Don't you realize that we have a lot of catching up to do?
Jerry's awfully upset, Don.
Yes, I know, about your going to Chicago.
Well, never mind.
I'll cheer her up.
There's nothing I like better than taking care of lonesome wives who talk exclusively about their husbands.
Come, come.
A little cheer for the departing host.
Here you are.
Thank you.
Here you are, Ted.
- Oh, thanks, old boy.
- Not at all.
Oh, sorry to have held up the party.
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, there you are.
Here you are, darling.
Thank you, Helen.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the bride and groom.
May they never be less happy than they are at this moment.
HELEN:
Cheerio.
DON:
Skoal.
May we never be less happy than we are at this moment.
Why, Jerry!
- What's the idea?
- What did you do that for?
Just an old Spanish custom.
- Come on, everybody, let's go.
- Get my coat, will you, dear?
Jerry!
HANK:
I always did like saying goodbye to husbands.
Well, I guess we'd better be off.
Well, that's all right.
Here you are, Ted.
Here's your hat and coat.
Now, you're sure you have everything packed?
You've got your pajamas, your toothbrush and everything?
Everything set?
Now, hurry up, come on.
(IN ITALIAN ACCENT) Well, well, come on, hurry up, Jerry.
We've got to get some business.
Hurry up, hurry up.
Make it quick.
Hurry up.
That's it, baby.
- Oh, porter?
- Yes, sir.
Porter, how long do we stop at the next station?
Long enough to telephone?
Yes, sir.
If you ain't gonna talk to nobody too far.
We're supposed to stop there in about six minutes.
- I see.
Thanks.
- You're welcome.
DON:
Same old plight I've always had with keyholes.
You stick with me and I'll win this one.
I'm going to invent a key for leaping keyholes.
(JERRY CHUCKLES)
- Thanks, Don.
- Don't mention it.
- Nice of you to bring me home.
- Oh, it's all right, it's all right.
Sorry to be such a nuisance and drag you away.
- Smarty, smarty had a party.
- And everybody stayed but smarty, I know.
Yeah.
Sure.
(WHISTLING)
What's the matter with you, Jerry?
I'm just trying to hang onto the marvelous latitude of a man's point of view.
But I find I can't do it and rub elbows with Janice.
- What do you mean, Janice?
- Oh, don't stall, Don.
I know all about it.
Ted told me tonight.
Oh.
(WHISTLING)
And I suppose I'm the last one to find it out.
Listen, how could any man who ever held you in his arms be serious about Janice?
I know, Don.
It doesn't mean a thing.
Ted told me that.
Not a thing.
Well, how could it?
You're too marvelous.
You're a wonderful girl, Jerry.
Thanks, Don.
But nevertheless, I couldn't stand the party.
Oh, it doesn't mean a thing.
Janice?
Not a thing.
That's funny.
Very funny.
(LAUGHING)
Let me in on the joke.
It doesn't mean a thing, not a thing.
What's the matter with me?
Jerry.
I'm sorry.
You know, I can't understand it.
Oh, come on now.
Pull yourself together.
Please, Don.
Oh, now, darling.
It doesn't mean a thing.
Not a thing.
Now, now, now.
There.
Hello?
Hello?
Can't you get it?
I know, but keep on trying, will you, please?
This is very important.
I've only got a few minutes, you know.
There, there, there, don't you worry your little head about Janice.
Janice, my hat!
Why, you're the grandest girl.
You got everything.
Most wonderful girl in the world.
Feel better now.
Thanks for being so sympathetic.
Been awfully sweet, Don.
I guess I'm all right now.
You'd better run along like a good fellow.
- Oh, somebody forgot something.
- What is it?
- What's that letter?
- Which one?
There's only one.
Looks like a "J" when it stops dancing.
"J" for Janice.
I wonder why she left that?
She took everything else.
Oh, I've got to get out of here.
I can't stand it.
This place is haunted.
Come on, Don.
Okay, where do you wanna go?
Oh, anywhere as long as it isn't here and I'm not alone.
Okay by me.
I got plenty of places to go and lots of things to do.
We'll go all the places and do all the things.
(PHONE RINGING)
(SWING MUSIC PLAYING)
(TROUPE SINGING SWING TUNE)
(WHISTLING)
Jerry?
Oh, Jerry?
(WHISTLING)
Hello, Jerry.
Hello, Ted.
- You'll upset a perfectly good breakfast.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I...
- I brought you something.
- Oh, how lovely, Ted.
That's sweet of you.
Well, aren't you going to kiss me?
Well, I love you, so why not?
Where's Hannah?
Oh, she had to go to the dentist.
That tooth that's been bothering her for the last eight years.
Oh, really?
That's too bad.
Nice trip?
Oh, no, awful nuisance.
A lot of big dinners, and bald heads and double chins.
You know, stupid.
Too bad.
Oh.
- Smells good.
- Oh, this is great, Jerry.
So, why didn't you answer the wires I sent you?
Oh, there was a lot to think about.
And the longer you wait, the more sense you get.
You know, letting things ride the way you did certainly whipped me plenty.
Boy.
You know, I imagined all sorts of receptions when I got home.
- This is great.
- You'll spill it.
Well, believe me, I've done all the spilling I want to do.
Yes?
- Anything new?
- No.
Oh, Helen and Bill are going to get married today.
Oh, really?
I suppose we'll have to go to that.
- I'm best man.
- Oh, yeah?
And after the wedding tonight, there's going to be a jamboree.
- A get-together of all their friends.
- Thanks.
Oh, gosh.
I suppose we'll have to go to that, too.
Well, they'll expect us to.
You know, it was our blissful example that made them do it.
Was there an overtone of sarcasm in that remark, Jerry?
Or am I looking for trouble?
Hmm?
No, Ted.
Your cheeriness is amazing.
Well, what do you mean?
You're like a little boy that's stolen some jam, been spanked, and kissed, and is happy again.
You know, that's just the way I feel.
You know, Jerry, darling,
I was afraid of my life we wouldn't hurdle this.
Gosh, you'll never know what an awful week I've spent without you.
I can't live without you, Jerry.
I never knew how much I loved you.
Darling, please.
Now, don't do that.
Well, for heaven's sake, Jerry, you'll have to make up your mind, you know, one way or the other.
Gosh, I thought you'd already done it.
Ted, let me understand something.
When you say that being unfaithful doesn't mean anything, you mean just that, don't you?
- Well, what I said was...
- Yes.
I remember what you said.
"It doesn't mean a thing."
I wish I could cover up things and forget them, Ted.
(PHONE RINGING)
I'll answer that.
Hello.
- Hello, Jerry?
- Yes.
This is Don.
I've been trying to get in touch with you ever since...
Well, for the last week.
I understand Ted's getting back in town today.
I realize how you feel and I sympathize with all your ideas about truth, honesty and ethics.
I want you to give me your word that you won't say anything to Ted.
- Will you do that?
- No.
For heaven's sake.
Don't you realize it will be all up with you if you tell Ted?
Perhaps.
Well, if you won't consider yourself, will you consider me?
After all, I'm supposed to be his best friend.
And...
Hello?
Hello?
Don't hang...
Hello, Jerry?
Oh, Lawson?
Lawson?
- Yes, sir?
- Find out what boats are sailing today.
- Where to, sir?
- I don't care, the further the better.
Yes, sir.
What were you saying when the telephone rang?
That I've balanced our accounts.
That's all.
I didn't really intend to, but that's how it is.
I had to tell you.
Don't look at me like that, Ted.
- You don't mean that, Jerry.
- I'm telling you the truth.
- Who's the man?
- Oh, Ted, don't be conventional.
Who's the man?
I want to see him.
Isn't it a rather good time to remember what you said?
- That it doesn't mean a thing?
- Shut up, you!
It can't be true.
Why, I always thought you were the most decent thing in the world.
Can't be true.
Well, it is.
I'm going to work, Ted.
I'm late.
See you tonight.
(DOOR CLOSING)
(BAND PLAYING DANCE MUSIC)
MAN:
Great party.
- Hello, Jerry.
- Hello, Hank.
- Ted back from Chicago?
- Yes.
Is he coming tonight?
I don't know.
I haven't seen him since the morning.
What's the idea?
Well, you're a full-fledged married man now.
- You certainly have a fine girl, there.
- Sure.
I hope you'll be very happy.
We're bound to be, aren't we, darling?
Say, let me tell you something.
All you have to do to get a free sandwich here,
- is to wish them health and happiness.
- This is a private party.
I understand all that.
- Hello, Ted.
- Helen.
- I told you they knew me.
- Yes, sir.
- Hello, Arkansas.
- How are you?
I'm sorry I'm late, Helen.
Husbands should never be late.
No, sir.
You never know who's sitting on the bench waiting to take your place when you fall out of the game.
Oh, don't be silly, Ted.
What made you so late?
Well, I...
- This little hand, you hand it over?
- Oh, pull yourself together, Ted.
"I weep for you," the walrus cried.
"I deeply sympathize."
I bet you haven't had any dinner?
Dinner?
No, I don't believe I have.
You better have some food, son.
I haven't seen my wife since she welcomed me home this morning.
Don't worry about her.
Have some food first.
- We'll find her later.
- No!
I'll find her.
I'm all right.
- MAN:
Hi, Ted.
Where've you been?
- Hello.
How are you?
MAN 2:
What's the matter, Ted?
MAN 3:
Hello, Ted.
- Help yourself, son.
- Help myself, huh?
All right, I'll take the blonde.
- I beg your pardon?
- It's all right.
Ted.
Look at the hero.
Just a fool, that's all.
There isn't a woman in the world worth that.
Love, honor and obey, huh?
Don't make me laugh.
- Ted!
- Where's my wife?
- Ted.
- Oh, there you are.
Oh, so you're the white-haired boy, huh?
Murderer returns to the scene of his crime.
- Ted, you don't know what you're saying.
- Wait a minute!
But I don't know whether you are or not, but just for luck...
- Ted, stop it.
Cut it out!
- Let go of me!
I'll go through this crowd like a high wind.
- Ted, pull yourself together!
- Get away from me!
BILL:
Come here, come here.
Get him out!
Does this mean that you're leaving me, Ted?
It's rather apparent, don't you think?
Oh, don't let's make a mess of things like this.
Spoil our happiness.
Happiness?
Don't you think it's a little late to talk about that?
Well, you didn't think of that when...
Oh, I see.
You're going to put all the blame on me, huh?
Oh, Ted, no.
I didn't mean to say that.
Well, listen, I'm not the first man in the world who's made a...
Oh, Ted.
Don't let's talk about men and women.
They do all sorts of things.
We've got to live our own life, dear.
There's so much of it ahead.
I'll never do anything you don't like.
I'll never make you sorry, really.
I'll forgive you anything, dear.
Can't you please forgive me?
When I try to look ahead without you, why, everything goes black.
I love you, dear.
I can't go on without you.
Oh, you'll get along all right.
You've made a pretty good beginning.
Oh, Ted, don't.
We both made a horrible mistake but that doesn't mean we can't try again.
Try again?
With all our friends laughing at me?
- Laughing at you?
- Yes.
Someplace among the people we know, there's a man.
Maybe men, I don't know.
But from now on, I'll wonder which one.
And how many of them are laughing at me?
Well, couldn't I have said that the day you asked me to marry you?
Supposing I had said,
"No, Ted.
I'm afraid I may meet the women that you've known."
And why not?
I waited for you.
You were my first love.
But this is entirely different.
All right, then, but tonight I come back here, ready to humiliate myself, beg for your forgiveness.
Ready to forgive you anything because I love you.
And you say that's different?
- You tell me your vanity is hurt?
- Oh, call it anything you like.
Vanity!
I'll never forget that.
Let's not talk anymore about it.
And I thought your heart was breaking like mine.
But instead, you tell me your man's pride can't stand the gaffe.
- Now, wait a minute, Jerry.
Listen...
- No, I don't want to listen.
I'm glad I discovered there's more than one man in the world while I'm young and they want me.
Believe me, I'm not missing anything from now on.
I don't doubt it.
Once a woman throws down her fences...
Oh, print it on a motto and hang it where Janice can see it.
- Stop that!
- Oh, loose women, great,
- but not in the home, eh, Ted?
- Cut it, do you hear?
(SCOFFING) The looser they are, the more they get.
The best in the world.
No responsibility!
Well, my dear, I'm gonna find out how they do it.
So look for me in the future where the prim roses grow and pack your man's pride with the rest.
And from now on, you're the only man in the world that my door is closed to.
That is all.
Counsel will prepare the decree.
This decree is interlocutory and becomes final in three months.
Congratulations, my darling, you're free.
You're exactly as you were before you were married.
Exactly.
All I need is a complete set of young illusions and an innocent expression.
Oh, cheer up.
I had a very good time as an ex-wife.
Why shouldn't you?
- All men are fair game.
- Yes, but I guess there's only one...
Oh, nonsense.
I'll show you a flock of them.
Friends of Bill's.
They're as rich as mud.
In a year, you'll have forgotten the color of Ted's hair.
- I hope so.
- My dear, I know so.
All right, Helen.
From now on,
I take all the hurdles, see all the scenery and listen to the band play.
Come along.
(BAND PLAYING JAZZ MUSIC)
(WHOOPING)
(PEOPLE CHEERING)
- Ted.
- Yeah?
I just want to wish you a happy New Year.
Thank you.
Same to you.
Don't let me keep you from your friend.
JERRY:
Oh, I couldn't think of accepting such a valuable gift.
MAN 1:
But, my dear, my feeling for you is purely platonic.
Really?
I've heard of platonic love, but I didn't know there was such a thing as platonic jewelry.
MAN 2:
My dear, Jerry.
You American women are so cold.
JERRY:
Are you sure you can tell whether a woman is cold or careful?
(MAN 3 SPEAKING FRENCH)
JERRY:
Uh-uh.
I don't understand French, but I know the symptoms of high blood pressure in any language.
MAN 3:
Aw.
By the way, Jerry, I see your husband around quite a lot.
Oh, yeah?
Well, the next time you see him, you tell him I'm still holding my own.
MAN 4:
I didn't know you had a husband, Jerry.
I had, but I haven't.
Let's drink to his health, the infernal fool.
When you have grown old, you will be very, very sorry.
Yes, I know.
I shall most likely push back the gray hair, curse at the wrinkles, and say, "You did not allow the great Ivan to make love to you,
"and now look at you."
Jerry, darling, what you need is a great romance.
Oh, one more would be the death of me.
What are you doing in my train, anyway?
International peace conference at Boston.
Stop off a day or so.
It might amuse you, eh?
Why not?
Two reasons.
One, I am, after all, a businesswoman on my way to a convention in Toronto.
And the other reason?
You are much too fascinating.
Jerry, darling, I have madly loved you for a year or so.
What you feel for me is not love.
It's the call of the gorilla to its mate.
Funny picture.
Ivan swinging through the tree tops.
Oh, am I cramping your style?
- I am serious.
- Oh, you mean you're proposing to me?
Jerry, you are too clever to be provincial.
Much too clever.
Do I not interest you?
- Possibly.
- Tell me the truth.
The truth?
The last thing any man wants to hear from any woman.
That's a lesson I learned from my husband.
And what you learn at your husband's knee, you never forget.
You shall not amuse yourself with me.
(EX CLAIMS)
(BELL BUZZING)
Only the bell saved me.
Come in.
Porter, will you open the window?
It seems a bit warm in here.
Yes, ma'am.
- That's all, ma'am?
- Yes, that's all.
Thank you.
Yes.
Oh.
Why, Paul.
Come in here!
Hello, Jerry.
How are you?
Oh, it's so long since I've seen you.
You should have a long gray beard.
Not at all.
I just happen to catch a glimpse of you through the door.
Oh, do you know...
Oh, how do you do?
I met you once at the press club.
Yes, of course.
Well, listen, what are you doing up so late and so far from home?
Oh, you are old friends, eh?
Oh, yes, we're very old friends.
In fact, I'm the man she should've married.
But that would have been not so fortunate for some of us.
Yes, I'd have been particular about some of her friends.
- I beg your pardon?
- Why...
Pardon me.
I have so many things to talk over with Paul.
Will you excuse us a few moments, Ivan?
Just a few moments?
Mmm-hmm.
(WOMAN EX CLAIMS)
Look here, young man.
I've been bumped five times between New Haven and Springfield and it's got to stop.
Sorry.
Rather dangerous playmate, isn't he?
Oh, well, perhaps that's what makes him amusing.
- Paul, I am so glad to see you.
- Then you haven't forgotten me?
Far from it.
In fact, I'm trembling like a leaf.
You bring back so much, so suddenly.
You've been trying to forget quite a lot, haven't you, Jerry?
- Who told you that?
- Oh, nobody.
I've been around New York most of the time.
Oh.
And heard the echo of my misdeeds as I thundered up and down Broadway?
Why haven't I seen you?
I understand several were killed in the rush.
Well, you don't exactly take the veil when your decree is granted, you know.
- So I understand.
- Oh, that sounds disapproving.
What should an ex-wife do?
Spend her days doing good deeds?
Going to bed at night with suitable books?
Great Scott, Jerry.
I'm not criticizing.
Why, whatever you do, as far as I'm concerned, is all right, because you do it.
That's sweet of you, Paul.
Where are you bound for?
- Away from New York.
- Oh, yeah?
Tomorrow will find me on my boat in some quiet little cove.
No office, no telephone, no neighbors.
It's good for the nerves.
You ought to try something like that, Jerry.
It'd do you good.
Sounds wonderful.
But not for me.
It's too late for that sort of thing.
I've worked too hard and played too hard.
I take my outings in the subway and my exercise in the nightclub.
I belong to the sweet, pure air of 42nd Street and Broadway.
Not you, Jerry.
I know better.
Well, don't let's talk about me.
Tell me about Dorothy, Paul.
Well, we're still married.
Oh, just that?
I've heard your name quite often, Jerry.
- From whom?
- Dorothy.
Oh, why?
She knows that I loved you, Jerry.
That I always have and always will.
My dear, you don't mean that.
You're not going to tell me that love is anything lasting.
I've tried to forget that.
Forever and a day, Jerry.
And after that.
Oh, I've made such a mess of it, Paul.
I'm so tired.
Forgive me, Jerry.
I didn't mean to upset you.
I'm so tired.
You brought back so much.
Oh, I...
I'm so fed up.
I've made such a wreck of things.
Such a good for nothing mess.
Well, what is it, dear.
What's the matter?
I'm just dizzy.
I can't see.
Oh, I'm not going to faint, but I'm just...
Jerry, take it easy, please.
It's all right, dear.
Oh, you mustn't let yourself go this way.
Come on, dear.
It's all right.
It's all right, Jerry.
You're just worn out, you're tired.
It's all right, Jerry.
It's all right, dear.
I'll see you in the morning.
Oh, listen, old man.
Jerry's pretty tired and she's not feeling well, but I think she'll sleep.
So if I were you, I wouldn't go back.
You assume some rights, do you not?
You are not her guardian.
- No, but you're not going back.
- No?
- We shall see.
- I mean it.
Oh.
Good old American custom, eh, minding other people's business?
What sentimental slop!
You are not protecting an innocent girl.
- She is nothing more...
- Why, you...
That's another good old American custom.
- Oh, porter?
- Yes?
There's only supposed to be one person in Drawing Room A, isn't there?
- Yes, boss.
- Well, see that's how it is.
Get me?
I get you.
Did he hurt you, boy?
Go away!
Mmm-mmm!
He's got a kick on him like a Missouri mule.
What are you thinking of?
Oh, how nice it is.
And how much you can shake off with just a little change in environment.
Happy?
You look great.
I told you what a couple of weeks would do for you.
- Oh, it's been lovely, Paul.
- It's yours for the rest of your life, Jerry.
- With my compliments.
- Thank you.
Oh, Jerry,
I have here the confirmation of my appointment to the Far East from my firm.
You like the idea, don't you?
If I can take you.
There's nothing anywhere without you.
What about Dorothy?
She'll be much happier, Jerry.
Our marriage hasn't meant anything.
She's always bitter and morbid.
Never lets me forget for a minute the accident that disfigured her.
Oh, well, you know.
Poor Dorothy.
It hasn't been easy for you either, has it, dear?
Oh, it's been fair enough, Jerry.
It's just that it hasn't mattered very much, but now things are different.
I have this offer, it's interesting.
And most important, I found you.
Dorothy'll give me a divorce.
You and I can be married and...
And we'll be happy.
- You think so, Paul?
- I'm crazy about you, Jerry.
Always have been.
I believe you.
I really do.
They want me to spend five years in Japan.
You know, we can have a beautiful time.
Leave all our mistakes 7,000 miles behind us.
7,000 miles.
It sounds grand.
We deserve a little happiness, don't you think?
I think you do, Paul.
I think you deserve anything you can get.
(HANNAH CLEARS THROAT)
Beg pardon.
Lunch will be ready in just a minute, Miss Jerry.
Good news, Hannah.
- Nice here, eh?
- It's just heaven.
Of course I ain't heard any angels singing, but aside from that...
Well, we've got to eat anyway.
Hey, come on.
Don't you know it's 4:00 in the morning?
The night is young and we are practically children.
- Hello, Joe.
- How are you?
How about a table for six?
Harry, table for six in the other room.
HARRY:
Right this way, please.
I want four specials and two orders of turkey legs.
Oh, here we are.
Right here.
Well, isn't New York a wonderful place?
You go to shows and you see legs.
You go to restaurants, and they give you legs.
(LAUGHING)
Don't laugh, Joe.
It's a serious matter.
- Don.
- Well, this is luck.
Well, you old son of a sea cook.
I didn't even know you were in New York.
I've been in Europe for the last few months.
Just got back.
Well, you're doing a lot of that sort of thing, aren't you?
Gee, I'm glad to see you.
Same here.
How've you been?
Oh, fine.
Lost my job yesterday.
And I'm nursing a pretty, little hangover today.
- Outside of that, I'm great.
- That's tough.
Anything I can do?
No, thanks.
I'll work it out all right.
- Say, it seems ages since I've seen you.
- Mmm.
Seen any of the old mob?
Mmm-mmm.
I suppose you heard about Jerry and me?
- Yeah.
Too bad.
- Oh, well.
That's life.
Say, I'd like to get together with you, Don.
- Fine.
- How about tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
I'm off again tomorrow.
- Canada, for a couple of weeks.
- Really?
- When I get back.
- Sure, if I'm here.
- Oh, you leaving town?
- Yes.
New York's bad medicine.
A lot of things I want to forget.
I can't seem to do it very well around here.
I know exactly how you feel.
You see, I keep thinking what a sad, little fellow I am, and brooding over the man that ruined my life.
- What would you do if you found him?
- Kill him, I suppose.
Funny, isn't it, how one girl can be bigger than all the tall buildings?
Well, I'll look you up.
When you get settled, let me know.
I may start and never stop.
(CHUCKLES)
That's my specialty.
Well, so long.
So long, Don.
She'll be in any minute now, Miss Helen.
She knows you're here.
- You going to Japan with them, Hannah?
- Oh, sure.
I want to see where the money's gone.
I've gave to foreign missions for the heathen.
How soon are they starting?
Oh, I forget you've been honeymooning so long you don't know anything.
His wife's going to let him loose.
It'll be soon, now.
Miss Jerry's gave up her job.
- Really?
She's resigned?
- Mmm-hmm.
And her firm come right back with an offer of $7,500 a year to go to London.
- They have branches in Europe.
- Hooray for Jerry.
Personally, I'd a darn sight rather go to London than to Yokohokohamie.
- Hello there, darling!
- Jerry.
Well, globetrotter bride and what have you.
Hello, yourself, you stormy petrel.
It's about time I came back.
Gee whiz, but I'm glad to see you.
Say, I've missed you like the dickens, Helen.
You, getting yourself out of one upheaval into another all the time.
Let me take a look at you.
Better be careful, darling.
My sea legs are still wobbly.
Now tell me, are you happy?
Yes, sure.
Bill's a big shot in his way.
He stands without hitching.
Nice and secure, eh?
Yes, but...
That other business.
You know, when you stand at the altar with someone you're wild about and the organ makes you dizzy and you say,
"This is heaven and we'll last forever."
Of course, that's gone forever.
- I wish you hadn't said that, Helen.
- But why?
Well, that brings my leaping mind back to its big news.
Big news?
We ran across Ted.
- Where?
- In Paris.
Saw quite a lot of him.
What's he doing?
Trying to wreck a fairly good mind and an A-1 body.
Really?
He's doing newspaper work, for the time being.
Of course, it won't last.
Ask about me?
My dear, he hates you so hard, I think he's still mad about you.
Oh, no, he's not.
Making a fool of himself, eh?
Oh, well, you know what Americans do in Paris.
When they meet someone who speaks American and knows Paris.
Ted was taking bets to see how many nights in succession he could stay drunk without spending a cent for it.
He'd gone six weeks when we started.
You know, Bill's been crazy about him ever since he broke up our wedding party.
It seems in the West where men are so and so, that, that's considered a pretty good piece of work.
Well, anyhow, I've been busting to tell you.
What a girl.
The lad I divorced is married again, has a baby and arrives in Wall Street every morning at 9:00.
Helen!
(DOORBELL RINGING)
Oh, I guess that's Paul now.
- He'll be delighted to see you, Helen.
- I'll be very glad to see him.
Oh.
It's Dorothy, Jerry.
Oh, yes, of course.
Come in, Dorothy.
I suppose I should have called you and made a date.
Well, for heaven's sake, Dorothy.
Hello, Helen.
I hear you've married again.
Yes, a big cattle and horse man.
Thanks for the tea, darling.
I must be going.
Buffalo Bill is waiting.
- I hope I didn't interrupt.
- Oh, no, not at all.
We're at the Ritz, dear.
Why don't you come over and have dinner with us?
Sorry, I have a date for dinner.
- Helen!
- Hello, Paul.
Hello.
Well, Jerry...
If anything happens to your date, dear, come on over.
Thanks.
- Goodbye, Paul, see you later.
- Goodbye, Helen.
- Have some tea, Paul, won't you?
- No, thanks, Jerry.
Well, Dot, what are you doing here?
I just wanted to see Jerry for a few minutes.
What did you want to say to her?
I guess I was going to ask her not to take you from me.
But I've told you that Jerry has no responsibility in the matter, Dot.
I thought that everything was all settled.
And besides, you said that we...
I know I said I'd set you free.
When you told me, my pride revolted at holding you against your will.
But now that I've had time to think it over, I have no pride, Paul.
Maybe our marriage hasn't meant much, but there's nothing at all without it.
It does give me an excuse for living, being married to you.
- There isn't anything else.
- Wait a minute, Dot.
You know that I'm not planning to desert you.
I've made certain definite arrangements to take care of you.
And that's everything in the world I have for you, my dear.
I have a right to a chance at some kind of personal life, haven't I?
Like anyone else?
Well, how about it, Dot?
Just a minute.
- Can't we talk afterwards?
- I'm afraid not.
I'm afraid she's right, Paul.
I couldn't do it.
I wouldn't dare expect to be happy.
Please, Paul, it hit me.
It brought back something.
Devastation just like this.
Only I deserved it.
Let me say it, Paul.
She married the man she loved.
So did I.
Every woman does, if she can.
But Dorothy is just trying to hang on.
I didn't.
I see my way.
I see it so clearly now, Paul.
I've never given my word and broken it before, except once.
And that was the promise I made on the altar with all my heart and soul.
Jerry I...
This is just a storm.
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Oh, please.
You've saved us both from a horrible mistake.
I'm really grateful.
This is right, Paul, and in our hearts we've known it, haven't we?
Marriage is the one thing in the world I thought ought to be perfect.
Nothing else is.
And when mine wasn't, I quit.
I don't know whether Ted could ever give me another chance.
But wherever he is, I'm going to find him and find out.
Jerry, if Ted doesn't come here, we'll go over to Zelly's.
We may find him there.
We'll wait a while, Hank.
What do you think he'll do when he finds you're in Paris?
Who can tell?
Why, there he is now!
- Is he alone?
- HANK:
No.
BILL:
Quite a party.
HELEN:
Jerry, don't you want to talk to him?
- Hank, will you take me over there?
- Why, certainly, Jerry.
Ted!
Come on, Ted.
Come on.
- Ted!
- Jerry!
What are you doing here?
Surprised?
Well, I thought when I put the Atlantic Ocean between us,
I wouldn't be seeing you.
You should have found a wider ocean.
Don't you think it would be more Christian if you'd give me a chance to forget you?
Do you still hate me that much, Ted?
Where's your husband?
Oh, he's not far away.
You do keep track of me, don't you?
That's why I left New York, because I couldn't think of anything else.
I'm still a little groggy, Jerry, but with time out I think I'll be able to finish the game.
You deserve the best in the world, Ted.
There's no one that wishes it for you more than I do.
Sure, I know.
And there's no reason on Earth why we can't still be friends.
No, of course not.
I hope that, that other fellow gives you the break you deserve.
I certainly didn't.
Well, here's everything, Jerry.
And happy New Year.
I'm working in London, Ted.
This is the third time I've been in Paris looking for you.
- For me?
- Yes.
Why?
You see, I had to leave New York, too.
Couldn't forget that little church and a lot of other things.
You're the only husband I've ever had and ever want.
It's New Year in a minute, Ted.
All the world gets a new chance.
Don't kid me, Jerry.
I'd give my right arm for another chance.
I like that right arm.
How about putting it around me?

- SDH
Bravo.
Not bad this time.
We'll take the refrain again and it'll be even better.
Music!
Everyone got a copy?
Let's hear that chorus.
Under the roofs of Paree What a joy for Nini
To run into her old sweetie
So he says:
It's a sign!
Now is the time
To make the church bells chime
Between us nothing's broken And I'm not jokin'
So forget the past And kiss me fast!
And Nini did forgive And happy ever after live
Under the roofs of Paree:
It's definitive!
It's a hit.
You sang well this time.
You, here!
No, miss.
But you can sing the refrain with us.
Hit it, Maestro!
That's it for today.
The accordionist is selling.
Look, you louse!
Lay off my customers.
- What's it to you?
- I'm no accomplice.
- Then turn me in.
- Give the money back.
Keep it down!
But you realized every day a bit more
My dear, what happiness is for!
Under the roofs of Paree
Enough already!
We know that one.
Fine.
Then you won't hear it ever again.
Oh, that song!
Who is it?
What do you want?
I came to say good night.
Good night.
Can't you give me a nicer good night?
Leave me alone.
You're so mean to me.
I wanted to take you dancing.
I don't feel like dancing.
You sure?
Sure you're sure?
Hey, boss, what's the damage?
Twenty-two francs.
Good night.
So long.
Sixty-three.
I win.
I won't fight with you.
Me neither.
But you're always around.
Go fight outside.
You, too!
Shall we roll for her?
The winner takes her out.
The loser lays off.
Okay.
Well, you're home.
It's nice out tonight.
How do you say it in Romanian?
Charming.
And funny, too.
Good night.
Albert.
Good night, Albert.
- Pola.
- Good night, Pola.
I have something else to say.
Then say it.
So it's no.
What now?
I can't go home.
Why not?
I don't have my key.
All right.
- Can I turn around now?
- Not yet.
Won't you be cold?
What are you afraid of?
Were you thinking that I...
Aren't you presumptuous!
Don't be afraid.
I'm not afraid.
If you're not afraid, then get undressed.
I've had enough!
This is my house.
If you don't like it, scram!
All right.
You can stay.
Don't come near me.
I have to lie down somewhere.
Leave me alone.
"Leave me alone!" But I am leaving you alone.
Will you leave me alone!
Turn on the light.
I can't sleep without a light.
This is a nightmare!
This kid's ridiculous!
Where'd you learn to carry on like this?
What do you take me for?
Not afraid to catch cold?
Okay, take the bed.
I'll sleep on the floor.
You can get back in bed now.
I'll stay down here.
No, this is your house.
Albert!
Nobody home?
Hurry up!
Open up!
C'mon, open up!
Hurry up, dammit!
Open up!
In the name of the law
I'll break the door in
Open up, in the name of the law!
We've been here for hours We should break the door down
Hello, Albert.
That was smart.
- Ain't it funny?
- Not a bit.
Poor little fella!
What do you want?
I gotta take a trip.
Can you watch this?
- Put it down.
- You're a pal.
Well?
- Thanks so much.
- Okay, spare me.
Is that all?
Yeah, good-bye.
Are you still here?
I don't want to go home.
Okay, stay here.
Make yourself at home.
Ask for the latest hit song, "It's Not Like That."
As sung in the music halls.
Words and music, one franc.
This charming lady will sell you the song with a smile.
Give 'em a big smile.
I'll sing it first, then we'll do it all together.
Music!
When a man's alone Living on his own
Life is monotone
When it's time for lunch The guy's in a crunch
He doesn't care to munch
The local restaurant Is no place for detente
He will barely stay For a cafe au lait
He's throwing his health away
It's not like that when you're in love
That's when you become a gourmet
Bring on the cake, my love
The pastries and the sundae
Sometimes she invents
Desserts with weird contents
Your stomach can make a faux pas Oolala!
But she says to you so sweetly
"I can't take another bite!"
But stuffs you so completely
That you begin to turn white
But if you get sick
She says: "You eat like a horse
"You have no remorse" Love's a charming course!
Now let's hear it.
All together now.
Give me a song.
Let's take it from the top.
The fat guy got it.
You were scared.
Who, me?
I'll show you.
I just love a brave man!
Don't go.
I'm going!
Are you two finished?
I'm going.
I'll show them how brave I am!
What do you want?
Let me by.
He's gone.
Lucky him!
I want to talk to your friend...
the singer.
Albert?
Know where he lives?
Sure.
Come over here.
Emile, I'm getting married.
I advise you to stay away from the kid.
Quit hanging around the women I like.
Who is it?
Open up.
Who is it?
In the name of the law
I'm not falling for that one again.
Police:
Open this door!
Lay off me.
You can wait.
I'll break the door in.
That's enough!
Get lost.
This is too much.
You're in for it!
Go get the locksmith.
Is all this yours?
No, it's not mine.
Hey, kid.
Come here.
Can you deliver this note?
Where'd it come from?
Someone left it here.
Who?
You won't talk?
Understand?
Go on.
How nice.
An early morning visit.
Your friend Albert just got arrested.
I hid the case at his place.
They found it.
How do you know?
I was walking by his house, and I saw some detectives taking him away.
We should get out of town.
For a while, anyway.
Your friend Albert...
Have you had any news?
No, they wouldn't let me see him.
How long has he been in prison?
Fifteen days
Your friend didn't know the contents of the suitcase?
Of course not.
He knew nothing.
You carried out this robbery with an accomplice.
Where ya been for the past month?
I took a little trip.
Leave me alone!
You haven't changed.
Not glad to see me?
- Where have you been?
- On a trip.
I'd better go find her.
Don't bother.
She'll come back on her own.
Come to the dance?
Not tonight.
Why not tonight?
Got a date?
In that case...
Come on.
Hello, Albert.
Hello, Pola.
Won't you dance with me?
Hey, you...
I hope you'll behave now.
I forbid you to look at her.
Or else...
And now...
Step outside, if you're a man.
As you like.
He's fighting Fred?
Don't go, Louis!
If you go, take this.
I don't want any.
Say...
Admit it, you're scared.
Okay, let's drop it.
But keep out of my sight.
Got it?
You guys coming?
Fred!
I didn't say good-bye.
Did you see two guys run by?
We didn't see anyone.
I didn't know you loved her.
- I don't.
- Neither do I.
You dope!
Stay here.
- You win.
- Are you kidding me?
You fell for it?
Couldn't tell it was a joke?
I never gave Pola a thought.
Go ahead and kiss her.
Pola, meet your fiance.
Not bad.
Let's take it again.
And you, miss?
It's free today.
But you'll sing with us.
All together now.

Who is it?
Open up.
Who is it?
In the name of the law
I'm not falling for that one again.
Police:
Open this door!
Lay off me.
You can wait.
I'll break the door in.
That's enough!
Get lost.
This is too much.
You're in for it!
Go get the locksmith.
Is all this yours?
No, it's not mine.
Hey, kid.
Come here.
Can you deliver this note?
Where'd it come from?
Someone left it here.
Who?
You won't talk?
Understand?
Go on.
How nice.
An early morning visit.
Your friend Albert just got arrested.
I hid the case at his place.
They found it.
How do you know?
I was walking by his house, and I saw some detectives taking him away.
We should get out of town.
For a while, anyway.
Your friend Albert...
Have you had any news?
No, they wouldn't let me see him.
How long has he been in prison?
Fifteen days
Your friend didn't know the contents of the suitcase?
Of course not.
He knew nothing.
You carried out this robbery with an accomplice.
Where ya been for the past month?
I took a little trip.
Leave me alone!
You haven't changed.
Not glad to see me?
- Where have you been?
- On a trip.
I'd better go find her.
Don't bother.
She'll come back on her own.
Come to the dance?
Not tonight.
Why not tonight?
Got a date?
In that case...
Come on.
Hello, Albert.
Hello, Pola.
Won't you dance with me?
Hey, you...
I hope you'll behave now.
I forbid you to look at her.
Or else...
And now...
Step outside, if you're a man.
As you like.
He's fighting Fred?
Don't go, Louis!
If you go, take this.
I don't want any.
Say...
Admit it, you're scared.
Okay, let's drop it.
But keep out of my sight.
Got it?
You guys coming?
Fred!
I didn't say good-bye.
Did you see two guys run by?
We didn't see anyone.
I didn't know you loved her.
- I don't.
- Neither do I.
You dope!
Stay here.
- You win.
- Are you kidding me?
You fell for it?
Couldn't tell it was a joke?
I never gave Pola a thought.
Go ahead and kiss her.
Pola, meet your fiance.
Not bad.
Let's take it again.
And you, miss?
It's free today.
But you'll sing with us.
All together now.
A vision of love that troubles my soul
and in my dream I live for you only for you, Lucia.
Bravo!
- Thanks.
Good thing he finished so soon.
He would've given us a symphony.
You're the greatest and noblest...
Silence!
Let him speak.
Let the orator speak.
Thanks, colleagues.
Thanks also to those who have booed.
But, don't forget that I still haven't paid the bill.
Forewarned is...
- You're a celebrity!
Puccini!
Wagner!
Paganini!
- No, Rossini!
- Beethoven!
- No way!
Let all these great masters rest in peace.
Enrico is something more.
- What?
The one who pays.
Before I leave, little Lucia, here's a keepsake for you.
This composition.
A brilliant work.
That you inspired in me and which will pass down into posterity.
Don't hug her!
No!
All this schmaltz for a cheap song!
- What if he wrote it for you?
When he was in love with me I was dedicated one song a day.
And that wasn't wasted music!
All right, be patient.
You'll see you can listen to Enrico's songs for the rest of your life.
But, if it wasn't for my patience, he would never have got the diploma.
Silence!
Silence!
The world's at our feet.
Trumpet!
Silence.
To you, shining glory of our conservatory and our magnificent Amphitryon.
I lost the thread.
May the success that has crowned your studies be the fitting consecration of your happiness.
In the name of Apollo, the god of music.
In the name of Melpomene, our goddess.
I...
I now pronounce you united in art... and love.
And now The Wedding March.
- No, a funeral march.
A toast to the newlyweds.
- Long live the bride and groom!
Let's sing our favourite song instead.
Let's sing our song!
No, no, no!
Enough of this music!
An orchestra of bottles!
- Yes!
An orchestra of bottles!
But they must be full.
So we can drain them.
Make sure the bottles are very large.
I won't let you run away!
- Stop!
Where are you off to?
They took to their heels.
- Let them enjoy their honeymoon.
You're jealous.
- Jealous?
Let me go!
Let me go!
Sure, sure, keep on laughing!
But when I sing at the Opera you others, music geniuses you'll all be below me, like you are now.
I'll stamp my feet so hard you'll eat the dust off the stage.
They'll be here any moment.
Here are the instruments.
Where's Enrico?
Let's go looking for him.
Let's hide.
They're coming!
Rascals!
They've disappeared.
Let's go looking for them!
- With music!
Watch out!
Are you happy?
- No.
Why?
- You're leaving tonight.
Your studies are over.
Mine not yet.
My parents are waiting the arrival of their hero.
Just a quick hug and I'll soon be back.
And I'll wait for you.
- You're not going to your mom's?
My mom...
Poor thing, she lives so far from me.
Her letters speak so little about her to me.
Will you really come back soon?
- Yes, I promise you.
Soon.
For me?
- For you...
And for our baby.
- Our baby?
You forgot about him.
- How cute he is!
Poor little thing, he's been out in the sun.
He looks just like his father!
He's got light-coloured eyes.
He's the spitting image of his mom.
No, because he's a boy.
No.
It's a girl.
Don't you see the little skirt?
It's a boy, I tell you.
- How can you tell?
Because...
Because he's got short hair.
And what will we make of him?
- Indeed!
We'll make him...
A jazz musician!
No, no, a composer like his dad.
- A composer?
But the composers compose nothing at all.
They always use someone else's music.
- Then what?
Instead, we'll make him...
A great...
- Film maker!
That's not a profession.
A theatre director?
- For God's sake!
They're all starving!
A boxer!
So he'll have lots of money!
- Lots?
Really?
Here they are!
We've found the lovebirds.
What are you doing up there?
- Oh, what a stupid question!
You were romancing, weren't you?
- No, we were just...
We were studying a new composition.
- For his new work!
A very bad one, by the way.
- Let's go.
Come down, Enrico.
Leave us alone!
- Watch out!
We'll set the tree on fire.
I'll be right down.
- Pay attention to Lucia.
Wait, easy now, Lucia.
- Mind your legs.
Be careful not to fall down.
Put your leg here.
- Yes, yes.
Here, give me your hand.
- No, come to me.
Be nice and go to bye-byes.
Daddy will come back soon.
Mom!
Mom!
Miss Lucia!
Where's mom?
Your mom...
Poor thing...
Mummy!
But why?
Why didn't I make it in time to give you a hug?
Death came unexpectedly.
I wired you immediately but the town is so distant.
They took her away...
This morning.
And this baby?
It's your mother's.
My mother's?
She wanted to hide the truth from you.
She didn't live alone.
- What?
No.
You shouldn't think harshly of her.
She thought she could rebuild her life.
She was... loved.
But after a while, there were bad times.
Wrong investments.
Money was running out.
Difficulties...
He left... to try to make something of himself.
Far away.
She died.
Poor little baby.
Where will you go now?
Alone...
Without money.
I'll sell all this furniture.
But, they don't belong to you.
- What?
Your mom, to pay for your studies had to sell them all.
For me?
Yes.
It doesn't matter.
I'll work.
A young man loves me.
He really loves you?
- Of course.
I'm sorry... but I saw your mother suffer so much that I'd like to spare you a disappointment, if possible.
But he's a nice, young man.
He's an artist.
Think...
A child without a name.
Without a father...
This might hinder his projects.
Hamper his career.
You told me he's an artist.
But an artist needs freedom.
You know...
There's...
One moment.
I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?
Enrico, where are going?
- I'm not telling you.
At last!
Lucia!
What happened, Lucia?
So he left.
With whom?
With Lucia, isn't it?
I've no idea.
He's with Lucia.
There has been a change in my life.
I didn't want to write you.
- Lucia, you can count on my support.
Thank you.
You're so kind.
This is why I wanted to see you.
I've got to talk to you.
Explain it to you.
- Of course!
Come.
It's not a secret anymore.
Everyone knows that Lucia's here.
Just a moment.
We'll be right back.
Listen.
I've signed a wonderful contract that we were just celebrating today.
Anna signed it too.
You see, it'll mean travelling for a while.
You'll see then, darling, that your life will be even more beautiful.
We'll set off.
See many cities.
We two.
Free, independent.
Without bonds.
Without obstacles.
Then, later on, when our future is ensured a little one, ours, all ours will make us even happier.
- Yes, Enrico.
I'd better go.
- Wait.
Where are you going?
Come here.
All my friends are there.
- No.
Sorry, you know...
Sorry.
Well, I'll go with you.
- No, thanks.
Do stay with your friends.
The trip wore me down.
Besides...
I need to be alone for a bit.
I'll go with you!
- No.
I want you to stay with them.
See you tomorrow.
But how?
- Tomorrow.
- Lucia!
What happened?
- And Lucia?
- Where did you send her?
You didn't let her in?
- No!
What's with him?
- Lovers' tiff, my dear.
We want music!
Music!
Spring cleaning today, eh?
- Of course.
Did you let the room?
- Yes.
Who to?
Who to?
- To a very sweet girl.
There, sweetheart, I'm coming.
I'll tell you later.
Yes, poor thing.
Mummy's pretty boy.
I'll be right back.
Poor thing.
You're right, poor thing.
Pretty, pretty, yes.
Mummy will bring you many nice little things.
There, there.
Why are you crying?
No.
I'm not crying.
And...
Ninnì has been good?
So cute and so good, your baby.
Ninnì is not mine.
What?
He's not your child?
Then, whose is he?
The bags are on the terrace.
By the way.
If you need anything knock on the wall.
Like this.
Goodbye.
Madame, madame!
- What is it?
I'd like... that nobody finds out that I'm living here.
I've no acquaintances and don't want to make any.
If someone asks about me, you'll tell them you don't know me.
All right.
- But...
You'll tell everyone, won't you?
Everyone?
Everyone, of course.
Everyone.
Thank you.
- Not at all.
Goodbye.
You'll always, always stay with your mummy.
You're really a little rascal.
This is something you just don't do to your mummy.
And now, because of you, I have to get changed.
Be quiet, Ninnì.
There, there, there.
How ugly he is, crying.
Now we'll make a nice little tuft.
Like that.
That little kid is getting cuter and cuter.
That's it.
And now we'll have a little walk.
Come on, easy.
Steady, steady...
How cute he is!
Come on, show me that you're a man.
Steady.
One...
Come on, two...
How nicely you walk.
What a lovely walk.
You're mummy's sweetheart.
Cutie, cutie...
But, you're right, poor boy.
She's coming, you know, your mummy.
You're right, you grump!
You're a little man now.
How beautiful you are...
No, don't come here, I told you!
Or you'll dirty my linen.
Who's that?
Is that you, Miss Lucia?
- Yes, it's me.
I also have a nice surprise for you.
One for you and one for Ninnì.
So come on down.
Did Ninnì annoy you?
He's been good?
- An angel.
Oh, what a mess!
What a mess you made, my boy.
For heaven's sake!
What am I to do with you?
Ninnì!
Look Ninnì...
Well...
What happened?
- Nothing.
- Ninnì, eh?
I told you he's been so good.
So good he deserves an prize.
- Here it is!
A gramophone?
- Yes.
And this is for Ninnì.
This way, while I'm at work, you'll play some music for him.
After all, you so like listening to music, don't you?
- And how!
And then, here, two tickets for the Opera, for you and your husband.
The Opera?
- Yes..
Thank you!
You're so kind, Miss.
Gigli, the tenor, gave me the tickets.
He came this morning to record five discs.
Yes, yes.
I know him.
Now I'm going to play some music for you.
Please do.
Lucky you.
What a nice job you've found.
The record store must give an impression of a theatre.
With all those artists who come to sing there.
And to think that I too had the voice of a nightingale.
Before I got married all the neighborhood would stop open-mouthed to hear me.
But, Arturo, as usual, wouldn't let me go on studying.
Marriage!
The ruin of art.
But even a husband is something.
Listen how nice it is.
Come here, Ninnì.
Come here.
Nice, nice...
You like it?
- A lot, a lot.
- This one is even nicer.
Listen.
Is it to your liking, Madame?
- Please, I'm a Miss.
Excuse me, Miss.
Adele.
Show Madame out.
- Please, I'm a Miss.
She's quite something, that one.
- The things that happen to us.
Miss Lucia.
Please, come down for a moment.
There's that client from Florence.
Right away, Madame.
Please, I'd like to know...
Considering you have patience and polite manners
I ask you to be at that gentleman's disposal.
Mind that he's a very difficult client.
- Very good, Madame.
Sir!
Would you like to buy some discs?
No, I want to buy some discs.
And...
What kinds of discs would you like?
"The Woman I Like"?
I've already bought that one.
Do you wish to consult the list of the latest recordings by maestro Brenetti?
Yes, negro songs, that's it.
- No!
Maestro Bre-net-ti.
- I got it!
I got it.
Hurry up, please.
- Please go to the booth.
May I speak to the Director, please?
- Right away.
- Oh, there he is.
Miss.
- Good day.
A hard life, dear maestro.
- I can quite believe it.
It was me who overcame his laziness.
If I... his little Anna... didn't remind him about his appointments, he would always be late.
That's true!
Miss Anna is so tiresome...
- What?
Pardon.
I meant to say so attentive, so kind, so careful...
Have you read the reports of our concert tour abroad?
- Of course!
All the newspapers have reported on your tremendous tour of Europe.
Newspapers, my friend, always exaggerate.
I only wrote the songs which Miss Anna brilliantly interpreted.
Oh, no, no!
The audience appreciates true art and intelligence and this is why we scored a fantastic hit in every town.
Come on!
- It's a pity my throat is so inflamed today.
Sorry?
- Don't you worry.
I know the lady.
Not because of that we'll postpone the recording of the disc.
- All right.
The orchestra's ready?
Yes.
In the recording studio, they're waiting just for you, maestro.
You know, what a joy when we hear your new song in all the nightclubs.
This way.
- Who's conducting?
- One of our best house maestros.
Thanks goodness.
So, we'll need fewer rehearsals.
In an hour, we must meet at the beach.
- Sure, sure.
You'll have time to flaunt your new costume.
Don't worry.
You'll get there in an hour.
From here to Ostia...
Oh, 15 minutes, no more.
We've got a spyder.
Latest model, isn't it?
- Yes.
Latest model.
Eight-cylinder, of course.
Good day.
Good day, Maestro.
How do you do?
- Good day, Maestro.
I hope you'll be satisfied with our performance.
- I hope so too.
Certainly!
- Engineer, are we ready?
Yes.
But I'd like a rehearsal.
For the tempo and the voice.
Please, Maestro.
- Can we start?
- No, no, no!
Not for the voice.
It's too hot in here.
It's better if I don't wear myself out.
Besides, today, my poor voice.
It's not possible, just not possible.
Not at all.
Stay calm, come on!
You have to be so patient.
- Well, women, women.
How well these negros sing!
Let's accurately time the performance.
Are we ready?
- Absolutely.
We can start.
Please, Maestro.
Do you wish to start?
Silence!
Are you satisfied?
- Perfect, dear Maestro.
Good.
Is it advisable, Maestro, a trial run with the voice?
- It's indispensable.
Then, get ready.
Miss?
- Ready, ready.
Eh, since it can't be helped.
So hot in here, Maestro.
- It's stifling.
What are you doing here?
I'm working.
What about singing?
Your studies?
You quit everything?
- Yes.
As you can well see.
Why?
Let me go.
- I want to know, Lucia!
What for?
- Because...
I could never forget you.
Indeed.
Anna is just my performer.
I mustn't be jealous.
What gives you the right to be jealous?
Who failed to keep their promises?
Weren't you the one who left me?
Yes, it's true.
It was me.
Yet...
Do you remember, Lucia... why you acted that way?
Don't try to find out.
You're happy now, quiet...
I wouldn't be able to give you anything of what you have today.
Your success, fortune...
Love.
- No!
You have to make yourself clear.
Speak up!
No.
- Speak up!
And to think...
I could believe in your love.
Don't speak, I beg you.
You were everything for me.
I still can't believe it.
You just can't break a love like ours.
You can't forget so many dreams, so many hopes...
So...
So something new has happened in your life?
Another...
love?
Yes.
- Is that true?
Another love?
- Another love... which fills up all my life.
You can't understand.
And this love, Enrico, would've been a big obstacle for us.
You're an artist...
- Words!
Just words!
You don't even have the courage to explain yourself.
You've always lied to me, that's the truth!
I... trusted you...
And you destroyed all the best that was in my heart.
Faith, enthusiasm...
- Enrico!
Go away!
Go away!
Well done!
I'm delighted to see that, instead of making music you're interested in drama?
- Stop it, please!
Oh, yes.
You have finally met again your great Lucia.
At this record store.
- Come on, enough!
The sound is excellent, Maestro.
We can record.
- Good.
Shall we start?
- When you think it's right.
Would you like to step up, Miss?
Here, near the microphone.
All right.
I will sing once again.
the song of Lucia.
Close the doors.
- Maestro.
- Ring the bell.
Thank you.
You can start.
Silence.
Who's this gentleman?
- He's...
Well, that gentleman said he wanted to see you in any case.
Miss, will you allow me a few minutes conversation?
But... in private.
Then, I'll go.
All right.
If you need me, then call.
Goodbye.
It's about him and your poor mother.
My mother?
- Yes.
I treated her badly...
really badly you know and I've come back to redress them.
So...
I'm Alberto Giordani, the father of this child.
You?
Miss, I understand your resentment but I too have suffered during these last two years.
I was poor.
I ran away.
And I've come back now, too late.
It's true!
Too late.
Mom died alone, abandoned!
Forgive me...
When I met your mother, I was penniless.
My wife was bed bound.
Since she is no more...
I can give a name...
- Ninnì is mine!
I gave up everything because of him.
I don't want to snatch him from your tenderness.
I know you've brought him up with such tenderness and devotion.
But, he must have a wealthy and happy future.
You...
You could live with him... in my house.
Neither I nor Ninnì need you.
My mother died of shame, of hardship!
And you'll never be able to blot out this memory.
You can't prevent this child from having a father.
It's his right.
And my duty.
- It's no use insisting!
I don't want to listen to you.
I wouldn't like to take drastic measures.
I don't want to assert my rights.
- Your rights?
Who will recognise them?
Think, Miss.
I'm his father.
I'll wait for you, at my house...
With my son.
No!
Ninnì is mine!
Mine alone!
You shall never have him!
Think it over.
Oh, God!
How many stairs.
Never mind.
If I hadn't married Arturo...
I too would have a lift.
A nice car...
Like that gentleman's car who came to see you.
What a car!
That gentleman, so kind...
He's Ninnì's father, isn't he?
- Yes.
I was sure.
I can smell out men.
And exactly because I guessed right, here's a reward.
A nice, special dinner.
So...
Are you going to live at his place, both of you?
I've never needed anything so far.
And I want to go on this way!
What?
You're leaving?
Yes.
Ninnì is mine.
And he'll always stay with me.
Are you maybe going to his place?
Please, take care of the child.
I'll be right back.
La Norma.
Ah, what music!
Who let this one sing?
And singers like these earn millions!
Well, it's badly recorded.
Who's that?
- May I?
- A moment.
What do you want?
Could you tell if Miss...?
- No.
Miss Lucia doesn't live here.
Then, you know her.
I'm sure she lives here.
I got the address from the record store.
But, she isn't here, I tell you.
No use insisting.
How come she doesn't want to welcome one of her oldest fellow students?
But, who are you, sorry?
- I'm a composer.
Ah, a composer!
You should've said so at once.
Please, take a seat.
- Thank you.
- Well, I love music so much.
Would you excuse me a minute?
- By all means.
I've been just playing some music as it's my passion.
I also know all the operas, all the authors.
And I don't want to brag.
I've got the voice...
of a nightingale.
But, Arturo, Arturo he's my husband, didn't want... wouldn't let me sing at the Opera.
But, whose baby is this?
- Cute, isn't he?
Well then...
Considering that you are a composer...
Miss Lucia is at the father's place.
But, please, I didn't say anything!
- Whose father?
Well, I meant the baby's father.
Not hers surely.
Miss Lucia never told me anything about this gentleman.
But, he turned up today.
A millionaire.
A marvellous car.
Well, he lives in the most elegant quarter of the city.
At last, the poverty will end for her and that little one, so cute.
She's been really very courageous.
A whole year of pain and suffering to keep him going.
She actually wanted me to believe it wasn't her son.
But, I'm a smart woman and I'm quick on the uptake.
By the way!
Since you are a composer...
I want you to hear a serenade which a young man, kind as you... wrote for me.
How rude of him!
No use mixing with such artists.
Alright.
I'll check if the master can see you.
Please, take a seat, Miss.
I'll announce you right away.
Please, take a seat.
Mom.
Miss!
Miss!
You don't wish to wait?
Where's the lady?
- She ran off all of a sudden.
Ran off?
All right.
No, stop it, stop it!
- No, more!
No, enough now.
- One more, Anna.
I won't let you go.
I'll always chase you.
I've got you.
Here, here!
I've got you!
- No.
Let me go!
A kiss first.
- Let me go!
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I thought you weren't coming.
But, if you are here, it means you've forgiven... my jealousy of earlier.
Let's make peace?
Who's that gentleman there?
I can well see you're being aloof with me.
Leave me alone, I beg you!
You saw Lucia again.
I love you so much!
I knew very well you'd end up making up your mind.
He insisted so much.
His house must be really nice.
I can imagine.
Paintings, carpets everywhere.
Tell me...
Did he show you your room?
Yes.
At least you can rest, sleep peacefully all morning long.
To sleep...
To sleep forever...
You've been really lucky.
But, you deserve it.
You'd be suffering so much, poor thing.
But I'll suffer no more.
- I'll bet!
Will that nice car come for you?
- No.
On the contrary, I'd like to ask you to take Ninnì to him.
Sure!
That way I'll see that nice house.
If I hadn't met Arturo, I too would now...
Ouch!
But, what about you?
You're not going?
- No.
Not now.
Later.
So, I'll go and get dressed right now.
I'll put on my lovely wedding dress.
Well, you can rest assured that I won't show you up.
It's new.
I only wear it on special occasions.
And you, handsome devil?
And you, Ninnì?
Will you remember me when you become a great gentleman?
But, I'll still come to see you.
Right, darling?
Sweetheart!
I won't take long.
I'll change in a moment...
Do you want me to tell you what I think?
You saw Lucia again.
Not alone but with the one who succeeded you.
Surely, a handsome lad.
Much more cheerful than you.
- Stop it!
Try to understand once and for all!
- What's there to be understood?
Everything's plain as day.
Lucia...
- Stop it!
I don't want to hear that name ever again.
Don't be afraid, dear.
But you can't stop me from thinking... that the other one will be much cleverer and... he won't let her go.
Do I look good?
I don't always have the chance to wear this dress.
Arturo is so jealous.
Actually, it's his fault if I'm so late.
Do you want me to help you put your things back?
Everything here that is mine, I give to you.
You've been so kind to me.
- For me?
But...
What about you?
- Me?
I need nothing at all.
I don't know how to thank you.
Let me at least help you.
- Thanks.
Besides, you'll need a little advice.
As far as dealing with men is concerned...
I'm always at your disposal.
I know very well those boors.
We'll keep on seeing each other often, won't we?
Yes.
You can come to see me.
There... where I'll be.
- Of course I'll come to see you!
And I can assure you...
You won't be ashamed of me.
I know how to behave myself in the house of a gentleman.
Besides, my birth is enough.
I only ask you to keep this photo... of my poor mom.
Would you?
- Certainly!
From time to time, you'll look at it and think about me just a little.
And afterwards...
When Ninnì grows up...
You'll talk to him about me.
What about you?
You've been so loving towards me...
Towards my Ninnì.
- If it's for that, all right.
Sir?
To whom do I have the honour of speaking?
Miss Lucia...
She must've told you about me.
And she must've also told you about our relationship.
- Sir!
It's no use feigning.
I know very well of your relationship.
Who are you?
And what do you want from me here?
Sure.
You feel embarrassed that I found you here, among so much wealth.
While, over there, where you had fun with a poor girl, forced to bring up a child who is yours!
What are you talking about, Sir?
I don't have to answer to you for anything.
I'll ask you to leave immediately.
Yes...
I'm going.
I have nothing to do here anymore.
Since I stand face to face with a coward!
I beg your pardon?
Let's not lose our temper, young man.
There's a misunderstanding... we'd better clear up.
Please, take a seat.
I don't think we've forgot anything, have we?
Well!
What's this little doll?
Whose doll is this?
It's Ninnì's.
- I've never seen it before.
The wardrobe is empty too.
Why are you crying?
- No.
I'm not crying at all.
You don't regret leaving this house, do you?
I know you spent a lot to have it done up.
But, since you gain in return.
So...
Eh, if I hadn't married Arturo.
It wouldn't be a flat!
Please, hurry up.
The taximeter is running.
Now I'll take you straight to your daddy's.
Say "daddy".
- Da-ddy.
- How cute!
You will remember me, won't you?
How many times I had to change my clothes because of you!
My Ninnì!
My Ninnì!
No, what are you doing?
My Ninnì...
I'll never see him again, Enrico...
Don't cry, Lucia.
Your Ninnì...
You'll see him again.
You'll see him again.
With me.

Watch out.
[ Buzzer ]
There is the tyrant, buzzing me out.
─ Her buzz is worse than her bite.
Wait a minute, Kate.
I've got a new assignment for you.
I think you'll go for it.
If it isn't another on baby-raising.
Next, we come to the little treasure's precious tummy.
Just the same, that's your solidest book, Kate.
Still selling 900 a week.
My dear man, you think that I want to go on writing like Dr Holz?
Whom you ought to write like?
Jack London, Jim Kelly.
Ernest Hemingway.
Myself.
─ Well ..
How do you like this for an idea?
I've made a few notes.
Cigar?
Not one of yours.
Thanks.
How do you like this?
Most women holding important business positions today ..
Have come up by the stenographer, private-secretary route.
There is a long, long trail a-winding.
A man is propelled toward the woman he marries by emotion.
That fool.
But his selection of his secretary is more careful and intelligent.
Ha .. yes it is, I don't think.
First, he looks at her legs.
Then he smells her perfume.
Then he stares at her face.
And if he still admires her legs .. he's sold.
Behave.
I am serious.
─ You mean ..?
The modern businessman's secretary is closer than his wife.
Yet not his wife.
Now look here, Kate.
Come here.
See that office building over there?
It's an architectural monstrosity.
In every office is a stenographer.
You called them potential mothers last time.
And in every office there is an employer with a wife at home.
A fool at home.
You know the number of jealous wives and secretaries who hate each other's souls?
Figure it out.
I tell you, Kate.
If you write a book about the office wife.
I'll make you rich.
I suppose I can't resist that argument.
─ You will do it then?
Okay.
─ Good.
I'm sorry, Mr Fellowes.
But this time is taken.
─ I'm just going, Andrews.
There is your office wife.
You haven't one at home.
You see, your idea is mere bunk.
A pretty good selling bunk, isn't it.
I'll tell you something else, Kate.
I'm getting married.
Are you really?
Congratulations.
─ Hmm.
I'll give you a rattle.
Right.
Don't give it to your baby.
Keep it for yourself.
Miss Andrews.
Make out a contract for Miss Halsey.
A nine part serial titled "The Office Wife".
The office wife?
A selling title, eh?
Great.
Andrew Washburn and Mr Lewin are outside.
Lewin?
Who you call the poet.
You like his stuff.
I told them both to wait.
It's now 12:10 and you have many luncheon appointments.
So I've sent for your tray.
At 2.00.
A general employee's conference.
You gave me some notes.
Perhaps you'd better look them over.
Signing these checks will fill in your time until your tray comes.
At 4:00
It's a lawyer from Holliston Evans.
The plagiarism case.
─ Oh, that's a waste of time.
I'm acquainted with the facts.
I'll handle it for you.
Yes.
You attend to it, please.
That gives you an extra hour for your magazine set up.
I need it.
And that takes us late.
Into the evening.
I'm sorry, Miss Andrews.
Would you like this?
I was only thinking of you.
You are so tired,
Me?
I am iron.
Please don't bolt your food.
I'm not.
I'm not.
You'd better show that poet in.
─ After lunch.
Yes, but ..
Besides, when you've finished, the tailor will be here with some cloth samples.
Tailor?
─ Uhuh.
Some of your coats are getting ..
Quite shiny at the back.
Are they really?
─ Yes.
This one is ..
Is quite shiny.
Woman .. you're a jewel.
Been waiting long, Ted?
─ Only about an hour, honey.
Every time I call for you, you're the last one out.
I'm awfully sorry, Ted.
Why do they always pick on you to work so late?
Supposing I were like poor old Andrews?
She often has to work with the boss until midnight.
Yeah?
And where does that get her?
It is with considerable disappointment that I am returning your manuscript.
Yours, sincerely.
Well, that's all of that, thank heavens.
It's been a long day.
I'll send you home in my car.
I can just as well call a cab.
No, no.
Take my car.
I'll be here for an hour.
I wish you would call it a day, Mr Fellows.
You look so tired.
You're always saying that.
Goodnight.
Anything ..
Only ..
I ..
I wish you'd take a vacation.
You're bound to have another breakdown.
Really, you are.
Well, I'm about to obey you, as usual.
I'm so glad.
Then you haven't heard the good news?
I'm going to Europe on my honeymoon.
Oh.
I'm to be married on the 16th.
Miss Andrews.
I'm ..
I'm quite alright.
─ Well, come, come.
Sit down for a moment.
There.
Now .. just sit still for a moment.
Miss Murdock.
Please turn the rest of your work over to Miss Dunfield.
Why, is anything wrong?
─ I would like to talk to you.
Come to my office, please.
It takes more than good looks to get by here.
You've got to have efficiency.
Come in, Miss Murdock.
Sit down.
Well .. you've been promoted.
Promoted ..
I have?
Yes.
Miss Andrews resigned last night.
You are to be Mr Fellowes new secretary.
Yes?
You see he's leaving next week, for Europe on his honeymoon.
And while he's gone, you'll have entire charge of his office.
So you'll know what it's all about when he gets back.
Congratulations.
─ Whee!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Your new salary begins next week.
But I'm going to give you a week off so that you'll get used to the idea.
Oh thank you, Mr McGowan.
And Anne.
You got this.
On your work.
What I mean is, charm counts ..
But you got this on your brain.
Don't forget that, Anne.
Indeed I won't, Mr McGowan.
Now run along.
Fix your face.
Thank you.
What's the idea?
Sis, aren't you going to work?
Sis!
No.
─ Fired?
I thought you would be.
You know you can't mess people around the way you do.
Who made a play for you?
─ Nobody.
Oh, don't tell me that, Anne.
Honestly, you ought to get wise to yourself.
Take me for instance.
I gained six pounds.
Maybe more.
But still I'm the pet model of the lead dress shop.
And you know why?
Because I let that fraud of a manager kiss me on the ear every now and then.
I got my raise on brains.
Not good looks.
Mr McGowan said so.
Yeah, how much is your raise?
A dollar a week?
If you come home nights before I'm asleep, you might learn something.
I'm the President's private secretary and I've got a week's vacation.
I'm to handle the office until he gets back from Europe.
My salary is forty-five a week and how do you like that?
You wouldn't rib your big sister, would you?
Just come back lunchtime and see me get up for breakfast if you think I kid you.
You have the darnedest luck.
─ You know, darling.
With my luck and your ears, the Murdock sisters should get ahead.
Oh gee honey, I'm glad.
Oh I'm not cross.
Here, kiss me.
I'm terribly glad, Sis.
Gee, I'm glad.
How'd you get it?
─ Old Andrews resigned.
They say the boss found out he was in love with him.
They think he told her he was getting married, see.
And he sent her home the other night in the car and the chauffeur said ..
She balled all the way.
What kind of a sheik is this boss of yours?
He won't be hard to have in the office.
─ Strictly business, huh?
Strictly.
─ Says you.
"Little Miss Efficiency" from now on.
Is that it?
To perfection.
And in ten years they'll be wheeling you down to the automobile.
Gee, I wish I had your chance.
You'd muff it, just like Andrews did.
You think so?
All she had was efficiency.
All you've got is a doubtful thirty-four.
And I suppose when you have both, like you, it's just too bad for the boss, huh?
Let me tell you something.
I'm not going to give the best years of my life to getting stung like Andrews.
I'm glad you realize that.
Don't you suppose I know what this business game is for a girl?
It's about as fair as the marriage game.
Catch as catch can, and anything goes.
I'm glad you realize that.
Why do you suppose I've been coming home nights?
Getting my beauty sleep.
[ Buzzer ]
Oh, you talk to him.
Hello?
Ted?
Anne is not going to the office this morning.
Nah, she's got a vacation.
Yeah.
He wants to show you his new Ford.
Oh tell him to call by and by.
Call her later, will you Ted.
Hey, wait a minute.
Will you take me to the shops?
Okay, I won't be a minute.
How about the boyfriend?
How does he fit in now?
No different.
You wouldn't marry that dud reporter, would you?
I've never meant to scramble up my life with Ted or anybody like him.
I've told him that until I'm tired.
He thinks you would.
─ Oh, go down and disillusion him.
I'll be seeing you.
Hello?
Yes.
Mr Fellowes returned from Europe yesterday.
He's expected in the office at ten o'clock this morning.
Oh, not at all.
Thank you.
Morning, Anne.
Good morning.
Well .. he's here.
Really?
─ Yep, he's outside.
Dealing with the gang.
You like it?
Is that his wife?
All of us clubbed together to buy the frame.
Oh I think it's gorgeous, Mr McGowan.
Isn't she beautiful.
Yes.
I guess she's got looks enough not to worry about any .. competition.
I shouldn't wonder.
I got a glimpse of her once, out on the beach.
Did you really?
─ Yes.
Her knees are .. perfect.
Hmm?
Don't forget, Anne.
He knees are magnificent.
Yes, we'll take up that matter first.
Get the reports.
─ Miss Murdock has them all ready.
How do you do.
─ How do you do.
Miss Murdock.
He wants you.
Oh.
For dictation purposes.
[ Buzzer ]
Did you go through this appointment list?
I put down what seemed most important for the day.
Cancel everything.
I'm going to be busy all day.
Take a cable.
AG Barnes and Company.
Soho, London.
The matter of British copyright still in dispute.
If it is at all necessary to hold up present edition.
Would you sit on this side, please?
The light from that window is blinding.
Now let's see.
Necessary to hold up present edition.
Until attorney's in Washington.
[ Telephone ]
Who's that?
Hello?
Hello?
What?
Who do you want to talk to?
Murdock?
No, no.
You've got the wrong ..
Oh, is your name Murdock?
─ Yes, Mr Fellowes.
It's for you.
─ Thank you.
Hello?
Oh Ted.
I'm very busy.
Would you mind calling up some other time?
I'm terribly sorry ..
─ What have you?
Oh ..
AG Barnes and Company.
Soho, London.
Matter of British copyright still in dispute.
Therefore necessary to hold up present edition until attorneys in Washington ..
Have looked up records and assured us we can proceed with publication.
At minimum risk.
Stop.
In view of the situation, we are unwilling.
Oh, and by the way, Miss Murphy.
Murdock.
Pardon me.
Miss Murdock.
Kindly ask your friends not to call on my private office line.
Oh, it won't happen again, Mr Fellowes.
You see, the party didn't know you were back.
I'm dreadfully sorry ..
─ That's alright.
That's alright.
We are unwilling to involve ourselves in a situation that may ..
Oh.
What's the matter, too fast?
─ Oh, not at all.
That's good.
It may later prejudice our good standing in the eyes of the Copyright Office.
And in view of the fact that we acted in good faith in forwarding the plates.
We respectfully beg to suggest.
That negotiations ..
Take out that stuff.
Take out what stuff?
─ Caviar.
But ..
You were not feeling very happy last Thursday afternoon.
And the doctor said that if ..
Miss Murdock, if you can't leave my digestion alone, I'll get a new ..
Doctor.
If you'll only be careful, you won't need one.
What am I to have?
I'll put these back.
What's this white stuff?
That's cottage cheese.
I don't like cottage cheese.
─ But it's very good for you.
Well, I suppose I'll have to eat it.
Here's your consommé.
─ Ah, splendid.
Now if you will just send McGowan up, we can talk over that ..
Mr Fellowes.
Would you mind waiting half an hour until you've finished your lunch?
But ..
You'll be able to work much faster afterwards.
It always makes me nervous to lunch alone.
I'll have your tea in just a moment.
Thank you.
Where do you have your lunch?
I have it in a bag, in my office.
Don't you go out?
There's hardly time.
Here, here, here.
You sit right down here, young lady.
You'll only talk business.
Not a word.
Sit down.
─ Alright then.
Have some cottage cheese.
I don't know why you didn't think of this before.
Well.
Shall we write just one more?
─ If you're not too tired.
No, indeed.
─ Alright.
All the .. paper mills.
Old town Maine.
Your wire received.
And am replying by letter in detail.
Oh Mama!
Hello.
Hello, cheeky boy.
I think you'll find your Mama down there by the pool.
Hey, come here.
Let me see you.
Give me a kiss.
Isn't he sweet?
─ Yes, indeed.
Do you like children?
─ Who doesn't.
Oh, I don't know.
I thought they were becoming a little less popular.
I suppose I'm old-fashioned.
Did that burn-you?
No, not at all.
Oh, here's a match.
─ Good.
Thank you.
Pleasant here, isn't it.
─ Isn't it.
Ouch!
So it did burn you.
How long were you going to suffer in silence?
All good secretaries do that.
Oh.
Are you a good secretary?
─ You never scolded me.
You ever have a boss that did?
Hmm.
Lots of them.
─ Ah well.
I'm just a failure.
A successful failure.
Are you going to give me a good recommendation when I'm fired?
When you're fired?
Just sign that Fellowes and Company.
Dearest!
─ Oh, Larry.
Excuse me a moment.
─ Certainly.
Yes?
Come on.
We're going in swimming.
Just a minute.
─ Right-oh.
Well.
That's all.
─ Alright.
Oh!
Oh, my foot is asleep.
I must have been sitting on it.
I thought I missed it.
Sorry you didn't look for it before.
─ Hmm.
Thank you.
I'll be in town, tomorrow.
And thank you for running down.
─ Oh, it's been great fun.
If you wait a moment I'll send you home in my car.
Oh don't bother.
I have a car.
You have a car?
─ Yes, thank you.
Goodbye.
─ Goodbye.
It's nice and warm.
─ Yeah?
─ Uhuh.
What's the matter, darling?
By George, I forgot to give a message to McGowan.
I'll be right back.
Oh, rats.
Come on, let's swim.
─ Okay.
Jump!
Oh, Miss ..?
Tired?
─ Not a bit.
You ought to go outside for a while.
But we'll never finish.
─ Oh well, we'll take another day.
But you know it's important to have this in the office the day after tomorrow.
Yes.
Well, your health is a little bit important.
So is yours.
When I've gone, I hope you'll rest.
You're a jewel.
We ought to be out there playing.
You know, Spring is only a few miles south of us.
And coming closer every minute.
A restless feeling, waiting for it.
Isn't it.
Let's have this dance.
Oh, I'd like some air.
─ That's great.
Shall we wait?
That all depends upon your patience, darling.
And that all depends upon the hooch.
Order another bottle on Larry.
That's a great idea.
─ A splendid idea.
Waiter.
How about that air, honey?
─ I'd love it.
Okay.
Uhuh.
Naughty, naughty.
[ Typing noises ]
Hear that?
That means he's safe.
Isn't he stupid.
If you were up there in his place, would we hear sounds like that?
Less metallic, I think.
I should think so.
Oh.
I made a mistake.
What?
Let me see.
Isn't it awful?
Well, you poor kid.
You're all worn out.
I don't care.
Anne.
You are glorious.
Am I?
Your key?
Yes.
I have another one.
Well, I gave them time enough.
Come in.
Hello.
Hello.
Larry, what are you trying to do?
Kill Miss Murdock?
Ah, she's been wonderful.
─ I'm sure she has.
Tell me, are you going to carry on?
I can burn up another hour so.
No, I think we'll stop right now.
Miss Murdock looks tired.
Why, my dear you are shaking.
Oh, I'll be alright.
I don't suppose Larry ever thought to offer you a highball?
She doesn't use them.
Well of course, if you know that.
But I'm sure you don't.
I bet he didn't offer you one.
I'll have some tea, later.
Well, I suppose tea is alright if it works.
Goodnight, my dear.
─ Goodnight.
Oh tell me Larry, are you coming to bed?
Coming right now.
─ Right-oh.
Goodnight, Miss Murdock.
─ Goodnight.
Larry, have you any strength left?
Plenty.
Will you help me off with this suit of armor?
Oh .. up!
Thanks.
Is that you, Anne?
Have a good time?
How is the old romance?
What's wrong?
I'm resigning.
What do you mean, you're resigning?
What happened, honey?
Oh, I love him.
Oh .. don't he like you?
Hmm.
─ Say so?
Practically.
─ Then what's the trouble?
It's his wife.
─ Gee, is she wise?
No.
It's just that he has one.
Now don't tell me that makes any difference to him.
I don't think so.
I don't get it.
You like him, he likes you.
Oh I love him.
─ And his wife don't know?
If those aren't the signs of the coming May season ..
Oh, I knew you wouldn't understand.
─ Well, suppose you make me.
Oh what happened, honey?
─ Oh, nothing much.
But after I found out I cared, I saw them go into their room together.
What of it?
Their door closed in my face.
Well, what of that?
What of it?
Everything.
Oh, I'll die if I think of it.
─ You'll get over that.
I've got to forget him.
If you'd only stick it out for what's in it, you won't be so crazy about him.
You've never loved anybody.
What do you know?
Nothing.
And I hope I stay dumb.
One sap in the Murdock family is plenty.
[ Telephone ]
Hello ..
Ted?
Yes, she's back but she doesn't want to talk to you.
Yes I will.
─ Wait a minute.
Hello, Ted.
And where do you think little Ted is sitting right now?
At the Sunday editor's desk.
Yep.
Promoted yesterday.
Say, I'm just finding out where I stand around this dump.
Perhaps you'd better take me out tomorrow night and tell me all about it.
Oh, so my stock is on the up again, is it?
Well, that's life.
Okay kid, but listen.
Be on time for a change.
They need me on this desk once in a while.
Very well, Ted.
Expect to console yourself with that washout?
If I'd stuck to my own kind in the first place I wouldn't have got hurt.
Ted wants a parking space for a couple of babies and a free laundry.
If you want to learn what the word "lonesome" is, take him on.
Maybe you think I couldn't hold him?
Not from the looks of the heel marks in that Ford of his.
You can break your heart over that tramp just as quick as the boss, kid.
Only in a different way.
Why did you write this?
I was afraid I couldn't say it.
What's it all about?
I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Mr Fellowes.
But I thought thirty days would be sufficient.
Why should you leave at all?
I've had another offer.
A better position?
Yes.
Somewhat.
That's not so, Anne.
If it were, you wouldn't go about it this way.
But what other way could I ..?
You'd have told me if you'd had a better offer.
Given me a chance to meet it.
You know how I depend on you.
Why beat about the bush.
You know I need you, and I can't get along without you.
Perhaps that's one reason why I should go?
And ..?
We are getting to depend upon each other too much.
I .. hoped Anne, that you had seen.
I thought perhaps the other night when I ..
Please, Mr Fellowes.
That shouldn't have happened.
Is that why you're going?
That decided me.
It won't happen again, Anne.
I promise you that.
Oh .. why can't we go on just as we were before?
This isn't fair to either of us.
To let a thing like this ..
I've been unfair with you right along, Mr Fellowes.
What do you mean?
I didn't tell you the truth about that boy you saw in the Ford.
I wanted to be sure of my position here.
And wait until he'd been promoted.
Well now that's happened.
He's Sunday editor now.
You.
You're going to ..?
We're going to be married.
Very shortly.
Be married?
I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before.
I'm sorry too, Anne.
Anne.
Are you quite sure that you love him?
Very.
I wish you all the happiness in the world.
Thank you.
I'll stay with you until you find a new secretary.
Thank you, Anne.
Shall I send in Miss Halsey?
Tell her to come back next week.
I'm in no mood to see her.
Anything wrong, Larry?
Oh.
Sorry if I woke you up.
Oh, it doesn't matter.
What's disturbing you, dear?
Let's talk.
─ Shall we?
Oh, it's cold in here.
Jump into bed.
What's on your mind, Larry?
First of all ..
I want to ask your forgiveness.
For what?
I've neglected you shamefully.
Oh, I don't think you were aware of it, which took the curse off of it somewhat.
Well, perhaps I wasn't.
I've been very stupid.
I suppose you're no different from other successful men.
Will you forgive me?
Why, of course.
But it's hardly fair.
Letting you beg my forgiveness.
─ Why?
I suppose I'm no different from other neglected wives.
That's not a very nice thing to hear Linda, but.
I suppose I deserve it.
Perhaps if I hadn't made a fuss over your neglect from the beginning.
You would have realized what was happening.
But my pride wouldn't let me.
Not nice to hear.
But I do deserve it.
I'm sorry.
Linda.
How would you like to go away for a while?
Say .. to Europe?
I've been thinking of it for some time.
─ Have you, dear?
I could be ready by the end of the week.
I meant alone, Larry.
Alone?
That's how it is now.
You?
You mean you want a divorce?
I don't think you'd mind it much.
Is that necessary, Linda?
I've gotten over loving you, Larry.
Well, perhaps ..
─ I do love someone else.
Oh, I see.
Jameson, I suppose?
Yes.
Well.
I guess that settles it.
Larry, don't you realize you are in love with your Miss Murdock?
Why, she's going to marry that young newspaperman very shortly.
Oh I'm terribly sorry.
─ Oh, it's alright.
I wish I could help you.
I'm sorry there is nothing I can do.
─ Oh, never worry.
Why, you're shivering, Larry.
You're cold. ─ No.
It's just my nerves.
Here, get into bed, please.
─ No, no.
I ..
Please do as I ask.
Shall I get the electric pad?
─ No.
No.
No, you just run along or you'll be shivering yourself.
Goodnight, dear.
Will you kiss me?
Of course.
In a moment, I'll cry.
Just run along.
Shall I switch off the light.
─ If you will.
Alright?
─ Fine.
Goodnight, Larry.
Goodnight, dear.
A full moon, alright.
Isn't it.
Couldn't be improved on.
No ..
I guess it couldn't.
Say, I got an idea, honey.
Let's come down here on our honeymoon.
Very well.
The first night we get down here the old moon will be ..
Pretty well down to the quarter.
And maybe you don't think I'll watch it from now on.
It can't shrink too fast for me, baby.
Hey, you're not going so strong tonight.
I had a hard day.
Watch the old moon, baby.
The day she shrinks to the quarter.
You walk out of that office for good.
I guess you won't cry about that.
No.
─ How about it?
No.
I won't cry.
You certainly sound like you would.
I'm terribly tired, really.
Sure, I know .. that guy works you like a dog.
Here.
Take a little sip of that.
─ No thanks.
No?
You mind if I take another little one?
─ Not at all.
Here, take a sip.
Then you won't get it on my breath.
Oh, I don't mind.
Come on now.
Go on, I know how it is.
A dame don't like the smell of hooch on a guy's breath.
Well, that's alright.
─ Come on.
No, I ..
Yeah, that's better.
We want preparation honey, believe me.
And I'm not laying off lips like those on a night like this.
Please, Ted.
There's a limit to that.
And I'll say you're low.
Better come up on the boardwalk and eat some food.
Why don't you go?
I'll wait.
I'd rather have the air.
─ Fresh air?
Say, maybe you don't think I like fresh air.
I'm the original fresh-air fiend.
Ever now that?
Sure I am.
Every night I sleep with every window in the place wide open.
Winter and summer.
Ever know that?
Sure I do.
And it's a great system.
I learned that from a leading physician.
He told me that when I was having colds right along.
Ever since that, I've been sleeping with my windows wide open.
I've never had a cold since.
Believe me baby, that's one thing you're going to get after we're married.
Plenty of fresh air.
And that's one of the few things I'm going to insist on.
Open windows at night.
I learned that from a doctor that knows his business.
Say.
He's one of the biggest specialists in Philly.
Ever hear of Doc Hemstead?
No?
Well, he knows his stuff like nobody's business.
And he gave me another tip, too.
Lay off the woollen underwear.
Ever know that?
Gets you hot at the wrong time.
Look.
Look what I wear the year around.
Look at that material.
That's all I wear all the year round.
Here, Anne.
Would you believe that?
Take a feel of it.
Hey.
What's wrong?
I'm awfully tired.
Gee, aren't you happy?
Of course, dear.
But don't mind me.
Come along, we'll go and get a hotdog.
─ Alright.
Wait a minute.
Give us a kiss.
Now you'll feel better.
The next time we come down here, it will be on our wedding night.
When that old moon shrinks to the quarter.
That's that baby.
Step on it you old son of a gun.
Step on it.
Well, what's the matter?
─ Oh, I lost a dime.
Shucks, what's a dime?
That new secretary, Anne.
I don't know.
I don't know.
She seemed quite intelligent when I showed her things.
This being the last afternoon, I thought she'd better try it alone.
Well, it isn't altogether her fault.
It's the boss.
You know it's difficult to make a change.
I'm terribly sorry.
Yes.
As sorry as you could be under the circumstances.
See you before you go?
─ I'll drop in, Mr McGowan.
Goodnight.
─ Goodnight.
Hello, Anne.
─ Hello.
The last pay check, eh?
The last one.
I guess you won't complain.
I may not cash this one.
Oh, saving it as a souvenir of your business life, eh?
Yes.
A pretty expensive souvenir.
You'll understand if this one doesn't come through.
Well .. goodbye, Anne.
And lots of happiness to the both of you.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
─ Bye.
Well, Anne.
Have you come to say goodbye?
I ..
I thought if the work isn't finished and you wanted me to stay a while tonight ..
I couldn't ask that of you.
─ Oh, I wouldn't mind.
One more night can't hurt.
You must have a thousand things to do now that you're ..
But I'd really like to stay.
If I can help.
I can't tell you delighted I feel.
Shall we start now?
Yes.
Get your pad and come back.
That's the last letter, I think.
By the time you've looked over these, I'll have this one typed.
Thank you.
[ Telephone ]
Hello?
Oh, it's you.
No, Anne isn't here.
She's working with the boss.
What's she working with the boss for?
Her time is up at five o'clock.
Maybe she likes it.
What do you know about that?
Hey, don't try and get my goat over that old walrus.
Not in your class is he, handsome.
Not so you'd notice it.
I know how to hold my women.
Ha!
And how.
Ha!
And the boss isn't so hot at it from what I hear.
From what you hear?
─ Yeah.
Take this fast one, right off the desk.
The boss's wife is divorcing him.
What?
Yeah.
That's how he holds them.
And say.
Here's a laugh for Anne.
The dope is she might have been named if it hadn't been known she was marrying me.
How about that?
Hello, hello?
Katherine?
Hello?
[ Telephone ]
Hello?
Oh, hello Katherine.
Well, I can't talk to you now.
I'll see you at home.
You needn't have done that.
─ Oh, it doesn't matter.
Well, we're running true to form.
Aren't we?
It's past eleven.
Thank you, Anne.
You sure there isn't oñe more letter?
That's the last letter.
You look tired.
So do you, Mr Fellowes.
I hope you're going to be very happy, Anne.
Thanks.
I shall.
Well.
Better get your hat on.
I'll send you home in the car.
Anything ..?
─ May I say something?
Well?
You should take a holiday.
You need a rest or I'm afraid you'll have a breakdown.
I expect to take a trip to the orient.
Won't that be nice.
I know how eager Mrs Fellowes is to go.
I'm going alone.
Oh.
Mrs Fellowes is going to Paris.
To divorce me.
Oh!
Oh ..
Anne.
Anne.
I'm alright.
Well my poor girl.
Here.
Thank you.
Come and sit down for a moment.
There.
Thank you, Mr Fellowes.
Are you quite sure you're feeling alright now?
I'm much better, thank you.
─ I'll take you home in the car.
[ Telephone ]
Perhaps you'd better answer that.
Hello?
Why ..?
Would you mind waiting?
Your sister just fainted, but she's better now.
That's why I rang up, Mr Fellowes.
See, I thought something like that might happen.
You know it's an awful strain on girl, breaking off her engagement.
Even if she wants to.
She broke it off?
It takes a lot of energy to do that to a persistent man like Ted.
I hadn't heard she'd broke it off.
Well of course she wouldn't discuss such personal matter with you, Mr Fellowes.
Why did she break it off?
─ What's my sister saying?
Why did she break if off?
Well, Anne didn't love him, Mr Fellowes.
Then why in the world ..
─ Well you see, Mr Fellowes ..
Anne fell in love with a gentleman.
It wouldn't be right to mention the party's name.
He has a wife.
So she thought it best to marry somebody else, and put temptation out of her way.
I'm telling you this, Mr Fellowes.
Because she's pretty broken up about it.
As you're her employer I thought you may be able to talk to her sympathetically.
Thanks
I'll try.
Anne.
It's time to clean up, Mr Fellowes.
─ It is!
Anne home yet?
Say, it's one o'clock.
What does this guy Fellowes think he's doing?
I hate to tell you but I bet he's good at it.
What's that?
─ It's a dime.
Oh shucks.
What's a dime ..?
I suppose you think I'm crazy bringing you down here at this hour.
There isn't a lovelier spot on earth.
The moon at this quarter looks different to what I expected.
Well .. what did you expect, dear?
Will you do something for me, Larry?
─ Anything in the world.
Then let me pick out your next secretary.

# Live forever the sparkling Asti, # # the Champagne and the Bordeaux. #
# Among the eating and drinking, # # with women close beside, # # we'll be entertained on the springs of the sofa. #
Nero:
Ave, Caesar!
- All:
Ave!
Ave, ave.
What's so funny?
Never seen an emperor?
# Where am I?
Who is this mob, # # watching me?
But where do I find myself?
#
# Heaven!
What do I see?
My vision dazzles. #
# Is it an old world or is it a new world!
#
# They've just dug me up.
Oh, oh... #
# Oh, la la la. #
# But I do not know how to explain it well, # # if I came here by myself, or if they sent for me. #
Tomorrow, if you go to stores to purchase this article in the Cathedral, you'll find that it's cheap.
I work in the public square, for the Bomb Norcia company.
I want to spit blood but I can't.
Stand back, boy, let me work!
Not for your needs, because needs, we already have enough, thank God.
Tell me, 4 is too much, 3 is too much, it's still expensive.
How much do you sell?
A pound per meter!
Toh!
Take it away, let them see.
If you don't like it, we have other articles.
Oh, the old days of brave warriors!
Hearts of steel and tempers of glass.
Where is that Muzio, good old Muzio.
Muzio!
Muzio Scaevola who fought the Etruscans, so strong, he put his hand in the fire and let it burn!
But is that story true?
- The historians say so.
- Sounds like a tale for the fireplace.
And the rule of Atilius Regulus?
A rule that you nor I have ever observed.
What a time!
That Golden Age of the great Ulysses!
The most fearless warrior who ever lived to fight.
Times sung by Homer and 'Bignose' Ovidius, and later by Virgil, and then Nero, the famous singer.
Mucrone, would you like a drink.
Give me a drink.
Would you fancy, listening to my latest verse?
- All:
Now!
The tench fish said to the pike:
'What are you doing, oh pike?
'.
Replied the pike:'I do what I like.'
Moral: or tench, or pike, do what you like.
All:
Well!
Bravo!
Bis!
We want him undressed.
Gourmet!
Moral: who falls gets hurt.
You can't spell service without vice.
But this is the imperial triclinium and I do not see Poppea.
Woman:
There's Poppea?
Do not be jealous:
Poppea is no longer popping.
Where's Poppea?
What is it?
You wanted me, dear Caesar?
Nero:
Greatly!
I longed for you.
Hi, matron!
- All:
Hail!
- Hail and thunder!
No longer matron but godmother now, huh?
Ripe as fruit in Autumn, worthy of being immortalized in marble by Phidias.
Too bad you put on weight!
Melius est abundare deficere quam.
Unlike you, you're bones, skins, nerves, but flesh... nothing!
- Tell me, do you want to take a walk?
- Yes.
- Und spazieren?
- Yes.
- Space enough...
- Are you tired?
- Nein.
- Nein?
(in German) My biggest darling, give me a kiss.
You will always be my chick?
And Acte and Calvia?
- They're only substitutes.
- I can't stand them.
Well, let's have some fun by abolishing them.
Take 100 slaves from Acte, and give them to Poppaea.
- Thank you.
I withdraw.
- Then I withdraw too.
- Ave.
- Ave.
- Ave.
- Ave.
- Bye, Caesar.
Bye, Caesar's, see you tonight.
And I?
And how shall I cope without the slaves?
Careful or I'll give you one in the face to send you to that post!
Pluto's tail, I am jealous!
The navel of Nebuchadnezzar!
Watch yourself,
I am not a slave, of that vain...
(SOUNDS LIKE HAVANA)
Who smoked that Havana?
- Hamilcar?
- Hamilcar.
- Hamilcar, take her away from me, before I crush her, splinter, pulverize her, like the glass of a watch between the gears of a dynamo.
Hail, Caesar Augustus!
Petronius, the arbiter of taste.
# What news do you bring me?
#
- Christians...
- How many times have I told you,
I do not want you to enter the triclinium with a pipe in the mouth?
You took the triclinium for a smoking room?
Hm?
By the poet!
And you who are the poet and artist, you smoke like a steam engine.
If I do not hit you on the head, it's because the top hat is mine.
Caesar, the population complains!
They want bread, oil, sesterces.
Says Terces?
Who is Terces?
Chastise these ignorant plebeians, is the advice of Tigellinus.
Tigellinus, are you there?
Stay.
Let's burn Rome, and rebuild it in reinforced concrete.
What do you think of my plan?
Courageous.
Well, I'll go.
Are you leaving?
I wanted to dismiss you, it's even better if you're already going.
Hamilcar!
Here, burn all of Rome, make it a fire well done.
- Caesar, I go.
- Go'.
# Go, go and come back soon, I'll wait here. #
Farewell!
Mucrone!
Mucrone, bring me my lyre.
Caesar, it sounds false.
Of course it is false...
That's why it's called a li-ar.
But no matter: brilliant people will improvise without the lire.
Music and words worthy of Nero.
Piripi, Piripi, Piripi!
Poropò, poropò, poropò!
Parapira, parapappa, piraparapappa, piraparapappa, piraparapappapà!
I'm composing the second part.
Parapiraparapappapà, pappapà, pappapà!
Oh, oh, oh...
Pom, pom, pom...
- I forgot to close the tap.
- Pom...
Tigellinus, the empire is mine.
When you want to poop, make your own empire.
Lie down.
Let's return to antiquity, that would be progress.
- A fire!
- What?
- All of Rome!
Light of Helios!
Don't you know that was my order?
- Beard of copper!
Why did you do this?
- Because Rome is mine!
But what about my savings!
Save my savings!
But I am not the fire brigade.
Wait!
I must make a call.
Speaking?
Speaking!
Of course!
If I am speaking you must be listening.
You're receiving me?
Oh!
What reception!
Ha ha ha.
No, Miss, connect me to the station...
No, no!
The fire station.
Huh?
Right now?
All right, go ahead.
- What is it?
- They're coming.
- This is it?
- No, but they're coming.
Already coming.
Oh!
I admire your diligence.
Yes, I'm speaking with the fire fighters, you fine fighters!
Yes, it's burning!
This is Mr. Nero, from the Palatine, yes!
What is burning?
A fire, of course!
Do not forget, huh?
Make a knot in your the handkerchief, tell your friends when they arrive!
Huh?
No!
No!
- You're lying!
Intentionally!
No!
- What is it?
- Tell me it's not true!
It's not true!
- What?
!
- No!
He says a firefighter came and left an umbrella, look...
Huh?
But no!
These are burning matters!
Man:
Death to the arsonist!
All (together):
To death!
- (in dialect of Rome) They fight!
- But no, it's there.
It's the people!
What...
What does this vile multitude want?
Mamma Mia!
Mamma Mia!
- We want your blood!
- Take Butter's blood!
Butter, lend me your blood, come!
See?
When you need it most, the butter melts away.
Tigellinus, would you burn for me?
Do you not fear my death will make the praetorians revolt?
Man:
Death to the mother-killer!
All (together):
To death!
Death to the mother-killer?
I am an orphan!
- Caesar, why do you not flee?
- Enough.
The public must forgive me this professional flirting.
At times like this, the actor disappears, and vanity takes over, the vanity of technical theater and cinema.
These internal choruses I seem to have done well, right?
But the public did not take them.
I will repeat them.
Do it again.
Man:
Death to the mother-killer!
All (together):
To death!
For what I pay them, they do miracles.
I'll make them do it a dozen times.
- Caesar.
- What is it?
- (in dialect of Rome) They want to kill you.
- But why?
- To make you pay for starting the fire!
- But why?
Who told you that?
- They told me so.
- They will make me pay?
- Yes.
But no!
I am insured against fire!
Talk to the people!
Wait, I'll talk to the people.
How exciting, addressing the crowd!
No!
Those guys want money!
Ah!
Wait!
What an idea!
The people are mine!
I hold them in my hand!
- 3!
All: 6!
- 7!
8!
- 4!
9!
You see?
It is the people!
Make them play, and they bite the bait!
- Look: 5!
7!
- 8!
7!
Another pint to be refilled!
Nero and players: 6!
6!
6!
Stupid!
Uuuh...
Ignoble mob, is this the reward for the sacrifices made for you?
Go home, prove yourselves men, and tomorrow Rome will be reborn more beautiful and magnificent than before!
Men:
Bravo!
- Thanks!
You like this word, 'before'?
The people love it when they hear difficult words.
I will repeat it to them:
More beautiful and magnificent than before.
Men:
Bravo!
- Thanks!
- More beautiful and magnificent than before!
Men:
Bravo!
- Thanks!
- More beautiful and magnificent than...
Men:
Bravo!
- More beautiful...
Bravo!
- Thanks!
- Beautiful, thank you!
Bravo!
- Thanks!
Bravo!
- 'you!
Thank'!
- Bravo!
Thanks!
Bravo!
You see?
The people, when they often say that you are good, will say so even if you do nothing.
Look.
Man:
Brrr!
- To you and your grandfather.
Tomorrow, tomorrow...
How many tomorrows are there in one month?
Tomorrow there will be large distributions, of wine, oil, of flypaper, and sesterces.
Bread and circles.
Man: bread and circuses!
Look who's speaking gibberish!
But I am made of stronger stuff!
I will give you everything, as long as you don't ask for anything!
Now go, beloved rabble!
All (together):
To death!
Woman:
To death!
- No!
Public:
Encore!
Bis!
Burglars A musical comedy of marriage
Let me, let me, be your Carmen just once for just one day, for just one hour.
Let me, let me, be in your arms just once with my mouth on your mouth.
if you don't love me you can act out of pity just fool me and act mechanically
but let me, let me, be your Carmen just once and kiss me, kiss me, like a Spaniard.
Olé!
Let me, let me, be your Carmen just once.
for just one day, for just one hour.
Let me, let me, let me...
Hello?
Eugène Dumontier here.
Laboratory for mechanical dolls and similar articles.
What?
Who do you want to talk with?
Mr. Amadé?
I know no Mr. Amadé.
Sorry, wrong number.
Please don't hang up.
Your new servant is called Amadé.
For ten years, all my servants have been called Jean.
So I'll get you Jean.
Miss Hortense, the servant is wanted at the telephone.
Jean!
Jean!
- One moment, Ms. Hortense!
A little faster, if you don't mind!
Ms. Hortense, I expressly asked for a quiet post.
Don't rush me, I have a weak heart.
If you don't like it here, you're free to leave.
There!
Amadé speaking!
- But Jean!
Pardon, I have to call myself Amadé on the phone.
Yes, please?
Yes, please?
Have you gone completely mad?
We're up to a big job, and you leave no message for me?
I beg your pardon, Sir, but... there was no possibility.
Now just tell me what's up.
Did the old frump really not notice that all your references are forged?
Oh no, Sir, the lady is very satisfied with my references!
Listen Amadé, I need to know the following:
Does Ms. Dumontier have a lot of jewelry?
So, she has.
Very good.
Let's move on.
Have you already set up the microphones?
Great!
Why are you coughing?
Do you have a cold?
No, monsieur, it's just that your stupid questions... bunged me up a little.
Stop fooling around!
We're risking our necks, and you...
How can you upset me like this?
I refuse to tolerate this!
Oh God, I...
I....
My heart!
What's wrong with you?
Hey, what are you doing there?
Water.
Water.
- At once, Jean, at once.
You idiot!
Do you want to put the police on our trail?
The old hag almost overheard everything.
But yes, the microphones are already set up.
I can eavesdrop on everyone in the villa.
It's all right.
I'll call...
Hortense!
Hortense!
Miss Hortense, a little faster, please.
What can I do for you, madame?
Mr. Sérigny is staying for lunch.
So?
But I'm not sure if that's all right with Mr. Dumontier.
But it's all right with me, and you can go if you don't like it.
Mr. Dumontier hired me for life.
Me, too.
It's horrible with that person.
She gets nasty every time I speak my mind.
Give me a light, please.
- Oh, sorry, of course I have a light.
Besides...
- Here you are.
Thanks.
Besides, formerly, she thought my husband would marry her.
That's ridiculous, isn't it?
Just sack her.
That's what you think!
My husband has strictly forbidden me.
For ten years, she's been darning his socks, she's always punctual and does everything the way he wants.
Well, I married her, too.
Well, madame... and you don't long for a man for whom you mean everything,
who only thinks of you,
and who only dreams of you?
Ah, now I understand.
So get started, so I can get over with it.
Well, I really don't know, madame...
- But I know.
In a few minutes you will rise, with a face like a tomcat when it thunders
First, you will awkwardly take a deep breath, then you will tell me with folded hands that you can't live without me anymore.
But no, no...
Then you will press my hand on your heart....
- But, madame...
Isn't it true?
Yes...no... yes...
See, now you even want to throw yourself on your knees in front of me.
No, I had no intention...
That spot is already threadbare, so many crawled there before.
But all to no avail.
Sadly.
See, my good Sérigny, there are three kinds of men.
The first kind you marry.
From them you get money, a bank account, they give you jewelry, pearls, big diamonds, and they pay for the dressmaker's bill, too.
In this respect, my husband is almost exemplary.
With the second kind of men you can play bridge, play golf, go to the theatre, dance the tango....
And I belong to that second kind?
- Partially.
With you, one can only...
- Do the tango?
Play bridge.
Well, and the third kind?
The third kind doesn't exist.
These are the men you long for.
See that picture over there, it's by Vallier.
You know who that is, the famous sports painter.
My husband bought it for me, for 600,000 francs.
"The Torero of Granada"!
See, that's one of the third kind.
He?
A bit of a common type, but he's got something.
Sadly, you don't have it, Mr. Sérigny.
I'm waiting for the only one who really behaves like a man
Until now, there was no one I really liked but I'm sure that he will come.
You can't be much indeed, because you listen to me far too dutifully.
If I am to love, it must be a man because only a man can excite me.
Let me, let me, be your Carmen just once for just one day, for just one hour.
Let me, let me, be in your arms just once
With my mouth on your mouth.
If you don't love me, you can act out of pity, just fool me and act mechanically.
Just let me, let me, be your Carmen just once and kiss me, kiss me like a Spaniard.
Olé!
I don't really like fighting bulls, but for you I'll start today.
You have to note down things like this for later use.
Now I can give evidence in court:
Dumontier has his reasons for divorce.
Madame, you must answer my prayers, otherwise I'll cry my eyes out.
Let me, let me...
- be your torero just once.
for just one day, for just one hour.
Let me, let me...
- Be in your arms just once,
With my mouth on your mouth
I'd gladly be wild like Emperor Nero, for one glance, for one sign of pity.
Just let me, let me be your torero just once and kiss me, kiss me as my Carmen.
Oh dear!
Do you, do you, want to be my Carmen finally?
Not for one day, not for one hour.
Tomorrow, she will be in his arms nevertheless,
With her mouth on his mouth.
He gets her heart, without being like Nero.
If he hears about this, he'll rage like Satan.
Let me, let me, be your Carmen just once.
and kiss me, kiss me, like a Spaniard.
Olé!
Mr. Dumontier!
Mr. Dumontier!
It's time.
You're mistaken, Hortense.
It's isn't time yet.
It's still a quarter of an hour until lunch.
As usual, at 1 pm.
But Mr. Dumontier, I'm talking about something completely different.
Your wife is cheating on you!
With whom?
- With Mr. Sérigny!
You're mistaken again, Hortense.
But I heard it with my own ears!
Mr. Sérigny is completely out of the question.
He is neither a boxer nor a bullfighter
He isn't a dictator, either.
And he has even less talent to be a murderer.
He isn't a romantic hero.
So, he hasn't got a chance with my wife.
But Madame Renée, please give me just one chance.
I'll have lunch at your place, and you'll have tea at mine.
My husband won't like that.
But Madame, there are places where your husband can't see us.
I don't mean out here in the suburbs.
In Paris, Madame Renée.
In a quiet, lonely street, in an old, secluded house...
You have a small, dreamy apartment, furnished only for me.
How do you know?
With swelling pillows, with dark curtains, with a gramophone, with sweet liqueurs?
No, with port wine.
All right then, with port wine.
But... without me.
My kind number two.
Oh, Madame Renée.
Think it over, please.
Don't say no so hastily.
I even have a big surprise in store for you.
A Vallier hangs on the wall there, a genuine Vallier for 400,000 francs.
"The Ocean Pilot".
If you pour your money down the drain, at least save your breath.
So I have no other way except...
Jean!
We'll have lunch in three minutes!
- Very good, Miss Hortense.
We'll have lunch in three minutes, madame.
All right.
- Very good, madame.
Now do me a favor and act like a normal person again.
Most of all, brush off your knees.
My husband always gets annoyed about this.
Please excuse me for a moment.
Lunch is served!
My dear Mr. Sérigny.
I'm very pleased to meet you again.
Please feel at home.
- Very kind of you.
You stained your knee there a little.
Jean, tell Madame that lunch is ready.
Very good, Mr. Dumontier.
It's a fight that costs a lot of energy.
The world of tennis has rarely seen something like that.
The powerful muscles of the master's arm are tightening.
Balls at lightning speed earn him point over point.
His opponent is lanky, but fast and flexible.
He plays great smashes.
Onto the sinuous bodies of the fighters the eyes of 5,000 attractive women are fixed.
But now the master gets down to business.
The force of his shots is increasing.
Forehand, backhand, forehand, backhand...
And a smash!
Madame!
- Don't disturb me!
Now the score is 4-5 !
And a changeover again!
The master refreshes himself with a glass of lemonade.
Won't you like a glass of port wine beforehand, Mr. Sérigny?
No, thanks.
I don't want to start without Madame.
This is all because of my wife.
She is very tactful, and my wife is very unpunctual.
Oh, I'll wait with the greatest pleasure.
I'm sorry, Madame is doing calisthenics.
1 pm and three minutes.
May I offer you some sardines?
No, thanks.
I'll show courtesy to your wife.
Don't show courtesy, take some caviar.
No, thanks.
I ask you to take my advice, because Madame Renée....
Some champignon salad?
... radiantly bright, always laughing and young, doesn't fit to your...
Cold salted tongue?
... doesn't fit to your puppet masteries, Mr. Dumontier.
A mayonnaise egg?
She is an angel who from heaven strayed to the earthly milling mass.
She is the sweet, soft, female good
In one word, she is a....
Piece of cold turkey hen?
She's a scorching breath of air coming to us from hot Spain
A few chestnuts?
In her divine claim to fame she is Carmen!
Sure, although she's a blonde.
So she sang something for you?
-Yes.
Pardon?
- Oh...ahm...no.
What's that?
- My latest invention.
A musical bottom plate.
If the conversation comes to a halt, you simply press the button.
Have a look!
Very charming.
It's bought very often, especially by people who are married for more than six weeks.
Well, you have a nice view of marriage.
Why did you marry at all?
Because of love.
My wife, too, by the way.
She wanted an intellectually eminent man, and I wanted a true little madam.
But marriage has changed us.
Renée now considers me a little dumbed down, and I consider her.....
Well...
I know that for a year she's been looking for a lover.
So you would let her go?
Yes.
But only if I can get her to marry again.
Beg your pardon?
To be quite outspoken about it, my dear Sérigny:
I am looking for a husband for my wife.
In order to make myself clear, my dear Sérigny:
If I found out that my wife had a lover,
I'd shoot him without further ado.
Of course.
Why didn't you wait lunch for us?
Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy your meal.
My dear child, I once and for all told you not to be tardy.
And I told you once and for all that no one tells me anything.
What's that?
Just have a look.
Allow me to help you, madame.
Oh, that is pretty!
Looks very nice.
Press the button!
Let me, let me, be your Carmen just once for just one day... for just one hour.
You even taunt me with my favorite song!
But I only wanted to please you.
You don't want to please me, you always want to educate me.
May I offer you some sardines?
No, thanks.
I already lost all appetite.
Nothing but education all day.
I'm fed up with it!
But child, show a little respect for our dear guest.
And you, don't disgrace me on our new servant's first day.
I'm not listening, madame.
Very kind of you, Jean.
But you will listen, and you too, Miss Hortense.
Now I lost my appetite, too.
Just remain seated, Mr. Sérigny.
You might learn something.
Please, madame, don't upset Mr. Dumontier again.
You're not my governess, you... you life-long house-dragon!
I forbid you to insult Hortense!
And I forbid you to forbid me anything!
I don't want to be educated all the time,
I'm not a child anymore.
Even if I have to live with a crazy person.
- But Renée!
Yes!
Just once again I want to do what I want.
I want to laugh, I need life,
I need cheerfulness...
Nothing else?
Yes, something else, too.
Happiness.
And I swear I will find it.
And if I knew I had to continue to live here,
I'd rather throw myself down the window.
And I would do it one minute before 1 o'clock so you can't sit down for lunch in time, yes!
The house only has one floor, so you wouldn't get hurt too much.
I can't stand it any longer!
Can't you see how much Mr. Dumontier is upset?
He always keeps calm.
That is what makes me furious!
Do you expect from me to shout like you?
And from Hortense, too?
- I can do you that favor!
But you won't see that from me.
I don't shout!
I'm quiet and considerate!
You won't disturb my calm!
And I can't get any lunch!
Now I have enough!
I won't accept this any longer!
I was expressly promised a quiet house!
Beg your pardon, Mr. Jean.
You're welcome, Mr. Dumontier.
I have to go to the factory.
If you want to spend another nice and quiet hour in my house, my dear Sérigny:
my wife very much likes to play bridge.
Oh, I know.
Goodbye, my dear child.
What does a good child say when papa leaves?
Goodbye.
Learn a lesson from this.
Mr. Sérigny.
- Mr. Dumontier.
Sérigny!
- Yes, madame?
Where is the said apartment?
In the Rue de la Tour des Dames, no. 37.
I'll come to you at 4 o'clock.
Thank you.
No, our relationship only starts at four o'clock.
But I admire you, madame, I admire you, you know that.
No.
It's impossible.
It's really not possible.
- But what's the matter?
Just because you're angry with your husband, you throw yourself into the arms of the first available man.
But the most important thing for you is that I chose your arms to throw myself in, my dear Victor.
"Victor"...
I feel embarrassed.
But it all happens so suddenly, I can't believe it yet.
I still feel dizzy, I..
Do you feel well?
- Oh, yes, yes.
I'm in seventh heaven, but...
Does this belong to your husband?
Oh, now I understand.
Are you afraid?
- No, no, I'm not afraid, but...
Your husband has such old-fashioned views about infidelity and shooting lovers....
Rest assured, that's what he tells everyone.
Oh, then it's all right, madame, and besides it doesn't matter...
One hour with you in my secluded apartment is not atoned for too expensively by death.
At four o'clock, Renée.
And will you be punctual, or are you doing calisthenics again?
Well, you'd better go now.
- Yes, of course.
So goodbye, madame.
- Goodbye.
I'm so happy, I'm so terribly happy.
I almost forgot to ask: do you prefer liqueur or port wine?
Oh, as you are used to do.
It's the first time I have ever cheated on my husband.
I don't know what one drinks on such an occasion.
It's port wine, then.
So goodbye.
And don't forget:
Rue de la Tour des Dames, No. 37, intermediate storey, right-hand side.
Goodbye, I'm so happy.
I'm so happy, so happy.
Ségur 3989.
Hello, is that you?
Amadé speaking.
A lot of jewelry.
The largest stone only 10 carat.
4 o'clock, Rue de la Tour des Dames, 37.
Intermediate storey, right-hand side.
A Vallier worth 400,000 francs.
But be very cautious.
Don't worry.
Nobody will catch me!
Mimi, what's this disturbance?
It's from the dentist next door.
You won't hear that all the time.
He chloroforms most of them.
Nice neighborhood for an hour of love.
Will you have a visitor?
- Yes, a lady is coming.
Put it in the next room, the Turkish room.
Put it on the little table in front of the large divan.
But keep your mouth shut, unlike last time.
The lady thinks that I own the apartment.
But the baron only lent it to you as long as he is out of town.
Why do you tell fibs to your lady?
She's a married woman and won't visit a stranger's apartment.
But she comes to acquaintances?
- Yes.
If she comes.
She'll come.
She's coming, she's coming....
You'll see she is coming.
So she's coming?
And how she's coming!
I say she isn't coming.
I can even hear she's coming.
She's coming, she's coming.
Oh dear!
- What's up now?
I used naphthalene.
She's coming, she's coming...
Hello.
Madame.
Now you smell a little better!
She's coming, she's coming...
Open the door, Mimi!
Beloved!
Don't crush my hat!
What's this masquerade for?
Masquerade?
Well, if you don't like it...
Now we can start.
You've got it nice here.
I wouldn't have thought you capable of so much taste.
Oh, sure.
Who is that?
- Who?
Oh that!
That's an old friend of mine, Baron Rochasse.
Tell me...
- Yes?
Must he sit in on us?
How charming!
Of course he needn't, but, you know, I sometimes lend my flat to him.
His girlfriends are to believe it is his own.
But if it bothers you, Madame Renée:
I'll cover him up.
Of course.
One moment, please.
It will be fixed soon.
Well, now let's...
Madame Renée, these are all minor matters.
The important thing is the thrill.
Our thrill.
You're right.
Let's start.
Yes.
All right.
No, no, in order!
First the port wine.
Of course, madame.
First the port wine, then the thrill.
Bless you, madame.
It's naphthalene.
What is this?
- It comes from the window.
Indeed!
Someone tries to open the shutter!
Perhaps it's just the wind?
- Nonsense.
Someone wants to get in!
Through the window?
Your husband!
For heaven's sake, Sérigny, save me!
- My husband will shoot us!
- We have to flee!
Are you crazy?
We can't get out of here together!
We must hide!
- But I don't know the whereabouts.
Hurry, over there!
- Perhaps there in the wardrobe.
Impossible.
Perhaps there.
Switch off the light, you idiot!
There he is!
Bless you!
Get up, Mister!
Make it quick!
Hands up!
Don't make a noise.
Switch on the light!
I'm sorry to disturb you, but I believed to find an empty apartment.
Baron Rochasse only wanted to return in three weeks' time.
Baron Rochasse?
- Of course, the man who owns this flat.
This apartment belongs to Baron Rochasse?
You didn't know that?
Or do I perhaps have the honor to meet some colleagues?
What do you think, we are here for quite different reasons.
I understand.
Port wine, biscuits, sweets, a beautiful lady, a very beautiful lady even.
And you are a friend of the house, and he put the apartment at your disposal.
Please, just take down your arms.
You don't have to be afraid of me.
Afraid, afraid.
Who's afraid here after all.
But, to be honest, as you can imagine:
With every noise you think it's the husband.
You idiot!
Interesting!
Madame is married.
No unnecessary excitement, I'm no blackmailer.
I have a different area of expertise.
I came for a Vallier.
In the next room.
- Thanks.
Then I don't want to hold you up any longer, you surely want to be alone.
Madame, it was a very special pleasure to meet you.
A very nice diamond.
- It is an imitation.
Pardon me, it's genuine.
But it would be impolite to take it off of this beautiful hand.
He is incredible!
Oh please, don't bother with the police.
No, no, I didn't have any intention.
It would be even more unpleasant for you than for me.
Why?
The police would ask for your names.
So you don't care at all for madame's reputation?
Indeed.
How could you get me into a situation like this?
I had the best intentions, it's not my fault if burglars come.
What do you mean by "burglars," good colleague?
Everybody here steals what he wants.
I take the Vallier, and you madame's virtue.
And I have made the worse choice.
Well, don't make comparisons.
I repeat you're a burglar...
I break into other people's flats, you into other people's marriages.
No, I only take what is given voluntarily.
Isn't that right, madame?
I only steal from people I don't know, you steal from your best friend.
Isn't that right, madame?
Let's start with our work.
Please feel quite at home.
Actually, a fabulous fellow.
Have you gone totally crazy?
If we report him, he will report us.
But we must get rid of that fellow somehow.
Through the window.
Two policemen!
Your husband has sent them.
Save me, Ms. Renée, I beg you.
I'm still so young!
Pull yourself together, you wimp!
Mr. Sérigny, Mr. Sérigny!
The police are here!
Open the door, quick!
Mr. Sérigny, open the door!
Mr. Sérigny, the police inspector is waiting outside.
I told him we have a lady visitor, but he wants to come in nevertheless.
Now they have us.
No megalomania, the police are looking for me.
Oh, you were three?
Listen child, you'll answer 'yes' to all I ask you now, do you understand?
No.
Here are 1,000 francs.
Do you understand me now?
Yes.
Now I'll say 'yes' every time.
Let the police come in.
Take off that jacket.
No.
Take off that jacket!
- Yes.
Dance!
Come on, dance!
Dance on your own, madame!
Get lively!
Action!
Let's go!
Enter!
Just one moment, inspector, let us just finish practicing!
So hurry up, then!
Oh, how wonderful it is in Paris!
The women are so sweet, but still I don't feel well.
Every evening in tuxedo or in tails
It's the same every day, and that is not my taste.
I say!
One moment, Inspector!
I'll have my body painted black and go to the Fiji Islands
Everything there is paradisically new
Oh, how glad I am!
I'll wear a fig leaf with shells and cuddle up with a Fiji-chick
I'll furnish myself a little bamboo hut
I'm a Fijian, and want to be a Fijian!
I'll have my body painted black and go to the Fiji Islands
Everything there is paradisically new.
Oh, how glad I am!
I'll wear a fig leaf with shells and cuddle up with a Fiji-chick
I'll furnish myself a little bamboo hut
I'm a Fijian, and want to be a Fijian!
Oh how wonderful it is in Paris...
Silence!
I've had enough of this!
I don't like the way you talk, young man.
What do you want here anyway, and who are you?
Inspector Thierry.
This doesn't allow you to forbid me to play the piano.
Or do you want to arrest me for playing out of tune?
Drop your joking!
You see I'm having a little port wine party.
May I introduce my friends, Mr. and Mrs...
Demoreux.
Are they relatives of the police superintendent?
A cousin.
Yes, the family likeness is unmistakable.
Yes, but - where is that man?
What man?
The man who climbed in through the window.
A man, through the window?
Indeed.
The policeman Trochut informed me.
Dear Madame Demoreux, did you see a man climbing in through the window?
I?
No.
Neither did I.
Nor I.
Then please excuse the mistake.
- You're welcome.
To err is polician (police-like).
Would Madam and Sir be so kind as to give my most obedient respects to the police superintendent?
I'll show you out.
You know, in this street we pay particular attention.
In No. 21, an entire ground floor flat is empty.
The owner is somewhere in Brazil.
I can tell you there are paintings hanging there, unbelievable!
What foolishness!
No. 21, you say?
Actually, the house has exactly the same front garden as this one.
With a lawn and...
Baron, may I ask you for something?
Please arrange for a commendation to the superintendent.
Well, of course, Inspector!
Now I have to say thanks to..
- No, I have to thank you.
I'll take any chance to make up for it.
Baron, goodbye.
Goodbye, inspector.
Wow, you're quite a perky fellow!
Is all this money really mine?
Sure.
Really?
Of course.
My first installment for a car.
I'll buy a car!
I'll buy a Ford!
Madame, you can't leave yet.
It could be a pleasant evening.
Sorry to interrupt you again, but I still have about two or three hours of work here.
Now leave me alone, will you?
The Vallier is next door.
Please stay, Renée!
Don't address me by my first name.
So, Madame Dumon...
- Why don't you give him my full address?
See, because of you she's leaving.
Madame, it's better for you to leave.
Beg your pardon?
You'll have time to think things over, and then you will probably avoid an escapade that's not worth it.
Monsieur, that goes too far!
Indeed.
You interfere with...
- None of my business.
That's why I can say everything.
I don't know you, madame.
Probably I'll never meet you again.
I only know one thing: your husband isn't compatible with you.
How do you know?
- Else you wouldn't be here.
But that's no reason to have a lover that is even less compatible.
I have to ask you to stop!
You're not the man to make a woman happy.
You don't borrow a woman from half past 4 to 7...
Ridiculous.
and then send her back home.
This is not what is called 'love'.
There's no way that you love a woman if you send her back...
That's what you say!
A kiss with a view to the clock is a kiss that brings no luck.
A love affair, quite casually, is not your style, madame.
Together in the afternoon but alone at night, that's not your style, madame.
Love, madame, doesn't eschew danger,
Love, madame, is all or nothing at all.
A love affair, quite casually, is not your style, madame, is really not your style, madame.
You don't say 'I love you', but only for today.
You're right, of course, but...
Not even a thief is as foolish, because he keeps his booty.
Well, you surely know!
A woman that is only half mine:
I abstain from that kind of love.
Are you that discerning?
A lover who is content with that cannot be right.
Perhaps.
A love affair...
- ...quite casually... is not your style, madame.
Together in the afternoon...
- But alone at night... that's not your style, madame.
Love...
-... madame, doesn't eschew danger.
Love...
-... madame, is all or nothing at all.
A love affair...
- ... quite casually.... is not your style, madame.
It's really not?
- It's really not your style, madame.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
A love affair, quite casually, is not your style, madame.
is really not your style, madame.
And now you will help me to take down the Vallier in the next room.
Why should I, are you crazy?
First you ridicule me in front of my girlfriend...
She's not your girlfriend and will never be!
When you came in through that window she almost was.
I always arrive at the right time.
See that you get out, you wimp!
I won't!
- Shall I kick you out?
Get out, you!
Please give back my jacket, I still need it badly.
There!
And I tell you, I wasn't afraid of you!
Did everything go well?
- Yes, apart from an inspector.
And?
You know how I handle such things.
I'll tell you how this affair will go on.
It's really not your style, madame.
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9
I can't deny I'm nervous, Hortense.
18-19-20....
Because an American doll manufacturer is coming?
What do you know about it?
That Hatkins is the most important toy manufacturer in the world.
129,000 dolls every day on the assembly line.
He only arrived in Paris this evening, and yet he already wants to see me.
There are millions in it.
But America needs your ingenious ideas.
Your musical plate.
You're right, he can buy the most beautiful things from me.
The dog looks as if it was alive,
The cat is always grooming.
The baby only speaks three words.
And how does the courageous tin soldier exclaim?
Everything's turning, everything's stirring, everything's budging and moving.
Everything's turning, everything's stirring, like a human being.
She has a clockwork, she has no heart.
A doll, a doll feels no pain.
Oh, that will be Mr. Hatkins.
Go to meet him, Hortense, go.
Ask him to come in immediately.
And Hortense, be very friendly to Mr. Hatkins.
Mr. Sérigny!
Oh dear!
I've been waiting only for you.
I'm coming because of the quiet, nice hour.
That's extraordinarily kind of you.
My wife will come soon, too.
Your wife, oh...
Nice things you have here.
Haven't I?
But the nicest one is my latest invention.
Take this for a moment.
Get over there with it.
Get over there.
And hold up the plate.
Higher!
Still higher!
Thank you.
And when I now aim very carefully and exactly hit the centre,
then the pig will drop down dead.
Goodbye...
Will you hold up that plate!
Don't tremble for fear.
You wimp!
- Wimp?
Hold up that thing.
Attention!
Don't shake, or it may be a close shave!
Attention!
I'm shooting!
Pardon me, dear friend.
Next time I'll aim better.
That's ridiculous.
Topsy turvy world!
My husband gave you horns.
Because of you it's the second time today that my life is in danger.
Your life's in danger?
Well, this could easily have been a close shave.
Outside, your husband shot at me.
That's really stupid, it is.
Your husband isn't compatible with you, I repeat it.
The man you love must be a real man.
Renée, I am such a man.
Just after the moment you left, I managed to capture the burglar.
You don't say!
Yes, I captured him, threw him to the ground, and tied him up.
He's still lying there.
But Sérigny, do you want me to believe all that?
What, oh yes.
I'll let the police pick him up sometime.
But Renée, don't you want to be my Carmen now?
Mr. Hatkins is coming.
- Hatkins?
Who is Hatkins?
Mr. William R. Hatkins from New York!
He must have escaped.
Oh, Mr. Dumontier, you don't have to speak in English with me.
All the better.
My dear child, my I introduce to you Mr. William R. Hatkins from New York?
My wife.
Mr. Sérigny, a bridge partner of my wife.
Bridge?
Bridge.
Oh, no hands needed.
Shouldn't we settle our business affairs first?
As you wish, and if madame permits it.
Oh sure, with the greatest pleasure.
Come then.
You'll excuse us, my dear child.
You'll be astonished.
I'll show you my latest inventions; some lovely things among them.
Tell me, did you come to me with your own car this afternoon?
Yes.
So he noted down your registration number, the rest was easy.
This is what you get from driving in your own car to a rendezvous.
I'll tell my husband everything.
Are you crazy?
The second time he'll aim better he said.
500,000 of them, please.
Well, I...
I have to leave now.
Goodbye.
Please stay.
I'm so afraid.
A little refreshment perhaps?
- No, thanks.
A glass of lemonade?
- No, thanks.
Tell me, Jean, did the gentleman come alone?
Yes, Mr. Sérigny.
500,000 of them, please.
That gentleman left a strange impression on me.
Why?
- For heaven's sake, what was it?
He gave me 1,000 francs.
1,000 francs.
His tactics.
And then he asked me where the Vallier painting was hanging.
His specialty.
He only steals Valliers.
What?
A thief?
A burglar?
I have to phone the police.
You can't do that.
Perhaps he isn't a thief after all.
Now pay attention.
500,000 of these, too, please.
In any case we must save the Vallier.
But where to put such a huge picture?
Perhaps in a drawer.
- Nonsense.
You have to carry it away, Mr. Sérigny.
What?
Oh yes, wonderful idea.
Just take it with you to your flat.
- Sure, but it must be done quickly.
Come, quick, help me.
That's truly delightful, Mr. Dumontier.
But you had a very charming model.
My wife.
I'll buy her for myself.
You can have her.
But now look what she can do.
Does the little child want a rattle?
I want a new dress.
Does the little child like to come to daddy?
I didn't have any time.
Tell us whom you like.
I like the young messieurs.
And any other nice things you have to say to me.
I like, I like you a lot.
Fabulous.
Everything's turning, everything's stirring,
Everything's budging and moving.
Everything's turning, everything's stirring, like a human being.
She has a clockwork, she has no heart.
A doll, a doll feels no pain.
Very charming.
Please, 500,000 of them, too.
Mr. Sérigny sends his excuses.
He's still utterly scared of your shooting practice.
What a wimp!
Mr. Dumontier, a disaster!
Mr. Dumontier, please don't get excited.
What has happened?
Hello?
Eugene Dumontier, mechanical dolls, speaking,
What?
Who is there?
The fire brigade of Vincennes?
- Our factory is burning.
When did the fire start?
Thanks, officer, of course I'll come immediately.
Hortense, the chauffeur shall drive up at once.
Such a disaster!
Bad luck!
Now we have to postpone our talk until tomorrow.
I'm sorry, my plane goes at 8 a.m.
But if madame doesn't mind, I will wait for you here.
I don't mind at all, I will accompany my husband.
Do you think I'll let you walk alone through burning timbers?
But Renée, as lady of the house you can't leave our guest alone.
I'll go with you.
I expressly forbid you to come along.
Hortense will accompany me.
Okay, I'll stay.
But if something happens, it will all be your fault.
What should happen?
Are you afraid, madame?
Afraid?
No.
You don't have to worry about me.
I will take good care of me.
Excuse me, goodbye.
Now that was a great job you did.
The fire, the false fire-brigade officer on the phone,
Hats off, Mr. Burglar.
But you didn't think of everything!
Jean is still here.
Jean!
Jean!
Protect me Jean, here is a burglar!
I know, madame.
We work together.
What?
- Well.
Two man against one helpless woman.
Aren't you ashamed?
Oh yes.
I'm ashamed, madame.
But that is impossible!
After all, you saved the picture a short while ago.
On my order.
On your order?
So that Mr. Sérigny leaves the villa.
Jean, save me, Jean!
Amadé, go into the park and whistle if someone comes.
Very well, Jacques.
Ah, now I know what you want.
This is where you have your eyes on.
There you are.
There, help yourself.
No, thanks.
I'm not interested in that.
Well, I can't give you any money.
The only thing I want to fetch.... is you.
Hello, hello, operator, answer!
Don't bother.
Cut off.
Don't touch me.
- Quiet, madame!
Just be quiet.
You are insane.
No, madame.
I'm in love.
I'd very much like to be tender to you, and you are always angry and silent.
And nevertheless you speak tenderly to me,
And I want to tell you why.
Your mouth is music, is music one can never forget.
Your mouth is music, when it smiles and silently kisses me.
Oh, don't let us lose time
We want to make a lot of music together.
Your mouth is music, is music one can never forget.
I don't want to.
- What is it?
I am...
- Well, perhaps you are...
In love.
I'm not saying anything anymore.
- You don't have to.
Because there are answers without words.
Your mouth is music, is music one can never forget.
Ah, it's terrible to be loved by a burglar!
What is this?
- A souvenir for you.
Keep your presents!
Madame Renée, from the best jeweler in Paris...
You stole it.
I bought it.
Paid for with honestly earned money!
Madame Renée, only listen to me for one moment.
But spare me your bracelet!
If you don't want to accept it, at least have a look at it.
Jacques Durand, Rue Blondé 11...
What does this mean?
A burglar revealing his address?
Only at the moment I'm Jacques Durand.
And you will only find me in Rue Blondé 11 this night between 12 and 2.
Perhaps tomorrow I will dwell in Madrid, and will be called Lima.
And you believe I accept your friendly invitation?
You have no time to reconsider.
Between 12 and 2, Rue Blondé, 11.
This night - or never.
Never.
Never will I be the mistress of a burglar!
And if I ask you to be my wife?
Your proposal honors me exceedingly, but it's a bit too romantic for my taste.
Mr. Dumontier is coming!
For heaven's sake, you must go away!
I'm staying.
Do leave, please leave!
Will you come tonight?
No!
Mr. Hatkins left immediately after you.
He sends his excuses, he will write to you.
I'm coming.
But please leave now, finally.
Quick, through the park, quick!
Well, everything goes wrong today.
Good evening, Renée.
Believe it or not, there was no fire.
Well, I never!
Someone made me an April's fool on the 30th of September.
Renée, where is the picture?
- I don't know.
But who stole the picture?
I have no idea, I was here all the time.
Ah, now I see clearly.
Sérigny.
Sérigny.
To impress you he wants to play the gentleman burglar.
You think that's funny?
You won't be laughing long about your lover.
Lover?
I won't tolerate that!
- Me neither!
I'll call the police now.
Hello.
Hello!
Operator, answer!
Gosh!
Like in Chicago.
Open the door!
Open in the name of the law!
Is the burglar still here?
I...
I really don't know.
Well... then..
You stay here and have an eye on the servant.
And you follow me.
My heart!
Are you not feeling well?
Water.
Cognac.
Yes.
Cognac.
Madame!
Madame!
Please open the door.
We have to search the room.
Madame Renée.
Just open the door.
It's me.
Your savior.
Renée, I forbid you to lock yourself up.
Well, we have to break in the door.
I've found something.
A bracelet?
But I don't know it.
Something's written in there.
May I?
Jacques Durand, Rue Blondé, 11.
What does that mean?
Rue Blondé, 11?
Strange.
Oh how wonderful is Fiji-Land,
They live there without taxes and police.
And there's no trace of a tuxedo only one thing is loved there, and that is nudism.
I'll have my body painted black and go to the Fiji Islands.
There everything is paradisically new,
Oh, how glad I am!
I'll wear a fig leaf with shells, and cuddle- up with a Fiji chick.
I'll furnish myself a little bamboo hut
I am a Fijian, and want to be a Fijian!
Max!
When the lady arrives, strikingly good appearance, blonde....
Slim, elegant, blue eyes...
How do you know?
- You already told me three times.
Any news, Amadé?
The police are on our trail.
We must leave with the plane for London or America.
I'm staying.
I want to know if Renée comes.
Good, than I'll go alone.
I won't have myself jailed because of you.
Jailed...
For heaven's sake, where's my passport?
Have I left it at Dumontier's in the end?
Yes.
- Pardon?
Yes.
And actually, I already caught the fellow once.
You caught him?
- Yes, in the apartment of a friend.
In the apartment of a friend.
Do you have any witnesses?
Well, a little cocotte.
A little cocotte.
I searched the whole apartment; madame is nowhere to be found.
Well then, kidnapping.
Mr. Dumontier, I've found something else.
Jean's wallet.
Jean's wallet.
That's stenography.
I can't read it.
But I can.
Mr. Sérigny, did you tell my wife that you'd like to be....
Her torero?
!
Torero?
I?
Did you spend with her... an hour in a secluded apartment in the
Rue de la Tour des Dames, No. 36?
No. 37.
37?
!
Are you looking for Mr. Jacques Durand?
Yes, if that's still his name.
This way, please
I'm glad you came, Madame Renée.
I'm happy.
Are the police coming, perhaps?
- Get out.
But I only want to...
- Please get out.
You must leave, Mr. Hatkins...
- Durand.
All right, Durand, but you have to leave or you'll be arrested.
I'm not afraid.
I'll stay with you.
Forever.
That takes two.
I won't share the life of a burglar.
And you only came to tell me this?
I came to warn you.
And that is all?
No.
I want something else, too.
I want to make you into an honorable person.
Make me into an honorable person?
Dumontier is coming!
This way please, the last door on the right-hand side.
Thanks.
Please leave us alone for a moment, Jean.... ahm...
Amadé.
I wanted to say, Dr. Latour.
His friend was so careless as to forget his notebook at my place.
So you know...
- Everything, Mr. Durand.
My dear child, I have to greatly disappoint you.
This gentleman is really called Jacques Durand.
He is a playwright.
In spite of that, he has never stolen anything in his life.
You are no burglar?
Why then did you put on this act?
You forced me to do it.
I?
Madame, I first saw you three months ago.
I sat beside you at the bullfight in Seville.
But you only had eyes for the torero.
Well, that was a hero.
And you always looked for a hero, didn't you?
He played it for you.
A burglar who steals pictures, who kidnaps women, a rendezvous at a negro ball, do you want even more romance?
So you only made fun of me?
No, madame.
I was serious.
So you won't stay with Mr. Durand?
No, ever.
And do you know what will happen to this gentleman?
So you do love him?
Answer!
Actually, I... quite like him.
Your mouth is music,
is music one can never forget.
Your mouth is music, when it smiles and silently kisses me.
Oh, don't let us lose time,
we want to make a lot of music together.
Your mouth is music,
is music one can never forget.
Mr. Dumontier, man to man.
I owe you satisfaction.
I ask you for the hand of your wife.
I'm truly sorry, my dearest, but you are a little too late.
But why, if you allow?
Here...
That's ridiculous.
Mr. Dumontier, may I ask you for a favor?
Do you want a reference as a valet?
Please give me back my notebook.
I actually wanted to keep it.
As a souvenir.
See, I wrote down everything that was said in your house, and now I'll write a play from it.
"Burglars
- A musical comedy of marriage".
I hope my part is not too comical.
Rest assured, I played the comical part. tcp
In the future, a computer program called Skynet will declare war on the human race.
Machines have traveled back in time, taking human form to terminate John Connor, the future leader of the Resistance;
Sarah Connor, John's mother, teacher, and protector;
Cameron, a terminator reprogrammed to defend them at all costs;
Derek Reese, John's uncle, and a commanding officer with the Resistance.
Together they fight to stop Skynet from ever being created.
The battle for our tomorrow starts today.
Previously on Terminator:
The Sarah Connor Chronicles
He's from the future.
Sent here by John.
Stop Greenway...
Serrano Point...
He's concerned about one of the censor board in the control room.
The reactor could melt down.
Skynet wins.
The reactor is overheating.
My name is Catherine Weaver.
I'd like to talk to you about a job opportunity, agent Ellison.
This is Riley.
Now is not the time for this.
So when is the time... to live my life?
Martin Bedell?
His name was Martin Bedell.
He was in Century work camp with you.
Right up until the escape.
So I knew him.
You knew him.
Everybody knew him.
But he doesn't know this one, does he?
Not this Martin Bedell.
No.
Another Martin Bedell.
Maybe it's just coincidence.
How many coincidences named Sarah Connor got killed, before Skynet finally locked in on you?
So why would they want to kill him?
He had experience and knowledge that John needed.
Military prep school, then West Point.
Bedell had real training.
He helped John put the Resistance together.
Okay.
There were three Martin Bedells in L.A.
Now there are two.
So how do we know which one is the target?
They both are.
Machines are thorough.
Only good thing about them.
So it took you, what, 30 seconds to find those names?
If there is a triple-eight out there, he's found them too.
Where are you going?
Martin Bedell number one.
Closest address.
Without a plan?
Yeah, I've got a plan.
It involves guns.
Wait.
You're not going with him.
No.
Everybody, wait.
P. Alto.
We thought it was a person.
It's not, it's a place.
It's a military prep school in Carlsbad.
Here's the student directory.
Martin Bedell number two.
Maybe we got a head start.
I'll load the truck.
We'll go.
We will, will we?
It's a boys' school.
I can do this.
I am doing this.
Nothing complicated.
Find the kid, throw him in a hole, babysit.
It's as safe as anything we do.
Go.
Two.
Two Sarah Connors were murdered before they found me.
Cameron and I will find the other Martin Bedell.
Maybe we can stop the triple-eight before he gets to you.
He's not a soldier.
No.
Not yet.
You haven't said a word since Anaheim.
That's 40 miles of quiet.
You are...thinking or worrying?
Thinking.
About Bedell.
After we grab him, where are we supposed to hide him?
Who said we were going to hide him?
Martin Bedell hiding in a cave somewhere might as well be Martin Bedell dead somewhere.
No use to John Connor.
Besides, it's a military school.
Soldiers, guns, can't do much better than that.
So you own this nuclear plant, Serrano Point?
I have an interest in it.
Is this the same company you were referring to the other day?
The one you wanted me to look into?
It is.
The near-meltdown a few weeks back...
The news said an employee caused the accident.
Mr. Ellison, there are no accidents.
Kansas, this is Hammerhead.
Do you copy?
-Kansas, respond!
-It's Kyle.
He's back.
Tin cans just hit Kansas bunker.
Survivors?
Prisoners now.
One ogre tank, three monkey wagons.
The convoy will roll out... down Wilshire to Century in the next hour.
And I'm thinking--
No, uh-uh.
We've got our orders.
Connor wants this corridor controlled.
So we sit tight, we observe Skynet movement, and we'll report back at regular intervals, and that's it.
What's that report going to say?
That we observed Skynet move these people into a death camp while we sat?
I know!
I know it sucks, all right?
But if we lose eyes on this road, we could lose a lot more than one bunker, Kyle.
If Connor were here--
Connor isn't here.
Corporal, get below.
Round up every tunnel rat you can find.
Martin.
You know what he'd say.
You know what Connor would say.
Yes, I know what he'd say.
If Connor wants to shoot me for disobeying orders, he can get in line behind the tin cans.
We're doing this.
You all right?
We see a lot of boys like your nephew, lieutenant.
Single mother.
Socially withdrawn.
Move around a lot.
Tend to cling to male authority figures.
Lost his dad, you said, in the war?
Killed.
On a mission.
Can't tell you any more than that.
Don't know?
Can't.
I understand.
Well...
Good grades.
Good test scores.
Good kid.
Here's what I'll do.
Three weeks as a plebe.
If he likes it, he can stay.
Then we'll talk tuition.
Thank you.
I'll give him the news.
Lieutenant.
I lost one of my tacs a couple weeks ago.
Reservist.
Had to go.
Tac.
Teacher-advisor.
They keep the cadets from going all lord of the flies on us.
Hired a replacement, but he's not due for a week.
I'm shorthanded.
Sir... respectfully,
I'm probably the last guy you're looking for.
Guys like you get dropped into the ass end of nowhere.
You can handle 30 adolescents for a week.
Good news.
You're in.
And what's the bad news?
I'm in.
Man up, nube!
You don't want to get owned.
Stop crying about your internet connection, and learn to play.
I got to e.f.k., man.
Martin Bedell?
Yes?
Come on, let's go.
Hurry up!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Drive.
You good?
You okay?
Seatbelt.
Who is that man?
He should be dead.
How come he's not dead?
And where's my mom?
No more questions.
Your mother's current location is unknown.
That man is a cyborg sent to kill you.
Cameron!
Get your seatbelt on.
I don't care about the reports, Mr. Nelson,
I know what they say.
What I don't know is...what really happened.
People who wrote that report are bureaucrats.
You know what bureaucrats do when the facts... don't fit their little checkboxes?
Ignore them.
Or change them.
So this valve supposedly blew open because of metal fatigue?
Sure.
Okay.
Not likely, but let's grant mother nature that one.
So how in the hell did it force itself closed?
Okay.
How strong do you have to be, to force it open and push it back?
On a scale of one to ten?
Superman.
Report says this damage was caused by a transformer explosion.
You want to see what the security tapes say?
There are no tapes.
-They're gone.
-That they are.
And who took those?
Carl Greenway, on the way to hanging himself?
Those mystery employees who shut the reactor down?
You ask the same questions I would.
Putting together a report for the NRC.
They're going to crawl up this place's ass with a wire brush.
It's going to play hell with the schedule.
Schedule?
What schedule is that?
August 2009.
New automated system comes online... and we're back in business.
That's what they say.
Of course, that ain't going to happen if the feds are on a war path.
-You jammed?
-Yeah.
You know sports?
Like wrestling?
No, it's a mnemonic.
Sports.
S-P-O-R-T-S.
May I?
All right.
So you want to slap.
Pull.
Observe.
Release.
Tap.
Shoot.
All right.
Thanks, plebe.
You're welcome, I think.
Baum.
I'm cadet captain Martin Bedell.
Commandant asked me to keep an eye on you.
Prep you for O.C.C.
What's this?
It's a merit... for squaring away Pyle.
And that's a demerit.
Next time you have a problem, flag down a senior cadet or an instructor.
You run, Baum?
I love to run.
You look ate up.
Oh, no.
This is great.
Yeah.
Imagine how it's going to be with a marine D.I. screaming at you.
Like everything's life and death.
I can imagine.
That the new tac?
Good ambush point.
In case you're looking for one.
Or in case you choose to jog in the woods.
By yourself.
You should be careful.
Of that, too.
It's tar.
La brea.
It's everywhere.
That stuff smells terrible.
It smells like--
Jet fuel.
So...
You're out here jogging, in the open,
Exposed, with...
Bedell.
I've heard a lot about you.
A lot of good, I hope, sir.
Lot of good.
So when do I get to call my mom?
When it's safe.
When's that?
Soon.
Do you do this every night?
Yeah.
Well, what happens when you go to sleep?
She happens.
Let's find you something to wear for bed.
Something in here should fit you.
Try these.
This is too small.
How do you know?
Just try them.
They're for a five-year-old.
How 'bout this?
Uh, that's for playing soccer.
Uh, this isn't your stuff.
Is it?
No.
It's not our stuff.
I want to call my mom.
She was supposed to get me a book.
For my book report.
If you call your mother, that man will use her to find you.
Then he'll kill her.
He'll kill you.
Uh, Cameron.
Would you like a bedtime story?
We made a tactical error.
We should have engaged the triple-eight.
With a little boy in the crossfire?
The boy is not important.
He is not our mission.
He is now.
It's just a meet and greet, sir.
Say hi.
Ask them how they're holding up.
Then company dismissed.
It's easy.
Oh, they're probably going to want to ask you about O.C.C. prep weekend.
We take the juniors through field exercises.
Obstacle courses, simulated missions.
Running around in the woods, you know?
It'll be fun.
Fun.
Hi, I'm lieutenant Baum.
I'm your new tac.
So I've been told... that my job is to make sure that you're all doing okay.
Well, you all look okay to me.
So, um...
Any questions?
All right, then.
Sir.
We heard you were in the war.
Heard you seen action.
Yeah.
Yeah, I've seen action in the war.
Got a lot of kills?
Say again?
Kills, sir.
I want to go infantry as soon as I get out of here.
Maybe Rangers.
Maybe Delta.
Best of the best.
Best of the best.
Counting kills.
Like it's a game.
Like it's just a game.
I remember one particularly fun day.
A guy in my squad... got his stomach blasted open in a fire fight.
He spent six hours holding his own guts in.
His buddy carried him on his back to the nearest aide station, just praying that someone could put the dumb son of a bitch together again.
The game, Pyle, the game is played with your buddy's life.
With the life of your squad.
Your platoon.
The game is played by you.
On behalf of the whole damn human race.
Meet my friend, the e.f.p.
He sits in the middle of the road and blows up metal.
This is his life's ambition.
I intend to help him achieve it.
We've seeded the street with these things.
We got to make sure that ogre cooperates.
Corporal Reese will take you and set up over at Lacma and the page.
When the convoy rolls to your position, open fire... on this bunker.
The ogre will think it's metal on skin and move to assist.
And when it does, boom.
Questions?
Move out.
They're kids.
They key off of you.
I know.
Your uncle...
He's an intense guy.
Yeah, I know.
He's a good guy, though.
He's just--he's a lot to take sometimes.
All that he's been through.
You know...
What are you supposed to say to that?
You mean, how do you measure up?
Every man in my family, going back five generations, has been a general or statesman,
CEO, something amazing.
They all went here.
But you know what the best part about Presidio Alto is?
The cross-country course.
You know, sometimes when I'm out there-- when I'm all alone, and I'm going flat-out-- everything just, sort of, falls away.
But sometimes, I wish that...
Wish you could just keep on running and never look back.
I met this girl over the summer.
Her name is Alicia.
She's amazing, dude.
She started at Dartmouth this year.
She's a runner like me.
She's coming home in a couple of weeks.
When she goes back,
I think I want to go with her... and never look back.
That's a secret, Baum.
You treat it as such.
I always do.
I was just on the roof.
There's flat terrain all around, but, uh, the woods are a problem.
When the triple-eight comes, that's where it'll come from.
You're alone and exposed here.
It's not good.
And you're going to tell me I know better.
Bedell is quitting.
Leaving school.
No, he isn't.
He won't.
Well, he is.
He doesn't.
He graduates.
Goes to West Point.
Why?
Because the future already happened, and... he's just going through the motions?
He doesn't have a choice?
He's got a choice.
We've just got to help him make the right one.
Like everybody does with me.
There are three exits within 20 meters, two of them lead to a parking lot.
There's a black hatchback, three cars with the doors unlocked, and the keys above the visor.
I do know better.
We're begging you.
Be merciful and keep our son safe.
Marty, if you can hear this,
We're going to get you back.
-Your dad and I love--
-Turn that off!
What the hell were you thinking, letting him watch that?
He wanted to see his mother.
You all right?
I told you people.
And I told you I had to get it done by Monday.
And it's Friday already.
And I haven't even started, and I'm already in trouble,
And when you don't do it, the teacher makes you stand up in front of the whole class!
Marty, slow down.
You're hyperventilating.
There.
Take a breath.
Tell me what this is about.
I told you.
My book report.
Book report?
Yeah.
It's due by Monday.
And I haven't even picked out a book yet.
Don't you listen?
Let's find you one.
There's got to be something for you somewhere.
It was John's favorite.
Who's John?
The machine won't stop.
He'll go back to that kid's house, find his parents, find his mom.
I would.
The police'll be there by now.
Police won't matter.
I know.
You don't need to be here.
There are other places to be.
You want me to protect his parents?
I want you to keep this contained.
Something you need, officer?
Good eye.
Job requirement.
Right.
Private sector.
Looking into the plant accident.
When Carl Greenway went nuts?
Yeah.
When Carl Greenway went nuts.
I understand he used to come in here.
They all do.
Including Carl.
Sit right where you're sitting.
Drink alone.
Drink a lot?
Tonic water.
Like you, I bet.
Was he alone like me?
Pretty much every night.
I don't know why the guy came in here at all.
Still, I do remember some hottie chatting him up at the bar the night before everything went down at the power plant.
Probably one of Sandy's friends.
Sandra runs H.R. at the plant.
Her birthday party that night,
I got pictures.
May I?
Find who you're looking for?
Actually, quite the opposite.
These going to kill it?
No, a speed bump.
That's all.
Now, this...
Raufoss.
Mark 211 round.
Tungsten core, armor piercing.
High explosive incendiary.
Hits with the force of a 20 millimeter cannon.
Saw your dad take down an h-k with one of those.
He liked it better than his plasma rifle.
So this is going to kill it.
It'll make it stop.
Reconsider its life choices.
That soldier...
The one you talked about in your story.
My dad carried him to that aid station, didn't he?
Yeah.
He spent a whole night in the bunker, trying to get the blood out of his fatigues.
You know what's funny?
I saw a deer the other day.
It made me think of him.
We were together the last time I saw one.
Before Judgment Day?
No.
After.
We were up in Griffith Park, hunting for food.
It was a big bastard too.
Your dad had never seen one before.
I mean, not like that.
After I killed it and we got close...
Your dad started crying.
You know, more than I'd ever heard or seen him.
I didn't know how to make him stop.
I buried the deer.
We went hungry.
He was just a boy.
So were you.
Yep.
I guess I was.
You see how the metal is twisted?
You can have the Steelers' entire offensive line... tugging' on that valve... and not generate enough force to do that.
So you agree it was a machine, as I thought.
Two machines.
One machine ripped the valve open, and I'm guessing... the other closed it.
And I'm pretty sure there was a fight between them.
Two machines.
This is new.
Where did they come from?
Why did they fight?
Um, I wish I knew.
I wish any of this made sense.
I do know I'm not the only one asking questions.
The plant manager, Nelson...
He wants the NRC to investigate.
It'll be a nightmare.
That will complicate our respective goals, won't it, James?
What would those respective goals be?
I'd like my company to lead the world into the next century.
And I'm fairly sure you're an avenging angel.
So let's keep looking... before the nightmare begins.
Last one.
Hey, it's for my heart.
You never heard of the french paradox?
Those frogs eat foie gras, and gargle red wine.
They live till they're 90.
Yeah, but it's the chemicals in the grape skins that do it.
Well, uh...
Bonjour.
Resvera...something.
I saw it on 60 minutes.
You don't say.
You're so beautiful.
Sorry, Alicia.
That's never happened before.
Don't worry, sweetie.
I bet that never happened before, either.
The FBI has moved Marty's parents.
And the triple-eight?
He's made no attempt to acquire them.
So what would you do now?
In your professional robot opinion.
Marty's trail has gone cold.
I'd switch targets to the other Martin Bedell.
So go to the other Martin Bedell's house.
Wait for the triple-eight.
When it shows up, blow its head off.
He can put it back on.
Marty likes the crust cut off.
Here you go.
My teacher doesn't like us to pick books that have been made into movies.
She thinks we'll just cheat and watch the movie instead.
You'd be in big trouble if you did.
The movie is pretty different than the book.
Really?
How?
Well, the slippers aren't ruby.
They're silver.
And there are two good witches, not one.
And Dorothy's not 16, she's nearer your age.
Smart and brave.
If that guy finds me, he's really going to kill me.
He won't touch you.
I promise.
Baum.
How are you holding up?
Shouldn't you be digging a tunnel outta here or something?
I'm not just going to skip out on my buddies.
I owe them this much.
Not everybody gets to run away, you know.
Pick up the pace, Baum.
I'm not going to carry you up this hill.
Triple-eight has been to that kid's house.
It knows about the school.
It has his picture.
How long?
Cameron says two, maybe three hours.
She's on her way.
You told me, throw that kid in a hole.
Babysit.
Nothing complicated.
It won't touch him.
I won't let it.
You'd better not.
'cause if you do, pray that triple-eight gets to you before I do.
Is, uh-- is everything okay?
Everything's fine.
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't--
I didn't mean this.
This was never the plan, ever.
What was the plan?
I don't know.
You can't always have one.
Not all the time.
Sometimes you just do.
And I did.
To you.
Well...
You saved my life, right?
So... good plan.
Thank you.
I said thank you.
I know.
I just...
I haven't heard that in...
I haven't heard that.
You're welcome?
Say it.
You're welcome.
Now say, "Marty... let me help you with your book report."
I can't call my mom and...
You're not doing anything.
So...
Thank you, Marty.
You're welcome.
Tonight's exercise is a rescue extraction.
Meet old Fred.
He weighs about 75 pounds, and needs to be carried from place to place.
This is his life's ambition.
And I intend to help him--
Forget that!
All eyes on me.
Seniors...
Get your people online.
Ten meter spacing.
Eyes up.
What about the obstacle course?
New exercise.
A guy with a gun is going to come through here.
Do not initiate contact.
Not even for laughs.
Are we clear?
You see him, you send a hand signal up the line.
If I see that hand signal before I see our infiltrator, you win.
Exercise over.
And where will you be?
Looking for that hand signal.
You're with me.
You too.
Those are detonators.
Claymore simulators.
Here, here, and here.
Now you wait for the signal.
You watch for me to lead the infiltrator past this line.
When he enters the kill zone, you hit the detonator, simulators go off.
End of story.
We go home.
Wait, sir.
The last-minute change of mission?
Pre-positioned equipment?
Claymore simulators?
What?
We're not having fun?
Aw, son of a bitch!
No, no, no, no!
Aw!
Got to be a little more specific.
Straight shot from one of the kids must've.
Must've hit one of the f-p's.
It's set them all off, it's a chain reaction.
We're just swinging in the wind.
Where's the ogre?
It's coming to kill us all.
Where the hell do you think it is?
Where is the tank?
About a block away.
Moving towards us.
There's no way we've got enough powder to kill it.
I'm going to lay down some covering fire.
Maybe drop a couple endos.
That'll give Kyle enough time to get back.
Reese...
We can kill that ogre.
We got one more magic bullet.
We just got to get it out there.
The emerald city was soon left far behind.
As they advanced, the ground became rougher and hillier.
For there were no farms nor houses in this country of the west.
Before night,
Dorothy, and Toto, and the lion lay down upon the grass and fell asleep, with the woodman and the scarecrow keeping watch.
Now, the wicked witch had but one eye, yet she could see everywhere.
She saw Dorothy lying asleep, with her friends all about her.
The wicked witch looked out with her one eye, she said to the king crow,
'Fly at once to those strangers, 'peck out their eyes, 'tear them to pieces.'
The wild crows flew in one great flock, toward Dorothy and her companions.
When the little girl saw them coming, she was afraid.
Come here.
But the scarecrow said,
'This is my battle, 'lie down beside me and you will not be harmed.'
Hey!
Look over here!
It's me!
Connor!
John Connor!
The witch got into a terrible rage.
She couldn't understand how all her plans to destroy the strangers had failed.
There was only one way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends.
Want me to read for awhile?
The sky darkened and a low rumbling sound was heard in the air.
There was a rushing of many wings, a great chattering and laughing, and the sun came out of the dark sky to show the witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys.
'Go to the strangers and destroy them all,' said the wicked witch.
But Dorothy they did not harm at all.
Careful and gently, they lifted Dorothy in their arms and carried her to the witch.
The witch looked into the child's eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them was, and that she did not know of her wonderful power.
The witch said to Dorothy,
'Come with me;
'for if you do not, I will make an end of you.'
The little girl grew angry.
'You are a wicked creature!
' she cried.
In her anger, she picked up a bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the witch, wetting her from head to foot.
The witch gave a cry of fear.
As Dorothy looked in wonder, the witch began to shrink away.
'See what you have done!
' the witch screamed.
'I shall melt away.'
With these words, she fell into a melted shapeless mess.
The wicked witch had come to an end.
Being at last free to do as she chose,
Dorothy ran, no longer a prisoner in a strange land.
Six stops down, there's a pay phone to call your mom.
You got your money?
If you get into trouble, you call me.
Say "book report" and I'll come.
Whatever it is, I'll come.
Are you a spy?
No, I'm not a spy.
Are you a mom?
Yeah, I'm a mom.
You kind of suck at it.
I know.
I'm working on it.
Let's catch your bus.
So this...
This is what I'm supposed to do?
Stay here, graduate, go to West Point?
Like I don't know the end of the world is coming?
Like any of this-- any of it really matters?
It does matter.
It all matters.
You believe that?
I've got to.
I'll see you around, Connor.
Yeah.
I guess you will.
Sometimes I wish...
I could just wake up from all this.
Like from a dream.
But I can't, can I?
You want to know what happened... to Bedell-- what really happened?
I don't know, do I?
Guess it depends on who I'm talking to.
John Baum or John Connor.
Baum is just a name.
I'll go.
Reese, I run faster than you.
You run like a duck.
You'll never make it.
He's my brother.
You want to save Kyle, or die trying?
Give me the damn e.f.p.
Please.
I want to take this one.
Run like hell, okay?
Bedell, you run like hell.
When this thing goes off, you pop those wagons.
You get those people out.
Don't be a hero.
Go!
And he ran.
He ran so fast.
Fast enough to get to that tank before it got to Kyle's position.
Fast enough to blow it sky-high.
We rescued 40 prisoners that day.
One of them was John Connor.
Martin was always a great runner.
But no one...
No one could outrun a blast like that.
He died, John.
He died for you.
We all die for you.
You're not nice like this!
Scratchy, isn't it?
How about us?
- No!
You are all my children.
What's the matter?
Troubles?
Nothing but troubles with the Prussians!
Karl, show it to him.
Thank you.
- No way!
I don't mind.
I'm not that soft.
Washing up is nothing for soldiers.
Hadau, right?
Love me now!
- Love...
I don't think about that.
- What did she say now?
- That you're an idiot.
Idiot?
- That's you?
- She thinks it's a compliment.
This lady is gonna be my bride for the next half hour.
Watch out!
You're spilling all that coffee, you childish buggers!
Don't mess it up!
Do you want to drink pure water?
At last some coffee.
For grandpa.
Oh, that's good, it's hot.
Give me some of that negro-sweat!
Don't cry.
Here's your coffee.
- Just in time old friend.
- That's love.
I'm hot for you.
Ouch, she is strong!
Frollein, leave him alone.
These Bavarians are no good.
Well, we'll see.
Let's have a go.
- I'm gonna give it to her.
- Well, do it if you have the guts!
OK.
- Let's go.
Behave yourself, Bruno.
Bazi will make it.
I bet six points for Bruno.
Kick him in the ass.
Ouch!
- Grandpa...
- Celler!
Get cover!
What's happening out here?
18... 20... 23...
- Pass. - 24...
- Me too.
- 27...
- Yes.
- Pass.
Ouch, that was warm rain, you rogue.
You have a trump.
Bumbum, miss.
Impolite your fellow countryman.
Pas galant.
Oh, my God.
This war...
This stupid killing.
I'm going to die for fear.
Don't shake, we're safe here.
No fear.
I'm here with you.
With you...
Oh, how kind are you, Monsieur.
Good Sir...
I love you.
Christ, that's some hole.
When he falls on his head, and can recite the last sentence.
Another one, I go.
There sure is.
Step in, great quarter.
Fire proof guaranteed.
Gentlemen, doesn't cost you a dime.
Half price for the army and free for girls!
Get ready for.
Kiss my arse.
So what?
- Hello, somebody here?
- What's the matter?
Here we go again with this filthy business.
Is this mess starting up again?
Crazy, just when I have a flush in hand!
Christ!
Don't break your neck, there's enough time to die in battle.
Where's the student?
Student?
I must be going.
Don't go away...
Stay with me.
Squad leaders report.
I'll be back.
Damn it!
The student!
Stop!
First selection line up!
Second selection line up!
Third selection line up!
First squad line up.

Open fire.
Wake me up when the time has come.
Alarm!
Everybody out.
Attack!
- God, what's happening?
- The gas-mask.
Quick, they gonna suffocate down there.
There won't be many left.
That was a direct hit.
Out.
Hell!
Are you mad?
We don't have enough oxygen in here.
Support the ceiling, it's coming down.
Quick!
Hurry up!
Don't give in.
That must have come from this side.
Damn it!
Our own artillery.
Fire to the front!
What's wrong?
Shit!
Messenger, quick!
The artillery shoots at their own position.
Direct hit of the artillery, observation.
Messenger!
Battle orderly over to the flanking division!
They shoot too short.
Medical orderly.
Can't...
Can't you breathe either?
I'm finished.
Hello?
Karl?
Here is water.
Help!
The messenger dog.
Good boy.
Messenger, go!
My God!
I can't take this!
What's the matter?
The front ditch is lost.
Lads, are you mad?
!
Voluntary messenger go to the regimental headquarters.
Voluntary messenger!
Are you mad?
Not quite.
I go.
Over to the regimetnal battle HQ.
Children, let's go down to the dug-outs.
- What's wrong, August?
- Nothing.
Corporal Richter.
- Yes?
What's happening with the message?
It's still not ready.
All linemen are away.
There is nothing we can do, colonel.
General, all the lines to the tunnel are shot to pieces.
Messenger...
Third Company.
Divisional artillery commander.
My God, major!
They shoot my regiment to pieces!
The firing-line's too short!
Change.
They have to lengthen the shot.
Got it?
- Messenger.
A message from the dug-out.
Silence.
Yes, I put you through to the colonel.
Captain Wolzon.
Yes?
What's wrong with your line?
Now, eat your fill.
Thanks.
- Bezincourt?
- Straight ahead.
They got him.
Oh, monsieur Georges.
Did you have an accident?
Is the student back?
- No.
Terrible losses... in one night.
The men?
Repair the tunnels.
How is the morale?
The soldiers on leave are back.
Who's turn is it?
Karl.
Hello, Karl should come!
You know...
I don't like sending people on leave.
When they are back, they spoil the spirit out here.
I know they tell them... they've been starving back home.
Stop!
Don't go.
I can't let my comrades win this war all by themselves.
What disaster, this war!
All people are crazy.
Stay here.
Christ...
Your battalion is lined up.
Well?
And you?
Is that the fifth?
The field-gerdarme.
That's the fifth, right?
That's where somebody deserted last week.
They got him tonight.
Okay.
The orderly-room is across the road.
The guy will be handed over this afternoon.
Get your guns ready.
Thanks a lot, mate.
All the best.
Are you leaving?
I've got leave to go home!
Lucky man.
Boy!
In Brussels station you can buy as much sausage as you like butter and beer.
- And one liter brandy.
I'll get the lot, the gonna be stunned back home.
Mine still locks like a young girl...
Can't wait to have someone to cuddle again.
Life looks quite different in the morning.
You don't know what it means.
You don't have a girl.
Yes, I have.
Since last night.
Good evening!
Dear comrades, let me introduce you our much beloved...
"Forget-me-not!"
Today I wear my cutest dress.
I just feel like it.
Just take a look
The front side is simply delicate.
And even the posterior side has something for the audience.
Fanfare!
It's May and I am there and all now shout:
Veronika, yes!
When the little daisies bloom
Violets and mignonettes
You have to kneel in front of me and talk to me of love!
And how aroused you'll be when I passionately will look into your blue eyes!
When the little daisies bloom
I will be your wife!
No night can ever be so fine as any day in May.
When he'll see me in the light of day no doubt, it will wet his appetite.
And I blow, lovestruck and harsh, already in secret the wedding march!
Fanfare!
Tara!
Chi-boom tara!
And all now shout:
Veronika, yes!
When the little daisies bloom violets and mignonettes
You have to kneel in front of me and talk to me of love!
When the little daisies bloom
You will be my bride!
- Boys, that's quite something...
- Hot stuff?
You know how to live at the Front you got the hang of it.
Look at that.
Give me fire.
That's some...
Christ!
Shut up, you!
Who are you?
Replacement battalion.
You think you're getting a bargain?
That's how it is here.
It's always the same.
So what, that's great.
Just wait...
It's not the same in the trenches.
Quiet!
Hello!
Hey!
Stop for a moment, will you?
What is this?
It's my turn now!
Again!
Have you ever seen something like that?
I'll play alone.
A little bit...
- No, I want to play, too.
- You?
- Yes.
Ah, then we'll both play.
Well, good.
He fell down!
He can't even sit on a chair!
- Can we play together?
- Play together?
Let's play it once more.
Good, let's play it once more.
- Now come on, come on, play!
- Yes, yes, I'll play.
- Come on!
I was only joking!
- Joking?
Come on, now.
We'll play something else.
Let's play another piece.
Hello!
What's it like out there?
We will stick it out.
When are you getting to Paris?
Why don't you drop in our regular haunt?
What miserable existence!
You can't get anything with that money.
You have to get something on the quiet.
If not, you kick the bucket.
Can't you leave those kids at home?
They will catch a cold.
At home?
Mother works all day in the factory.
Hey, hey!
Can't you queue up like the others?
What's the matter, silly cow?
Don't push!
- Say...
Adolf?
Is he dead?
- Yes, he is.
So what?
Do you think mine is alive?
That's not reason to push.
Go back.
Get going!
Make way.
He stocked up.
- Surprised, eh?
- Of course, they live.
Wasn't that you son Karl?
Where?
- There.
I can't leave now that...
I've been waiting here all morning.
Do you?
Go on kissing.
Go on.
Go on kissing!
Why aren't you kissing?
Take the blanket off.
Do it!
One-two...
An order for line up?
Who's that?
You?
You too?
Tomorrow morning.
Now...
Get out!
I'm dog tired.
Like the pickled herring...
All gone since yesterday morning.
It's terrible what they do with us.
It's not my fault.
Forget it and make some coffee.
SOLD OUT
Is he really coming?
But...
What's the matter?
Mother!
Karl!
It's really you?
That's all for you.
What's the matter with you?
It would have been better to stay out there.
Don't say thing like that.
What's wrong?
Oh, mother...
It's not my fault.
These are hard times.
The butcher Willi from downstairs.
Sometimes he brings me something...
You know mother how it is.
From what should we live?
Of course, the people out there don't have a clue.
If somebody is hungry, the others are too.
They stick together.
All for one...
Take the coffee.
But what a woman do all by herself in this terrible town.
All alone.
Stay with us and have some coffee.
How was it?
Everything's OK.
But it goes too long.
I already have some.
Try...
It tastes good.
From a place in Vaudin for three Mark fifty.
My friend, the student, he got himself a girl.
What did your friend do?
He'll marry her.
I've heard everything in the corridor.
Make his bed.
You've been away from home too long.
Exactly eighteen months and nine days.
One shouldn't leave the women by themselves that long.
No one shouldn't.
Is it my fault?
Is it anyone's fault, Karl?
Are you coming tomorrow to have lunch with me?
We are all in trouble, mother.
Tell me something nice.
Leave me alone.
Why don't you make peace out there?
Hark!
What stirs in the castle now?
What do my black ears perceive?
Is it just a deer in the vale that I hear?
And overhead the roaring waterfall.
Hush!
What is approaching the castle?
A horseman descends from his steed.
Knocks already at the gate.
"Oh, Good God!
It's my son!"
"Where then is mine mother...
The twelfth.
...who so heartily wept for me?"
"Thine mother, she was kind, who rests now in the earth."
Thereupon the son took the sword, and stabbed it in his father's heart.
"Oh, son...
Oh, son...
Do spare me.
Your mother died for thee."
Then, once more he took the sword, and stabbed it into his own heart.
Deserted lies now the house and yard.
Everything rests in the graveyard.
To whom are you writing?
I'm writing to mother.
You blockhead.
Dear homeland, all hail.
In the distance, all hail you.
All hail from afar.
Dear homeland, all hail.
Next shift to the sap-trench.
Come on.
Quick!
A grenade, take cover!
Watch out!
Comrades!
Christ, they hit Fritz.
Ambulance.
Children, we get five of them back.
Hurry up!
The gas!
I've got to leave at 10:30 then I'll just about make it.
There's some coffee left.
I can get it refilled on the way.
You seem happy...
Yes, I really look forward to that trench.
In three minutes.
To the student and the other comrades...
Funny, isn't it?
I guess if you are together for so long in that ditch...
Forgive me.
Sometimes I'm surprised myself.
You have behaved just like you were made of stone.
That I have been so damn lucky.
If you had told me off at least.
Can you fasten it?
But I can't talk to you about it.
Now, we are set again for the trench.
Now...
Good-bye.
Are you leaving like this what can I do?
I'm a human being.
I'm your wife!
Leave it...
It's got to be.
You can't go like this!
There's no time.
Don't cry, it's no use.
Come, come, come.
They should be grateful to us.
If this continues, there won't be a soul left in two weeks.
Don't go, wait!
What's the matter with you, girl?
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go away.
Where is my friend, the student?
Yes, I tell him.
Let's go.
Tell him...
I'm Bayaume.
I wait for Monsieur Otto.
He must write, tell him.
À Bayaume.
You understand?
To the depot.
Since midnight heavy devastating fire on the whole section.
One moment, Major.
Where are they shooting at now?
- To the back, lieuntenant.
- To the back, Major.
Yes!
It's none of your business.
They are trasmitting over the entire division quarters.
That doesn't matter if these gentlemen get their share.
Karl is back!
Hello, you look very smart.
How was it at home?
- How should it have been?
- That's very nice of you to have come back just when this mess starts again.
- Is the lieutenant here?
- On the phone.
Since when are you in trouble?
Third day.
Yes, Major.
Major, I repeat.
All the information confirm our assumption that the enemy will assume the offensive this morning.
Yes, Sir.
Do you hear?
That's fine with me.
We fire right to the back let them have it.
The General himself?
At your orders, General!
If I'm alone in the dug-out?
Straight away!
Make a move.
- Hello August.
- Hi Karl.
No, no.
Later.
Where's the student?
Heads down!
Where's the student?
Out there.
Since when?
Since last week.
That's him!
No, that's a Frenchman.
Listen how he screams.
He has been screaming like that for two days.
But nobody can go there.
I go.
- Don't go, it's a Frenchman.
They can get them themselves.
And what if it's the student?
But, I have seen him...
I crawled past him when I was on patrol.
Where did he get hit?
Nowhere...
He lies in the water.
I can't take this.
But listen...
He'll stop.
- I get him today.
- Save your skin, for God sake.
Can't you hear what's going on?
We can't let him rot away out there.
Look out, the lieutenant.
Who's here?
Reporting back.
Oh, it's you.
Four reliable men have to go to the front.
They'll have to entrench in front of the wire entanglement.
I'll send an MG later on.
It's important to attack the French in the flank.
Who volunteers?
Me.
Lieutenant.
I already thought of you.
Now you can show how beneficial your leave at home has been.
Who is going with him?
Can I choose some guys?
Are you coming?
What can I do...
I just have to.
I can't let you go by yourself.
God...
The student.
God!
Pull yourself together.
We're supposed to be heroes.
If we were heroes, we would be at home by now.
Watch out!
Go!
They are coming.
Pull the pins, for God's sake.
Go, there's gas!
Yes...
Your Majesty.
I'm blind!
I'm blind!
Kill me.
Get them out first.
There is no more room down there.
I have no more legs!
But you have arms.
Think of your girl.
Towel.
Gloves.
Start with the narcosis.
Instrument.
Swab.
Where is the student?
Say something nice, for God's sake.
I'm your wife.
Be quiet my child...
I come back to you.
It's not my fault.
Forgive me.
We are all in trouble.
All alone?
I know, I know, not you.
All this.
It's... everyone's fault.
I can't go on.
Cigarette!
I've got five children at home.
Narcosis.
There are no more narcotics.
I wanna go home.
I'm...
Comrade.
No enemy.
Water.
THE END?

Saint Vaclav
A film epopee consisting of a prologue and 10 parts
Prologue
Since ages ago, a mighty tribe of Czechs has lived in a beautiful and fertile country
Cultivating the land making decisions in harmony, like a family and worshipping their gods.
At the dawn of history, within the walls of the mighty castle Velehrad the seat of Svatopluk, Czech prince Borivoj and his wife Ludmila have accepted Christianity from the hands of the holy man Metodej.
A human lifetime later, the forests on Czech borders were brigtened with the voice of the hunters...
Drahomir, from the tribe of the pagan Polabans.
Vratislav, son of the widow princess Ludmila.
"You missed."
"Straight into the heart."
Chieftin Sker hated the power of the ruling Premysl family, even though he pretended to be a friend of Vratislav
"She will be mine!"
Soon, Vratislav has married Drahomir and made her a princess with a silent agreement of his mother, princess Ludmila.
"Bless the people!"
Expecting the heir of the principate.
"O Czechs, behold your future prince!"
"A bad sign!"
This is how Vaclav was born in the Premysl family
A feast in the castle
"Long live the princess!"
"Which one, you fool?"
"Drahomir!"
Vaclav grew older...
In Budec he was raised a Christian
After coming back, Vaclav, the firstborn, was blessed by the princes and dukes from the neighbourhood
Boleslav, Vaclav's younger brother
Pribyslava, his sister
Radmila was a bright, shining opposite of her father, chieftain Sker
"Can you see the future prince, boy?"
Prince Vratislav, the father of Vaclav, has died prematurely and Drahomir became the ruler of the country.
"Men!
This courier brings a message about the violent acts of Radslav, the prince of Zlicans..."
"Let's punish Radslav with our swords!"
Kosvan, the leader of the army of the Prague castle.
"A prince should decide about a war!"
"Him?
He's amongst his monks again."
"Quiet, you shameless man.
He's at his father's grave."
"Who calls for a war, a war that kills people?"
"I decide..."
"...and put Hnevsa in charge of the troops."
"My daughter, you have no right to usurp the power of the prince..."
"Do you want us to fall in the hands of the conqueror like sheep?"
"I just want the Czech prince to rule himself and decide for war or peace..."
"We shall not deny help to our oppressed brothers"
"I will lead you!"
Chieftain Radslav of the Zlicans is robbing across the country
Vaclav and his army get ready for a fight.
"Radmila!"
"Oh, how much I love him..."
When the armies met,
"Hear me, Radslav!"
"Fight me alone, and whichever of us wins, shall rule both principates!"
"You have no right to sacrfice us!"
"That is why I shall fight alone, Boleslav!"
"Go home in peace.
I shall not claim your life."
"All the glory has fallen on my brother's head"
From time to time, merchant from the eastern countries have visited the Prague castle to exchange arms and clothes for the fruits of the Czech country.
Sker aimed high, for the throne of Premysl.
Like a dark shadow, he followed Drahomir and fed her hatred for Ludmila.
Every day, the poor have waited by the chapel for princess Ludmila.
"Long live our princess Ludmila!"
"Get out you riffraff!"
"Don't you know who the real princess is?"
"Leave the poor ones alone..."
"...and know that you shall not be the judge of my people."
"Are you starting arguments?"
"Do you want to insult me in front of the people?"
"I have no intensions with you.
I just want the Czechs to be ruled by the right prince..."
"Not your evil counsellors!"
In Ludmila's chamber...
"I shall leave to castle Tetin, dear Vaclav..."
"Where, far from the will of evil, I shall pray for your long and prosperous reign..."
One night at Tetin castle.
"What kind of fury is in your minds?"
"Did I not raise you like my own sons?"
"Kill, you dogs!"
The same night Vaclav, knowing not what happened, was baking offering bread with his friends.
At dawn.
"Now you are the only princess!"
And as the sun was rising...
"Boleslav!"
"They murdered princess Ludmila!"
"Grandmother...my dear..."
"I want to be alone now!"
"O Lord, may I be a rigteous judge"
"Vaclav...
I want to carry your fate and your burden with you..."
"Thank you dear Radmila"
"I want to be a servant of God and my people, alone."
"Your son, princess, is calling all the faithful"
"Forgive me, Radmila..."
"The true mother of our people, princess Ludmila, has been murdered"
"From now on, I am the prince and the ruler!"
"There is now room for you in my castle, mother!"
The fear of being punished lead Sker to further intriques.
"You will punish the murderers of Ludmila!
Do it or don't come back!"
"It's the prince's will!"
"Whatever you grab, is yours!"
"Fools!"
"Younger prince Boleslav has sworn his love to me, father!"
"Be blessed then - you, future princess!"
"In you, my daughter, I will reach my goal"
"Afrer marrying Radmila..."
"Boleslav and his faithful men left for Psov, which they got from prince Vaclav.
Meanwhile, the rising power of prince Vaclav has lead the invasive Germans to attact the Czech country.
The Bavarian Prince Arnulf was leading them and took with him Ger, son of German king Heinrich, to teach him in the art of war.
Wherever the enemy moved, warning fires of the Czechs were lit.
"Destroy the fires!"
From the Prague castle couriers have set out for help.
One of them reached Boleslav's residence.
"Why, are the angels not helping enough?"
Heroically, the Czechs have faced the larger army of the enemy.
Prince Vaclav and his faithful joined the battle.
"Czech prince is coming!"
"Ger, your time has come!"
"Arrest the prince of the Czechs!"
Vojemir and his company were defending the positions.
Tie up the prisoners!
With the wounded prince.
"My beloved..."
"...is our fight not in vain?
There are too many of them."
"Say a word, master, and we shall die for you!"
"We must live, Kosvan"
"Nor for me..."
"But for the people and the Czech country"
"Bring the imprisoned prince Ger!"
The outcome of the fight is still uncertain.
This has brought Boleslav to the Prague castle.
"You and a group of my faithful shall bear a message of peace"
"Let your king know, that the prince of the Czechs wishes neither killing nor fighting"
"Do you want to give in without a fight?"
"You are late, brother.
The battle is over"
"Your time has not come yet - sir"
In Arnulf's camp
"These are my friends"
"They bring peace in exchange for my life!"
"I accept!"
"Tell your master to come to the assembly of the princes of the empire.
There this peace shall be sealed!"
German king Heinrich I.
Opens the assembly in Qedlinburg
"The prince of the Czechs is coming"
"Bishop, give the prince the holy relics!"
"I shall deposit the relics of St.Vit in the Prague castle and in his memory I shall build a worthy church!
Meanwhile, Boleslav was building a mighty castle and a temple at Psov
In Boleslav city, all who were opposed to Vaclav were residing
"The monk at Prague castle has sentenced him, because he had married another wife"
"Why all the weapons, my husband?"
"I called all the men of Psov to get ready for the celebrations and to sanctify the chapel"
"I will go too, Boleslav"
"The cross!
You still belong to Vaclav!"
"You shall see, father, I belong to Boleslav now."
"Hail Boleslav, the proper prince of the Czechs!"
"Don't you know who calls himself prince in this country?"
"Vaclav is a priest rather than a prince !
A disgrace of the princes !"
"We want you to be the prince of the Czech country!"
"Invite Vaclav for the celebration!"
"You yourself, Sker, will accompany Vaclav to my castle!"
At night.
"You, Radmila?
So late?"
"What intrigues do your counsellors advice you?"
"Let the men act, Radmila!"
"Boleslav!
Don't hurt Vaclav!"
"You love him!"
"I think of him only in my prayers"
Day has come
"Today he comes.
Let us decide which one of us will welcome him with a sword."
"Go back, noble prince.
They are waiting for you with weapons!"
"I came here for you have invited me, brother, and..."
"...
I want you to be in charge of the country now."
"I will go to the holy city of Rome to ask for a bishop for our country."
"We want no strangers here!"
"Quiet, Hnevsa!"
"I will not be the judge today"
"As a host, accept my sword"
"You will obey the prince in everything!"
"Prepare the feast and the games!"
The glorious feast has begun.
Outside, the people were wassailing
"Today, they're pouring wine.
Tomorrow, they will pour the blood of our prince"
Sker and his company were making the visitors drunk.
"I'll take the women away."
How shall we not cry for Velehrad?
How shall we not cry for Svatopluk?
The dying prince is calling his sons
His songs, three strong young men, He orders them to tie wicker together, in a fascine, and break it
No one will break you when you stay united, Svatopluk said.
But his sons' hearts got poisoned by power
The eye of the enemy is waiting to break us, wicker by wicker, the Great Moravia is gone
"In the name of the lord, let us drink this cup of love and peace"
"Amen, our lord!"
"Amen"
"You are alive, prince?"
"I beg you, run away, save your life for your people!"
"Thank you, Radmila"
"Perhaps I shall be more useful to my country dead than alive"
"Now you are not the lord of this castle?
Is it Vaclav instead of you?"
"I will arrest the prince!"
"Vaclav!"
"I shall kill!"
Morning came.
Boleslav was awake
and so was Sker.
"He is coming!"
"Lead us, master!"
"Prince, please, run away, for they are planning your death!"
"Prepare the prayers, son!"
"Good morning, brother!
Thank you for your yesterady's hospitality"
"Today, I have something better for you"
"Do not allow the hand of God's servant to be stained by his brother's blood!"
"Let's kill all men from Prague!"
"They are killing the prince!"
"They are killing the prince!"
"They are killing the prince!"
"Forgive me!"
"Long live our only prince!"
"Mother!"
"Fall on your knees, you worm!"
"You are stronger, brother!"
"You will be the prince of the Czechs forever!"
"Forgive me!"

And a lady's writing.
Then that must come from my daughter, Anna.

By golly, that's good news all one time for old fella.
You know, Marthy,I told you I don't see my Anna since she was little girl in Sweden, 5 year old.
How old will she be now?
Oh, she must be-

-You've not seen her for 1 5 years?
-No.
I think it's better Anna live on farm.
Then she don't never know that....

She don't know father like me.
This girl will marry a sailor herself, likely.
It's in the blood.
No, by golly, she don't do that.

What are you trying to do, spill my suds for me?
Oh, what's up with you?
Ain't you a sailor yourself?

You wanna get rid of me because your kid's coming, huh?
Wanna kick me out, huh?
Well, see here, Chris.
There ain't no Swede on no boat that's man enough to get away with that.
Don't you start nothing you can't finish.
No,I don't start nothing, Marthy.
No, you don't.
You....
You're a scream.
Oh, honestly....
You're a knockout.

You don't?
Go and take a slant at yourself in the mirror.
Oh, gee.
Old squarehead, huh?
Trying to kid Marthy Owens, huh?
Oh, I'm onto the game.
I wasn't born and dragged up on no waterfront for nothing.
You thought I'd make trouble, didn't you?

Yeah, I'm leaving you flat.
There's plenty of guys on plenty of boats waiting for me.
Always was.

So cheer up, old squarehead.
I'll be out of the way before your kid gets here.
You'll be rid of me for good, and me of you.
-And good riddance to both of us.

Oh, sure.
You look all in.
Have you been on a bat?

Traveling.
Day and a half on a train.
Had to sit up all night in a dirty coach too.
I thought I'd never get here.
-Where'd you come from?
-St.
Paul, out in Minnesota.
Minnesota?
Then you're the--?
All the way from Minnesota, sure.
Say, what are you laughing at?
Me?
Oh, no.
Sure, kid.
No, l-- I was thinking of something else.
Well,I wouldn't blame you, at that.
I guessI do look rotten.
I'm just out of the hospital two weeks.
I'm gonna have another drink.
What do you say?
Will you have something on me?
Sure thing.
Thanks.
Larry?
Larry!
Little service here, please.
-Same for me.
-Oh, same here.
Sit over here.
Let's be friends, yeah?
I'm a dead stranger in this burg, you know.
-Skoal.
Here's how, huh?
-Here's luck.
Let you smoke in here, won't they?
Sure, but throw it away if you hear someone coming.
Well, ain't they fussy in this dump.
is there anything wrong with me?
You're sure looking hard enough.
I ain't gotta look very hard.
I got your number the minute you come in the room.
is that so?
Well,I got yours too, without no trouble.
You're me, 40 years from now.
That's you.
is that so?
Well,I wanna tell you straight, kiddo that Marthy Owens never--
Oh, let's cut out the scrapping.
I don't want no hard feelings with no one.
-Come on, let's shake and be friends.
-Sure.
I ain't looking for trouble either.
Let's have another, huh?
Say, don't you think you'd better go kind of easy on that stuff?
Well,I guess you're right.
I gotta meet someone too.
My old man.
I ain't seen him sinceI was a kid.
Don't even know what he looks like.
I just got a letter now and then.
This was always the only address he gave me to write him back.
He used to be a sailor.
He's a janitor of some building here.
-A janitor?
-Sure.
AndI was thinking, seeing he ain't done a thing for me in my life he might be willing to stake me with a room and eats untill could rest up.
ButI ain't expecting much from him.
Give you a kick when you're down, that's what all men do.
AndI don't suppose he'll turn out no better than the rest.
Do you hang around this dump much?
Oh, off and on.
Why, maybe you know him, my old man.
Well, it-- lt isn't old Chris, is it?
-Who, old Chris?
-Yeah, Chris Christopherson.
-That's his full name.
-That's him.
Anna Christopherson is my real name only out there,I call myself Anna Christie.
-So you know him, huh?
-Oh, I've seen him around here for years.
What kind is he?
Well, he's as fine an old guy as ever walked on two feet and that goes.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
Why, you think he'll stake me to the rest cure I'm after, then?
Surest thing you know.
Where'd you get the idea that he was a janitor?
Well, he wrote me he was himself.
He's lying.
He's a captain on a barge.
A barge?
What kind of a barge?
Well, coal, mostly.
A coal barge?
Well, well.
If that ain't a swell job to find your long-lost old man working at.
Oh, gee.
Well, that puts the kibosh on his giving me a rest.
Why?
Couldn't you live on it too?
Who, me?
On a dirty coal barge?
Well, what do you thinkI am?
Well, what do you know about a barge?
Bet you ain't never seen a barge.
That's what comes of him bringing you up inland where you'd be safe.
Say, his bringing me up, is that what he tells people?
Well,I sure like his nerve.
Why, he let them cousins keep me on the farm and work me to death like a dog.
Well, you didn't fall for that farm life, did you?
I should say not.
I had to slave for all of them.
Was all right till my mother died buti was only a poor relation, you know and they treated me worse than they dared treat a hired girl.
Oh, what a life on that farm out in Minnesota.
With them Swedes, woman-hungry.
One nightI was alone in the house and one of the sons came back.
After that,I hated them, so I'd kill them all ifI stayed sol ran away.
St. Paul.
Yeah,I overheard Chris saying as how you was in St. Paul.
-Working, he said.
-Oh, that's no lie.
I went there to work, butI was still a kid.
It's all men's fault, giving you the wrong start.
I'm just out of the hospital two weeks.
The judge gave all of us girls 30 days.
Well, the others didn't seem to mind being in the cooler much.
ButI couldn't stand it.I went nuts.
I never could stand being caged up nowhere.
I got good and sick, and they had to send me to the hospital.
And it was nice there.
I was sorry to leave it, honest.
If my old man doesn't help me it's men again.
Men all the time.
Oh, howl hate them, every mother's son of them.
Don't you?
Well, there's good ones and there's bad ones, you know.
Now, your old man, old Chris.
Oh, he's a good one, honest.
Well, he'll have to show me.
Wait till he finds out.
Well, you know, he's kind of simple.
He's got nutty notions.
You know, he thinks that--
He thinks you're working as a nurse girl in St. Paul.
You know, he thinks that-
- He means all right, honest.
He thinks the world of you.
Honest, he does.
Quit your kidding.
Well, as soon asI get rested up I'll clear out and get back to the old job in St. Paul.
Josephine Come board the ship
Long time I wait for you
-What's up?
-That's him.
-Who?
-Your old man.
Golly, Larry.
That grub, it taste good.
-ls Marthy in back?
-Sure, and another tramp with her.
That's him, you see.
He's coming in here.
Now, brace up.
Oh, hello, old Chris.
Say, listen, I'm gonna blow down to the barge and pack my duds and beat it.
She's in there.
Your Anna.
Yeah, she's just come.
She's waiting for you.
And you treat her right.
She's been sick.
Well....
So long.
Well, so long, kid.I gotta beat it.
I'll see you later.
Anna.
Hello, Father.
She told me it was you.

- It's good for see you after all them years, Anna.
Well, it's good to see you too.

Anna lilla.
Oh,I had an awful trip getting here.
I'm all in.
Had a hard time finding this place, too, you know.
I've never been in New York before, and....
I'm just out of the hospital two weeks.
You, Anna?
Oh, by golly.
But you feel better now, though, don't you?
You look little tired, that's all.
I am tired to death.
I need a long rest.
That's whyi made up my mind to come and see you.
I thought if you had a place where maybe, if you didn't mind having me I could rest up for a while.
Untill felt able to get back on the job again.
Oh,I got nice place for rest, Anna.
You rest all you want.
You don't never got to be nurse girl no more.
You stay with me, by golly.
You're really glad to see me, honest?
Oh, Anna, I'm glad more like everything for see you,I tell you.
Don't you talk no more about getting job.
You stay with me.
I don't see you for long time and I'm getting old.
I got no one in world but you and I'm going to tell you about everything and you tell me all thing what happen to you.
But not here, now.
This ain't no good place for young girlies.
Only no-good sailor fella come here for get drunk.
You come with me.
You need lie down, get a rest.
-Where are you going?
-We go onboard.
-Onboard your barge, you mean?
-Aye.
Well, nix for mine.
Do you think that's a good place for a young girl?
coal barge?
Yeah,I think, Anna.
You don't know how nice is on barge.
Tug come, he tow us out on voyage.
You got just water all around.
Sunshine, fresh air, plenty good grub for--
For make you strong, healthy girl again.
You need a rest like that.
You work too hard for young girl already.
You need vacation, eh?
Well, it sounds pretty good, to hear you tell it.
I'd sure like a trip on the water, all right.
I'll go down with you and have a look.
Maybe I'll take a chance.
Seeing America from a coal barge, that's a good one.
We go?
Wait a second.
What's the rush?
-Gee, I'm thirsty.
-Oh, I'm sorry, Anna.
What you think you like for drink?
Well, I'll take a....
Oh,I don't know, really.
What have they got here?
I don't think they got much fancy drink for young girl in this place.
Well, say, ginger ale or sarsaparilla, maybe.
Well, make it sarsaparilla.
I tell you, Anna, we celebrate, just this once because we meet after many year.
They got some good port wine.
Now, that's good for you,I think.
It ain't strong, neither.
One glass, he don't go to your head, I promise.
-All right.
I'll take port.
-I go get it.
Well, who's the blond?
That's Anna, Larry.
-Your daughter, Anna?
-Aye.
Don't you think she's pretty girl, Larry?
Sure, a peach.
You give me drink for take back.
One port wine for Anna.
She celebrate with me just this once.
Small beer for me, please.
Small beer for you?
She's reforming you already.
You bet.
I can't stand it.
I better beat it.
I take back, Larry.
Why, you look a little tired, Anna buti make you take good, long rest now.
You drink your wine.
That put new life in you.
Skoal, Anna.
You know that Swedish word?
Skoal.
I guessI know that word, all right, all right.
A bridge, Anna, it's pretty, eh?
Gives you the creeps, though.
It's like a great big spiderweb.
Oh, you're tired, you sick, Anna.
Someday, bridge, he look awfully pretty to you.
I bet your life those big buildings make you open your eyes.
Well, it scares me to think of being up so high.
I bet we look like ants to them.
I bet they can't even see us down here.
On trip back, I take you up in Woolworth Building.
There you see everything.
I've seen too much already.
You know, Anna, you was awful pretty girl.
I bet you all men see you fall in love with you, by Jiminy.
You cut that.
You talk just as they all do.
No harm your father talk that way, Anna.
Oh, fine father you are.
Like a stranger.
Why didn't you ever come out west to see me?
I'm sorry, Anna, but after your mother die I want come see you end of every voyage but whenI get money for coming west,I forget.
I get drunk and spend all money.
I don't know why, Anna, but that's the way with most sailor fella.
That old devil sea.
She make them crazy fools with her dirty tricks. ls so.
Well, it's good you got something to blame it on.
Kind of tough for me, though.
I know, Anna, I'm sorry.
But if you stay with me,I make you glad.
I make you forgive me for being no-good father.
It sounds okay with me.
I'll try anything once.
I'm glad you like it here on barge with your old father, Anna.
Who saidI like it?
Well, you change a lot in one week.
The sea air make you feel good again, eh?
Maybe.I don't know.
Four bells.
What time is that?
Six o'clock.
Funny, all this sea talk.
I'm getting onto the lingo.
Now, there's where you belong, on a real ship like that sailing all over the world.
I do that many year whenI was big fool.
Oh, rats.
Say, was all the men in our family always sailors?
Yes.
All men in our family crazy fools.
My father and my three brothers is buried at sea lost on sailboat.
Just like your brothers was drowned.
Sailor man is no good, Anna.
They don't never come home.
Don't never do nothing what good men do.
And sooner or later, that old devil, she swallow them up.
But she don't gonna got me.
No, by Jiminy, not me.
Beefing about the sea again.
Well, I'm getting sol kind of like it.
Old man?
Father.
Father!
Anna, you was scaredI got hurt.
Oh, gee,I thought you were overboard, honest.
You been sorry if that old devil, he got Chris, eh?
Why, sure.
Ain't you my father?
Oh, that's a sure thing.
You like me little, maybe?
Can the sentiment, Pa.
I'll fix you a whiskey toddy.
I'll pull off your boots first, though.
Oh, Anna, you make old fella want to cry.
Nix on the sob stuff now.
Heave, hearty!
Oh, don't go away, Anna, don't go away.
You was my little girl.
My Anna lilla.
Anna lilla.
Anna.
-Anna.
-Yes.
HereI am.
What do you want?
Why you don't come turn in, Anna?
It's late, it's after four bells.
I like this fog, honest.
It makes me feel as ifI was out of things altogether.
Fog.
That's one of the worst dirty tricks of that old devil.
Funny.I feel sort of strange tonight.
Sort of nutty as if I've been living a long, long time out here in the fog.
I don't know just how to tell you whatI mean.
But it's like I've come home from a long visit someplace andI seem to have forgotten all that's happened.
Like it didn't matter anymore.
You must think I'm off my base.
Oh, Anna,I want always make you happy.
We fool that old devil.
We sell barge.
And you and me, we live together in nice little house inland.
Inland?
You mean leave the sea?
By golly, we have a little house, just you and me and maybe sometime comes along a nice land fella.
You get married.
You have kids.
Oh, by Jiminy, that sure is a pretty picture, Anna.
Maybe.I wanna be with you but somehow I don't wanna leave the sea.
She's old devil, Anna.
Don't let her get you.
Well, ain't it natural, me loving the sea?
It's in the blood, ain't it?
I think I'm a big fool for bring you on this voyage, Anna.
Now you're talking nutty yourself.
You act as if you were scared something was gonna happen.
-Only God know that, Anna.
-Well, then, it'll be God's will like the preachers say, what does happen.
No.
That old devil, she ain't God.
Ahoy!
Ahoy!
Ahoy!
-What's that?
-Oh, that scare me for a minute.
is just some fisherman lose his course in fog.
Sound come from this side.
They come in from open sea.
Ahoy!
What's trouble?
Heave a rope when we come alongside.
-Where are you, you scut?
-This way!
Right you are.
Why don't he stay where he belongs.
Johnson, come and give a hand.
Anna, you go in cabin, get whiskey, please.
Those fellas will need a drink for fix them up.
Johnson, come here.
Give me a hand here with this fella.
-What is it, sir?
-They come in from the open sea.
-Must be sailor fellas.
-The open sea?
That old devil is doing something again, Johnson.
Three of them there.
-Did you see them there, Johnson?
-Sure, a couple of them is out.
Make fast rope there, you fella.
Right you are.
Heave away.
Come in here.
-Johnson.
-Johnson, you get that other fella there.
Right away.
Anna, get whiskey, quick.
These here sailor fellas their steamer got wrecked in storm.
Been five days in open sea.
Johnson brings another fella.
You take whiskey to him.
Take your whiskey, here.
Are these all?
I'll get whiskey inside.
Take that to the man's who's coming onboard now.
What's this tub?
Well, we're safe anyhow, with the help of God.
Sure, it's me, Matt Burke himself, dreaming again.
You drink this and you'll find it's no dream.
The devil with the drink.
But I'll be taking it anyhow.
Sure, I'm needing that.
It's fine stuff.
But it wasn't the drinkI meant whenI said, wasI dreaming.
Sure,I thought you was some mermaid out of the sea, come to torment me.
Aye, real flesh and blood, devil the less.
Cut that.
What's a fine, handsome woman the like of yourself doing on this scow?
Never you mind.
You're a great one, honest.
Starting right in kidding after what you've been through.
I'm telling you, but for the strength and guts in me, we'd be scoffed by the fishes this minute.
Gee, you hate yourself, don't you?
But you must come and lie down and go to sleep.
Lie down and sleep, is it?
But you'll not be thinking I'm a weak scut.
Sure,I could lick any man on this boat with one hand tied behind me back.
I could lick all hands on this tub one by one, tired asI am.
Ain't you the hard guy, though, huh?
But never mind that fight talk.
I'll take your word for what you say.
You're all in, own up to it.
The devill am.
Well, be stubborn, then, for alll care.
AndI must sayi don't care for your language.
The meni know don't pull rough stuff when ladies are around.
Ladies!
Let you not be making game of me.
Whisht, now, milady, it's one of your kisses I'm needing to take the tiredness from me bones.
One kiss, now.
Let go of me, you--!
Oh, gee,I was scared for a moment I'd killed you.
"Killed you," you say?
Faith, it would take more than a bit of a blow to crack my thick skull.
Glory be, you got a power of strength in them fine arms of yours.
Forget it.
I'm sorry it happened.
Only, you've no right to be getting fresh with me.
Listen, now, don't go getting any more wrong notions.
I'm on this barge because I'm making a trip with my father.
The captain is my father.
Now you know.
I'm sorry.
I'm thinking I'm not good enough to kiss the shoe soles of a fine, decent girl the like of yourself.
Will you forgive me now and let's be friends from this out?
I'm thinking I'd rather be friends with you than anything else in the world.
-Sure.
-God bless you.
It is a clumsy apeI am.
Sure, it is great powerI have in me hand and arm, andI do be forgetting it at times.
You're sure strong, all right.
Sure, it is the will of God in it that brought me safe through the storm to the one spot in the world where you was.
Think of that, now, and isn't it queer?
Anna, you get in cabin, you hear?
Who do you think you're talking to, a slave?
You need to rest, Anna.
What are you doing here, you sailor fella?
You ain't sick like others.
You get in forecastle, they give you bunk.
You hurry,I tell you.
But he's sick.
He can hardly stand up.
Look at him.
is it giving me orders you are, me bucko?
Let you look out, then.
Weak asI am, I can break you in pieces and throw you over the side, and your crew after you.
I was forgetting, you're her old man.
Sure, I'd not lift a fist to you for the world.
Come inside.
You can have my bed if there is no other place.
That's your dirty trick, old devil but you don't do that, no, not that whileI live.
Mulligan!
Sure, it is myself that's hungry.
And a pie, Matt.
Glory be, what doI care for a stew or a pie?
It's not for food I'm hungry...
-...but for the sight of your face.
-Oh, go on with your blarney, you gasbag.
Now, Matt, look what you've done.
Pick that up.
Shame on you.
Sure, her with the face of an angel and the sting of a wasp.
Oh, so it's darning you're doing.
Shut up.
You've got a voice like a foghorn.
What's this?
Well, what do you think it is?
Well, holding it up this way, it might be new underdrawers for old Chris.
-Ain't for him, though.
-Oh, ain't it, now?
-For some sweetheart?
-Maybe.
Don't make me jealous, or I'll burn it up and him in it.
-No.
Give it to me.
-You got a guilty look in your eye.
Now, you give it to me, now.
You bully.
Now....
Don't!
-Look what you've done, galoot.
-WhenI get ahold of him that wears it I'll pull out an arm and wave you goodbye with it.
Supper's almost ready.
Well, I've been hungry.
Well, asi was saying to you before....
Stand up, just to measure this sweater.
Sure,I will.
On me head or me feet?
Your feet, silly.
It is only prayer or paralysis can save you now, Anna.
Well, I'm praying, Matt.
It is a miracle if your prayers are answered.
Thanks, Matt.
It's for my father.
And him hating to stand up for measurements.
-Will you wear it for my sake?
-Oh, yeah.
It is a lie in your throat and you know it.
No, it isn't.
You made it for me with your own blessed hands.
And I'll wear it when we dock in New York and take you out for a day's fun.
Oh, no, you won't.
It won't be finished by then.
I won't go with you.
Make up your mind to that.
-Yes, you'll go with me.
-Oh, no,I won't.
-Just the two of us.
-Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes, you will.
Well, you won the capital prize, fella.
Help yourself.
Anybody else around?
Here we go, boys.
Why don't you test your lungs too, Matt.
I should test them, with the fine bellows thatI got?
Well, try it.
Faith, that's a woman's game.
Not for a husky like me.
You try it, Anna.
No, Matt.
You do it.I haven't got the wind in me that you have.
Hand it over.
Watch me.
Sure, I've air enough in me chest to blow up a balloon.
Well,I don't doubt it.
What do you mean, you don't doubt it?
I was just kidding.
I bet he goes to 40.
Oh, boy.
Step up and roll the sweet mamas out of their beds.
Make your own sweet mama jealous.
Only 25 cents to see the most enchanting scene on Coney Island.
Now there's Lily and Clytie without any nighties.
Hey, you, step right up.
Give us a good free look at the mamas in their pretty lace hootenannies.
Wanna keep us in bed all night, tightwad?
Loosen up, lads.
Give us a little tumble.
I'll bet you couldn't hit that target if you stayed until you grew a long, white beard.
-The devill couldn't.
-Come on, Matt.
Go on and try it.
Bet you can't even hit the net.
-Yeah, how about a home run, Babe Ruth?
-Sure,I dare you to.
With one throw,I could knock them dames off of their bunks.
Go to it, big boy.
Don't overlook me, carrot top.I have the shape that makes the old men young...
-...and the young men old.
-Attaboy.
-Mama wants Papa.
-Papa wants Mama.
Some mamas too.
Now somebody else.
Somebody that packs a mean right.
What we want this time is a regular he-man.
You shut up or I'll wrap you around the target.
Don't get sore, big boy.
It's a hot night.
Roll me out of the blanket.
And that be the end to the story of the whale and the grasshopper.
Oh, Matt, honest, I ain't ever laughed like this.
-You're funny.
-Sure, I'd think it was blarney if it wasn't meseIf was making you laugh.
Oh, sure, Anna, you're crazy about me, and I'm not after blaming you.
You just hate yourself, don't you, Matt?
Oyster loaf for the lady, sir.
-I ordered milk for the lady.
-Well, I've got it here.
Well, let's drink to our good health.
Here's to you.
And skoal, Matt, to you and me.
-Hot mustard, Matt?
-I don't need it.
-Pepper?
-Full of it.
-Well, here's something you do need.
-Oh, is that so, now?
Well, all right.
But if I'm needing sugar, I know where to look for that.
Oh, we're goofy, Matt.
Just like a couple of kids.
Sure, Anna, when you're in love, you ain't got the brains of a tick.
What do you mean, love?
You know whatI mean, Anna.
It's in me eye and on the tip of me tongue.
A man like me ain't given to loving a woman.
He knows too much about them.
Every color of them, from here to the China Sea.
The whole lying, cheating smear of them.
Sailors' bait.
When he comes across a girl like you, Anna that's as clean as a shell.
You're a lucky girl to be hearing such talk from the lips of Matt Burke him that the women are so crazy over.
Anna, what's come over you?
Oh, nothing.
Sure, don't lie to me, Anna.
You're as stiff as a corpse.
Hello, dearie.
-Well, I'll be--
-Well, she's a friend of mine.
Aren't you, dearie?
I'm afraidI don't remember you.
-She don't remember me.
-Of course she don't, you old scab.
-Beat it, or I'll have you thrown in the brig.
-No, Matt, maybeI do know her.
That old sea cow?
Go on, clear out of here.
You know a nice young girl never met the likes of you.
A nice young--?
A nice young-- Pure and white as a lily.
Shut up, or I'll choke the wind out of your gullet.
Oh, Matt, let her alone.
She don't mean nothing by it.
Anna.
Anna, darling.
You see what you've done?
You frightened her.
-Go on, clear out of here.
-I'm going, I'm going.
Let her alone.
Don't go.
I was lying, Matt.
I know her and she knows me.
I recognized her the minute she stepped across the room.
Shut up, kid.
You don't have to spill over for nobody.
You ain't responsible for what your old man does.
I'll tell you why she didn't want to talk to me.
Because I'm a tramp, that's why.
And her old man kicked me off the barge when she come there to live on it.
Yeah, he didn't want any old wharf rat around a nice young girl.
Well, it ain't so, though, Matt.
She's lying.
Lying, I'm ly--?
Well,I like your nerve, all right, all right.
Gee, I'm sorryI came here to speak to you.
Insulting me.
Well, can you beat it?
I'll be toddling along.
I'm glad you found yourself such a nice, friendly gent.
I hope you're happy, kid.
I'm sorryI bothered you, honest, l-- Oh, forget it, Ann.
You only got one life to live.
And it's a...of a life at that.
Say, skipper, you wouldn't stake me to a quarter, would you?
You know,I haven't had a drink in a month.
Take it and beat it.
With pleasure, captain.
Well, so long.
Be a good girl, Ann, no matter how lonesome.
Happy days.
Happy days.
The poor old devil.
SometimesI feel sorry for them.
Come on, Anna.
Don't let it get you down.
Sure, the world's full of them.
I know it's a sad sight for a decent young girl the like of yourself, darling.
What would you say, Matt, ifI told you that...?
Say what, me darling?
Tell me what.
Oh, nothing.
Sure,I know what you'll be wanting to tell me soon, if not this minute that you love me.
Don't be so sure of yourself, Matt.
I'm loving nobody.
And you'll be wanting to marry me, and maybe I'll be accepting you.
Why, Matt.
You want to marry me?
-Honest?
-Sure, I'll marry you.
Only, don't be putting me to too many tests, orl might change me mind.
I'm tired, Matt.
I wanna go back to the barge.
You-
- You think you love that sailor fella, Anna?
Well, what ifI do?
You think maybe you marry him?
No.
I'm glad you don't marry sailor, Anna.
is bad for woman.
They don't never see their men only once in long while.
You sit and wait all alone and when their boys grow up and go on sea they sit and wait some more.
Any girl marry sailor is crazy fool, I tell you.
Your mother, she tell you same thing if she was alive.
Well, that ain't whyi won't marry him.
I'm not thinking about myself but about him.
He's such a simple guy, a big kid.
AndI haven't got the heart to fool him.
You fool him?
Oh, you go crazy,I think.
I've been thinkingI was myself the last few days.
I'll be outside.
I love to watch the ships passing.
When Matt comes along, tell him whereI am, will you?
All right,I tell him.
Well, God bless who's here.
How's the world treating you this afternoon, Anna's father?
Oh, pretty good, if it ain't for some fellas.
Meaning me, do you?
Well, if you ain't the funny old crank of a man.
Where's herself?
-Where's Anna, I'm after asking you.
-She gone out to look on boat.
Well, I'll be going out to her.
But beforeI go, I'll take this chance while we're alone to have a word with you.
And that word is soon done.
I'm marrying your Anna before this day is out.
You may as well make up your mind to it, like it or no.
That's easy for saying.
You meanI won't?
is it yourself is after stopping me, do you think?
-I stop it if it come to worst.
-Sure, it isn't trouble I'm looking for.
You're her father.
Wouldn't it be a shame for us to be at each others' throats like a pair of dogs, andI married to Anna.
So out with the truth, man alive.
What is it you're holding against me at all?
I don't want my Anna for got married.
Listen, you fella.
I'm old man.
I don't see my Anna for 1 5 year.
She's alll got in the world.
You think now when she come on first trip, I want her for leave me alone again?
Sure, let you not be thinking I've no heart at all for the way you'd be feeling.
Then you do right thing, eh?
You ship away again and leave my Anna alone.
Say, big fella like you on sea, he don't need a wife.
He got new girl in every port, you know that.
Oh, shut up.
Sure, there's a time come to every man, on sea or land when he's sick of the lot of them cows, and wearing his heart out to meet up with some fine, decent girl and building a home to call his own, rearing up children in it.
Sure, Anna's the one woman in the world for me andI can't live without her now, I'm thinking.
You think I'm going let her life be made sorry by you just like her mother's was made by me?
No, she don't marry you.
Not ifI have to kill you first.
Glory be to God, what talk from a stumpy runt of a man.
It is queer fool's blather you have, about the sea done this and the sea done that.
You ought to be ashamed to be saying the like, you an old sailor.
I'm hearing a lot from you, and a lot more that Anna tells me you do be saying to her.
I'm thinking it is a poor weak thing you are.
Not a man at all.
You see if I'm man maybe quicker than you think.
You know the truth in your heart.
The sea hit you a clout once and knocked you down.
You're not man enough to get up for another, but you lie there howling murder.
I'd like to see you in the best of your youth.
-Do whatI done in the storm and after.
-Why, you young fool, you.
In old days, whenI was on windjammer I went through hundred storms worse than that.
Ships were ships then, and men what sailing them real men.
What you got on steamers now?
You got fellas on deck don't know a ship from a mud scow and below deck, you got fellas just know how to shovel coal.
You might as well work on coal wagon ashore, you.
is it throwing insults at the men in the stokehold you are, you old ape?
One of them is worth any 1 0 squareheads ever shipped on a windbag.
-You Irish swine.
-So you don't like the Irish, you old baboon?
Sure, it's that you're needing in your family.
An Irishman.
A man of the stokehold to put guts in it so you'll not be rearing up grandchildren to be jackasses like yourself.
Sure, old men getting childish shouldn't play with knives.
Faith, I've half a mind to hit you a clout will put sense in your square head.
Keep away from me, now.
Hello, Matt.
Are you here already?
Say, what's up?
How did that chair get knocked over?
Oh, Matt, you haven't been fighting with him, after you promised?
I've not laid a hand on him, Anna.
I told him to his teethI love you.
That's God's truth, and well you know it.
He tell same thing to girl in every port he goes.
I know it's true, Matt.
Don't you mind what he says.
God bless you.
And thenI saidI thought maybe you'd have a bit of love for me too.
So you told him that?
MaybeI have.
I've been wondering ifI do love you.
I didn't want to,I must own up to that.
But l--I guessI can't help it, sol guessI do.
Oh, sure,I do, Matt.
What's the use of kidding myself different?
-Sure,I love you.
-God be praised.
AndI haven't ever loved a man in my life before, never.
Faith, we'll be having a grand, beautiful life together to the end of our days.
Matt.
-Goodbye, Matt.
-Goodbye, is it?
I'll be coming at you in a second for more of the same.
Own up like a man when you're beat fair and square.
Here's me hand to you.
We'll be friends from this out.
No,I don't shake hands with you, fella.
Not whileI live.
The back of me hand to you, then, if that suits you.
It's a rotten bad loser you are, devil mend you.
No,I don't lose.
Anna said she like you little bit.
But you don't hear her say she marry you,I bet.
No, andI don't hear her say the sun is shining, either.
-No,I didn't say it, Matt.
-There, you hear?
You're waiting to be asked, you mean?
Well, I'm asking you now.
We'll be wedded this day, with the help of God.
-You heard whatI said afterI kissed you.
-I don't remember.
I said goodbye.
That kiss was for goodbye, Matt.
What do you mean?
I can't marry you.
We've said goodbye, that's all.
-I knew that was so.
-ls it making game of me you'd be?
It's a queer time to joke with me.
Don't be doing it, for the love of God.
You don't think I'd kid you now.
I'm not joking, Matt.I mean whatI say.
You don't.
You can't.
It is mad you are, I'm telling you.
-No, I'm not.
-What's come over you so sudden?
You were saying you love me.
I'll say that as often as you want me to.
It's true.
But why?
What?
What is it?
Because it's the best wayI can figure out, Matt.
I've been thinking it over and thinking it over, day and night, all week.
Oh, don't think it isn't hard on me too, Matt.
Well, will you tell me what's preventing this wedding when the two of us has love?
I'm thinking it's listening to that old fool you are him hating me, filling your ears full of lies against me.
Yes, Anna believe me, not you.
She know her old father don't lie like you.
You sit down, do you hear?
Why do you come butting in and making things worse?
You're like a devil, you are.
HereI was, beginning to like you, beginning to forget all the things...
-...
I've held up against you.
-You ain't got nothing for hold against me.
Haven't I, though?
Well, let me tell you.
Matt, I'm surprised at you.
-You didn't think anything he'd said--
-Sure, what else would it be?
Tell me, and don't keep me waiting.
I can't tell you, andI won't.
I've got a good reason, that's all you need to know.
I can't marry you, and that's all there is to it.
So for heaven's sake, let's talk of something else.
No, I'll not.
-ls it married to someone else you are?
-I should say not.
You're like them women can't make up their minds till they're drove to it.
Well, I'll make up your mind for you.
We've had enough talk.
Let's go to the other room and dress in your best.
We're going ashore.
-She don't do that.
-Where do you get that stuff?
Never mind, get on with your dressing.
-We'll see who'll win in the end, me or you.
-Stay, Anna.
She will not.
She'll do whatI say.
You've had your hold on her long enough.
-It's my turn now.
-Your turn?
What ami anyway?
Never mind what you are.
It's what you're gonna be:
Wedded to me.
Come on with your dressing.
-Don't do one thing he say!
-She will!
-I'm her father.
-She will in spite of you.
She's taking my orders from now on, not yours.
Orders is good.
Never mind now.
We've no time to be wasting.
-Do you hear what I'm telling you?
-No, stay here, Anna!
You can go to blazes, both of you.
You'd thinkI was a piece of furniture.
I'll show you.
Sit down.
Sit down, do you hear?
Let me talk for a minute.
You're all wrong, see?
I'm gonna tell you two something, and then I'm gonna beat it.
I've been meaning to turn it loose on you every time you get my goat with your crazy talk about wanting to keep me safe inland.
I wasn't going to tell you, but you've forced me into it.
Oh, what's the use?
It's all wrong anyway.
You might as well get cured this way as any other.
Don't forget what you said about it not mattering to you what reasonI got as long asI wasn't married already.
That's me word, and I'll stick to it.
You make me laugh, honest.
Wanna bet you will?
You wait and see.
You was going on as if one of you had to own me.
But nobody owns me, see, excepting myself.
I'll do whatI please.
And no man, I don't give a darn who he is can tell me what to do.
I ain't asking either of you for a living.
I'll make it myself, one way or another.
I am my own boss.
Now, put that in your pipe and smoke it.
-You and your orders.
-I wasn't meaning it that way at all and well you know it.
You've no call to raise this rumpus with me.
-lt is him, you've a right.
-I'm coming to him.
But you, you did mean it that way.
You sounded just like all the rest.
It is queer, rough talk, that, for a decent girl the like of yourself.
Decent.
Who told youI was?
I'm talking to you now.
I don't want to hear.
You go out your head,I think.
Well, living with you is enough to drive anyone off their nut.
Your bunk about the farm being so fine.
Didn'tI write you, year after year, how rotten it was and what a dirty slave them cousins made out of me?
What did you care?
Nothing.
Not even enough to come out and see me.
Your crazy stuff about wanting to keep me away from the sea don't go down with me.
You just didn't want to be bothered with me.
-Oh, that ain't so, Anna.
-But one thingi never wrote you it was one of them cousins that you think is such nice people that started me wrong.
And it was none of my fault.
I hated him and he knew it.
But he was big and strong, like you.
That's whyi ran away from the farm.
That's what made me get a job as a nurse girl in St. Paul.
You think that was a nice job for a girl, too, don't you?
With all them nice inland fellas just looking for a chance to marry me.
They weren't looking for marrying.
You don't say nothing.
Either one of you.
ButI know what you're thinking.
You're just like all the rest.
And who's to blame for it?
Me or you?
If you'd been a regular father and had me with you...
-...things would've been different.
-Don't talk that way.
-I go crazy.I won't listen to you.
-You will listen.
You, keeping me safe inland.
I was no nurse girl the last two years.
I lied whenI wrote you.
I was in a house, that's what.
Yes, that kind of a house.
The kind that sailors like Matt and you go to in port and your nice inland men too.
And all men.
I hate them,I hate them....
-Oh, it's a lie, Anna, it's a lie....
-So that's what's in it.
I suppose you remember your promise.
No other reason was to count with you as long asI wasn't married already.
You want me to get dressed and go ashore, don't you?
Oh, yes, you do.
I suppose ifI tried to tell you thatI wasn't that no more you'd believe me, wouldn't you?
And ifI told you that just getting out on this barge and being on the sea had changed me and made me feel different about things as if all that I've been through wasn't me, didn't count it was just like it never happened you'd laugh, wouldn't you?
And you'd die laughing, I'm sure, ifI told you that meeting you that funny way that night in the fog and afterwards, seeing that you were straight good stuck on me had got me to thinking for the first time in my life.
AndI sized you up as different from the ones on land, as water is from mud.
I couldn't marry you with you believing a lie.
AndI was ashamed to tell you the truth.
And now, give me a bawling-out and beat it likel can tell you're going to.
Will you believe it ifI tell you that loving you has made me clean?
It's straight goods, honest.
Oh, yes, you will.
You're just like all the rest.
The rest, is it?
My curse on you.
Clean, is it?
Oh, don't, Matt.
Get out of here.
Let me alone.
Get out of here!
I'll be going.
And I'll be drinking slews of whiskey so to wash that black kiss of yours off me lips!
And I'd be getting dead, rotten drunk so I'll not remember you at all!
I'll ship away on a boat to the end of the world, where I'll never see your face again!
-Oh, don't go.
It's better Anna marry you--
-Let go of me, you old ape!
Marry her, is it?
I'd see her dead at me feet first.
I'm shipping away out of this, I'm telling you.
My curse on you, and the curse of all the saints.
-I go ashore too.
-Not after him,I tell you.
Don't you dare.
Oh,I go for get drink.
I'm driving you to drink too, huh?
You wanna get drunk so you can forget, like him.
Aye.
You thinkI like hear them things?
Oh, Anna.
Anna,I think you wasn't that kind of girl.
You want me to beat it, don't you?
You don't want me here disgracing you,I suppose.
Oh, no, no, Anna.
You stay here.
It ain't your fault,I know that.
It's that old devil do this to me.
It was all right on barge, with just you and me.
Then she bring that Irish fellow in fog.
That fella, he don't never come, you don't never tell me them things.
I don't never know.
Then everything is all right.
Oh, that dirty devil sea.
Oh, what's the use?
Go ashore and get drunk.
You wait here, Anna?
Maybe.
Maybe not.
Maybe I'll get drunk too.
Maybe I'll.... 0h, what do you care whatI do?
Go on and beat it.
It's foggy outside.
Oh, God.
-What's the trouble?
Feeling sick?
-Inside my head feels sick.
Oh, Anna, you think maybe sometime you forgive me, Anna?
-I'll forgive you right now.
-Oh, Anna lilla.
Oh, don't bawI about it.
There ain't nothing to forgive anyway.
It ain't your fault, it ain't mine.
It ain't his, neither.
I fix everything all right for you and me, Anna.
Yes?
Then you and me will stick together?
We'll work for each other and help each other, huh?
-What is it you fixed?
-Well,I sign on steamer Londonderry.
sail for Cape Town tomorrow.
Oh, Anna,I only bring you bad luck.
That's how you fix me, is it?
Well,I think that old devil get me back maybe she leave you alone, then.
Oh, can't you see that you're doing the same thing that you've always done?
Can't you see that?
Oh, what's the use of talking?
You ain't right.
I'll never blame you anymore.
Oh, Anna.
You forgive me, sure?
SurelyI do.
You ain't to blame.
You're just what you are, like me.
And you, you let me kiss you once again, eh?
-Oh, sure, no hard feelings.
-Oh, Anna lilla.
I can't say it, Anna.
I thinkI go lie down, go to sleep.
Oh, that booze, he don't go well, Anna.
I think I'm never going to drink again.
I can't stand this much longer.
What ami waiting for, anyhow, like a darn fool?
Anna?
-Anna?
-Yes, what do you want?
Don't say it.I know what's in your mind.
Yes, that's whatI was, and that's what I'm going back to.
I'd kill you first.
And finish it up.
It's a dog's lifeI been living sinceI found out what you are.
Oh, why don't you leave me alone.
Go away.
Don't you see I'm licked?
What do you want to keep kicking me for?
Don't you deserve the worst I'd say, God forgive you?
All right, maybeI do.
But don't rub it in.
Why haven't you done what you said you were going to?
Ship away to the other side of the earth, where you don't have to see me.
-I have.
-What?
You're going away, honest?
I signed on, drunk asI was, and she's sailing tomorrow.
-Where is she going?
Far away?
-Cape Town. lt is at the end of Africa.
That's far for you.
-What's the boat's name?
-The Londonderry.
The Londonderry?
Oh, this is too much.
Faith,I don't blame you for laughing at me.
True, it is the fool of the worldI am to come back to talk to you at all.
Oh, what's the use?
What's the use of me talking?
What's the use of anything?
Anna....
Anna, ifI could only be believing I was the only man in the world ever you had love for, I could be forgetting the rest, maybe.
Are you trying to accuse me of being in love really in love, with them?
You fool, you.
I've stood enough from you.
Love them, is it?
I hated them,I tell you.
And may God strike me dead, and my mother too, if she was alive if I'm not telling you the honest truth.
Oh, sure, Anna, ifI could only be believing you, now.
Why, Matt, you've got to believe it.
What cani do?
What willl do to prove to you I'm not lying?
Anna, would you--?
Would you be willing to swear an oath, a terrible, fearful oath?
Oh, sure,I will, Matt, on anything.
Would you swear on this?
Oh, sure.
Give it to me.
It is a cross given to me by me mother, God rest her soul.
And I'm telling you, it has great power in it.
And I'm warning you now, if you swear on this it is me old woman herself who'd be looking down on you from heaven and praying the saints to put a curse on you if she hears you swear a lie.
I wouldn't have the nerve, honest, Matt, if it was a lie.
But it's the truth, andI ain't scared to swear it.
Give it to me.
What do you want me to swear?
You say it.
Swear I'm the only man in the world ever you felt love for.
I swear it.I swear it by God.
And may the blackest curse of God strike you if you're lying.
And may the blackest curse of God strike me if I'm lying.
Oh, glory be to God, I'm after believing you now.
-Now what's the matter?
-ls it Catholic you are?
-No, why?
-Oh, God pity me.
Sure, it's some devil's treachery in it.
You swearing on a Catholic cross, and you one of the others.
-Well, don't you believe me, Matt?
-Oh, but if it ain't a Catholic you are....
I ain't nothing, Matt.
What's the difference?
Didn't you hear me swear?
I'm afraidI love you, God forgive me, no matter what you are.
I'd be going mad if I'd not be having you.
I'd be killing the world.
We'll be wedded this day.
And we'll be happy, the two of us, in spite of the devil.
Well, we gotta have a drink on this, my good man.
-Blast you.
-That's the way to talk.
Oh, Matt, it's time for you two to kiss and make up.
You'll be shipmates on the Londonderry, you know.
-Shipmates?
Has himseIf--?
-Aye, and I'm boatswain on her.
The devil!
You'd be shipping away to sea and leaving her alone again, will you?
It's all right, Matt.
That's where he belongs, andI want him to go.
You've gotta go too.
We'll need the money.
And as for me being alone, why, that runs in the family and I'll get used to it.
I'll get a house somewhere and I'll make a regular place for you two to come back.
And now you'll drink and be friends, huh?
Sure.
-Here's luck to you.
-Skoal.
Well, you'll not be lonesome long.
I'll see to that, God willing.
Sure as himself will be having a grandchild riding his foot,I tell you.
-Maybe twins.
-Oh, quit your kidding.
is it any religion at all you have, you and your Anna?
Well, in the old country, we was Lutherans.
Lutherans, is it?
Oh, then I'm damned entirely.
Oh, well, what's the difference?
It is God's will anyhow.
It's queer, you and me shipping on same boat that way.
That ain't right.
It's that funny way old devil sea do her worst dirty tricks.
Aye, is so.
Faith, I'm afraid you've the right of it for once, devil take you.
Why, gee, Matt, you ain't agreeing with him, are you?
Come on.
Here's to the sea, no matter what.
Be a game sport, man.
Drink to that.
Fog, fog all time.
You can't tell where you was going.
Only that old devil sea.
She knows.
[english]
Either you're flat or I am.
I beg your pardon.
Excuse me.
Always the lady.
Say...
Say, what the...?
Why, I frighten your hiccup away, Marthy.
Yes, you did.
And I'm going to hit you.
See here.
If you soak me in the eye again I'm gonna quit you.
- You get me?
- No.
Only on the back this time, Marthy.
I get you.
- Well, I think you lose them, Marthy.
- Yes.
Yes, I did.
Oh, I got it.

Ten swallows of this without breathing and... sure cure.
One, two, three, four, five 10.
Maybe I got hiccup too, Marthy.

I told you.
It's a sure cure, never fails.
I think we got to go to Johnny the Harp for get some more whiskey.
Yeah, well.
Right you are, I'm bone dry.
Wait, I'll get my bonnet.
Johnny, he'll be surprised to see you and me together once more.
Hold that, will you?
You're not sorry you took me back, are you?
Oh, no, Marthy.
I'm darn glad I found you in Norfolk.
Aye, you been too old to go walking streets, Marthy.
Old!
But you had better stay with old Chris on the barge.
Well, I'm glad you found me.
Honest, I am.
Yeah, I'm glad to be here dump that it is.
You're a good old punk.
- Come on.
- Yeah.
Marthy.
Where are you going?
No, Marthy, no, we're in the boat, huh?
I forgot where the front door was.
- It's all right.
It's all right with me.
- That's it, Marthy.
Oh, Marthy, hold my hand.
Hold my hand.
Well, I declare.
How can you do a thing like that?
Wait a minute, now.
I'm all right.
I wasn't a tightrope walker for nothing.
See?
Oh, Marthy.
Look out.
That's what I get for being a tightrope walker.
See, that's...
Where are we?
There we are.
- We go down and get a drink.
- No, wait, hon.
Oh, the horses.
Oh, where are you?
- Here, Marthy.
- Old fool, I thought I'd lost you.
Just an old fool.
Come on.
Here we go.
Come on.
Oh, what was that?
Wait, wait.
The doors.
Stopped.
- That's not funny.
- Marthy.
- There's the entrance.
- All right wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
- Yeah.
- Listen.
You wait here, Marthy.
- I go let you in.
- Oh, all right.
"Ladies' entrance."
Well, that's a g...
Well, why not?
Said she, with all the dignity in the world.
- Well, hello, Johnny.
- Hello, Chris.
How are you?
Come and have a drink on me.
Come on, Larry.
Drinks for the house, and have one yourself.
Oh, I got money, plenty money.
Speak of the devil, Chris, we was just talking about you.
- Hello, Chris, put it there.
- Larry, give us a drink.
You got half a snootful now.
Oh, I'm a little drunk, not much.
Just feel good.
My Josephine Come board the ship
Long time I wait for you
The moon, she shines
She looks just like you
Same old Josephine, eh, Chris?
Well, you don't know good song when you hear it.
Italian fellow on other barge, he learn me that song.
Come on, get your drink.
Skoal!
- Drink hearty.
- Here's how.
- Come on, Larry, order drinks...
- No, no.
No, Chris.
Some other time.
I've gotta go home.
Where you in from this time?
Norfolk.
Oh, we make a slow voyage dirty weather, just fog.
Fog all the time.
No, no, I go, Larry.
I forget, it's Marthy.
She come with me.
What's the matter with you, you old punk?
Gonna keep me standing out there all night?
I'm sorry, Marthy.
Just I talk with Johnny.
What you think you like for drink, whiskey?
Well, I'll take a scoop of lager and ale for a chaser.
I go bring back for you, Marthy.
Lager and ale for Marthy, Larry.
Whiskey for me.
Right you are.
By the way, Chris, we've got a letter for you from St. Paul, Minnesota.
And a lady's writing.
Then that must come from my daughter, Anna.
She living there.
I don't get letter from Anna, must be year.
That's a fine fairy tale, your daughter.
Sure, I'll bet it's from some skirt.
Oh, no, this come from Anna.
I see...
By golly, I think I'm too drunk to read that letter from Anna.
I think I go sit down for minute.
You bring drink in backroom, Larry.
All right.
Well, where's my lager and ale, you old stiff?
Oh, Larry bring.
Larry bring, sweetheart.
How are you?
Good news?
Well, what do you got there?
Well, by jiminy, what you think of that?
My daughter, Anna, say she coming here right away.
She got sick on job in St. Paul, she saying.
Let me see.
It's a short letter, it don't tell me much more than that.
By golly, that's good news all one time for old fella.
You know, Marthy, I told you I don't see my Anna since she was little girl in Sweden, 5 year old.
How old will she be now?
Oh, she must be...
She must be 20 year old, by Jove.
- You've not seen her for 15 years?
- No.
I think it's better Anna live on farm.
Then she don't never know that...
That old devil sea.
She don't know father like me.
This girl will marry a sailor herself, likely.
It's in the blood.
No, by golly, she don't do that.
Here!
What are you trying to do, spill my suds for me?
Oh, what's up with you?
Ain't you a sailor yourself?
Yes, and that's just why I say it.
Sailor is all right fella, but not for marry girl.
I know that.
Anna's mother, she know that too.
When is your daughter coming?
Soon?
Why, I forget.
I see.
Well, she say she coming right away, that's all.
She'll be coming here to look for you, I suppose.
Better hang around, Chris.
- Marthy...
- Well, what do you want?
I'm wise to what's in the back of your nut old squarehead.
You wanna get rid of me because your kid's coming, huh?
Wanna kick me out, huh?
Well, see here, Chris.
There ain't no Swede on no boat that's man enough to get away with that.
Don't you start nothing you can't finish.
No, I don't start nothing, Marthy.
No, you don't.
You...
You're a scream.
Oh, honestly...
You're a knockout.
I don't see nothing for laugh at.
You don't?
Go and take a slant at yourself in the mirror.
Oh, gee.
Old squarehead, huh?
Trying to kid Marthy Owens, huh?
Oh, I'm onto the game.
I wasn't born and dragged up on no waterfront for nothing.
You thought I'd make trouble, didn't you?
Not me.
I'm packing my duds and I'm quitting you.
Yeah, I'm leaving you flat.
There's plenty of guys on plenty of boats waiting for me.
Always was.
I always found them.
So cheer up, old squarehead.
I'll be out of the way before your kid gets here.
You'll be rid of me for good, and me of you.
- And good riddance to both of us.
- You.
That's a good girl, Marthy.
Oh, "good girl."
Cut that bull.
Oh, well, you was always square with me, so it's fifty-fifty and nobody owes nobody nothing, do they?
Nobody's sore.
- Still friends?
- Oh, by golly, yes, Marthy.
Still friends.
Blow me another scoop of lager and ale, and I'll drink your kid's health.
- And I'll...
- I'll do that, Marthy.
I get it right away.
Another lager and ale for Marthy, Larry.
Whiskey for me.
My Josephine Come board the ship
Long time I wait for you
The moon, she shines
- She looks just like you
- Oh, help us.
Help us.
Help us, help us, help us.
Come on, get your drink, Marthy.
Skoal!
I celebrate...
I celebrate because my Anna coming home.
You know, Marthy, my Anna...
What you think she look like, Marthy?
- I don't know.
- I bet you she's a fine, good, strong girl.
Pretty like everything because, you know, live on the farm they make them that way.
And I bet you someday she marry good, steady land fella here in East.
Have little house all her own.
Have kids!
Then I'm old grandfather, by golly.
By Jiminy Cricket, we gotta celebrate that.
- Come on, Larry.
Give us a drink, there.
- Wait.
You're soused to the ears, that's what you are.
- Oh, you bet, you celebrate...
- I know, I know, but go on put some food in you and sober up.
Here, you old fool.
You don't know when your kid's coming here, do you?
- Oh, well...
- Well you wanna be sober when she does get here, don't you?
- Oh, by golly, that's so, Marthy.
- Well, then go throw a beef stew in you and...
Go on, around the corner.
I do that, Marthy.
I been coming right back.
Oh, well, that's that.
Give me a whiskey.
Ginger ale on the side.
And don't be stingy, baby.
- Well, shall I serve it in a pail?
- Well, that suits me down to the ground.
Gee, I needed that bad, all right, all right.
Oh, sure.
You look all in.
Have you been on a bat?
No.
Traveling.
Day and a half on a train.
Had to sit up all night in a dirty coach too.
I thought I'd never get here.
- Where'd you come from?
- St. Paul, out in Minnesota.
Minnesota?
Then you're the...?
All the way from Minnesota, sure.
Say, what are you laughing at?
Me?
Oh, no.
Sure, kid.
No, I...
I was thinking of something else.
Well, I wouldn't blame you, at that.
I guess I do look rotten.
I'm just out of the hospital two weeks.
I'm gonna have another drink.
What do you say?
Will you have something on me?
Sure thing.
Thanks.
Larry?
Larry!
Little service here, please.
- Same for me.
- Oh, same here.
Sit over here.
Let's be friends, yeah?
I'm a dead stranger in this burg, you know.
- Skoal.
Here's how, huh?
- Here's luck.
Let you smoke in here, won't they?
Sure, but throw it away if you hear someone coming.
Well, ain't they fussy in this dump.
Is there anything wrong with me?
You're sure looking hard enough.
I ain't gotta look very hard.
I got your number the minute you come in the room.
Is that so?
Well, I got yours too, without no trouble.
You're me, 40 years from now.
That's you.
Is that so?
Well, I wanna tell you straight, kiddo that Marthy Owens never...
Oh, let's cut out the scrapping.
I don't want no hard feelings with no one.
- Come on, let's shake and be friends.
- Sure.
I ain't looking for trouble either.
Let's have another, huh?
Say, don't you think you'd better go kind of easy on that stuff?
Well, I guess you're right.
I gotta meet someone too.
My old man.
I ain't seen him since I was a kid.
Don't even know what he looks like.
I just got a letter now and then.
This was always the only address he gave me to write him back.
He used to be a sailor.
He's a janitor of some building here.
- A janitor?
- Sure.
And I was thinking, seeing he ain't done a thing for me in my life he might be willing to stake me with a room and eats until I could rest up.
But I ain't expecting much from him.
Give you a kick when you're down, that's what all men do.
And I don't suppose he'll turn out no better than the rest.
Do you hang around this dump much?
Oh, off and on.
Why, maybe you know him, my old man.
Well, it...
It isn't old Chris, is it?
- Who, old Chris?
- Yeah, Chris Christopherson.
- That's his full name.
- That's him.
Anna Christopherson is my real name only out there, I call myself Anna Christie.
- So you know him, huh?
- Oh, I've seen him around here for years.
What kind is he?
Well, he's as fine an old guy as ever walked on two feet and that goes.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
Why, you think he'll stake me to the rest cure I'm after, then?
Surest thing you know.
Where'd you get the idea that he was a janitor?
Well, he wrote me he was himself.
He's lying.
He's a captain on a barge.
A barge?
What kind of a barge?
Well, coal, mostly.
A coal barge?
Well, well.
If that ain't a swell job to find your long-lost old man working at.
Oh, gee.
Well, that puts the kibosh on his giving me a rest.
Why?
Couldn't you live on it too?
Who, me?
On a dirty coal barge?
Well, what do you think I am?
Well, what do you know about a barge?
Bet you ain't never seen a barge.
That's what comes of him bringing you up inland where you'd be safe.
Say, his bringing me up, is that what he tells people?
Well, I sure like his nerve.
Why, he let them cousins keep me on the farm and work me to death like a dog.
Well, you didn't fall for that farm life, did you?
I should say not.
I had to slave for all of them.
Was all right till my mother died but I was only a poor relation, you know and they treated me worse than they dared treat a hired girl.
Oh, what a life on that farm out in Minnesota.
With them Swedes, woman-hungry.
One night I was alone in the house and one of the sons came back.
After that, I hated them, so I'd kill them all if I stayed so I ran away.
St. Paul.
Yeah, I overheard Chris saying as how you was in St. Paul.
- Working, he said.
- Oh, that's no lie.
I went there to work, but I was still a kid.
It's all men's fault, giving you the wrong start.
I'm just out of the hospital two weeks.
The judge gave all of us girls 30 days.
Well, the others didn't seem to mind being in the cooler much.
But I couldn't stand it.
I went nuts.
I never could stand being caged up nowhere.
I got good and sick, and they had to send me to the hospital.
And it was nice there.
I was sorry to leave it, honest.
If my old man doesn't help me it's men again.
Men all the time.
Oh, how I hate them, every mother's son of them.
Don't you?
Well, there's good ones and there's bad ones, you know.
Now, your old man, old Chris.
Oh, he's a good one, honest.
Well, he'll have to show me.
Wait till he finds out.
Well, you know, he's kind of simple.
He's got nutty notions.
You know, he thinks that...
He thinks you're working as a nurse girl in St. Paul.
You know, he thinks that...
He means all right, honest.
He thinks the world of you.
Honest, he does.
Quit your kidding.
Well, as soon as I get rested up I'll clear out and get back to the old job in St. Paul.
Josephine Come board the ship
Long time I wait for you
- What's up?
- That's him.
- Who?
- Your old man.
Golly, Larry.
That grub, it taste good.
- Is Marthy in back?
- Sure, and another tramp with her.
That's him, you see.
He's coming in here.
Now, brace up.
Oh, hello, old Chris.
Say, listen, I'm gonna blow down to the barge and pack my duds and beat it.
She's in there.
Your Anna.
Yeah, she's just come.
She's waiting for you.
And you treat her right.
She's been sick.
Well...
So long.
Well, so long, kid.
I gotta beat it.
I'll see you later.
Anna.
Hello, Father.
She told me it was you.
I just got here a little while ago.
Oh, it's...
It's good for see you after all them years, Anna.
Well, it's good to see you too.
Anna lilla.
Anna lilla.
Oh, I had an awful trip getting here.
I'm all in.
Had a hard time finding this place, too, you know.
I've never been in New York before, and...
I'm just out of the hospital two weeks.
You, Anna?
Oh, by golly.
But you feel better now, though, don't you?
You look little tired, that's all.
I am tired to death.
I need a long rest.
That's why I made up my mind to come and see you.
I thought if you had a place where maybe, if you didn't mind having me I could rest up for a while.
Until I felt able to get back on the job again.
Oh, I got nice place for rest, Anna.
You rest all you want.
You don't never got to be nurse girl no more.
You stay with me, by golly.
You're really glad to see me, honest?
Oh, Anna, I'm glad more like everything for see you, I tell you.
Don't you talk no more about getting job.
You stay with me.
I don't see you for long time and I'm getting old.
I got no one in world but you and I'm going to tell you about everything and you tell me all thing what happen to you.
But not here, now.
This ain't no good place for young girlies.
Only no-good sailor fella come here for get drunk.
You come with me.
You need lie down, get a rest.
- Where are you going?
- We go onboard.
- Onboard your barge, you mean?
- Aye.
Well, nix for mine.
Do you think that's a good place for a young girl?
Coal barge?
Yeah, I think, Anna.
You don't know how nice is on barge.
Tug come, he tow us out on voyage.
You got just water all around.
Sunshine, fresh air, plenty good grub for...
For make you strong, healthy girl again.
You need a rest like that.
You work too hard for young girl already.
You need vacation, eh?
Well, it sounds pretty good, to hear you tell it.
I'd sure like a trip on the water, all right.
I'll go down with you and have a look.
Maybe I'll take a chance.
Seeing America from a coal barge, that's a good one.
We go?
Wait a second.
What's the rush?
- Gee, I'm thirsty.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Anna.
What you think you like for drink?
Well, I'll take a...
Oh, I don't know, really.
What have they got here?
I don't think they got much fancy drink for young girl in this place.
Well, say, ginger ale or sarsaparilla, maybe.
Well, make it sarsaparilla.
I tell you, Anna, we celebrate, just this once because we meet after many year.
They got some good port wine.
Now, that's good for you, I think.
It ain't strong, neither.
One glass, he don't go to your head, I promise.
- All right.
I'll take port.
- I go get it.
Well, who's the blond?
That's Anna, Larry.
- Your daughter, Anna?
- Aye.
Don't you think she's pretty girl, Larry?
Sure, a peach.
You give me drink for take back.
One port wine for Anna.
She celebrate with me just this once.
Small beer for me, please.
Small beer for you?
She's reforming you already.
You bet.
I can't stand it.
I better beat it.
I take back, Larry.
Why, you look a little tired, Anna but I make you take good, long rest now.
You drink your wine.
That put new life in you.
Skoal, Anna.
You know that Swedish word?
Skoal.
I guess I know that word, all right, all right.
A bridge, Anna, it's pretty, eh?
Gives you the creeps, though.
It's like a great big spiderweb.
Oh, you're tired, you sick, Anna.
Someday, bridge, he look awfully pretty to you.
I bet your life those big buildings make you open your eyes.
Well, it scares me to think of being up so high.
I bet we look like ants to them.
I bet they can't even see us down here.
On trip back, I take you up in Woolworth Building.
There you see everything.
I've seen too much already.
You know, Anna, you was awful pretty girl.
I bet you all men see you fall in love with you, by Jiminy.
You cut that.
You talk just as they all do.
No harm your father talk that way, Anna.
Oh, fine father you are.
Like a stranger.
Why didn't you ever come out west to see me?
I'm sorry, Anna, but after your mother die I want come see you end of every voyage but when I get money for coming west, I forget.
I get drunk and spend all money.
I don't know why, Anna, but that's the way with most sailor fella.
That old devil sea.
She make them crazy fools with her dirty tricks.
Is so.
Well, it's good you got something to blame it on.
Kind of tough for me, though.
I know, Anna, I'm sorry.
But if you stay with me, I make you glad.
I make you forgive me for being no-good father.
It sounds okay with me.
I'll try anything once.
I'm glad you like it here on barge with your old father, Anna.
Who said I like it?
Well, you change a lot in one week.
The sea air make you feel good again, eh?
Maybe.
I don't know.
Four bells.
What time is that?
Six o'clock.
Funny, all this sea talk.
I'm getting onto the lingo.
Now, there's where you belong, on a real ship like that sailing all over the world.
I do that many year when I was big fool.
Oh, rats.
Say, was all the men in our family always sailors?
Yes.
All men in our family crazy fools.
My father and my three brothers is buried at sea lost on sailboat.
Just like your brothers was drowned.
Sailor man is no good, Anna.
They don't never come home.
Don't never do nothing what good men do.
And sooner or later, that old devil, she swallow them up.
But she don't gonna got me.
No, by Jiminy, not me.
Beefing about the sea again.
Well, I'm getting so I kind of like it.
Old man?
Father.
Father!
Anna, you was scared I got hurt.
Oh, gee, I thought you were overboard, honest.
You been sorry if that old devil, he got Chris, eh?
Why, sure.
Ain't you my father?
Oh, that's a sure thing.
You like me little, maybe?
Can the sentiment, Pa.
I'll fix you a whiskey toddy.
I'll pull off your boots first, though.
Oh, Anna, you make old fella want to cry.
Nix on the sob stuff now.
Heave, hearty!
Oh, don't go away, Anna, don't go away.
You was my little girl.
My Anna lilla.
Anna lilla.
Anna.
- Anna.
- Yes.
Here I am.
What do you want?
Why you don't come turn in, Anna?
It's late, it's after four bells.
I like this fog, honest.
It makes me feel as if I was out of things altogether.
Fog.
That's one of the worst dirty tricks of that old devil.
Funny.
I feel sort of strange tonight.
Sort of nutty as if I've been living a long, long time out here in the fog.
I don't know just how to tell you what I mean.
But it's like I've come home from a long visit someplace and I seem to have forgotten all that's happened.
Like it didn't matter anymore.
You must think I'm off my base.
Oh, Anna, I want always make you happy.
We fool that old devil.
We sell barge.
And you and me, we live together in nice little house inland.
Inland?
You mean leave the sea?
By golly, we have a little house, just you and me and maybe sometime comes along a nice land fella.
You get married.
You have kids.
Oh, by Jiminy, that sure is a pretty picture, Anna.
Maybe.
I wanna be with you but somehow I don't wanna leave the sea.
She's old devil, Anna.
Don't let her get you.
Well, ain't it natural, me loving the sea?
It's in the blood, ain't it?
I think I'm a big fool for bring you on this voyage, Anna.
Now you're talking nutty yourself.
You act as if you were scared something was gonna happen.
- Only God know that, Anna.
- Well, then, it'll be God's will like the preachers say, what does happen.
No.
That old devil, she ain't God.
Ahoy!
Ahoy!
Ahoy!
- What's that?
- Oh, that scare me for a minute.
Is just some fisherman lose his course in fog.
Sound come from this side.
They come in from open sea.
Ahoy!
What's trouble?
Heave a rope when we come alongside.
- Where are you, you scut?
- This way!
Right you are.
Why don't he stay where he belongs.
Johnson, come and give a hand.
Anna, you go in cabin, get whiskey, please.
Those fellas will need a drink for fix them up.
Johnson, come here.
Give me a hand here with this fella.
- What is it, sir?
- They come in from the open sea.
- Must be sailor fellas.
- The open sea?
That old devil is doing something again, Johnson.
Three of them there.
- Did you see them there, Johnson?
- Sure, a couple of them is out.
Make fast rope there, you fella.
Right you are.
Heave away.
Come in here.
- Johnson.
- Johnson, you get that other fella there.
Right away.
Anna, get whiskey, quick.
These here sailor fellas their steamer got wrecked in storm.
Been five days in open sea.
Johnson brings another fella.
You take whiskey to him.
Take your whiskey, here.
Are these all?
I'll get whiskey inside.
Take that to the man's who's coming onboard now.
What's this tub?
Well, we're safe anyhow, with the help of God.
Sure, it's me, Matt Burke himself, dreaming again.
You drink this and you'll find it's no dream.
The devil with the drink.
But I'll be taking it anyhow.
Sure, I'm needing that.
It's fine stuff.
But it wasn't the drink I meant when I said, was I dreaming.
Sure, I thought you was some mermaid out of the sea, come to torment me.
Aye, real flesh and blood, devil the less.
Cut that.
What's a fine, handsome woman the like of yourself doing on this scow?
Never you mind.
You're a great one, honest.
Starting right in kidding after what you've been through.
I'm telling you, but for the strength and guts in me, we'd be scoffed by the fishes this minute.
Gee, you hate yourself, don't you?
But you must come and lie down and go to sleep.
Lie down and sleep, is it?
But you'll not be thinking I'm a weak scut.
Sure, I could lick any man on this boat with one hand tied behind me back.
I could lick all hands on this tub one by one, tired as I am.
Ain't you the hard guy, though, huh?
But never mind that fight talk.
I'll take your word for what you say.
You're all in, own up to it.
The devil I am.
Well, be stubborn, then, for all I care.
And I must say I don't care for your language.
The men I know don't pull rough stuff when ladies are around.
Ladies!
Let you not be making game of me.
Whisht, now, milady, it's one of your kisses I'm needing to take the tiredness from me bones.
One kiss, now.
Let go of me, you...!
Oh, gee, I was scared for a moment I'd killed you.
"Killed you," you say?
Faith, it would take more than a bit of a blow to crack my thick skull.
Glory be, you got a power of strength in them fine arms of yours.
Forget it.
I'm sorry it happened.
Only, you've no right to be getting fresh with me.
Listen, now, don't go getting any more wrong notions.
I'm on this barge because I'm making a trip with my father.
The captain is my father.
Now you know.
I'm sorry.
I'm thinking I'm not good enough to kiss the shoe soles of a fine, decent girl the like of yourself.
Will you forgive me now and let's be friends from this out?
I'm thinking I'd rather be friends with you than anything else in the world.
- Sure.
- God bless you.
It is a clumsy ape I am.
Sure, it is great power I have in me hand and arm, and I do be forgetting it at times.
You're sure strong, all right.
Sure, it is the will of God in it that brought me safe through the storm to the one spot in the world where you was.
Think of that, now, and isn't it queer?
Anna, you get in cabin, you hear?
Who do you think you're talking to, a slave?
You need to rest, Anna.
What are you doing here, you sailor fella?
You ain't sick like others.
You get in forecastle, they give you bunk.
You hurry, I tell you.
But he's sick.
He can hardly stand up.
Look at him.
Is it giving me orders you are, me bucko?
Let you look out, then.
Weak as I am, I can break you in pieces and throw you over the side, and your crew after you.
I was forgetting, you're her old man.
Sure, I'd not lift a fist to you for the world.
Come inside.
You can have my bed if there is no other place.
That's your dirty trick, old devil but you don't do that, no, not that while I live.
Mulligan!
Sure, it is myself that's hungry.
And a pie, Matt.
Glory be, what do I care for a stew or a pie?
It's not for food I'm hungry but for the sight of your face.
- Oh, go on with your blarney, you gasbag.
Now, Matt, look what you've done.
Pick that up.
Shame on you.
Sure, her with the face of an angel and the sting of a wasp.
Oh, so it's darning you're doing.
Shut up.
You've got a voice like a foghorn.
What's this?
Well, what do you think it is?
Well, holding it up this way, it might be new underdrawers for old Chris.
- Ain't for him, though.
- Oh, ain't it, now?
- For some sweetheart?
- Maybe.
Don't make me jealous, or I'll burn it up and him in it.
- No.
Give it to me.
- You got a guilty look in your eye.
Now, you give it to me, now.
You bully.
Now...
Don't!
- Look what you've done, galoot.
- When I get ahold of him that wears it I'll pull out an arm and wave you goodbye with it.
Supper's almost ready.
Well, I've been hungry.
Well, as I was saying to you before...
Stand up, just to measure this sweater.
Sure, I will.
On me head or me feet?
Your feet, silly.
It is only prayer or paralysis can save you now, Anna.
Well, I'm praying, Matt.
It is a miracle if your prayers are answered.
Thanks, Matt.
It's for my father.
And him hating to stand up for measurements.
- Will you wear it for my sake?
- Oh, yeah.
It is a lie in your throat and you know it.
No, it isn't.
You made it for me with your own blessed hands.
And I'll wear it when we dock in New York and take you out for a day's fun.
Oh, no, you won't.
It won't be finished by then.
I won't go with you.
Make up your mind to that.
- Yes, you'll go with me.
- Oh, no, I won't.
- Just the two of us.
- Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes, you will.
Well, you won the capital prize, fella.
Help yourself.
Anybody else around?
Here we go, boys.
Why don't you test your lungs too, Matt.
I should test them, with the fine bellows that I got?
Well, try it.
Faith, that's a woman's game.
Not for a husky like me.
You try it, Anna.
No, Matt.
You do it.
I haven't got the wind in me that you have.
Hand it over.
Watch me.
Sure, I've air enough in me chest to blow up a balloon.
Well, I don't doubt it.
What do you mean, you don't doubt it?
I was just kidding.
I bet he goes to 40.
Oh, boy.
Step up and roll the sweet mamas out of their beds.
Make your own sweet mama jealous.
Only 25 cents to see the most enchanting scene on Coney Island.
Now there's Lily and Clytie without any nighties.
Hey, you, step right up.
Give us a good free look at the mamas in their pretty lace hootenannies.
Wanna keep us in bed all night, tightwad?
Loosen up, lads.
Give us a little tumble.
I'll bet you couldn't hit that target if you stayed until you grew a long, white beard.
- The devil I couldn't.
- Come on, Matt.
Go on and try it.
Bet you can't even hit the net.
- Yeah, how about a home run, Babe Ruth?
- Sure, I dare you to.
With one throw, I could knock them dames off of their bunks.
Go to it, big boy.
Don't overlook me, carrot top.
I have the shape that makes the old men young and the young men old.
- Attaboy.
- Mama wants Papa.
- Papa wants Mama.
Some mamas too.
Now somebody else.
Somebody that packs a mean right.
What we want this time is a regular he-man.
You shut up or I'll wrap you around the target.
Don't get sore, big boy.
It's a hot night.
Roll me out of the blanket.
And that be the end to the story of the whale and the grasshopper.
Oh, Matt, honest, I ain't ever laughed like this.
- You're funny.
- Sure, I'd think it was blarney if it wasn't meself was making you laugh.
Oh, sure, Anna, you're crazy about me, and I'm not after blaming you.
You just hate yourself, don't you, Matt?
Oyster loaf for the lady, sir.
- I ordered milk for the lady.
- Well, I've got it here.
Well, let's drink to our good health.
Here's to you.
And skoal, Matt, to you and me.
- Hot mustard, Matt?
- I don't need it.
- Pepper?
- Full of it.
- Well, here's something you do need.
- Oh, is that so, now?
Well, all right.
But if I'm needing sugar, I know where to look for that.
Oh, we're goofy, Matt.
Just like a couple of kids.
Sure, Anna, when you're in love, you ain't got the brains of a tick.
What do you mean, love?
You know what I mean, Anna.
It's in me eye and on the tip of me tongue.
A man like me ain't given to loving a woman.
He knows too much about them.
Every color of them, from here to the China Sea.
The whole lying, cheating smear of them.
Sailors' bait.
When he comes across a girl like you, Anna that's as clean as a shell.
You're a lucky girl to be hearing such talk from the lips of Matt Burke him that the women are so crazy over.
Anna, what's come over you?
Oh, nothing.
Sure, don't lie to me, Anna.
You're as stiff as a corpse.
Hello, dearie.
- Well, I'll be...
- Well, she's a friend of mine.
Aren't you, dearie?
I'm afraid I don't remember you.
- She don't remember me.
- Of course she don't, you old scab.
- Beat it, or I'll have you thrown in the brig.
- No, Matt, maybe I do know her.
That old sea cow?
Go on, clear out of here.
You know a nice young girl never met the likes of you.
A nice young...?
A nice young...
Pure and white as a lily.
Shut up, or I'll choke the wind out of your gullet.
Oh, Matt, let her alone.
She don't mean nothing by it.
Anna.
Anna, darling.
You see what you've done?
You frightened her.
- Go on, clear out of here.
- I'm going, I'm going.
Let her alone.
Don't go.
I was lying, Matt.
I know her and she knows me.
I recognized her the minute she stepped across the room.
Shut up, kid.
You don't have to spill over for nobody.
You ain't responsible for what your old man does.
I'll tell you why she didn't want to talk to me.
Because I'm a tramp, that's why.
And her old man kicked me off the barge when she come there to live on it.
Yeah, he didn't want any old wharf rat around a nice young girl.
Well, it ain't so, though, Matt.
She's lying.
Lying, I'm ly...?
Well, I like your nerve, all right, all right.
Gee, I'm sorry I came here to speak to you.
Insulting me.
Well, can you beat it?
I'll be toddling along.
I'm glad you found yourself such a nice, friendly gent.
I hope you're happy, kid.
I'm sorry I bothered you, honest, I...
Oh, forget it, Ann.
You only got one life to live.
And it's a... of a life at that.
Say, skipper, you wouldn't stake me to a quarter, would you?
You know, I haven't had a drink in a month.
Take it and beat it.
With pleasure, captain.
Well, so long.
Be a good girl, Ann, no matter how lonesome.
Happy days.
Happy days.
The poor old devil.
Sometimes I feel sorry for them.
Come on, Anna.
Don't let it get you down.
Sure, the world's full of them.
I know it's a sad sight for a decent young girl the like of yourself, darling.
What would you say, Matt, if I told you that...?
Say what, me darling?
Tell me what.
Oh, nothing.
Sure, I know what you'll be wanting to tell me soon, if not this minute that you love me.
Don't be so sure of yourself, Matt.
I'm loving nobody.
And you'll be wanting to marry me, and maybe I'll be accepting you.
Why, Matt.
You want to marry me?
- Honest?
- Sure, I'll marry you.
Only, don't be putting me to too many tests, or I might change me mind.
I'm tired, Matt.
I wanna go back to the barge.
You...
You think you love that sailor fella, Anna?
Well, what if I do?
You think maybe you marry him?
No.
I'm glad you don't marry sailor, Anna.
Is bad for woman.
They don't never see their men only once in long while.
You sit and wait all alone and when their boys grow up and go on sea they sit and wait some more.
Any girl marry sailor is crazy fool, I tell you.
Your mother, she tell you same thing if she was alive.
Well, that ain't why I won't marry him.
I'm not thinking about myself but about him.
He's such a simple guy, a big kid.
And I haven't got the heart to fool him.
You fool him?
Oh, you go crazy, I think.
I've been thinking I was myself the last few days.
I'll be outside.
I love to watch the ships passing.
When Matt comes along, tell him where I am, will you?
All right, I tell him.
Well, God bless who's here.
How's the world treating you this afternoon, Anna's father?
Oh, pretty good, if it ain't for some fellas.
Meaning me, do you?
Well, if you ain't the funny old crank of a man.
Where's herself?
- Where's Anna, I'm after asking you.
- She gone out to look on boat.
Well, I'll be going out to her.
But before I go, I'll take this chance while we're alone to have a word with you.
And that word is soon done.
I'm marrying your Anna before this day is out.
You may as well make up your mind to it, like it or no.
That's easy for saying.
You mean I won't?
Is it yourself is after stopping me, do you think?
- I stop it if it come to worst.
- Sure, it isn't trouble I'm looking for.
You're her father.
Wouldn't it be a shame for us to be at each others' throats like a pair of dogs, and I married to Anna.
So out with the truth, man alive.
What is it you're holding against me at all?
I don't want my Anna for got married.
Listen, you fella.
I'm old man.
I don't see my Anna for 15 year.
She's all I got in the world.
You think now when she come on first trip, I want her for leave me alone again?
Sure, let you not be thinking I've no heart at all for the way you'd be feeling.
Then you do right thing, eh?
You ship away again and leave my Anna alone.
Say, big fella like you on sea, he don't need a wife.
He got new girl in every port, you know that.
Oh, shut up.
Sure, there's a time come to every man, on sea or land when he's sick of the lot of them cows, and wearing his heart out to meet up with some fine, decent girl and building a home to call his own, rearing up children in it.
Sure, Anna's the one woman in the world for me and I can't live without her now, I'm thinking.
You think I'm going let her life be made sorry by you just like her mother's was made by me?
No, she don't marry you.
Not if I have to kill you first.
Glory be to God, what talk from a stumpy runt of a man.
It is queer fool's blather you have, about the sea done this and the sea done that.
You ought to be ashamed to be saying the like, you an old sailor.
I'm hearing a lot from you, and a lot more that Anna tells me you do be saying to her.
I'm thinking it is a poor weak thing you are.
Not a man at all.
You see if I'm man maybe quicker than you think.
You know the truth in your heart.
The sea hit you a clout once and knocked you down.
You're not man enough to get up for another, but you lie there howling murder.
I'd like to see you in the best of your youth.
- Do what I done in the storm and after.
- Why, you young fool, you.
In old days, when I was on windjammer I went through hundred storms worse than that.
Ships were ships then, and men what sailing them real men.
What you got on steamers now?
You got fellas on deck don't know a ship from a mud scow and below deck, you got fellas just know how to shovel coal.
You might as well work on coal wagon ashore, you.
Is it throwing insults at the men in the stokehold you are, you old ape?
One of them is worth any 10 squareheads ever shipped on a windbag.
- You Irish swine.
- So you don't like the Irish, you old baboon?
Sure, it's that you're needing in your family.
An Irishman.
A man of the stokehold to put guts in it so you'll not be rearing up grandchildren to be jackasses like yourself.
Sure, old men getting childish shouldn't play with knives.
Faith, I've half a mind to hit you a clout will put sense in your square head.
Keep away from me, now.
Hello, Matt.
Are you here already?
Say, what's up?
How did that chair get knocked over?
Oh, Matt, you haven't been fighting with him, after you promised?
I've not laid a hand on him, Anna.
I told him to his teeth I love you.
That's God's truth, and well you know it.
He tell same thing to girl in every port he goes.
I know it's true, Matt.
Don't you mind what he says.
God bless you.
And then I said I thought maybe you'd have a bit of love for me too.
So you told him that?
Maybe I have.
I've been wondering if I do love you.
I didn't want to, I must own up to that.
But I...
I guess I can't help it, so I guess I do.
Oh, sure, I do, Matt.
What's the use of kidding myself different?
- Sure, I love you.
- God be praised.
And I haven't ever loved a man in my life before, never.
Faith, we'll be having a grand, beautiful life together to the end of our days.
Matt.
- Goodbye, Matt.
- Goodbye, is it?
I'll be coming at you in a second for more of the same.
Own up like a man when you're beat fair and square.
Here's me hand to you.
We'll be friends from this out.
No, I don't shake hands with you, fella.
Not while I live.
The back of me hand to you, then, if that suits you.
It's a rotten bad loser you are, devil mend you.
No, I don't lose.
Anna said she like you little bit.
But you don't hear her say she marry you, I bet.
No, and I don't hear her say the sun is shining, either.
- No, I didn't say it, Matt.
- There, you hear?
You're waiting to be asked, you mean?
Well, I'm asking you now.
We'll be wedded this day, with the help of God.
- You heard what I said after I kissed you.
- I don't remember.
I said goodbye.
That kiss was for goodbye, Matt.
What do you mean?
I can't marry you.
We've said goodbye, that's all.
- I knew that was so.
- Is it making game of me you'd be?
It's a queer time to joke with me.
Don't be doing it, for the love of God.
You don't think I'd kid you now.
I'm not joking, Matt.
I mean what I say.
You don't.
You can't.
It is mad you are, I'm telling you.
- No, I'm not.
- What's come over you so sudden?
You were saying you love me.
I'll say that as often as you want me to.
It's true.
But why?
What?
What is it?
Because it's the best way I can figure out, Matt.
I've been thinking it over and thinking it over, day and night, all week.
Oh, don't think it isn't hard on me too, Matt.
Well, will you tell me what's preventing this wedding when the two of us has love?
I'm thinking it's listening to that old fool you are him hating me, filling your ears full of lies against me.
Yes, Anna believe me, not you.
She know her old father don't lie like you.
You sit down, do you hear?
Why do you come butting in and making things worse?
You're like a devil, you are.
Here I was, beginning to like you, beginning to forget all the things I've held up against you.
- You ain't got nothing for hold against me.
Haven't I, though?
Well, let me tell you.
Matt, I'm surprised at you.
- You didn't think anything he'd said...
- Sure, what else would it be?
Tell me, and don't keep me waiting.
I can't tell you, and I won't.
I've got a good reason, that's all you need to know.
I can't marry you, and that's all there is to it.
So for heaven's sake, let's talk of something else.
No, I'll not.
- Is it married to someone else you are?
- I should say not.
You're like them women can't make up their minds till they're drove to it.
Well, I'll make up your mind for you.
We've had enough talk.
Let's go to the other room and dress in your best.
We're going ashore.
- She don't do that.
- Where do you get that stuff?
Never mind, get on with your dressing.
- We'll see who'll win in the end, me or you.
- Stay, Anna.
She will not.
She'll do what I say.
You've had your hold on her long enough.
- It's my turn now.
- Your turn?
What am I anyway?
Never mind what you are.
It's what you're gonna be:
Wedded to me.
Come on with your dressing.
- Don't do one thing he say!
- She will!
- I'm her father.
- She will in spite of you.
She's taking my orders from now on, not yours.
Orders is good.
Never mind now.
We've no time to be wasting.
- Do you hear what I'm telling you?
- No, stay here, Anna!
You can go to blazes, both of you.
You'd think I was a piece of furniture.
I'll show you.
Sit down.
Sit down, do you hear?
Let me talk for a minute.
You're all wrong, see?
I'm gonna tell you two something, and then I'm gonna beat it.
I've been meaning to turn it loose on you every time you get my goat with your crazy talk about wanting to keep me safe inland.
I wasn't going to tell you, but you've forced me into it.
Oh, what's the use?
It's all wrong anyway.
You might as well get cured this way as any other.
Don't forget what you said about it not mattering to you what reason I got as long as I wasn't married already.
That's me word, and I'll stick to it.
You make me laugh, honest.
Wanna bet you will?
You wait and see.
You was going on as if one of you had to own me.
But nobody owns me, see, excepting myself.
I'll do what I please.
And no man, I don't give a darn who he is can tell me what to do.
I ain't asking either of you for a living.
I'll make it myself, one way or another.
I am my own boss.
Now, put that in your pipe and smoke it.
- You and your orders.
- I wasn't meaning it that way at all and well you know it.
You've no call to raise this rumpus with me.
- It is him, you've a right.
- I'm coming to him.
But you, you did mean it that way.
You sounded just like all the rest.
It is queer, rough talk, that, for a decent girl the like of yourself.
Decent.
Who told you I was?
I'm talking to you now.
I don't want to hear.
You go out your head, I think.
Well, living with you is enough to drive anyone off their nut.
Your bunk about the farm being so fine.
Didn't I write you, year after year, how rotten it was and what a dirty slave them cousins made out of me?
What did you care?
Nothing.
Not even enough to come out and see me.
Your crazy stuff about wanting to keep me away from the sea don't go down with me.
You just didn't want to be bothered with me.
- Oh, that ain't so, Anna.
- But one thing I never wrote you it was one of them cousins that you think is such nice people that started me wrong.
And it was none of my fault.
I hated him and he knew it.
But he was big and strong, like you.
That's why I ran away from the farm.
That's what made me get a job as a nurse girl in St. Paul.
You think that was a nice job for a girl, too, don't you?
With all them nice inland fellas just looking for a chance to marry me.
They weren't looking for marrying.
You don't say nothing.
Either one of you.
But I know what you're thinking.
You're just like all the rest.
And who's to blame for it?
Me or you?
If you'd been a regular father and had me with you things would've been different.
- Don't talk that way.
- I go crazy.
I won't listen to you.
- You will listen.
You, keeping me safe inland.
I was no nurse girl the last two years.
I lied when I wrote you.
I was in a house, that's what.
Yes, that kind of a house.
The kind that sailors like Matt and you go to in port and your nice inland men too.
And all men.
I hate them, I hate them...
- Oh, it's a lie, Anna, it's a lie...
- So that's what's in it.
I suppose you remember your promise.
No other reason was to count with you as long as I wasn't married already.
You want me to get dressed and go ashore, don't you?
Oh, yes, you do.
I suppose if I tried to tell you that I wasn't that no more you'd believe me, wouldn't you?
And if I told you that just getting out on this barge and being on the sea had changed me and made me feel different about things as if all that I've been through wasn't me, didn't count it was just like it never happened you'd laugh, wouldn't you?
And you'd die laughing, I'm sure, if I told you that meeting you that funny way that night in the fog and afterwards, seeing that you were straight good stuck on me had got me to thinking for the first time in my life.
And I sized you up as different from the ones on land, as water is from mud.
I couldn't marry you with you believing a lie.
And I was ashamed to tell you the truth.
And now, give me a bawling-out and beat it like I can tell you're going to.
Will you believe it if I tell you that loving you has made me clean?
It's straight goods, honest.
Oh, yes, you will.
You're just like all the rest.
The rest, is it?
My curse on you.
Clean, is it?
Oh, don't, Matt.
Get out of here.
Let me alone.
Get out of here!
I'll be going.
And I'll be drinking slews of whiskey so to wash that black kiss of yours off me lips!
And I'd be getting dead, rotten drunk so I'll not remember you at all!
I'll ship away on a boat to the end of the world, where I'll never see your face again!
- Oh, don't go.
It's better Anna marry you...
- Let go of me, you old ape!
Marry her, is it?
I'd see her dead at me feet first.
I'm shipping away out of this, I'm telling you.
My curse on you, and the curse of all the saints.
- I go ashore too.
- Not after him, I tell you.
Don't you dare.
Oh, I go for get drink.
I'm driving you to drink too, huh?
You wanna get drunk so you can forget, like him.
Aye.
You think I like hear them things?
Oh, Anna.
Anna, I think you wasn't that kind of girl.
You want me to beat it, don't you?
You don't want me here disgracing you, I suppose.
Oh, no, no, Anna.
You stay here.
It ain't your fault, I know that.
It's that old devil do this to me.
It was all right on barge, with just you and me.
Then she bring that Irish fellow in fog.
That fella, he don't never come, you don't never tell me them things.
I don't never know.
Then everything is all right.
Oh, that dirty devil sea.
Oh, what's the use?
Go ashore and get drunk.
You wait here, Anna?
Maybe.
Maybe not.
Maybe I'll get drunk too.
Maybe I'll... 0h, what do you care what I do?
Go on and beat it.
It's foggy outside.
Oh, God.
- What's the trouble?
Feeling sick?
- Inside my head feels sick.
Oh, Anna, you think maybe sometime you forgive me, Anna?
- I'll forgive you right now.
- Oh, Anna lilla.
Oh, don't bawl about it.
There ain't nothing to forgive anyway.
It ain't your fault, it ain't mine.
It ain't his, neither.
I fix everything all right for you and me, Anna.
Yes?
Then you and me will stick together?
We'll work for each other and help each other, huh?
- What is it you fixed?
- Well, I sign on steamer Londonderry.
Sail for Cape Town tomorrow.
Oh, Anna, I only bring you bad luck.
That's how you fix me, is it?
Well, I think that old devil get me back maybe she leave you alone, then.
Oh, can't you see that you're doing the same thing that you've always done?
Can't you see that?
Oh, what's the use of talking?
You ain't right.
I'll never blame you anymore.
Oh, Anna.
You forgive me, sure?
Surely I do.
You ain't to blame.
You're just what you are, like me.
And you, you let me kiss you once again, eh?
- Oh, sure, no hard feelings.
- Oh, Anna lilla.
I can't say it, Anna.
I think I go lie down, go to sleep.
Oh, that booze, he don't go well, Anna.
I think I'm never going to drink again.
I can't stand this much longer.
What am I waiting for, anyhow, like a darn fool?
Anna?
- Anna?
- Yes, what do you want?
Don't say it.
I know what's in your mind.
Yes, that's what I was, and that's what I'm going back to.
I'd kill you first.
And finish it up.
It's a dog's life I been living since I found out what you are.
Oh, why don't you leave me alone.
Go away.
Don't you see I'm licked?
What do you want to keep kicking me for?
Don't you deserve the worst I'd say, God forgive you?
All right, maybe I do.
But don't rub it in.
Why haven't you done what you said you were going to?
Ship away to the other side of the earth, where you don't have to see me.
- I have.
- What?
You're going away, honest?
I signed on, drunk as I was, and she's sailing tomorrow.
- Where is she going?
Far away?
- Cape Town.
It is at the end of Africa.
That's far for you.
- What's the boat's name?
- The Londonderry.
The Londonderry?
Oh, this is too much.
Faith, I don't blame you for laughing at me.
True, it is the fool of the world I am to come back to talk to you at all.
Oh, what's the use?
What's the use of me talking?
What's the use of anything?
Anna...
Anna, if I could only be believing I was the only man in the world ever you had love for, I could be forgetting the rest, maybe.
Are you trying to accuse me of being in love really in love, with them?
You fool, you.
I've stood enough from you.
Love them, is it?
I hated them, I tell you.
And may God strike me dead, and my mother too, if she was alive if I'm not telling you the honest truth.
Oh, sure, Anna, if I could only be believing you, now.
Why, Matt, you've got to believe it.
What can I do?
What will I do to prove to you I'm not lying?
Anna, would you...?
Would you be willing to swear an oath, a terrible, fearful oath?
Oh, sure, I will, Matt, on anything.
Would you swear on this?
Oh, sure.
Give it to me.
It is a cross given to me by me mother, God rest her soul.
And I'm telling you, it has great power in it.
And I'm warning you now, if you swear on this it is me old woman herself who'd be looking down on you from heaven and praying the saints to put a curse on you if she hears you swear a lie.
I wouldn't have the nerve, honest, Matt, if it was a lie.
But it's the truth, and I ain't scared to swear it.
Give it to me.
What do you want me to swear?
You say it.
Swear I'm the only man in the world ever you felt love for.
I swear it.
I swear it by God.
And may the blackest curse of God strike you if you're lying.
And may the blackest curse of God strike me if I'm lying.
Oh, glory be to God, I'm after believing you now.
- Now what's the matter?
- Is it Catholic you are?
- No, why?
- Oh, God pity me.
Sure, it's some devil's treachery in it.
You swearing on a Catholic cross, and you one of the others.
- Well, don't you believe me, Matt?
- Oh, but if it ain't a Catholic you are...
I ain't nothing, Matt.
What's the difference?
Didn't you hear me swear?
I'm afraid I love you, God forgive me, no matter what you are.
I'd be going mad if I'd not be having you.
I'd be killing the world.
We'll be wedded this day.
And we'll be happy, the two of us, in spite of the devil.
Well, we gotta have a drink on this, my good man.
- Blast you.
- That's the way to talk.
Oh, Matt, it's time for you two to kiss and make up.
You'll be shipmates on the Londonderry, you know.
- Shipmates?
Has himself...?
- Aye, and I'm boatswain on her.
The devil!
You'd be shipping away to sea and leaving her alone again, will you?
It's all right, Matt.
That's where he belongs, and I want him to go.
You've gotta go too.
We'll need the money.
And as for me being alone, why, that runs in the family and I'll get used to it.
I'll get a house somewhere and I'll make a regular place for you two to come back.
And now you'll drink and be friends, huh?
Sure.
- Here's luck to you.
- Skoal.
Well, you'll not be lonesome long.
I'll see to that, God willing.
Sure as himself will be having a grandchild riding his foot, I tell you.
- Maybe twins.
- Oh, quit your kidding.
Is it any religion at all you have, you and your Anna?
Well, in the old country, we was Lutherans.
Lutherans, is it?
Oh, then I'm damned entirely.
Oh, well, what's the difference?
It is God's will anyhow.
It's queer, you and me shipping on same boat that way.
That ain't right.
It's that funny way old devil sea do her worst dirty tricks.
Aye, is so.
Faith, I'm afraid you've the right of it for once, devil take you.
Why, gee, Matt, you ain't agreeing with him, are you?
Come on.
Here's to the sea, no matter what.
Be a game sport, man.
Drink to that.
Fog, fog all time.
You can't tell where you was going.
Only that old devil sea.
She knows.

Are you crazy?

He ain't gonna put out 1 94 bucks on a lousy pair.
You did.
I'm saying you've been marking these cards.

The man holds markers on everybody in this town.

I'll take the 1 1 0, the 60.
You take the 85 and put it back in your bank.
Thanks, Kid.

Hi, Kid.

It was the only game I could find where I wasn't holding markers on somebody.
-I'm thinking about going to Miami.
-You're gonna go to work in Miami?
.
Yeah.
Yeah.
-You got a better idea?
.
-I don't know.
It may be just a rumor.
You know how these things get started but they say that Lancey Howard is in town.
They say Lancey Howard?
.
The man himself.
The Kid will have to play him.
Am I right, Kid?
.
You gonna play him?
.
Lancey Howard.
Lancey Howard take the skin right off the Kid.
I'm giving even money on the Kid.
Fifty cents.
Mark it.
Yes, Mr. Slade.
Tomorrow's fine.
Couldn't be better.
I understand that stud poker is your game.
Well, your stakes are my pleasure, sir.
Well, why don't we make it about Iunchtime.
That's a fine idea, Mr. Howard.
Around noon, then?
.
I'm right here in the hotel.
My pleasure, sir.
And do remember me kindly to your charming wife.
Yes, I'll do that.
Mr. Howard, one thing more.
Say, l--
May I suggest we secure for ourselves the dealing services of the Shooter for this auspicious occasion?
.
That's excellent.
Excellent.
All right, then.
Bye-bye.
Don't touch me.
Just a wee bit more Tabasco.
Yeah, this game's been coming for a long time, hasn't it, Kid?
.
Too long.
Think so?
.
I told you what happened when I played.
Yeah, I know.
He laid me out, strung me up and then....
Kid, I mean, he gutted me.
Yeah, you told me, Shooter.
Just wait till he's looking down your throat, that's all.
You don't think I'm ready, do you?
.
I don't know.
You're one of the greatest stud players I've seen.
But then again, so was Lancey Howard.
It's not gonna be like sitting down with me and Doc Sokal.
You see, I've been where I'm going.
The way I play now?
.
Just percentages.
Don't win much, don't lose much.
You think you were ready when you sat down with him?
.
I thought I was the best stud-poker player in the world.
I'm telling you, I thought I was the best.
I got something, Shooter.
You know I've got something.
Yeah, you've got something.
I know that, Kid.
But you've got to remember that he's the man, see?
.
He's got an awful lot to protect.
He'll use everything in the book and then some he's made up to kill you.
I don't want any lesson, Shooter.
I want everything he's got.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-You cold?
.
-No.
What happened to your coat?
.
I ripped it.
What'd you do today?
.
Oh, went to the movies.
And it was all in French.
-ln French, huh?
.
-Yeah.
Know what they do?
.
They sign the words in at the bottom of the picture...
-...in English, so you can understand it.
-Oh, yeah?
.
-Yeah.
-Oh, it wasn't in French?
.
-What?
.
-What was the movie about?
.
It was about this town in Europe, and they get this message--
Well, was it in French, Spanish or English?
.
-What?
.
-The message.
-Do you wanna hear this?
.
-Yeah.
Go ahead.
Well, this Spanish general had sent the message that he's coming to spend the night with his army.
Now, the men in the town are scared silly so the wives and the daughters tell them not to worry and go away and hide someplace and let them bargain with them.
You see?
.
Who?
.
Well, the ladies with the Spanish army.
I won't tell it anymore.
-Go ahead.
-No, I won't tell it.
No.
-Well, just tell me what happened.
-No.
No.
You won't believe this.
But the women get together and have this big party and they all go to bed with the Spanish army.
Oh, yeah?
.
Anyway, come morning the soldiers go off, and everybody's happy.
Yeah, and the husbands are happy.
Yeah, husbands, fathers, everybody.
Seems they--
Seems they cared more about their lives than they did about their honor.
That seem right to you?
.
Yeah.
Well, how come?
.
Well, because that makes sense.
-That's why.
-lt doesn't make sense.
The point is that what good is honor if you're dead?
.
Hey, what the hell are you going to Frenchy movies for, anyway?
.
Shooter's wife wanted to go.
-Melba?
.
-Melba.
-Since when are you hanging with Melba?
.
-Since that game in Corpus.
-Melba.
-I know.
You don't want me to go out with Melba?
.
Hey I don't care what you do.
Well, you should.
I happen to like Melba.
Melba why do you do that?
.
So it will fit, stupid.
No, I'm not talking about that.
What I'm asking is--
Do you have to cheat at everything?
.
At everything?
.
Yes, at solitaire.
I've yet to see you play solitaire without cheating.
So what?
.
Look, you're just cheating yourself.
Don't you understand?
.
You'll be the loser, no one else but yourself.
You've ruined the puzzle.
Now, that doesn't go in there.
It does now.
Why should I answer?
.
-Hello.
-You only get steamed if it's for me.
Oh, yes.
Lancey.
Yes, I heard you were in town.
Hey, what are you up to?
.
A little action, maybe?
.
But I keep forgetting.
You like to steam, don't you, Shooter?
.
William Jefferson Slade.
Local celebrity, I understand.
Comes from one of the richest families in the state.
Yeah, that's right, Lancey.
Seems that your reputation is one of the few stable things in a world of crumbling values.
I'll be there.
Would you really wear a thing like that?
.
Why not?
.
I got nothing to hide.
Hey, I bet you'd look good in one too.
Oh, no, I couldn't.
I just couldn't wear that.
Come on.
Well, now where are you going?
.
You ever been to the Turkish bath?
.
Turkish baths?
.
French movies?
.
I don't know about you, Melba.
Well, then, come on and find out.
The Turkish bath leaves nothing to the imagination.
But I wouldn't know what to do in a Turkish bath.
But that's what's so marvelous.
You don't do anything.
They do it to you.
-Come on.
-They do it to you?
.
Well, you and the Shooter are married.
Now, that's something.
It's nothing.
Believe you me, honey, it's nothing.
You know you got somebody that wants to spend the rest of his life with you too.
How'd you like to spend the rest of your life with Shooter?
.
Least you know how much you mean to somebody.
Last card.
Possible flush.
Pair of eights.
Nothing there.
Pair of queens.
Possible flush.
Queens check to the possibles.
Two thousand.
Two and up two.
Fold.
Fold.
I fold.
This Cincinnati Kid, he wants a game, huh?
.
-He does.
-ls he any good?
.
Come on.
You know he is.
That's the biggest pot yet.
Call the two thou.
Queen high.
-Jack high.
Can you beat that?
.
-He just did.
Hello.
Just a moment.
-Charlie, it's your office.
-Dallas or Tulsa?
.
Probably both.
How the hell did you know I didn't have the king or the ace?
.
I recollect a young man putting the same question to Eddie the Dude.
"Son," Eddie told him, "all you paid was the looking price.
Lessons are extra."
-Here, Lancey.
-Thank you.
You gonna play the Kid?
.
-There's always a Kid, isn't there?
.
-Yes, there is.
But I think you'll enjoy his game.
I may admire it but if what I heard is true, I doubt I'll enjoy it.
Come on, the tougher the competition, the better you used to like it.
Well, what are we waiting for, Shooter?
.
Come on.
Let's go.
Deal them up.
Well, I do declare, Christian.
It's that three-river gambling man, the Cincinnati Kid getting himself all shined up.
How they running, Kid?
.
Fine.
How they running for you?
.
You'll never guess where we've just been.
Stag movies?
.
We went to Turkish baths, and we had rubdowns and everything.
-Yeah.
You should have been there.
-Yeah.
Listen, I heard the big news.
Big news?
.
Yeah.
Everybody says the Kid's gonna sit down with Lancey Howard.
Some say he's gonna be the man.
Or didn't you know, Christian?
.
See you around.
-Double or nothing.
-Call it.
Heads.
You're just not ready for me yet.
Come on.
Let's get something to eat.
I didn't know you were thinking about going home.
When are you going?
.
There's a bus that leaves tonight.
Unless you wanted me to stay.
Until morning, that is.
Well, are you coming back?
.
Well, you never even asked me why I was going.
Well, why are you going?
.
You don't want me around your neck.
Not now, anyways.
Well, I never said that.
You never said anything.
About us.
Listen, Christian after the game I'll be the man.
I'll be the best there is.
People will sit down at the table with you.
Just so they can say they played with the man.
And that's what I'm gonna be, Christian.
I know.
What is it?
.
Marriage?
.
I'm all packed.
Six stacks.
Is that right, Shooter?
.
Six.
Well we've been playing 30 hours.
That rate, 6000, that makes roughly two hundred dollars an hour.
Thanks for the entertainment, gentlemen.
-Thank you.
-Good night.
I'm particularly grateful to Lancey here.
It's been a rewarding experience to watch a great artist at work.
Thank you for the privilege, sir.
Well, you're quite welcome, son.
A pleasure to meet someone who understands that to the true gambler money is never an end in itself but simply a tool, as language is to thought.
Good evening Mr. Slade.
Good evening, Mr. Howard.
Old Shooter.
I wanna see you tonight, my house.
In about 30 minutes.
Now, look, Slade I can't make it tonight.
I promised my wife--
You can make it, boy.
I'll see you tonight.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Quincy-6859, please.
-Good night, Lancey.
-Night.
-Night, Shooter.
-Hi, Kid.
Shooter.
Listen, I told Melba I'd take her with us to the fights tonight, but....
Well, something's come up.
How about if she'd go with you and Christian?
.
Christian isn't here.
She's with her folks for a couple of days.
Did Lancey go for it as a game setup?
.
Yeah.
Just about.
Is it okay if Melba goes with you?
.
-Look, Shooter--
-I promised her.
You know how it is.
Well, I'd appreciate it.
Thanks, Kid.
I'll meet you at my place after the fight.
Well, Lancey, are we all set for Monday night?
.
I can get Lady Fingers to come.
Lady Fingers?
.
I haven't seen that old bitch....
Oh, it must be at least 1 0 years.
Long enough to think of her almost fondly.
-How's she doing?
.
-She's down.
She busted out in a Vegas faro game.
And I'd like to use her as a relief dealer, if that's okay with you.
-Oh, sure.
Sure.
-Well, I guess that's it, then, huh?
.
Eight o'clock Monday.
Apartment 2A at the old Lafayette.
-Yes.
-And may the best man win.
That's how it usually comes out in the long run.
Oh, Shooter tell me is this young man of yours gonna give me any trouble?
.
Yeah.
He's gonna give you trouble.
Well, I hope it isn't gonna be one of those marathon games.
-Not anymore.
-Like the session we had in St. Louis?
.
-Remember?
.
-Sure, sure.
With those hoods from South Chicago?
.
The longest game I ever played was on the maiden voyage of the Mauretania.
Bishop's Rock to Ambrose Light without a stop.
Six days.
Lancey you have been the man for a long time.
That is undoubtedly true.
But don't let that fool you.
I'm not ready to retire yet.
Thank you.
Hello, Kid.
How are you?
.
Hey, kids.
Hey, Kid.
Over here!
I got two seats for you....
Do we have to sit with them?
.
Sit where you want to.
Come on, Jessie, move yourself.
Come on there, boy.
Hey, hey.
-Hello, Hoban.
-Where's the Shooter?
.
He's working.
Sokal.
-Hello, Jessie.
-Where's Christian, honey?
.
She went home to mama.
Didn't she, Kid?
.
Can't live with them and can't live without them, huh?
.
Yeah, that's right, Pig.
Don't lose no sweat, Kid.
Mine left me too.
I wonder why.
Who you trying to kid, sister?
.
Soldier's Gray and Gaffer's Gray!
Soldier's Gray and Gaffer's Gray!
Soldier's Gray and Gaffer's Gray!
-Twenty-five and 20!
-Which one?
.
-Soldier's Gray.
-All right.
All right.
Get them up.
Get ready.
Come on!
Let's go out to the car.
Why don't you relax.
-You say 25 and 20?
.
-That's right.
-To lose.
-He's got him.
He's got him.
Looks like you're gonna owe us some money, fat boy.
Don't spend it, baby.
Don't spend it!
Alice Lee, honey, would you like to freshen up Mr. William's drink a little bit?
.
-A little more bourbon, Mr. William?
.
-Thank you, Mrs. Slade.
Now, you just say when.
When.
That's it.
Thank you kindly, Mrs. Slade.
Honey, why don't you go out to the kitchen and bring us some of those fancy little hors d'oeuvres.
Why, that's exactly what I was about to do, sugar.
I declare, Billy, sometimes I think you got psychic powers.
She's a real lady, Mrs. Slade.
That little gal means more to me than the whole wide world, Shooter.
How's your Melba these days?
.
Melba?
.
Well, she's fine.
Just fine.
Yeah, she's a nice girl, Melba.
Girl of quality and taste.
Expensive tastes, I would imagine.
-Well, I guess you might say that, yes.
-Well, that's as it should be.
That's one of the great feminine characteristics.
Taste for fine things.
Of course, we can't always afford to indulge their tastes.
That's the tragedy of it.
That's when they start to drift away.
You know this game that you're dealing for Lancey and the Kid, you know?
.
There's an awful lot of interest developing in that game.
Betting interest, that is.
What would you figure the odds to be, Shooter?
.
Well, I'd say the New York money will probably lay about oh, 8-5 on Lancey.
Personally, I think the Kid's chances are better.
So do I.
So do I.
That's why I'm getting me down a bet.
-Big bet.
-Well, I don't think I'd wanna bet on it.
The Kid could take him, if he's right, but I'd never bet on it.
Lancey Howard is an old man, Shooter.
He's ready for a fall.
Trouble is that the Kid might be nervous, big game like this.
He may be off his form.
He may need a little help.
You know?
.
No, I don't.
I don't quite know what you mean.
-You're dealing the game, aren't you?
.
-Yes.
I thought as long as I'm going to the trouble of putting a bet down for myself I may as well get one down for you too.
Say in the neighborhood of $25,000?
.
I could never do anything like that.
Of course you couldn't.
That's why they chose you to give them a fair deal.
It's out of the question, Mr. Slade.
You see....
If I....
-I tell you, it's just out of the question.
-Merci, Emile.
Well, the Kid's not gonna need much help, Shooter.
Maybe two or three hands at the right time.
Oh, Melba would be mighty proud of you if you won yourself $25,000.
No, I'm sorry, Mr. Slade.
Well, I'm sorry too, Shooter, because you leave me no alternative but to remind you of the fact that I'm carrying these markers on you.
-Twelve thousand dollars, to be exact.
-Those are legitimate markers.
-You gave me two years to pay them.
-Now, wait a minute.
Just because I'm generous or foolish enough to accept your marker one day doesn't mean I'm gonna recognize it the next.
No, sir, no.
That recognition is null and void if I happen to suddenly realize that you are not of sound mind.
You know when I realized that?
.
When I saw you hesitate about accepting that $25,000.
That's right, boy.
You just think that over.
Twenty-five thousand, plus 1 2,000 here.
-That makes....
-Thirty-seven.
Thirty-seven, if memory serves.
Why are you doing this?
.
It can't be for money.
It's for my kind of money.
Gut money.
I wanna see that smug old bastard gutted.
-Gutted.
-Like he gutted you?
.
-Yes, that's right.
That's right.
Hold it.
-I'm gonna be--
Lookie here, now, Cora-Anne and Billy-Bob come to say good night to their daddy.
Well, now, my cottontail bunny rabbits.
Come here.
-Holler if you need anything, now.
-All right.
Do you wanna hear a little bedtime story?
.
About Shooter's wife, Melba?
.
-All right, now--
-I know all those stories.
Well, are you aware of the circumstances on which she left Shreveport, Louisiana?
.
Yes, I'm aware.
Well, some people don't know the story.
I think they'd enjoy hearing it.
It's a story that deserves to be told.
Now, listen carefully, children.
Once upon a time down in Shreveport, Louisiana there was this bad little girl named Melba Nyle.
Relax.
Shooter will be along.
Why don't you make us a drink.
You know where it is.
All that dust at the pit.
I always feel so dirty after one of those things.
Brings out the best in you, Melba.
What does that funny little country gal bring out in you?
.
See anything you like?
.
About the dance, I mean.
Now, don't tell me Shooter's your oldest and best friend.
-That's right.
-He's mine too, honey.
Next you're gonna say he's like a father to you.
You see what that leaves us.
Yeah.
Yeah?
.
Oh, hi, sugar.
Well, then you won't be home for a while.
Yeah?
.
Shooter.
Yeah.
Is the game set?
.
Eight o'clock Monday, apartment 2A at the old Lafayette.
Old Lafayette.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, she seemed to have a pretty good time.
Yeah, she's a fun girl.
Yeah.
You bastard!
I hope you lose.
Thanks, baby.
Day after tomorrow at the old Hotel Lafayette, 8:.00.
Yeah, you better let him know.
They gonna be full up, from what I hear.
Same to you.
You know who that was, Kid?
.
Jollie from Boston--
-You seen Shooter?
.
-No, not today.
Called all the way from Boston.
And Lady Fingers.
Guess you know she's coming.
And Yeller.
There's gonna be a lot of money in town.
Hey, how's it going?
.
Hoban tell you about Yeller?
.
Yeah, I was just telling him.
I'll see you later.
Hey, Kid.
Hey, what's wrong?
.
-Jack Doyle's laying 1 2-5 on Lancey.
-Jack Doyle.
Now, listen, that's old money.
Conservative money.
That's always on the man.
-There's plenty of money on you too.
-It's the waiting.
I'm ready now, and I gotta wait.
Don't let the odds rattle you.
That's the worst that can happen.
-Stay loose.
Relax.
-It's not the odds.
I told you.
-It's the wait.
-Listen, just relax.
I'll see you later, Shooter.
Hey, Kid!
Hi, honey.
-Hi, Kid.
-Hi.
This is a surprise.
-Did you come on the bus?
.
-Well, yeah.
I just came by to see how you were doing.
Mama, this is Eric.
How do you do, Mrs. Rudd?
.
Howdy.
Why don't you sit down, and I'll fix you something.
No, I had something to eat in town.
Come on.
There's some hot biscuits in the warmer.
Come on.
I used to come here and play when I was little.
I'd dream, mostly.
Yeah?
.
About what?
.
Oh, just things that little girls dream about.
There was a story I heard about a wishing stone somewhere on the bank of the Mississippi.
And I used to play like this creek was the Mississippi and that rock over there was a wishing stone.
And if I kissed it and made a wish it'd come true.
What was the wish?
.
Oh, that somebody would come and take me away from here to some big city like New Orleans or Mobile.
Sure was a good dinner, Mrs. Rudd.
Just our usual.
Christian, help your mother with the dishes.
-Ma, we got any cards?
.
-Cards?
.
You know, them playing cards.
We used to have some.
May still be some in that drawer over there.
I don't know how good they are.
Now you can show Papa some of them tricks.
-Tricks?
.
-Yeah.
Like you done with that little shoeshine boy.
-I best get on with my evening chores.
-Oh, please, Papa.
You'll like it.
Pick a card, Mr. Rudd.
Any card you want.
Three of hearts.
Damnedest thing I ever did see.
Hey, you gotta come in and see this one.
Get in here.
-Come on, Mama.
-This is the best yet.
-Come on in here.
-You got any idea what time it is?
.
-Come on.
Get over here, get over here.
-Come on, Mama.
Come on.
I want you to see this.
Now, you look good.
-Show her, Eric.
-All right, Mrs. Rudd.
Now, just take a card.
Any card at all.
Don't show it to me.
The three of spades.
Are you playing tonight or just dealing?
.
-Are you playing tonight?
.
-Yes, I'm playing tonight.
I'm playing.
-How much you gonna win?
.
-I'll win something.
Don't you worry about it.
Twenty-five years.
I've been building a reputation for 25 years.
-My honesty, integrity--
-Remember what you said...
-...about cheating yourself?
.
-What are you talking about?
.
You know what I'm talking about.
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
I'm not gonna give him any help unless he needs it.
Good old honest Shooter.
You know, you remind me more and more of my first husband.
-He was a loser too.
-Well, I'm no loser.
The Kid could break lucky and stay ahead the whole game, couldn't he?
.
Well, it could happen, couldn't it?
.
Sure it could happen.
I mean, be there to see that it does.
Won't you, Shooter?
.
Take me around the block a couple of times.
You did tell the Kid 8:00, didn't you?
.
Yes, I did.
Well?
.
Hello, everybody.
-Lady!
-Piggy, Pig, Pig.
Doctor.
Oh, how lovely.
-Lady Fingers.
-Yeller!
Good to see you.
-Hiya.
-Hi, Ho.
Lady Fingers.
You know the missus.
Mrs. Hoban.
Melba.
-Sorry I'm late, Shooter.
-Lady!
What do you say, sweetheart?
.
Lancey Howard.
The man himself.
My pleasure, Lady Fingers.
You don't get around these parts much anymore.
That's true.
I suppose it's more a matter of climate than anything else.
No other reason?
.
-What other reason could there be?
.
-The Cincinnati Kid.
That's what they're saying, Lancey.
You've been scared of the Kid.
Should I be?
.
Hey, Kid.
He's here.
Damn right.
Hey, you come up slashing, you hear?
.
Hello, Yeller.
Kill that cat, Kid.
-Hello, Kid.
How are you feeling?
.
-Well, I'm feeling great.
-And it's good to see you again.
-Play him close.
Well...
-...
let's get started.
-Yeah.
Absolutely.
Lancey this is Eric Stoner, the Cincinnati Kid.
Lancey Howard.
I'm glad to know you, Lancey.
My pleasure.
How the town treating you?
.
New Orleans always been good to me.
Well, that's fine.
Of course, towns do change, though, don't they?
.
They tell me you're quite a stud player, young man.
-Do they?
.
-That's right.
New York, Chicago, Miami.
Oh, I've been hearing about you for a couple of years now.
Yeller there tells me how you gutted him once with a pair of fours.
That's right.
Remember, Kid?
.
The night you cut me up with the two red fours?
.
Must have overplayed my hand.
Well, that's a dangerous thing to do.
Well, it depends who you're sitting with, Lancey.
-Well, let's play some cards.
-Hoban's?
.
-Yeah.
-I've already looked around...
-...so if you wanna have a look at things....
-Thanks, Lancey, I think I will.
They come from the New Orleans Bridge Club and they've been bonded by the steward.
I seen him take them right out of the safe himself.
And Shooter, Lady Fingers and me just carried them right here.
Hoban's selling them to us at $5 a pack with the usual guarantee.
If it's proved a deck's been juiced, he pays off the losers.
-Who's sitting with us?
.
-The four of us.
Me, Pig, Yeller and Doc Sokal.
-lf that's all right with the both of you?
.
-Fine.
Good.
-Dead.
-Dead.
Now, Kid, what's your game?
.
Stud poker.
Gentlemen if there are no objections, I'm the dealer.
All right.
These rooms have been contracted for, and the ante will be $1 0 per chair per day.
During the breaks for me, Lady Fingers has agreed to deal.
-But she don't care to be a player.
-I'm sorry to hear that, Lady Fingers.
You know how much I enjoy your high style of playing.
You got a lot of style yourself, Lancey.
Thank you.
Let's hope it holds out.
Gentlemen, this game is five-card stud poker.
There's no limit.
No string bets.
You can check and raise.

Shooter knows what he's doing.

Well, he'd better be if he's gonna remain anything at all.

I'll try it.
Five thousand to you, Pig.
Well, that's pretty sweet.
I jack it up and get whipped on both sides.
Lancey?
.
New deck, please.
He don't chase the Kid nowhere.
Read them and weep, boys.
Aces up.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Be funny if the two champs got cleaned up, huh, Yeller?
.
Yeah, man.
Absolutely hilarious.
-What's the action?
.
-Pig's ahead about a grand the Kid maybe 1 200.
-Yeller's up.
-Lancey?
.
Well, the Kid hit him once, and he ain't come back yet.
-He'll take out Pig first.

-Pig don't think so.
I'm sticking.
Ten to the jacks.
Possible straight.
Pair of sevens.
Check those sevens.
Likewise.
I'll bet the size of the pot.

Busted.
No straight, no flush.

I haven't got it.
How much have you got?
.
Eleven hundred.
All right.
Then we'll make it 1 1 00.
Five 1 0, 1 4.
Eleven hundred to you, Pig.
No.
I won't call.
Take it easy, Pig.
Deal me out.
You let him fake you out.
Thanks, Lancey.
Thanks a lot.
Not very lucky, is he?
.
He never has been.
Look, I know it's a little early.
What do you say we take a break?
.
Yeah, let's go a little while.
Thank you kindly, Melba.
Thank you, dear.
You know, Melba, it always distresses me, a man like Shooter here reaching his middle years and still having no assurance of next week's income.
-I know what you mean, Mr. Slade.
-Don't you find that kind of disturbing?
.
Excuse me.
-Say, Hoban....
-And Spider Man died kind of slow.
First they took a kidney, then a gallbladder and then they took his whole damn stomach.
You remember Spider Man, don't you?
.
-Who?
.
-Spider Man.
He was about your age.
-Yes, yes.
-Lady Fingers.
-Will you please help me with the food?
.
-He died kind of slow.
Yeah, man, why don't you come on up to Memphis.
-Things are hot up there.
-Wait.
I'll go with you.
Solid.
-Good crowd.
-Yeah.
You know, Kid you're the best stud-poker player I've seen in 35 years of action.
Thank you, Lancey.
You know, that was a sweet thing you did to the Pig with those jacks.
You saw that coming, did you?
.
Yeah, I saw it coming.
Before I raised?
.
I saw it coming, Lancey.
You ever play down Miami?
.
-Not yet.
-Beautiful town.
Lot of loose money around.
You ought to come down sometime.
-I might do that.
-Gotta have good nerves, though.
You lose the feel of the cards when you have so much action day in and day out.
Unless your nerves can hold.
How are yours, Kid?
.
They've been worse.
I'm not keeping you from anyone, am I?
.
No.
-Girl, maybe?
.
-No.
No.
Well, don't you have a girl?
.
Yeah, well, she's out of town right now.
No unpleasantness, I hope.
Well women are a universal problem in our business.
Of course, it's purely an academic question with me now but in looking back, I think it's best not to look for a fixed thing.
Just tie into something nice when you're away from the action and let it wear itself out.
-Boys?
.
How about some food?
.
-Right with you, Shooter.
Well, I'm glad we had this little chat.
I know we can be friends.
Regardless of what happens.
Yeah, that's right, Lancey.
Regardless.
Well, cheers.
It's a whole new deal.
Good hands all around.
Prosperity for everybody.
You haven't lost your touch, Lady Fingers.
You hear Whistlin' Sam's gone, Lancey?
.
No, I haven't heard.
Yeah.
I had to go down to the morgue to identify him.
-He's a little younger than you, isn't he?
.
-Just deal, Lady Fingers.
A deuce to the man.
King, jack....
Trey.
Busted.
Deuce.
Ace-queen bets....
What's in the pot?
.
Four-twenty.
It's yours, Shooter.
Hoban?
.
You mind shutting those drapes?
.
There, that makes me about even, gentlemen.
In a game like this, that's a smart place to quit.
If it's all right with all of you, I'll just do the dealing.
Ace-king bets.
Doc you're high.
Ace-king bets.
One moment, please.
Nine hundred and thirty.
You and that damn book.
What are you writing in that book, Sokal?
.
Nine-thirty to you, Lancey.
What have you got?
.
It doesn't matter.
If you can call, you can beat.
Ace, king, seven.
Ace, king, 1 0.
How about that mess.
I had them both beat with a pair of fives.
What do you keep betting out for?
.
The bet was correct.
He should not have called.
He shouldn't have, eh?
.
Better write yourself a new book, daddy.
Gentlemen I'm wasted.
I'll settle for the 1 700 that I've already lost.
Later.
Gentlemen, I, too, will withdraw.
Well just the two of us, Kid.
Deal them up, Shooter.
Cost you a grand.
Well....
Compulsory call, Kid.
Two pair, jacks up.
Kings up.
Last card.
Nine to the kings.
Ace.
Pair of aces bets.
Bet the pot, 2700.
-Two thousand.
-Call.
Last card.
Three sevens.
Two pair, 1 0s and sixes.
-Three sevens bets.
-Two thousand more.
Take it, Lancey.
I can't beat three sevens.
I'd like to take a break now and sleep.
It's not my place, because I'm winners, but I'm saying it.
Sure, sure.
We'll start again at 5.
All right?
.
Right.
How's it going, Lancey?
.
Lady, that young man is a stud-poker-playing son of a--
He's getting to you, huh, Lancey?
.
No, not yet, he isn't.
-I folded winners in that last hand.
-That's a hell of a thing to do.
I got so lucky getting that fifth card, I got embarrassed.
You crazy?
.
That's no way to play poker.
I thought it was time to ask, what are you trying to pull?
.
-Nothing.
What are you talking about?
.
-You, Shooter, man.
You been dealing me cards for an hour.
Like hell l--!
No, Kid-
- No, listen.
Listen, Kid.
Kid.
Even if I was, nobody could spot it.
You know that.
I'm too good a mechanic.
Kid you gotta understand.
This wasn't my idea.
Look, Slade's got the squeeze on me.
Think I wanna deal phony?
.
Think it don't mean something to me?
.
-With my reputation?
.
-Get this straight.
No fix.
You deal it clean, or I'll blow it.
-But Slade won't buy that.
-Slade ain't gonna know.
I'm gonna win this game, Shooter.
And I'm gonna win it my way.
And you ride along with it, or you're out.
You're finished.
Okay, Kid.
I wanna leave a call for 4 p.m. sharp.
Yeah.
This is Lancey Howard.
Could you call me in a couple of hours, please?
.
Thank you.
No, Lady, he hasn't gotten through to me yet.
But he damn well might.
Good afternoon, sir.
It's 4:00.
It's only 25 to 4.
You can stay right where you are.
Melba....
I came to wake you up.
You are awake, aren't you?
.
Yeah, I'm awake.
Well?
.
You're quite a girl, Melba.
Still worried about Shooter?
.
You wanna get that, honey?
.
I ordered some coffee.
Christian.
They took a break in the game to get some sleep and Shooter sent me to wake him up.
Well, I guess I'd better get back downstairs.
See you later.
You sure got a great sense of timing, Christian.
-Anything happen?
.
-No, Kid paired kings.
Won 1 00.
Eight.
Five.
Queen bet.
What have you got?
.
Three nines.
Eight will bet 200.
No stay.
New deck, please.
Two hundred.
-And up five.
-Fold.
Jack.
Eights bet 2000.
I'm not that curious.
-Gents, I'm declaring a break.
-I don't want a break.
Go on.
Deal the cards.
Same deck is good enough.
No, I'll take a new deck.
All right, all right.
Give him a new deck.
Deal them.
You want them, deal them yourselves.
I'm going to the john.
Gotta get something to eat and take a nap.
If you don't like it, you can both go to hell.
I guess that's it.
Yeah, it looks that way.
How long you wanna take?
.
Well, let's make it an hour.
Okay with you?
.
Sure.
You okay?
.
Sure, sure.
Just a little stiff, that's all.
Slade wants to see you.
There's nothing to talk about.
It'd be a big mistake to think that, Mr. Stoner.
Believe me.
How do you like that steak, Kid?
.
It's okay.
It's good.
I thought we should get together and see whether we could settle our differences.
-What I told the Shooter goes.
-You gonna say no before we've even discussed it?
.
What am I to think?
.
Are all my arguments gonna be wasted?
.
Why don't you give the Kid some more salad there, Felix.
No, thanks.
Okay.
We'll skip to the final argument.
Old Shooter's gonna be dealing again when the game starts.
He's gonna give you an occasional helpful card.
-You call that an argument?
.
-No, that's a fact.
The argument's leaning over there against the door jamb.
Now, let me give you a fact.
I'm not gonna let it happen.
I'm gonna beat Lancey Howard, Slade.
But I don't need your help to do it.
Let him go, Felix.
What's the matter with you, Shooter?
.
You don't look too good.
Why not lay down for a while.
-You feeling all right?
.
-No, I'm okay.
-What are you talking about?
.
-You know.
-He's been sick all night.
-No, I'm all right.
You should have said something about it.
We got Lady Fingers here, or we can deal ourselves.
-I'm fine.
I tell you--
-Olean.
Wake up Lady Fingers.
Ask if she's ready.
You ready, Lady Fingers?
.
As Eddie the Dude said on his deathbed, "I'm as ready as I'll ever be."
I can't persuade myself you have a flush.
I'm gonna pay the price to look at that third nine.
I say the jack isn't there.
My bet.
Up five.
Fold.
The Kid's pushing him now.
Old man's crumbling.
Kid's gonna take him yet.
Eight.
Ten.
Ten bets.
Five hundred.
Deal.
Pot's right.
Queen and two diamonds.
Pair of 1 0s.
Tens bet.
Thousand dollars.
-Up 1.
-Seventy-five to 50.
-He's paired the queens.
-Thousand to you, Kid.
I'll just call.
Three diamonds and a possible.
An ace to the 1 0s.
Three thousand dollars.
Three thousand to you, Lance.
I don't think he will fold.
And I don't think he's got the queens.
He's going for the flush.
Reasonable bet.
He's going for the flush.
Kid's got him.
He's going all the way.
Deal the cards.
Nine of diamonds and a possible flush.
Possible straight flush.
The ace of spades.
Two pair.
Two pair bet.
Check to the possible.
-One thousand.
-He's got the flush.
Call your thousand and raise what I've got in front of me.
Thirty-five hundred.
That ace must have helped you, Kid.
Call your 3500, and I'll raise you 5000.
By God, he's got the jack.
-Couldn't have the jack.
-He didn't have queens.
-He's got the jack of diamonds.
-No.
-He's trying to buy it.
-He's bluffing, ain't he?
.
Sure he is.
He hasn't got the jack.
The Kid's got him.
Yeah.
-The Kid's got him.
-The Kid's got him.
You're right.
The Kid's got him.
I got him.
I got the man.
Five thousand to you, Kid.
I'll take your marker, Kid.
I can get the money.
I know you can.
Okay.
Let's see it.
That's 5000 you owe me, Kid.
You still playing, Kid?
.
No.
I'm through.
You raised him 1 0s on a lousy three flush.
Gets down to what it's all about, doesn't it?
.
Making the wrong move at the right time.
Is that what it's all about?
.
Like life, I guess.
You're good, Kid but as long as I'm around, you're second best.
You might as well learn to live with it.
What happened, Kid?
.
-What's the tab for this whole show?
.
-Great play.
You had to do it, didn't you?
.
-You had to go your own way.
-Quiet.
Listen, I'm sorry, Kid.
I was wrong.
I had you figured for brains.
You blew it this time, didn't you, boy?
.
You really blew it.
Hey, Cincinnati.
Come on, man.
Come on.
I'm gonna get you one more time.
Come on, Mr. Gambling-Man.
I can cut you.
I can do it.
Stand up.
Come on, Cincinnati.
Just one more time.
Come on, man.
What you afraid of?
.
Come on.
You get up here.
Just one more time.
Come on, daddy.
Let's see you cut that.
Come on, Cincinnati.
Let's see you cut it.
Come on.
Come on, Cincinnati.
Let's see you cut that.
You tried too hard, man.
You just ain't ready for me yet.

This film was restored in the laboratories of the Brazilian Cinema Foundation, São Paulo.
THE BLOOD OF MINAS
Today we present you THE BLOOD OF MINAS, Phebo's fourth cinematographic work.
We chose to give it that name, not because of some provincial chauvinism, but, first and foremost, because of that vigorous spirit of Brazilianhood, which is today reanimating and re-educating the new Brazilian generations.
By recording customs and facets of life in Minas, although in quick details, we try to register, in a way, a part of the simple and kind soul of our people.
A large part of this film was shot, in several sequences both indoors and outdoors, in the wonderful mansion of Monjope, owned by José Mariano Jr., the great champion our colonial traditions, this fact being in itself one of the
stronger, if not the strongest, points of interest in our work.
Carved between mountains, in its naive girlish dazzle,
Belo Horizonte is the Enchantment-City, the Repose-City, the Orchard-City...
The industrialist Juliano Sampaio, although young, is a strange human figure whose passion for traditions is reflected in the architectural design of his mansion.
Roberto, intimate friend of the industrialist Sampaio, and a frequent visitor of the Mansion.
Can you drive, Franco?
To tell you the truth, I was born in a garage.
I will never be baffled in the complex multiplicity of their fundamental structure, before the arcane mysteries of good driving...
Don't be late.
I've seen - and I'm increasingly convinced of - the undeniable ways in which Carmen constantly demonstrates her feelings of filial affection.
I've adopted her when she was only ten days old.
She and Neuza, my daughter who's returning from college today, are sisters of the same age.
Stay on this same road.
She's the adopted daughter of Sampaio, the industrialist.
Maximo, let's go.
This hunting thing is pointless.
By now I bet your mother is already nagging.
That was Maximo's cousin.
He studies in Rio, and he's spending his holidays at his aunt's place.
His name is Cristovam.
They live in the country house of World-End, on the outskirts of town.
You go ahead.
When aunt Martha is done with her taking I'll... show up.
Now that Neuza is coming after spending four years in college,
Daddy will open up the mansion for a grand feast in honor of St. John.
World-End, recently transformed in an elegant cottage by one of his last masters, is, nevertheless, the property of one descendant of the Tavares family
- severe in its customs and zealous of its past traditions.
My son: you must think less about hunting and more about fulfilling your duties as a man.
I am today reduced to you and Tufy: a son and a grandson.
Don't forget that our house is mortgaged.
Don't hang out with Christovam.
He has no idea of what poverty means.
Don't worry about me, Aunt Martha.
Once the St. John night is over
I will be on my way.
This is indeed the end... of the World.
Time for lunch.
On St. John's night...
The city's mundane world now requires the presence of Neuza - a light figure of a modern girl educated in the American way.
Meanwhile, far from the city, St. John's night is quite different.
I'm taking Christovam to a ball in the city.
Tonight of all nights, my son, when everything is prepared:
the fire, the dinner...
I'll just introduce Christovam and I'll be back right away.
Very well.
I'll wait for you.
We must take the chariot.
The car is broken.
I promised Mother I'd be here soon afterwards.
You'll stay at the ball and I will return.
What ball!
If we're going, it is to have fun...
What about Mother...
The fire...
The party she gives every year...
Nevermind Mother!
Nowadays the real St. John's fire is the cabaret.
Let us see how lucky Carmen is.
The times have changed.
And traditions have gone with them...
The cult of beautiful things from the past disappeared.
You can have dinner.
And let the fire burn and now I don't know what to do...
I feel so forlorn...
I never felt so alone...
Forlorn, no.
You'll stay with us.
It would be humiliating to return
My child.
Abduction or escape, the important thing is to solve this mystery, which, of course, is bound to create a scandal around my name.
Who knows if the said escapee or abductee didn't leave a note?
I couldn't find anything.
There is no limit to youth's volatility.
In their ever refreshing joy great sorrows are, for the young, small accidents.
Touché!
Eureka!
There she is, the escapee, illuminating the lugubrious rocks of these formidable millennial mountain ranges.
Unlike what I said some days ago, I don't know when I'll be back.
The weather is magnificent and the air of the mountains is doing wonders for me.
There's also the hunting, the swimming with Max and the long walks in these beautiful nooks of Minas.
I almost forgot about Rio but I remember all of you.
... and he wanted to meet you.
I'll give it to you if you tell me what you were discussing.
I'll tell you if you give me that goat-cart.
We only found about you yesterday.
You must return with me now.
Daddy is very anxious about all this.
Impossible, Neuza.
I won't feel comfortable about coming back.
I am the only one to blame.
But I didn't know, Carmen.
I swear I ignored everything.
And since that night there's nothing more between Roberto and me anymore.
I'm indifferent to Roberto's name.
What I can't conceal is the nostalgia I feel for our home.
And you also miss him, Carmen.
I don't believe in that indifference.
Don't get upset, man.
It is just a joke.
Some joke!
You are a coward!
A rascal!
Max, let's stop.
Let's leave it there.
Christovam needed a lesson.
He is the family idiot.
Making that good girl suffer..
Max, forget about it.
This is a misunderstanding...
Not at all.
What you did was a huge disappointment for everyone.
I didn't mean it, Carmen.
I am sorry.
You are the only reason of my sojourn here.
I'll leave tomorrow, but I want to have your forgiveness.
You don't have to go.
I don't want you to leave this house, where
I've been so happy, because of me.
You've made a mistake.
But I promise to forget about it and pacify things.
Franco.
Now I understand how stupid I've been.
I'm very sorry.
Find me a chance to talk with Carmen and Neuza in a safe place.
My true love, as you know, is Carmen, the only person I ever loved.
I need to explain things and for that it is necessary to have a meeting with both of them.
You are intimate with industrialist Sampaio, so you can help me.
I come on behalf of my niece, Neuza.
She wishes to speak to you.
You better not take too long.
I just wrote to our friend Franco about it.
Nobody is as interested as me in the resolution of this incident.
I've witnessed unpleasant scenes in the mansion.
I'm deeply sorry.
I'll try to meet Sampaio the industrialist together with Franco.
Youth's recklessness often conjures pleasures with destructive consequences.
On the night of St. John a cloud fell over the mansion which was not yet dispelled.
I've been convinced of your guilt since the beginning.
It's the result of the education given in schools today.
I'm determined to end this scandal once and for all.
No, dear father, don't talk like that.
I'll deal with it myself.
Think of my happiness for one second.
Daddy...
You don't understand..
It is youth...
Love...
I love him so much.
So much...
Go.
Confabulations of this sort - given its diplomatic context - only I can handle them.
You can say I was born in a consulate.
A few days later, Franco, a refined diplomat, puts his vast knowledge to practice.
I'd rather never see him again.
But since it is Neuza's happiness we're talking about...
Seeing these abundant effluvia of kindness, I happily return, reassured of the consummation of the said conventicle.
But, Carmen...
All regret deserves forgiveness.
I'm not interested in forgiveness.
Go back to Neuza and don't ever disturb my life's tranquility again.
You're being unfair.
You don't want to understand me.
You've forgotten everything.
Our love, our promises...
And you laugh.
Very well, you shall never see me again!
Don't be scared.
I just want to talk to you.
Before leaving I was searching for an opportunity, such as this one, to confess you many things.
I still haven't felt in you, Carmen, nothing that can be compared to the affection that grew during the sweet time we spent together in those unforgettable days in World-End.
Talk to me.
Open up your heart.
I want to know what's inside...
I've once won your forgiveness.
Now I hope to win a little more: your love.
Behold the irrefragable assertion of my prophetic predictions.
Happiness, Neuza, can be whimsical sometimes.
It demands sacrifices before it can be conquered.
Listen, Max:
Christovam sent us a check to pay the mortgage.
What are you thinking about, my son?
I noticed you're not the same since Carmen's departure...
Every person has its own fate in life.
And you're too young to worry about such things...
Write to Christovam thanking him.
And think a little more about us: my old age and Tufy's future.
Carmen, a letter from Max.
I miss World-End...
THE END
Hey, I'm talking to you
Give me 600 dollars
You wish!
That's all we've left
And you still go to gamble
Shut up
I earn the money
Even that you can't take it for gamble
Shut up
What're you doing?
Bastard, I'm gonna beat you
You gambling pig, I'll beat the shit out of you

The way she's now
Do you want to give me trouble?
I'm in more trouble than you
I am a woman
I'm a sailor
You take care of Marble
Just gamble a bit less is enough to raise the kid

Raising her would be like raising others' wife
No advantage
A lost business

And you tell her to be smart
Don't marry a gambler
Hey, you want a quarrel?
No, never
This is the last time
You're SO right

That's only for boys
Yeah, I have a wee-wee.
Have you?
Aunty Chiang Lin, one more baby this year?
Yes
You are the best in your family
Hey, you think it's my will
I was compelled by my stupid husband
Come on.
Let's worship first
Eat some roast pork
We have a lot of it
Honey, do we have our share if we got a baby?
Yes.
Only with Chinese blood
What do you mean?
It means I give you a green hat
Oh, that goes with my clothes then
Eat, no more talk!
So rude.
Take it home
Get up, go
We're going back home
Be quick
Honey
Hey, make a stance
Hold it...
Master, every time we've to stand in a pose
If you could teach us something else please
Okay
Shaolin Masters learn poses for years
Hold it...
Okay.
I'll teach you something new
Watch me
See.
Get to it
Seeing Shanghai Beach in Mainland
Here I'm still watching it everyday
I'm so tired
Tired?
Let's go to bed for rest
I hate Chau Yun Fa the most
He didn't marry when I'm in China
As soon as I'm here, he got married
You can't come to Hong Kong if you don't marry me
You said you are big boss
Having a big business
Now that I'm in Hong Kong ...I'm still a country woman
What country woman?
I feel sorry for myself
Then I ought to feel much more sorry
You can't even lay an egg
This year I can only get one share of pork
And you're blaming me for it?
Damn monkey...
What's going on?
A letter for you
Oh, it's you
Your monkey glared at me fiercely
Will you open it for me?
Read it to me.
I am quite illiterate
Stop it.
Don't bother him
Let me help you.
Give me the letter
Postman's duty is to deliver and read letters
He reads for Aunt Jiao
How can you compare to her?
Aunty Jiao is 83 years old
Hello, dubbing room
Martin?
Martin is working
Are you lying to me?
Why should I lie?
I know he's free.
Get him
You listen yourself then
Hello, what's the noise?
Is someone being raped?
Martin, your telephone
Hello
What took you so long?
Recording is going on
Don't mess around
Yes, I know.
I won't
Honey, I couldn't help myself... and spent $12.70
Why did you spend so much?
I was late for work... so I took a taxi
On your way back don't forget to buy vegetables
Okay
And buy a pair of slippers for me
Got it, honey
I'll hang up.
Bye
Wouldn't marry if you know your wife is so bad!
Take pity for the rest of my life
Hey, what's on your neck?
Nothing
You look piteous
She's the piteous one
The vampire is here
Grandma, grandma
Someone is fighting
Grandma, grandma
Come over quickly
What happened?
Someone is fighting
Fighting?
Yes
Where?
Over there!
You see it?
I spare you this time.
No next time
Sorry, let me kiss you
Cut the bullshit.
Go to bed
I need to work tomorrow
Where at?
That villa over there!
Wow, it looks beautiful
Who lives there?
Snow White
Kidding, there's no Snow White
Oh, murder
That's the pig scream
Why's the pig screaming so late at night?
Shorty's father... always kills the pig this late
Why so late?
So the government won't know
But how could a pig's scream be so terrible?
Why?
Why aren't you tired?
Why aren't you sleepy?
Why haven't you gone to bed?
Why are you so nosy?
Go to sleep!
Here's the kitchen
Oil.
Salt.
Sauce.
Vinegar.
All there
Go tidy up
Ask me if you have any question
Come dance with me
Come on
Come
Dance
I'll teach you.
Don't be afraid
Damn dog!
Damn it!
What's such a big deal to be rich?
Pay for my pants
Sorry.
I don't mean to be rude
Be careful next time
Miss, it seems I've seen you somewhere
Of course you have
I'll be the Miss Hong Kong in next contest
I have nine posters at the Ferry pier
And I've been handing out my photographs all around
Never seen one as rude as you
Chang Jin
This girl is great.
She lives in your village?
Of course she's from our village
The beauties only live in my village
And the ugly ones only live in your village
Miss, I want my BALL back
We're back from Holland
Shall we make a friendship?
My dad said she got married
Married?
No way
Look at her curves!
She sure knows how to keep fit
Maybe she never takes birth-control pills
Hey, pals
Be nice to a girl, huh?
What do you mean?
You think you're a kungfu master?
Get the ball back
Okay
We're friends.
If you don't give me face
At least for my Dad's sake... let's not make a fuss of this
Are you alright?
He hits me.
Beat him
Stop
Just playing.
Stop
What're you on about?
I've stopped.
Why don't you stop?
I'll let you go, damn kid
Don't let me see you again
I'll kill you next time
Let's go, go
Waste of strength!
Post-boy.
You think you're good
We're taking pity on you
Yeah
Go, go
Your parcel is rejected from your hometown
Wait a minute!
Sorry to bother you again
Please sign
Where's Wang?
He went to Kowloon on business
Oh, you're bleeding?
Who hurt you?
Let me help you
Suppressing anger is not a good thing
What?
Let me clean your wound
No
Okay, I won't touch you
I'll give you some water, do it yourself
How often do you deliver each day?
What are you drawing so late at night?
Go to bed.
You have class tomorrow
Go to sleep now
Dad, I'm going to school now
Go now.
Don't be late
Okay, I know
A shepherd drove sheep on the hill
Watching farmers farming below...
Jin Bao
I have twenty of them
Give me one
No way
My uncle smuggled it from Mainland
What is it?
How about I exchange one with a secret
What secret?
Last night the White Man tortured his wife
I don't believe you
He's so coward to his wife he'll never beat her
Then will you give me?
What kind of a secret it is?
Okay, forget it
The shepherd laughed...
Master
Good morning, teacher
I've taught you... to write yourselves a letter
And learn to write your home address
That'd help uncle Postman to deliver
No, Mister Postman
Oh yes, calling 'uncle' is too old
Yes
Now come out to get your letter when I call you
Wang Jia Leung
Here
Wang Shi Chung
Here
Shu Ker Ying
Here
She's a cripple!
Don't laugh at her
Wang Jia Hao
Here
Wang Jie Hwa
Here
Wang Wan Wen
Here
Wang Tian Sheng
Here
Marble
Mister
You have a letter from your dad
Your Grandma said he's in Panama
What has he written?
Just ask your Grandma
No
My Dad is dead
Don't curse him
I don't like him
Go away
Go away
Let me go
Let me go...
Damn dog
Go away
Let go of me
The damn dog bites anything it sees
I always get bitten when delivering letters
Don't tell people about it
I won't.
I'll do as you said
You'll be responsible if anyone knows
I never lie to a child
I'll keep your secret
Let's hook our pinkies
I'll be true to my word
Wait for me?
When I'm young no-one likes me
I hope someone would love me like crazy
If not, I hope I have lots of money
If no money, I wish I can be famous
Let everyone know me at least
If I have nothing else
I hope I'm prettier than others
Staying pretty longer is okay
Being a woman is indeed tragic!
But you have everything now
How poor of you, silly girl?
You never stay with me overnight
You'd better find an excuse to convince me
My wife doesn't understand me
Take any man in the world
Not one would say his wife understands him
I really love you
Not for your money
Don't think you're Santa Claus
Why would I do this?
So cheap!
Go to bed early
Don't abuse drugs
Wang, give me a red cloth
Okay
Lin, give him a red cloth
Big one or small one?
Big one, of course
Did you make this?
Of course I made this cloth
You think old Wang can do that?
You are good
Your hand is so white, I believe you'd have made it
Lin, go to work if you've nothing else
Okay, five dollars
Bin, why did you have to come yourself to buy?
What else do you need?
Nothing else.
I'll come later
See you
I know all the neighbours around here
Hey, get the button fastened
I can't breath if I fasten up
Or you buy me a new dress
Okay, okay
Let me take you to the discount stall
Discount stalls only sell cheap stuff
I want to visit the fashion shop
Look at you
Just two months here you've learned it
I learned all about it long before I came
Then you be good
I'll buy you anything you want
Okay?
Then ain't I good enough now?
Good, you're good
Sir, I would like to know... if there's a new villa here?
You've real talent
Among the mistresses of my husband
You own the most beautiful house
Thanks
You can have anything you want?
Sure
He's my Santa Claus
You think you're young?
Whatever.
I'm younger than you
I heard you're a dancer
What kind of dance are you good at?
The kind that takes hard work... and looks like mad jumping
You have money now
Why work so hard?
Is money everything?
No?
Depends on the person
Don't say you love my man
No, we use each other
What are you laughing at?
One night your husband told me... his wife doesn't understand him
He lies, you fool
It's not bad he lies to me in that way
My husband is sure in bad luck
He has a mistress like you
He is in luck actually
Because he met me
You're just a whore
What are you here for?
You're great
Let me show you something
No.
Okay, you can go now
You don't like me a bit?
Like you what?
What good are you?
Oh, I dare not
Don't be afraid.
There's a rug here
Give her a hand
Get up, get up
Be serious.
Come
One more time
I can't
Use the hip.
Come.
Ready
Go
See, you can do it
Got weak hips.
I can't get up
Forget it
You are a porn star.
No need to get up
You bald head
You should be an extra forever
Oh, I am now
Yao Ju, come
Coming
You play with him
Hold it
Get me a suit from the wardrobe
What's that for?
Meet your girlfriend
That one
You want it however she looks
You take all whatever the age
My girl is beautiful
And who is that?
Nanny!
Yao Ju
Who's she?
I don't know
Why do you always come to me?
I have things to do
Then I'll wait for you
You have to wait a long time
I'll wait for you
Then you have to wait a long time
What's wrong with me?
At least I am with single mind
Why do you hit her?
Yeah, why do you hit me?
Don't you think I don't dare
I'll kill you
You don't want me
You dump me after you have had sex with me
Isn't it just for money?
No, it isn't for money
I love you
I am not for money
I really love you
You're crazy
Just make a run
Or I'll cut you to pieces
Damn shameless bitch
Let's play rubber-band rope
Come, let's play rubber-band rope
Come on
Don't go
Come
In any event let's clarify our relationship today
You have a husband
My husband is no use
Lower your voice
What're you afraid of?
No need to fear if you dare to do it
In short, I'll give you money
Money... yes, I'll need a lot of it
You think you can afford?
You're prepared, huh?
Let me tell you now
My cousin will come next month
He'd need cash for permit and ID card
That takes 50,000 dollars
Are you worth it?
Maybe I'm not worth it
But if I spread word of our affair around...
You'll be in deep trouble
And that woman is more trouble enough
You think I don't know she's a mistress
Just think what if her man knows ...of your affair!
Perhaps you can bear losing face
She can't
You have no money, she has
You hit me!
My husband never dare hit me.
How dare you!
Rape!
Help!
I'm being raped... please help!
Help!
Rape!
Someone rapes me
Stop it.
That will kill her
Hey, that's not enough
What's that for?
It's for you
Carnation
Like it?
Carnation is only for mothers
Mother's Day?
Do you ever give anything to your Mom?
She wants nothing
She only wants money
As if someone would marry you!
She'll have three kids in her teens
Get fat as a barrel and smell bad
She'll get up every day at six-thirty
Cook an egg for your breakfast
And says it's good for you
Every week you go to Kowloon for tea once
Every half a year you'd take a photo
You have nothing
You laugh at my poverty?
No
At least I have everything
But you don't have a husband
That's okay to me
You say so for sure
I'll go now
If he doesn't find me on the phone ...then I'll truly have nothing
If he lies to his wife, he can lie to you
Are you sure he has no-one else?
That's none of your business
What about me?
I left that woman because of you
What about this?
I don't even know who'd get the money
I don't care
Let go
Sit
"RITA"
Miss Rita
Last night I passed by your house
Your dog scared me
Then I fell down
And dropped a ring
It's my husband's gift
You know when a man gives you some gift
It's no good if you were to lose it
He'll be unhappy
Did you see it?
Help me to find it, please
The ring is worth 100,000 dollars
I'll help you to find it
Then I'll wait for your news
I'm so sorry
Even she can have such an expensive ring
When I studied in Grade Two
I already hated women
That class girl captain... told the teacher I peeked at her
And the teacher hit me hard for it
I was hit so hard that it broke the ruler
In university I studied the Tang dynasty poems
It said women are tender and passionate
But I found it to the contrary
Women and mean people are hard to deal with
It wasn't easy for me to stay away from women
Now I wouldn't want one anymore
Women are poison!
You're right
Let's toast
Tonight when you're home
You should punish your wife hard
All men are brothers!
Great.
I'll punish her tonight
Fifty to hundred thousand each call
Your threat is never-ending
After this time...
Once and for all, I'll leave
You take this man
I'm tired of him
If you're that crazy for men...
I'll give my Wang to you, too
Stupid
Where're you going?
Grandma, Grandma.
Come on
Murder
Grandma, hurry
What's that serious?
Someone is killed
Hurry, have a look!
Where?
Over there, you see?
What nonsense!
There's nothing there
It's really a murder
Hey, stop talking rubbish!
Go to bed
Stop looking
Kids are innocent
Shorty, don't move
Stop moving
Shorty, Shorty
It was terrible last night
I saw two guys fight
And then one person... killed the other!
The killer wore a chain
You know, I could... pull out some hair from the killer
But Grandma doesn't believe me
If you'd please check for me
What're you doing?
You haven't finished your hair-cut?
What happened?
Go and see
Quick
What is it?
Quick
Come, be quick
This is the White Man's house
This is the villa
This is where Jin Bao lives
I live right here
That night
I saw a murder in there
Hey, what's this?
It's a watchband
You can't even recognise it in picture, stupid
Hold it.
Hold it.
Hold it
What's this?
Silly fool, it's Ninja
That night
The whole night it was thunderous
Under the tree
I saw two guys were fighting over there
And then one man... killed the other
The killer wore a watchband too
I saw it
But I'm not scared
Then I went out and took a look
But he had run away
I just saw some hair and a lot of footprints
Now our first move... is to check out who's missing in the village?
What are you doing here?
Where's your wife, uncle?
Looking for my wife at your age?
You have guts
Go away
I'll get your Dad to take you back
You'd better spend time on study
And stop running around
Go home
Wang, where's your wife?
My wife is sick, okay!
Nosey
Have you seen the White Man and his wife?
Shin, go home for meal
Hurry
Always playing
Marble, time for work
Don't run around
I'm working right now
Look here.
On the rock
Here
It's real
The White Man
Women are sick, vicious... and fierce.
We should kill them all
Kill, kill, kill
Then we'll never have to bear with them
What is the time?
Oh, time for work
Get lost
Why are the floor so dirty?
Hey, what're you doing?
I just came early to tidy things up
See, what have you done!
I...
White Man.
It's him
Little girl
Little girl
Wake up
Little girl
Wake up
You okay?
Are you all right?
But that can't be evidence
That's the record in my children's diary
This proves that everyday he thought of murder
Did your teacher tell you... not to lie to the police?
I have more evidence
Take it out
I saw that after he killed his wife... he dragged the corpse away, too
That night he didn't return home
He went out for drinks
Got drunk and slept on a rock
And he cursed the women too
He almost killed me
What a bad White man
Always thinking to kill people
Chinese won't do that
The Chinese don't have that power
Go and see
Hi
Police?
What're you doing?
Playing chess
Play chess?
Is it illegal to play chess?
You have a warrant, sir?
Of course, see
It's marijuana
Go away...
What are you looking?
Nothing good to see
Move away
Hey, what're you doing?
He's my husband
He just slapped me slightly
Is it illegal the husband slapping his wife?
Actually I let him slap me
Why are you arresting him?
Where are you going?
I just went back to my Mama's house
Why don't you call me these few days?
Who is he?
His sworn brother
What's a 'sworn brother'?
Move.
Don't pretend anymore
Sir, he's innocent
Don't arrest him
Girl, don't lie
Sir, please don't arrest my husband
Don't arrest my husband
Let him go
Dear
Hello, Miss Rita
Why?
Why am I being fired?
How do I guess if you don't tell me?
Mister Postman.
Mister?
No-one believed the murder I told you about
What clue do you have?
I suspected Wang's wife is dead
Oh, dead?
Good if she's dead
Wang, you got mail
It's hot outside.
Come and have a seat
Have some tea
Busy?
Yeah, the past few days has been killing!
A lot more people at the festival this year!
You ought to take your girlfriend along
I don't have a girlfriend
You're kidding
Where's Mrs. Wang?
Can you not mention her?
Where has she gone?
I don't know where she has gone
Mind your own business, kid
This letter is from my wife
Marble, Marble
Oh, you are here!
Shorty has been calling you many times
Must have found something new
What did she say in the letter?
She ran away with someone
Now she's with someone else
She told me not to think of her
Even though we can't be a couple
She still thinks of writing to me
I knew she is a good girl
Just the men are bad
That's good.
That bitch is gone
Thank God, we'll have peace now
Don't cry
I'm sorry
Shorty and I thought your wife is murdered
What?
I go back to answer the phone
Grandma said many girls... worried that they can't immigrate in 1997
So they all wanted to marry an old foreigner
Those old men are so ugly!
More ugly than Wang
You see, I don't even have time for toilet
Old Wang, just a woman
One left.
More to come
I would get you a good girl later
Grandma
Everyone will quarrel after getting married
Stop being a match-maker
If I don't help them make the match...
They will have no-one to quarrel with
Let's go home
What a crowd!
Look
How much is a pack of tissue?
Fifty cents
What're you doing?
Idiot
I told you Wang's wife is dead
No, lousy kid
I kept a secret for you
What secret?
I won't tell anyone
About you and Wang's wife
Grandma
Xiaoji
Xiaoji
Xiaoji
Xiaoji
Marble, get dressed.
We go to pray
Grandma is bad.
You killed my Xiaoji
You'll have to compensate
No other chicken have folded eyelids
Go...
Wang, what're you doing?
I'm gathering the fire wood
Oh, don't sit here
Sit over there
It'll dirty your pants
And you'll need your Grandma to wash it
I don't care
What did she do?
Did she make you angry?
She's a killer
Jin Bao, faster
Yes
Shorty, Shorty
The village chief gave me 10 dollars to catch grasshopper for the bird
And you won't investigate my case?
All those you mentioned as missing are still alive
I don't know if you're telling the truth
That's no fun
I didn't lie to you
Please help me, okay
Unless...
Unless what?
Unless you let me be the commander
Well, you listen to me whatever I say
The mission we have tonight... is to search the suspects and evidences
Especially that watchband
Yes, especially the watchband
Jin Bao, you watch number one to fifteen
I'm terribly afraid
Jin Ju, you watch number to thirty
Especially my dad, he's fierce
How could your Dad be the murderer?
He dares to kill pigs
If he's the killer, I'll get him
You watch all the shops
Okay
You watch the pigsty and the doghouse
You must obey the order
You gather information
How come I have nothing to do?
Because you walk slow
That's true
Fine.
I'm sick of girls crying
You take my post
Women are troublesome
Everyone take a firecracker as weapon, pass it
Use it only if you see the enemies
The enemies are tough
Be careful.
It's life-threatening
Understand?
Yes
Okay, let's go
Go
If anything please say it now
You don't speak and didn't let me either
You won't understand even if I say it
Has your husband been found?
In this situation
Spreading out isn't the worst.
At the most we could flee
How'd that help?
I am not afraid of getting caught
I know I am poor
All you love is money
Help!
Help!
Shorty, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Come back
Shorty's spirit, come back
Don't be afraid
Shorty's spirit, come back
Shorty, what did you see?
Who is it?
Ghost!
Open up your eye
Shorty, recover
Let's stop the investigation, okay?
We just want you to recover
Yes
Yes, don't be like that
Shorty, don't be afraid... please!
Shorty's spirit, come back
Shorty's spirit, come back
What took so long?
Is it okay?
It's not done yet
Mine is fit for eating?
Marble, come to eat
Shorty's gone mad.
I have no appetite
Hey, come over
I'll let you be the host.
Come
It smells great
Fire's up
It's ready
Don't kill her
Are you alright?
Grandma will never kill your chicken
I'll buy you another chicken tomorrow
I swear I'll never kill your chick
You hear me?
What're you doing?
It's all your fault
I could watch you once
I can't watch you forever
I'm not willing to do that
I didn't hate you
We had been a couple before
I'll burn more food for you
I'll burn paper clothes for you
I'll offer some Chau Yun Fa's photos, too
Wang...
I need to talk to you urgently
Open the door
Wang, I have something to tell you
You'd better brace yourself for this
Don't be shocked out of mind
Actually your wife is dead
I knew you would be stunned
Relax and listen to me
The letters you got
It's all a farce
It's actually the postman
The postman did it
After he killed your wife...
He forged her letter to you
He knew how
The school taught us... how to write to ourselves
Let me see the letter.
Quick
Then I'll get it for myself
So, will you leave?
Where do we go?
To Mainland China, okay?
Whatever
You don't leave until you got trouble
Now you got trouble
Will this all ever be exposed?
Did you leave any evidence?
The trouble is the letter you wrote
What letter?
The letter you forged in her handwriting
I had never written any letter
So the letter Wang had received...
You read to me
I am quite illiterate
Marble, Marble
Come.
Eat something
This is yours
Go on!
How come I have more?
And you have less?
You take this bowl
It's okay for kids to eat more
It's sweet and tasty.
Eat now
Where's the letter?
Oh, I forgot where I put them
Eat...
It's new
Yes.
Eat while it's hot
Relax, Wang
Everything will come out fine
He can't run away
I'll move on
Or grandma will scold me, bye
Bye
Brother Yao
Where were you last night?
It's late.
Time to go
Are you ready?
Yes
You're always the last
Let's go
Where's Marble?
Marble is up the hill with Wang
Ready, go
You see, it flies high
It's great
It's beautiful
Marble, you fly it
It's fun
Be careful.
Be careful
What happened?
Marble, Marble
What are you doing here?
There's a kite there
Yes, go have a look
You see
Jin Bao, be careful
Be careful
Hold on
A little to that side
Pull it down
It hurts
Murderer
It's not us
He fell down by himself.
It's not us
Where's Marble?
She was just here
Help...!
Help!
Help...!
Help!
Mister Postman...
Don't be afraid
Help me
Mister Postman
Help me
Mister Postman
Marble, grab my hand
Wang
Inspector, see
Let me Mr. Butterfly give you a lesson
Do you know how to act?
Your first day at this, huh?
Sorry, Brother Lang
Sorry
Hey, what's up?
What's the matter?
They are all fools
Yes, he's a fool
Be smart
Once again
Let's do it again
One try is okay
Calm down
Come again
Do it better
All standby
Ready
You're shooting movies?
Master, who do you fight with?
That's Wan Ji Lang?
Want a drink, master?
Who's the director?
The one in red glasses
A woman
Yes
Oh no, fell down!
Brother Ji Lang, you okay?
What's wrong with you?
Who taught you that?
All are fools
Yao Ju, come over
Coming
It's my turn.
Don't run around
It's all yours
Yao Ju.
Memorize those moves
Act better
Ready
All standby
Do it better
Don't make trouble
Ready?
Action!
Cut
Okay
Move the machine here
Move it over
Come, over here
Like that?
Okay?
It's fine
You said you'd go to Mainland with me
Really?
Of course you can't remember
I did
Did you see me shooting movie?
A little bit
Next week I'll go to London
I will write to you when I arrive
You better not go
If you don't go, you don't need to write
You'd pay for my living, huh?
No big deal
I don't know what to say
That's rubbish
Okay
Take care
Mister Postman
Marble, are you alright?
Yes
Marble...
It's for you
Is it good?
Do you like it?
- Thirty thousand.
- From the Russians?
No, from the French.
From the Russians we capture more than that every day.
[People Shouting, Chattering]
Mr. Postman.
War is war and schnapps is schnapps, and business must go on.
You didn't leave the mail yet this morning.
Ah, I'm sorry, Mr. Meyer.
Hello, Himmelstoss.
Anything for us today?
- No, no, Master Peter.
- Oh, there must be something.
Here, here you go, young lad. [Laughing]
There.
This is the last mail I deliver anyhow.
- What?
- Tomorrow I change uniforms.
- You're going in the army?
- Yes, I was called.
I'm a sergeant in the reserves, you know.
I'll be called myself, if it doesn't end in a few months.
- It will, though.
- I'm sure you're right, Mr. Meyer.

[Speaking, Inaudible]
...defending our country, our fatherland.
Now, my beloved class, this is what we must do:
Strike with all our power.
Give every ounce of strength... to win victory before the end of the year.
It is with reluctance that I bring this subject up again.
You are the life of the fatherland, you boys.
You are the iron men of Germany.
You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy... when you are called upon to do so.
It is not for me to suggest that any of you... should stand up and offer to defend his country.
But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads.
I know that in one of the schools, the boys have risen up in the classroom... and enlisted in a mass.
But, of course, if such a thing should happen here, you would not blame me for a feeling of pride.
Perhaps some will say... that you should not be allowed to go yet, that you are too young, that you have homes, mothers, fathers, that you should not be torn away.
Are your fathers so forgetful of their fatherland... that they would let it perish rather than you?
Are your mothers so weak that they cannot send a son... to defend the land which gave them birth?
And after all, is a little experience... such a bad thing for a boy?
Is the honor of wearing a uniform... something from which we should run?
And if our young ladies glory in those who wear it, is that anything to be ashamed of?
I know you have never desired the adulation of heroes.
That has not been part of my teaching.
We have sought to make ourselves worthy, and let a claim come when it would.
But to be foremost in battle... is a virtue not to be despised.
I believe it will be a quick war, that there will be few losses.
But if losses there must be, then let us remember the Latin phrase... which must have come to the lips of many a Roman... when he stood embattled in a foreign land:
"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."
"Sweet and fitting it is to die for the fatherland."
Some of you may have ambitions.
I know of one young man who has great promise as a writer, and he has written the first act of a tragedy... which would be a credit to one of the masters.
And he is dreaming, I suppose, of following in the footsteps of Goethe and Schiller, and I hope he will.
But now our country calls.
The fatherland needs leaders.
Personal ambition must be thrown aside... in the one great sacrifice for our country.
Here is a glorious beginning to your lives.
The field of honor calls you.
Why are we here?
You, Kropp, what has kept you back?
You, Mueller, you know how much you are needed?
Ah, I see you look at your leader.
And I, too, look to you, Paul Baumer, and I wonder what you are going to do.
- I'll go.
- I want to go.
- Count on me.
- Me too.
- I'm ready.
- I'm not gonna stay home!
- [All Shouting]
Follow me!
Enlist now!
- No more classes!
- [Others] No more classes!
- Don't be a quitter!
- Come on, Behn!
Stick together.
That's what we've got to do.
- Let's all stick together.
- Come on, Behn.
All right.
All right.
- I'll go.
- That's the way!
Let's go!
Hey!
Let's sing!
Come on!

- Anything you say, General.
- [All Laughing]
Detail, halt!
Left face!
Get into uniform, ready to report.
Fall out!
[All Chattering, Shouting]
I betcha a place like this gets you in good condition.
You have to be for the long marches.
I'm gonna get in the cavalry and ride.
No cavalry for me.
Infantry's where you see the fighting.
Where are all the guns?
That's what I want to know.
Oh, you don't get a gun for a long while yet.
If I'm gonna bump off the enemy, I gotta have some practice.
Ow!
Bayonet drill.
That's what I want.
Ah!
You won a medal that time, Mueller.
You wait.
In about a month I'll be covered with 'em.
Say, keep your boots out of my face!
Why, it's an honor to have those boots in your face.
They're the best pair in the army!
My uncle gave 'em to me.
Just look at that special imported leather.
Put 'em anyplace you like, except in my face.
Not even a kitchen maid'll look at me in this!
Attention!
Well, for the love of...
It's Himmelstoss!
- So it is.
- And all dressed up.
Hello, Himmie.
You didn't think you'd see me again so soon, did you?
- You see my rank?
- Sure.
Fall back, then!
- Himmelstoss, we certainly are glad to see you.
- What did you say?
- I was going to say...
- Never mind!
- What's the matter with you?
- When you address your superior officer, say "sir"!
- Where'd he get such a nice uniform?
- Any mail for us, Himmie?
- Quiet!
- My dear fellow, you're shouting.
Ah, come on, Himmelstoss.
We know ya.
Take off the false whiskers.
- I believe you mean it!
- You'll find out that I mean it.
- But only three days ago you were our postman.
- Silence!
Come back here!
Line up!
Line up!
Get in some kind of a line!
All of you!
Line up, I say!
[Laughing]
[Laughing]
Hmm.
What a pretty sight that is!
Have you never heard of standing in line?
You make a fine mess of it.
Well, I'll have to teach you.
We'll spend the whole day on it, huh?
You may be stupid, but I'm used to that.
And then there'll be plenty of other things too.
Oh, I'll not neglect you.
Hmm.
You're not much to begin with, but I'll do my best.
I see that we have come here with a slight misunderstanding, and we'll correct that, too, won't we, huh?
And the first thing to do is to forget everything you ever knew.
Everything you ever learned, forget!
See?
Forget what you've been and what you think you're going to be.
You're going to be soldiers, and that's all!
I'll take the mother's milk out of you!
I'll make you hard-boiled!
I'll make soldiers out of you or kill you!
Now... salute!
A-ten-hut!
Detachment...
lie down!
Down!
Head down!
Keep your head down, Baumer!
Detachment... get up!
Now sing!
¿¿ [All Singing Feebly, Unintelligibly]
Do you call that singing?
Detachment, halt!
So... we have no spirit, huh?
We are in no mood for recreation.
Work is what we want.
Good!
Then we'll go back to work!
Detachment, lie down!
Keep your head down!
Now sing!

Men... halt!
Order, arms!
Inspection at 3:00.
Dismissed!
[Chattering]
Oh, that swine!
That means we get no time off.
It will take four hours to get ready for inspection.
- I'd like to know what's in his mind.
- He hasn't got any!
I'm gonna cut him open sometime and find out!
He's too thick-skinned.
He won't cut.
This is the fourth time he's made me disappoint that poor girl.
Arms!
Order, arms!
Left shoulder, arms!
Squad right.
To the right, march!
Left, left, left, left.
Follow right, march!

Excellent work.
They're going up front tomorrow.

Crawl forward!
[All Chattering]
He spoiled our leave.
I'll never forgive him for that.
- The rat!
- Leave till midnight.
Hmm!
Lt'll take till midnight to dry our clothes.
There goes the filthy ape now.
While we slave over this mud, he goes off to have a few drinks!
Someday I'm going to take one smack at him... just one.
Me too.
That's gonna be my life's work from now on.
Why only one?
I'm gonna take several.
I might even kick him while he's down.
I feel mean.
What are you doing?
You're not going to desert, are you?
What?

I've got an idea.

- Sounds like more replacements coming in.
Yeah.
Tjaden must have gone home for that wood.
There's some more, fresh from the turnip patch.
[Paul] I suppose this is where we bunk.
That's me, "I. Westhus,"
and this is where I live.
- I didn't know!
- Well, you know now!
Yes.
Yes, of course.
- It's all right.
- [Soldier] Here's a bunk, Paul.
- When did we eat last?
- Don't remind me.
- I was fine until you spoke.
- Where are we anyway?
I don't know.
The name on the railroad station's been shot off.
There must be something to eat somewhere.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll ask those fellas.
Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Westhus.
Oh.
Meet Detering.
A better farmer never lived.
- And Mr. Tjaden.
- Sit down.
You see, we haven't eaten since breakfast.
We thought maybe you could tell us what we ought to do about it.
Eat without further delay.
[Detering, Tjaden Laughing]
Well, what's funny about that?
This is a bad town to bring an appetite to, soldier.
We've been here since yesterday morning, living on baled hay and razor blades.
We're willing to buy our food.
Where's the canteen?
[Laughing] The only canteen in these regions is out looking for supplies.
- Ever hear of Katczinsky?
- Who?
Katczinsky.
He's uncanny.
If there's any food within 25 miles, he'll be the one to get it.
- Hey!
- [Grunts]
[Grunts]
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hup!
- Hup!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[Chattering]
Attention!
[Laughing]
- What is this?
- Volunteers for the future generals' staff.
Sometime I'm gonna take one of you volunteers apart... and find out what makes you leave school and join the army.
At ease.
This is no parade ground.
- Hungry?
- [All Shouting] Yes.
Wait!
Wait a minute!
That's no invitation.
- Can you pay?
- Yeah, sure.
- I have some money.
No, not money.
That's just pieces of paper.
Have you got any cigarettes, cigars,
- or soap, cognac...
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Chewing tobacco?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Kat!
Are you crazy?
There ain't enough here for us.
I wish you three would get bumped off.
I'm tired of feeding ya for nothing.
- Bring everything you got.
- [All Chattering]
- [Boy #1] I'm so hungry...
- [Boy #2] I'd be glad to give you...
- Come on!
- Is this enough, sir?
- Kat!
- Hmm?
- You've got the wiring detail tonight.
- Where?
- Past the graveyard.
- With this bunch?
It's quiet tonight.
You can teach 'em a couple of things.
Thanks.
I'd rather do it alone.
- These babes get killed off too fast.
- Well, the lorry's waiting.
Last night I was too hungry to sleep, and tonight, when I get the wrinkles out of my gut, they think up wiring duty.
Well, here's your chance, heroes.
For the fatherland!
Come on, get your stuff and let's get out of here.
- Is that any way to drive?
- Let him drive any way he wants.
Suppose he breaks your arm.
You get sent home, don't you?
A lot better than havin' a hole in your guts.
If there's any of you left, I'll pick you up in the morning.
Well, if that ride you gave us didn't kill us, nothing will.
- And be on time.
I don't want to miss my breakfast.
- [Laughing]
- Huh?
- You better wait for your army, Papa.
Here, here.
Don't be so backward.
Listen, children.
All we got to do is to string a little wire.
We pick it up at the dump and carry it to where we need it.
Now, you're gonna see some shell fire, and you're gonna be scared, see?
[Shell Whistling, Explosion]
It's all right, boy.
Get up.
Here.
Never mind.
It's happened to better men than you, and it's happened to me.
When we come back, I'll get you all some nice clean underwear. [Chuckles]
That kind of shell you don't have to pay much attention to.
Those big fellas just make a lot of noise and land about five miles behind the line.
The things we've got to watch out for are the light ones.
They don't give you much warning.
They go "waa-aa-aah zing."
And when you hear that, down!
Mother Earth.
Press yourselves down upon her.
Bury yourselves deep into her.
Just keep your eyes on me.
When you see me flop, you flop, only try to beat me to it.
[Explosion]
Shh-shh.
Now listen.
I'll show you how it's done.
Give me a couple of those.
That's to kill the noise.
Tjaden.

He's dead.

- Why did you risk your life bringing' him in?
But it's Behn!
- My friend.
- He's a corpse, no matter who it is.
Now, don't any of you ever do that again.
Put him over there.

Kat, what are we doing?
What's happening?
You heard him.
Orders to march.
- But where to, for the love of...
- Another party.
And this one is gonna last a long time.
Come on.
Here we go.
Company, attention!
Shoulder arms!
March right, march!

- Take your hands off that!
- Queen takes it!
- Well, if you think that's a queen, look again.
Ah, it's a jack.
- Yeah.
- Honest, these cards all look alike.

It's too noisy!
I can't play.
- I suppose your delicate nerves can't stand it.
- Get up!
That's Oscar.
The son of a...
Look at that!
Don't be so snooty.
You may wish you had this back.
About two more days of this... and this rat-bitten end of a piece of bread's gonna taste like a hunk of fruitcake.
It wouldn't...
It wouldn't last two more days, would it?
Didn't I tell you this was gonna be a bad one?
I don't mind the days so much.
It's keeping up all night...
Ah, two more days makes a week, kid.
Then you can say you've been under fire!
You're not scared, are you?
No.
I was just asking.
That's all.
- Wanna play some more?
- Do you?
- Sure.
- All right.
My deal.
You better get your boot back before Oscar eats that!
- [Laughing]
- The kid's all right.
[Explosions Continue]
[Soldier Groaning] Behn!
Behn.
[Kat] Yeah, yeah.
Let him sleep.
He's dreamin'.
Oh, God.
Can't you see it's Behn?
He didn't want to come to war!
No, no.
It isn't Behn.
[Shouting] It isn't Behn!
It's Kemmerick!
It's me!
Shut up, will you?
It's bad enough in here as it is.
[Paul] Every...
Everything's all right, Franz.
You're dreaming.
You're just dreaming, I guess.
- Attention!
- At ease.
The barrage is gettin' worse.
The men in two more dugouts gone.

However, we'll do our best to get some food up here by evening.
[Whimpering, Moaning]

Stop!
Stop!

[Kemmerick] Let me out!
- What did you do that for?

Grab him.
- No.
- Now hold him.

You all right now?
I think so.
I couldn't hold out much longer.
[Screaming]

[Paul Shouting]
- Oh, God, it's Franz!
- Get him over there!
No, he's been hit in the stomach.
He can't have anything to drink.
Get a stretcher.
Where'd they get you, Kemmerick?
Oh.
- Here it is, sir.
- Take his head.
All right.
Take him out.
- Is it serious, sir?
- I'm not sure.
- Tell the others he's all right.
- Yes, sir.
If we're going to fight, why don't we fight?
Why don't we go over?
You could go crazy staying here.
Let's do something!
- Let's go after 'em!
- Sit down!
If that cook of ours had any guts, he'd try to bring something through.
He's so far behind the lines he can't hear the shooting!
- Here's Kat.
Get anything?
- Any luck?
- We'll have to split this up among us.
- Something to eat!
[All Shouting]
We need butter too.
Yes.
And dessert.
And a feather bed to sleep on.

I've got other things to do.
I've been waiting for this for three weeks.
When they all get here.
What do you want?
Beans, you homely-lookin' son of a frog's leg.
- What do you think I want?
- [Man] We're hungry.
[All Shouting]
Shut up!
I'll feed you when you're all here.
- We're all here now.
- Only half the company's here.
Get the rest.
- Wake 'em up.
- [All Laughing]
I wish I could wake 'em up.
There's 80 of us left.
The rest is in dressing stations or pushing' up daisies.
Eighty?
And I cooked for 150!
All right.
We'll have enough for once.
Come on.
Dish out!
You mean you've cooked beans for 150... and you've got bread for 150... and sausage for 150, and tobacco for 150?
Everything!
It's all wrong.
I should have been notified.
What a feast!
- Everyone gets two issues.
- [All Shouting]
- Get back in line!
Get back in line!
- Oh, no!
That won't do.
I can't give 80 men what's meant for 150.
[All Grumbling]
Listen.
You drew rations for the 2nd Company, didn't ya?
Yeah.
All right.
We're the 2nd Company.
- [Approving Shouts]
- I've got my orders.
- Kat's right.
- We're the 2nd Company.
And if only half of us get back, that's our good luck.
- Come on.
Dish it out.
- [Men Shouting] Come on!
- No!
- [All] Hey!
You're the yellowest baboon that ever drew a cook wagon, and you're scared...
it shows.
All we want to hear out of you is one more little yip, and we'll cut ya up and eat ya raw.
Why, you keep your kitchen so far back of the lines, we never get anything to eat until it's cold and we're asleep!
Now, you low-down rat, get out...
- or we wreck the joint!
- [Approving Shouts]
- Come on!
Give us...
- Attention!
At ease.
What's goin' on here?
He's cooked for 150, sir, and he only wants to give us half.
- Looks pretty good.
- Yes, sir.
- Serve the whole issue.
The men can use it.
- Yes, sir.
- And bring me a plate too.
- Yes, sir.
All right.
Take it all.
Take everything.
Give 'em honey.
Give 'em what they want.
- Fill it up!
- Fill it up!
[All Chattering]
- Don't mind me.
- Oh, that's all right.
Don't mention it.
You know...
I could do with some more beans.
Go help yourself.
There's more over there.
[Groaning]
- It's too far.
- [Kat Chuckling]
- I wonder, when are we going back to the front?
- Tomorrow.
It's enough to take away a man's appetite.
You know, if they're gonna march us in again tomorrow, we ought to go see how Kemmerick is.
- That's a good idea.
- Let's do that.
- How far is the dressing station?
- About two miles.
- We could take his things to him.
- Good.
It seemed rotten to think of a thing like that happening to him, a nice fellow like Kemmerick.
Ah, the French certainly deserve to be punished for starting this war.
Everybody says it's somebody else.
Well, how do they start a war?
Well, one country offends another.
How could one country offend another?
You mean there's a mountain over in Germany gets mad at a field over in France?
- [All Laughing]
- Well, stupid, one people offends another.
Oh, if that's it, I shouldn't be here at all.
I don't feel offended.
It don't apply to tramps like you.
Good.
Then I can be going home right away.
- Ah, you just try it.
- [Kat] Yeah.
You wanna get shot?
- The kaiser and me...
- [Jeering, Snickering]
Me and the kaiser felt just alike about this war.
We didn't either of us want any war, so I'm going home.
- He's there already.
- Somebody must have wanted it.
Maybe it was the English.
No, I don't want to shoot any Englishmen.
I never saw one till I came up here.
And I suppose most of them never saw a German till they came up here.
- No, I'm sure they weren't asked about it.
- No.
Well... it must be doing somebody some good.
- Not me and the kaiser.
- I think maybe the kaiser wanted a war.
You leave us out of this!
I don't see that.
The kaiser's got everything he needs.
Well, he never had a war before.
Every full-grown emperor needs one war to make him famous.
- Why, that's history.
- Yeah, generals too.
They need war.
- And manufacturers.
They get rich.
- [Murmurs Of Agreement]
I think it's more a kind of fever.
Nobody wants it in particular, and then all at once, there it is.
We didn't want it.
The English didn't want it.
And here we are fighting.
I'll tell you how it should all be done.
Whenever there's a big war comin' on,
- you should rope off a big field...
- And sell tickets.
Yeah.
And...
And on the big day, you should take all the kings and their cabinets and their generals, put them in the center dressed in their underpants, and let 'em fight it out with clubs.
- The best country wins.
- [All Groan, Murmur]
Well, now that Kat's settled everything, let's go see Kemmerick.
- Something interesting might happen on the way.
- Might cheer him up.
Boys, me and the kaiser want you back in time to march tomorrow.
Don't forget.
- We'll be back.
- Give the boy my regards.
- We'll be back.
- Give the boy my regards.
[Soldiers Chattering]
There he is.
- Hello, Kemmerick.
- How are ya?
- How's it going?
How are things going?
Are they looking after you all right?
How are they treating you?
Franz?
[Groaning]
They're robbers here.
Robbers.
They stole my watch!
I always told you, nobody should carry as good a watch as that.
- They took it while I was under ether!
- Franz, you'll get it back.
Do you feel all right?
- Just look at my hand.
- That's because you lost so much blood.
- Just eat decently and you'll get well again.
- Oh, no.
You must eat.
That's the main thing.
It looks good too.
I have such a terrible pain in my foot.
Every toe on my right foot hurts.
Well, how can your foot hurt when your leg's been...
[Hysterically] I know what you mean!
I know!
I know now!
They cut my leg off.
Why didn't they tell me?
Why...
Why didn't they tell me?
- Franz!
Franz!
- Now I can't walk anymore!
You must be thankful that you've come off with only that.
I wanted to be a forester once.
You can yet.
They make artificial legs that are wonderful.
And you're through too.
You can go home.
Think of that.
We brought your things for you.
See?
Put 'em under the bed.
That's a marvelous pair of boots.
Look at that leather!
What comfort.
I was just thinking.
If you're not going to be using these, Franz, why don't you leave 'em with us?
What good are they to you?
I can use 'em.
My boots give me blister after blister...
Well, we'll be going, Franz.
Oh, don't go.
Stay just a little while longer.
- I'll come right back.
- We'll be coming soon again, Franz.
- I know you'll be feeling better.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Good-bye, Franz.
[Albert] You think he'll last till after mess?
- I don't think...
- Done for.
[Paul] Boys, you go along.
I'll see you later.
[Soldiers] Good-bye.
All right, Paul.
I'm sorry, Paul.
I wouldn't touch a thing of his if he could use it.
I'd go barefoot over barbed wire for him if it'd do him any good.
Only...
Only why should some orderly get those boots?
I understand, Mueller.
We're all alike out here.
And good boots are scarce.
Tell the doctor to come, please.
Doctor, the man in the next bed would like to see you, sir.
I've done everything I can for him.
There's no helping him.
Poor little fella.
He says next time, Franz.
Do you think I'll ever get well?
Why, of course.
- Do you really think so?
- Sure, once you get over the operation.
I don't think so.
Franz!
Don't talk nonsense.
Why, you'll be as good as new.
They fix up worse things than that.
Perhaps you'll go to the convalescent home... in Klosterberg among the villagers.
Then you can look out of the windows, across the fields... to the two trees on the horizon.
The loveliest time of the year now when the corn ripens.
You can go out without asking anyone.
You can even play piano if you want to.
Oh...
Oh, but, Franz, you must try to sleep now.
[Sobbing]
O God, this is Franz Kemmerick, only 19 years old.
He doesn't want to die.
Please don't let him die.
[Whimpering] Paul.
- Paul.
- Franz.
Take my boots home for Mueller.
Oh, no, Franz, no.
And if...
Paul... you find my watch, send it home.
Franz!
Doctor.
Doctor!
Doctor!
Doctor!
Where's the doctor?
Why isn't there a doctor here?
- Doctor, come quick.
Franz Kemmerick is dying!
- Which one is that?
- Amputated leg.
- I've amputated a dozen legs today.
- Bed 26, sir.
- You see to it.
I'm due in the operating room.
- [Seething]
- One operation after another since 5:00 this morning.
Sixteen dead today, and yours is the 17th.
There'll probably be 20 by the morning.
[Soldiers Chattering]
[Soldier #1] You're lookin' good.
Very good today.
[Soldier #2] What's your hurry?
Hey!
I'll bet he stole those boots!
[Laughing]
- I got it, Kat.
- Hmm?
Listen: "The sum of an arithmetic series... is S = A + L x N over 2."
- Interesting, isn't it?
- What do you wanna learn that stuff for?
One day you'll stop a bullet and it'll all be worthless.
- I get a lot of fun out of it.
- Aah!
My boots!
Mueller.
I saw him die.
I didn't know what it was like to die before.
And then...
then I came outside... and it felt... it felt so good to be alive that I started in to walk fast.
I began to think of the strangest things, like being out in the fields.
Things like that.
You know... girls.
And it felt as if there were... something electric running from the ground up through me.
And I started.
I began to run hard.
I passed soldiers and I heard voices calling to me.
I ran and I ran.
I felt as if I couldn't breathe enough air into me.
And...
And now I'm hungry.
I don't mind the war now.
Be a pleasure to go to the front in boots like these.
[Gunfire, Explosions]
[Gunfire, Explosions Continue]
[Whistle Blows]
[Men Laughing]
It's a good invention just the same.
If you crack each separate louse, think of all the energy you use up.
Watch.
- Burned to death.
- [Laughing]
- How was patrol?
Bad?
- Must've been terrible if they had time to gather the harvest.
We passed a cherry tree and when he saw it, he went crazy.
I could hardly drag him away.
It was... beautiful.
I have a big orchard with cherry trees at home.
When they're in full blossom, from the hayloft it looks like one single sheet.
So white.
- Perhaps you can get leave soon.
- You may even be sent back as a farmer.
A woman can't run a farm alone.
That's no good, you know?
No matter how hard she works.
Harvest coming on again.
What's the matter with him?
Got a letter yesterday from his wife.
He wants to get back to his farm.
We'd all like to get back home.
I wonder what we'd do if it were suddenly peacetime again?
Get drunk and look for women!
I'd go looking for a Cinderella... that could wear this for a garter.
And when I'd found her, nobody'd see me for two weeks.
I'll go back to the peat fields... and those pleasant hours in the beer gardens.
And there's worse things than cobbling too.
Look.
My family.
I oughta give you a kick in the backside for startin' all this.
It's all right for all you to talk.
You've got something to go back to:
Wives, children, jobs.
But what about us?
What have we got to go back to?
- School?
- Why not?
You know everything already.
A man can't take all that rubbish they teach you seriously... after three years of shells and bombs.
- You can't peel that off easily.
- They never taught us anything really useful, like how to light a cigarette in the wind or make a fire out of wet wood... or bayonet a man in the belly instead of the ribs where it gets jammed.
What can happen to us afterwards?
I'll tell ya.
Take our class.
Out of 20, three are officers, nine dead,
Mueller and three others wounded... and one in the madhouse.
We'll all be dead someday, so let's forget it.
[Man Shouting] Hurry up!
Get in there!
Hurry up!
Himmelstoss!
[Laughing]
- [Laughing Continues]
- What's up?
- What are you, crazy?
- It's Himmelstoss!
Himmelstoss?
There is justice in the army!
Well, well.
So, we are all here, huh?
- A bit longer than you, Himmie.
- Since when have we become so familiar?
Stand up and click your heels together!
All of you!
- Take a running jump at yourself!
[Laughs]
- Who's your friend?
Would somebody get General Ludendorff a nice, comfortable chair?
- [Laughing]
- I command you as your superior officer!
- Do you want to be court-martialed?
- I do!
There's going to be a big attack tonight and I'd just love to get out of it.
- [Laughing]
- Will you obey my orders?
Kiss my butt!
It isn't customary to ask for salutes here.
But I'll tell you what we'll do.
We're going to attack a town that we tried to take once before.
Many killed and many wounded.
It was great fun.
This time you're going with us.
If any of us stops a bullet, before we die... we're going to come to you, click our heels together and ask stiffly,
- "Please, Sergeant Himmelstoss, may we go?"
- You'll...
You'll pay for this, you...
[Distant Explosion]
- There it is.
- [Explosions Continue]
Right on time.
Better get ready, boys.
[Explosions Continue]
[Blows Whistle]
[Shells Whistling]
[Whimpering]
I'm wounded!
I'm wounded!
It's just a scratch, you yellow rat!
Up!
Get out with the others!
- Up!
- No!
No!
No!
- You yellow rat!
- [Whimpering]
Stinking yellow rat!
Let the others do it, eh?
Get up!
Get up!
- Aa-aah!
- Get up!
Forward!
- Get out here!
- Command... was forward.
Command was forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
- Forward!
- [Men Shouting]
Forward!
[Shells Continue Whistling]
[Bombing Ceases]
Counterattack.
- [Men Shouting] - [Explosions Resume]
[Machine Gun Fire]
[Screaming]
[Wheezing]
I want to help you.
I want to help you.
[Explosions, Gunfire Continue]
- [Wheezing]
- Stop that!
Stop it, stop it.
I can bear the rest of it.
I can't listen to that!
Why do you take so long dying?
You're going to die anyway!
Oh, no.
[Indistinct]
Oh, no.
You won't die.
Oh, no.
You won't die.
They're only little wounds.
You'll get home.
You'll be all right.
You'll get home long before I will.
[Explosions, Gunfire Continue]
You know I can't run away.
That's why you accuse me.
I tell you, I didn't want to kill you.
I tried to keep you alive.
If you jumped in here again, I wouldn't do it.
When you jumped in here you were my enemy, and I was afraid of you.
But you're just a man like me, and I killed you.
Forgive me, comrade.
Say that for me.
Say you forgive me.
Oh, no.
You're dead.
You're better off than I am.
You're through.
They can't do any more to you now.
They can't do any more to you now.
Oh, God, why did they do this to us?
We only wanted to live, you and I.
Why should they send us out to fight each other?
If we threw away these rifles and these uniforms, you could be my brother just like Kat and Albert.
You'll have to forgive me, comrade.
I'll do all I can.
I'll write to your parents.
I'll write to...
I'll write to your wife.
I'll write to her.
I promise she'll not want for anything.
I'll help her and your parents too.
Only forgive me.
Forgive me!
[Sobbing] Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Terrible thing happened yesterday.
I stabbed a man.
With my own hands, stabbed him.
I know how it is.
Your first time.
Never mind.
The stretcher-bearers will find him.
- He's dead.
I watched him die.
- You couldn't do anything about it.
We have to kill.
We can't help it.
That's what we are here for.
Uh...
Look there, for instance.
- [Fires]
- Hah!
That got him.
You should've seen how he leaped in the air.
That fellow had to shoot with us for today with three hits.
If he keeps it up, he'll have a decoration for his buttonhole this evening.
Don't you lose any more sleep over this business.
Maybe it was 'cause I was out there with him so long, huh?
Sure, that's it.
After all, war is war.
[Fires]
¿¿ [Soldiers Singing In German]
[Man #1] March!
Forward!
[Man #2] Forward, march!

Uncommissioned officers, enlisted men, dismiss!
[Soldiers Shouting] Hooray!
Come on!
Let's get outta here!

Oh, ho ho!
A beer.

[German]
Here's hoping we get falling-down drunk tonight.
Here's how it started.
I'd forgotten there were girls like that.
There aren't.
Just look at those thin, little shoes.
She couldn't march many miles in those.
Paul!
Don't speak about marching.
You're boring the young lady.
A thousand pardons.
- How old do you think she is?
- Oh, about 22.
No, that'd make her older than us.
She's... 17.
A girl like that.
That'd be good, eh, Albert?
We wouldn't have much of a chance with him around.
- We could take a bath, wash our clothes...
- All right.
And I might even go so far as to get deloused.
Wait a minute!
She's a long way from here now.
Look at the date.
May, 1917.
- Four months ago.
- That's true.
Well, here's to her anyway.
Here's to 'em all, everywhere.
Albert,
- we might as well wash up anyway.
- All right.
Personally, I like 'em bigger around.
This conversation was on a high moral plane up to now.
Now we do need a bath.
- A bath?
- For what?
Hm.
You wouldn't understand.
This water is freezing.
This romantic business has gone too far.
- Ahh, but think of her beautiful eyes!
- Oh!
Oh, and her hair.
- Here we are!
- We're not gonna miss a thing!
- Go away!
- What are you doing here?
- Bathing!
They tell me there's some people in this world takes a bath every week!

Aw, baby!
Aw, no, girls!
Don't go away!

Aw, mama!
[All Shouting In French]

- Don't go away!
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!
[Shouting In French]
Food!
Food!
Whoo-hoo!
[French]
[All Shouting]
Halt!
You know you're forbidden to cross.
You fellows stay on this side or you'll get yourselves in a lot of trouble.
[French]
- What are they jabbering' about?
- They want us to swing over tonight.
They're expecting us.
- That's fine!
- We'll do it!
- That blonde's crazy about me.
- But there's four of us and only three of them.
- I was the one that stopped 'em!
That blonde piece of work is mine.
You three fight for what's left.
Fight's the word.
All's fair in love and war.
Huh?
What do you mean?
What're you gonna do?
You'll find out.
Au revoir!
Au revoir!
- [Rapping] - [Woman, French]
- C'est moi, blondie!
- Bon ami!
Bon ami!
Vos camarades!
Vos camarades!
Ooh!
[French]
She means the door.
[Women Cackling]
[Men Laughing]
[Soldiers] Not only modest, but dashing!
A perfect fit.
It might've been made for me.
An officer's coat.
We're calling distinguished company.
- Ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
- [French]
[French]
[Women Shouting]
Merci.
[French]
[Women Speaking French]
- [Soldiers Chattering]
- Have another little drink, comrade.
Is this your birthday or mine?
Why?
You've been buying me drink after drink for two hours.
What I'm tryin' to figure out is why.
Why?
Why?
Oh!
Ha-ha!
Oh.
L-lt's just that the boys... told me to amuse you for a little while.
- [Laughing]
- Oh, nice boys.
Yeah!
They-They said you'd understand.
Ehh... heh.
Huh?
I've been betrayed!
Yeah, you certainly have.
- Take that for a minute!
- [Laughter]
I'll give you more!
Ahh.
[Snoring]
It's too loud.
[Bottles Clinking]
[Grinding Sound]
Suzanne.
And I wouldn't even know you if I did.
And yet, I'll remember you always.
Toujours.
Oh, if you could only know how different this is from the women we soldiers meet.
[French]
You.
That's what I'm talking about.
Vous.
It seems as though all war and terror and grossness... had fallen away from me... like a miracle.
Like something I never believed.
Pauvre garcon.
Pauvre garcon.
Frau Paul.
We're going, Paul.
[Paul] Have a look.
Nice, new coffins.
Huh!
For us.
I must say, that's a very cheerful preparation for this offensive.
That's very considerate of them.
But I don't see any long enough for our comrade Tjaden.
Mind you, I'm not speaking to you, you traitors.
- But no coffin's gonna get me.
- I should say not, heartbreaker.
You'll be thankful if they slip a waterproof sheet...
- around that Aunt Sally of a carcass of yours.
- [Laughter]
- [Explosion] - [Soldiers Shouting]
[Groaning]
Oh-Oh, my side!
My side.
Catholic hospital, Albert.
[Groans] They say you always get good food and good treatment.
- We're lucky.
- After that rainy dressing station... and 24 hours on the train, we deserve to have some luck.
[Wheezing Laughter]
I'm Hamacher.
Yeah, that's my name.
I got a crack in the head and they gave me a certificate stating,
"Josef Hamacher is periodically... not responsible for his actions."
And ever since then, Hamacher has been having a grand time.
I hope you boys are not too badly wounded. [Laughing]
The others die off so quickly we don't have time to get acquainted.
You'll get to know us...
very well.
Thank you.
You too.
I'm sorry, my dear.
It's time to go now.
Yes, sister.
Watch.
If they take his clothes away, you've seen the last of him.
- See?
They're taking him to the dying room.
- Dying room?
When you're ready to kick the bucket, they get you out of the way so they can use the bed.
In the corner of the building there's a little room... right next to the morgue!
[Laughs]
It's so convenient.
It saves a lot of trouble.
But suppose he gets well?
I've seen a lot of 'em go in that dying room, but nobody ever comes back.
[Quietly] Sister.
Sister.
Sister.
- [Albert] Is that you ringing, Paul?
- Yes.
- [Hamacher] Is something going on?
- I think I have a hemorrhage.
The bandage is all wet.
I've been ringing forever and nobody comes.
- I think I'm bleeding.
- Sister, get me a sterile dressing and an ice pack.
- Why didn't someone call me?
- [Albert] He's been ringing.
[Hamacher] Nobody can walk, Sister.
- [Albert] Sister, is it bad?
- No.
No, we'll be all right.
We've got it in time.
[Paul Whimpering]
What's the matter?
What are you doing?
We must rearrange your bandages.
Wh...
Where are you taking me?
To the bandaging ward.
To the bandaging ward.
- No, no!
I'm not going!
I'm staying here!
- [Albert] Paul!
Paul!
- Now, now!
- I'm not going to the dying room!
- We're going to the bandaging ward.
- Why are you taking my clothes?
You're lying to me!
But I'll come back.
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'm not going to die!
I'll come back!
[Hamacher] Sister Libertine, how is he?
Poor boy.
They had to amputate his leg.
Paul.
Paul.
Paul.
Oh, he is... gone.
Gone.
Hello.
Welcome home, Albert!
- How do you feel, kid?
- All right.
But I've got such an awful pain.
My foot hur...
Hamacher.
Did they cut my leg off?
Of course not!
How many did you have?
Two?
You still got 'em!
One, two!
[Laughs]
Don't play the fool, Hamacher.
Tell me truthfully.
Of course not.
And you look fine.
Look.
See?
- [Gasps] I won't be a cripple.
- Now, now.
- I won't live like that!
- Be calm.
- I'll kill myself the first chance I get!
- Albert!
- I won't live!
I won't live!
- Yes, you will.
Albert!
Albert!
Albert, I've come back!
I told you I'd come back.
Look, everybody!
I've come back!
- [Albert] Paul!
Paul!
- That's not where I'm going.
I live over there.
Paul, I'm so happy.
Hamacher, I've come back from the dead!
- It's most irregular.
Never happened before.
- Albert, get well quickly... so we can go home soon.
- Everything will be all right now.
- Yes, Paul.
Everything will be all right... now.
[Bell Ringing]
Oh!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul.
- What's the matter, Paul?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
Paul.
Give me your handkerchief.
- Mother?
- [Woman] Here I am, Paul.
Here I am.
Mother's ill.
- Are you wounded?
- No, Mother.
I got leave.
[Relieved Sigh]
[Sobbing]
Here I am cryin' instead of being glad.
Anna, get down the jar of blackberries.
You still like them, don't you?
Yes, Mother.
I haven't had any for a long time.
We might almost have known you were coming.
- I'm making potato cakes.
- [Mother] Don't let them burn.
Paul... sit down... beside me.
My Paul.
My baby.
I almost forgot, Mother.
I've got some little presents for you.
Look, Mother.
Bread, sausage and rice.
- Paul, you've been starving yourself.
- Hmm-mm.
Hadn't I better go and tell Father Paul's home?
- Paul could watch the things on the stove.
- No, I'm getting up.
Oh, Paul, you're a soldier now, aren't you?
But somehow, I don't seem to know you.
I'll take these off, Mother.
I'll get your suit.
It's in the wardrobe, just where you left it.
Are you really here, Paul?
You won't...
You won't disappear, will you?
No.
I'm here.
Your things are ready for you, Paul.
- I remember when you caught that one.
- Yes.
And you took it away from me, didn't you?
- [Giggles]
- Yes, I did.
We're behind the lines, but we know how to honor the soldier... who goes on in spite of blood and death.
Gentlemen, my son.
- Prosit.
- Prosit.
- Cheers.
I'm glad to know you, young man, I am glad to know you.
How are things out there?
Terrible, eh?
Terrible.
But we must carry on.
After all, you do at least get decent food out there.
Naturally, it's worse here.
Naturally.
But the best for our soldiers all the time.
That's our motto.
- The best for our soldiers.
- [Murmurs Of Agreement]
But...
[Chuckles]
- You must give the Frenchies a good licking!
- [All Laughing]
And, if you boys want to come home, ehh, let me show you what you must do before you can come home.
Give us a hand there, men.
Now, then, there's the line.
Runs so, in a "V".
Here is St. Quentin.
You can see for yourself.
You're almost through now.
All right?
Shove ahead out there and don't stick to that everlasting French warfare!
Smash through the johnnies!
And then you will have peace.
When you get in it... the war isn't the way it looks back here.
Oh!
You don't know anything about it.
Of course, you know about the details, but this relates to the whole!
You can't judge that.
Of course, you do your duty and you risk your life.
But for that, you receive the highest honor.
I said that every man in the war ought to have the Iron Cross.
First, the enemy lines must be broken through in Flanders.
- On to Paris!
Push on to Paris!
- Right.
No, not in Flanders.
I'll tell you just where the break should come.
- Here.
- The enemy has too many reserves there.
- I insist upon Flanders!
- Why should they do that... when they're halfway through St. Quentin already?
Because Flanders is a flat country!
- No mountains, no obstructions!
- There's too many rivers there!
[Professor] From the farms they have gone;
from the schools, from the factories.
They have gone bravely, nobly, ever forward, realizing there is no other duty now but to save the fatherland.
Paul!
How are you, Paul?
Glad to see you, Professor.
You've come at the right moment, Baumer!
Just at the right moment.
And as if to prove all I have said, here is one of the first to go.
A lad who sat before me on these very benches... who gave up all to serve in the first year of the war;
one of the iron youth who have made Germany invincible in the field.
Look at him...
sturdy and bronze and clear-eyed.
The kind of soldier every one of you should envy.
Oh, lad, you must speak to them.
You must tell them what it means to serve your fatherland.
- No, I can't tell them anything.
- You must, Paul.
Just a word.
Just tell them how much they're needed out there.
Tell them why you went and what it meant to you.
I can't say anything.
You can remember some deed of heroism, some touch of nobility.
- Tell about it.
- [Enthusiastic Chattering]
I can't tell you anything you don't know.
We live in the trenches out there.
We fight.
We try not to be killed;
sometimes we are.
That's all.
[Professor] No.
No, Paul.
I've been there!
I know what it's like.
That's not what one dwells on, Paul.
I heard you in here reciting that same old stuff, making more iron men, more young heroes.
You still think it's beautiful and sweet to die for your country, don't you?
We used to think you knew.
The first bombardment taught us better.
It's dirty and painful to die for your country.
When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all!
There are millions out there dying for their countries, and what good is it?
- [All Chattering] - [Professor] Paul!
You asked me to tell them how much they're needed out there.
He tells you, "Go out and die."
Oh, but if you'll pardon me, it's easier to say "Go out and die" than it is to do it.
- [Boy] Coward!
- And it's easier to say it than to watch it happen.
- [Angry Clamoring] - [Professor] No!
No!
Boys, boys!
- I'm sorry, Baumer, but I must say...
- It's no use talking like this.
You won't know what I mean.
Only, it's been a long while since we enlisted out of this classroom.
So long I thought maybe the whole world had learned by this time.
Only now they're sending babies, and they won't last a week!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
Up at the front you're alive or you're dead, and that's all!
You can't fool anybody about that very long.
Up there we know we're lost and done for whether we're dead or alive.
Three years we've had of it... four years.
Every day a year and every night a century.
Our bodies are earth and our thoughts are clay, and we sleep and eat with death.
We're done for because you can't live that way and keep anything inside you!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
I'll go back tomorrow.
I've got four days more, but I can't stand it here!
I'll go back tomorrow!
Sorry.
Mother, you'll catch cold here.
You must go to sleep.
There'll be plenty of time to sleep... when you're gone.
Must you go tomorrow, Paul?
Must you?
Yes, Mother.
Orders were changed.
Are you very much afraid, Paul?
No, Mother.
There's something I want to say to you, Paul.
It's...
Just be on your guard against the women out there.
They're no good.
Where we are, there aren't any women, Mother.
Be very careful at the front, Paul.
Yes, Mother, I will.
I'll pray for you every day.
And if you could, get a job that's not quite so dangerous.
Yes, Mother.
I'll try and get in the cookhouse.
- That can easily be done.
- You do it then, and if the others say anything...
That won't worry me, Mother.
Now, you must go to bed and you must get well quickly before I come back.
I put two sets of underwear...
new ones... in your pack.
They'll keep you nice and warm.
[Choking] They're all wool.
That's sweet of you.
Good night...
my son.
Good night, Mother.
Oh, Mother, Mother.
You still think I'm a child.
Why can't I put my head in your lap and cry?
- Is this the 2nd Company?
- Yes, sir.
¿¿ [Concertina]
¿¿ [Whistling]
- Is this all of it?
- Yes, sir.
We had 150 men, but this is all that came back yesterday.
But now they're going to give us enough to make 150 again.
How old are you?
Sixteen.
No use.
I couldn't find anything.
- We'll have to eat the sawdust.
- [Discontented Grumbles]
Not me!
I'll go hungry first.
It makes me sick.
Now it's gonna be a real war again.
Paul!
How's old Paul?
Here I am.
You know, the 2nd Company's getting hard to find.
Nobody seemed to know where you were.
I'm glad you found it.
I guess I don't get much of this.
There used to be some food in the sawdust.
Now it's all sawdust.
No joke, either.
Eats ya up inside.
This doesn't look much like the old 2nd Company.
The replacements are all like that.
Not even old enough to carry a pack.
All they know how to do is die.
I guess... some of the old-timers are here yet.
Paul, they're tryin' to invent somethin' to kill me right now.
Where's Westhus?
Messenger dog was wounded.
He went out to get it. [Clucks Tongue]
- Is it true about the armistice?
- Doesn't look that way back there.
- You mean they want us to go on fighting?
- That's what they say.
They're crazy!
Germany'll be empty pretty soon.
Where is...
Where is Detering?
He got homesick.
You remember about the cherry blossoms?
I guess he never got over that.
He started out one night to go home and help his wife with the farm.
They got him behind the lines, and we never heard of him since.
He was just homesick, but probably they couldn't see it that way.
- Where's Kat?
Is he...
- [Chuckles]
Not Kat!
If he were out, the war would be over.
You remember what he always says:
They're savin' him for the last.
- Where is he?
- He's out lookin' for food, something to make soup with.
- Which way?
- Down the road about two miles that way.
I'll see you later.
Kat!
Paul!
Hello, Paul.
- How's the side?
- Oh, it's all right now.
It's fine.
- Have any luck?
- No, the general's staff's been over this country with a rake.
[Chuckles] Let's sit down there.
Tell me, Paul...
how was it at home?
Have a good leave?
- In spots.
- What's the matter?
Ohh...
I'm no good for back there anymore, Kat.
None of us are.
We've been in this too long.
The young men thought I was a coward because I told them that... we learn that death is stronger than duty to one's country.
The old men said, "Go on.
Push on to Paris."
My father even wanted me to wear my uniform around him.
[Laughing]
It's not home back there anymore.
All I could think of was, "I'd like to get back and see Kat again."
You're all I've got left, Kat.
I'm not much to have left.
I missed you, Paul.
At least we know what it's all about out here.
There're no lies here.
Push on to Paris?
You ought to see what they've got on the other side.
They eat white bread over there.
They've got dozens of airplanes to our one, and tanks that'll go over anything.
What've we got left?
Guns so worn they drop shells on our own men.
No food, no ammunition, no officers.
Push on to Paris!
So that's the way they talk back there. [Chuckles]
I guess we'd better be going.
How I lied to my poor mother.
I told her it wasn't so bad out here because there was always a lot of us together.
Now that I'm with you, I'm beginning to believe that I told her the truth.
Down!
That's another one that missed us.
Come on.
Let's go.
Wait a minute.
Looks like the old bread wagon's broke down.
- I guess I don't walk the rest of the way.
- Did that get ya, Kat?
Aah, I think it broke my shin.
That's not so bad.
Hold it together.
- Just my luck, huh?
- Good luck.
That means the war is over.
Oh, no, sir!
This war don't end till they really get me.
- [Chuckles]
- Now this one...
- Aah.
- Easy, now.
- Hey!
- Easy!
Easy!
Come on.
I'll take you in.
Give me your hand.
Easy.
[Grunts]
All right.
Well, kid...
now we're gonna be separated.
Maybe we can do something together later on when the war is over.
- Yes, kid.
- You give me your address, I'll give you mine.
[Explosion]
[Debris Clattering]
You can't get both of us in one day.
Ah, we'll surely see each other again, Kat.
Remember that day when you brought the whole pig into the factory?
And that day in the woods when you taught us how to dodge shells?
And my first bombardment.
How I cried.
I was a young recruit then.
Here we are.
Here we are.
[Grunts] All right now, Kat.
You could've spared yourself the trouble.
He's dead.
Oh, no.
He's just fainted.
He was hit in the shin.
He's dead.
Would you like to take his pay book?
- You're not related, are you?
- No, we're not related.

...defending our country, our fatherland.
Now, my beloved class, this is what we must do:
Strike with all our power.
Give every ounce of strength... to win victory before the end of the year.
It is with reluctance that I bring this subject up again.
You are the life of the fatherland, you boys.
You are the iron men of Germany.
You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy... when you are called upon to do so.
It is not for me to suggest that any of you... should stand up and offer to defend his country.
But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads.
I know that in one of the schools... the boys have risen up in the classroom... and enlisted in a mass.
But, of course, if such a thing should happen here... you would not blame me for a feeling of pride.
Perhaps some will say... that you should not be allowed to go yet... that you are too young, that you have homes, mothers, fathers... that you should not be torn away.
Are your fathers so forgetful of their fatherland... that they would let it perish rather than you?
Are your mothers so weak that they cannot send a son... to defend the land which gave them birth?
And after all, is a little experience... such a bad thing for a boy?
Is the honour of wearing a uniform... something from which we should run?
And if our young ladies glory in those who wear it... is that anything to be ashamed of?
I know you have never desired the adulation of heroes.
That has not been part of my teaching.
We have sought to make ourselves worthy... and let acclaim come when it would.
But to be foremost in battle... is a virtue not to be despised.
I believe it will be a quick war... that there will be few losses.
But if losses there must be... then let us remember the Latin phrase... which must have come to the lips of many a Roman... when he stood embattled in a foreign land.:
"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."
"Sweet and fitting it is to die for the fatherland. "
Some of you may have ambitions.
I know of one young man who has great promise as a writer... and he has written the first act of a tragedy... which would be a credit to one of the masters.
And he is dreaming, I suppose... of following in the footsteps of Goethe and Schiller... and I hope he will.
But now our country calls.
The fatherland needs leaders.
Personal ambition must be thrown aside... in the one great sacrifice for our country.
Here is a glorious beginning to your lives.
The field of honour calls you.
Why are we here?
You, Kropp, what has kept you back?
You, Mueller, you know how much you are needed?
Ah, I see you look at your leader.
And I, too, look to you, Paul Baumer... and I wonder what you are going to do.

- That's a good idea.
- Let's do that.
- How far is the dressing station?
- About two miles.
- We could take his things to him.
- Good.
It seemed rotten to think of a thing like that happening to him... a nice fellow like Kemmerick.
Ah, the French certainly deserve to be punished for starting this war.

We didn't either of us want any war, so I'm going home.
- He's there already.
- Somebody must have wanted it.
Maybe it was the English.
No, I don't want to shoot any Englishmen.
I never saw one till I came up here.
And I suppose most of them never saw a German till they came up here.
- No, I'm sure they weren't asked about it.
- No.
Well... it must be doing somebody some good.
- Not me and the kaiser.
- I think maybe the kaiser wanted a war.
You leave us out of this!
I don't see that.

- And manufacturers.

Nobody wants it in particular... and then all at once, there it is.
We didn't want it.
The English didn't want it.
And here we are fighting.
I'll tell you how it should all be done.
Whenever there's a big war comin' on...
- you should rope off a big field--
- And sell tickets.
Yeah.
And--
And on the big day... you should take all the kings and their cabinets and their generals... put them in the centre dressed in their underpants... and let 'em fight it out with clubs.
- The best country wins.
- [ All Groan, Murmur ]
Well, now that Kat's settled everything, let's go see Kemmerick.
- Something interesting might happen on the way.
- Might cheer him up.

- We'll be back.
- Give the boy my regards.

- How are things going?
- Are they looking after you all right?

Franz?
[ Groaning ]
They're robbers here.
Robbers.
They stole my watch!
I always told you, nobody should carry as good a watch as that.
- They took it while I was under ether!
- Franz, you'll get it back.
Do you feel all right?
-Just look at my hand.
- That's because you lost so much blood.
-Just eat decently and you'll get well again.
- Oh, no.
You must eat.
That's the main thing.
It looks good too.
I have such a terrible pain in my foot.
Every toe on my right foot hurts.
Well, how can your foot hurt when your leg's been--
[ Hysterically ] I know what you mean!
I know!
I know now!
They cut my leg off.
Why didn't they tell me?
Why-
- Why didn't they tell me?
- Franz!
Franz!
- Now I can't walk any more!
You must be thankful that you've come off with only that.
I wanted to be a forester once.
You can yet.
They make artificial legs that are wonderful.
And you're through too.
You can go home.
Think of that.
We brought your things for you.
See?
Put 'em under the bed.
That's a marvellous pair of boots.
Look at that leather!
What comfort.
I was just thinking.
If you're not going to be using these, Franz, why don't you leave 'em with us?
What good are they to you?
I can use 'em.
My boots give me blister after blister--
Well, we'll be going, Franz.
Oh, don't go.
Stay just a little while longer.
- I'll come right back.
- We'll be coming soon again, Franz.
- I know you'll be feeling better.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Goodbye, Franz.
[ Albert ] You think he'll last till after mess?
- I don't think--
- Done for.
[ Paul ] Boys, you go along.
I'll see you later.
[ Soldiers ] Goodbye.
All right, Paul.
I'm sorry, Paul.
I wouldn't touch a thing of his if he could use it.
I'd go barefoot over barbed wire for him if it'd do him any good.
Only-
- Only why should some orderly get those boots?
I understand, Mueller.
We're all alike out here.
And good boots are scarce.
Tell the doctor to come, please.
Doctor, the man in the next bed would like to see you, sir.
I've done everything I can for him.
There's no helping him.
Poor little fella.
He says next time, Franz.
Do you think I'll ever get well?
Why, of course.
- Do you really think so?
- Sure, once you get over the operation.
I don't think so.
Franz!
Don't talk nonsense.
Why, you'll be as good as new.
They fix up worse things than that.
Perhaps you'll go to the convalescent home... in Klosterberg among the villagers.
Then you can look out of the windows, across the fields... to the two trees on the horizon.
The loveliest time of the year now when the corn ripens.
You can go out without asking anyone.
You can even play piano if you want to.
Oh-
- Oh, but, Franz, you must try to sleep now.

Why isn't there a doctor here?
- Doctor, come quick.

- Which one is that?
- Amputated leg.
- I've amputated a dozen legs today.
- Bed 26, sir.
- You see to it.
I'm due in the operating room.

- Interesting, isn't it?
- What do you wanna learn that stuff for?

- I get a lot of fun out of it.
- Aah!
My boots!
Mueller.
I saw him die.
I didn't know what it was like to die before.
And then-- then I came outside... and it felt-- it felt so good to be alive that I started in to walk fast.
I began to think of the strangest things... like being out in the fields.
Things like that.
You know-- girls.
And it felt as if there were... something electric running from the ground up through me.
And I started.
I began to run hard.
I passed soldiers and I heard voices calling to me.
I ran and I ran.
I felt as if I couldn't breathe enough air into me.
And-- And now I'm hungry.
I don't mind the war now.
Be a pleasure to go to the front in boots like these.

- You may even be sent back as a farmer.

Got a letter yesterday from his wife.
He wants to get back to his farm.
We'd all like to get back home.

But what about us?
What have we got to go back to?
- School?
- Why not?
You know everything already.
A man can't take all that rubbish they teach you seriously... after three years of shells and bombs.
- You can't peel that off easily.
- They never taught us anything really useful... like how to light a cigarette in the wind or make a fire out of wet wood... or bayonet a man in the belly instead of the ribs where it gets jammed.
What can happen to us afterwards?
I'll tell ya.
Take our class.

What are you doing?
We must rearrange your bandages.
Wh-
- Where are you taking me?
To the bandaging ward.
- No, no!
I'm not going!
I'm staying here!
- [ Albert ] Paul!
Paul!
- Now, now!
- I'm not going to the dying room!
- We're going to the bandaging ward.
- Why are you taking my clothes?
You're lying to me!
But I'll come back.
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'm not going to die!
I'll come back!
[ Hamacher ] Sister Libertine, how is he?
Poor boy.
They had to amputate his leg.
Paul.
Paul.
Paul.
Oh, he is... gone.
Gone.
Hello.
Welcome home, Albert!
- How do you feel, kid?
- All right.
But I've got such an awful pain.
My foot hur--
Hamacher.
Did they cut my leg off?
Of course not!
How many did you have?
Two?
You still got 'em!
One, two!
[ Laughs ]
Don't play the fool, Hamacher.
Tell me truthfully.
Of course not.
And you look fine.
Look.
See?
- [ Gasps ] I won't be a cripple.
- Now, now.
- I won't live like that!
- Be calm.
- I'll kill myself the first chance I get!
- Albert!
- I won't live!
I won't live!
- Yes, you will.
Albert!
Albert!
Albert, I've come back!
I told you I'd come back.
Look, everybody!
I've come back!
- [ Albert ] Paul!
Paul!
- That's not where I'm going.
I live over there.
Paul, I'm so happy.
Hamacher, I've come back from the dead!
- It's most irregular.
Never happened before.
- Albert, get well quickly... so we can go home soon.
- Everything will be all right now.
- Yes, Paul.
Everything will be all right... now.
[ Bell Ringing ]
Oh!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul.
- What's the matter, Paul?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
Paul.
Give me your handkerchief.
- Mother?
- [ Woman ] Here I am, Paul.
Here I am.
Mother's ill.
- Are you wounded?
- No, Mother.
I got leave.
[ Relieved Sigh ]
[ Sobbing ]
Here I am cryin' instead of being glad.
Anna, get down the jar of blackberries.
You still like them, don't you?
Yes, Mother.
I haven't had any for a long time.
We might almost have known you were coming.
- I'm making potato cakes.
- [ Mother ] Don't let them burn.
Paul... sit down... beside me.
My Paul.
My baby.
I almost forgot, Mother.
I've got some little presents for you.
Look, Mother.
Bread, sausage and rice.
- Paul, you've been starving yourself.
- Hmm-mm.
Hadn't I better go and tell Father paul's home?
- Paul could watch the things on the stove.
- No, I'm getting up.
Oh, Paul, you're a soldier now, aren't you?
But somehow, I don't seem to know you.
I'll take these off, Mother.
I'll get your suit.
It's in the wardrobe, just where you left it.
Are you really here, Paul?
You won't--
You won't disappear, will you?
No.
I'm here.
Your things are ready for you, Paul.
- I remember when you caught that one.
- Yes.
And you took it away from me, didn't you?
- [ Giggles ]
- Yes, I did.
We're behind the lines, but we know how to honour the soldier... who goes on in spite of blood and death.
Gentlemen, my son.
- Prosit.
- Prosit.
I'm glad to know you, young man, I am glad to know you.
How are things out there?
Terrible, eh?
Terrible.
But we must carry on.
After all, you do at least get decent food out there.
Naturally, it's worse here.
Naturally.
But the best for our soldiers all the time.
That's our motto.
- The best for our soldiers.
- [ Murmurs Of Agreement ]
But...
[ Chuckles ]
- you must give the Frenchies a good licking!
- [ All Laughing ]
And, if you boys want to come home, eh... let me show you what you must do before you can come home.
Give us a hand there, men.
Now, then, there's the line.
Runs so, in a "V".
Here is St Quentin.
You can see for yourself.
You're almost through now.
All right?
Shove ahead out there and don't stick to that everlasting trench warfare!
Smash through the johnnies!
And then you will have peace.
When you get in it... the war isn't the way it looks back here.
Oh!
You don't know anything about it.
Of course, you know about the details... but this relates to the whole!
You can't judge that.
Of course, you do your duty and you risk your life.
But for that, you receive the highest honour.
I said that every man in the war ought to have the lron Cross.
First, the enemy lines must be broken through in Flanders.
- On to Paris!
Push on to Paris!
- Right.
No, not in Flanders.
I'll tell you just where the break should come.
- Here.
- The enemy has too many reserves there.
- I insist upon Flanders!
- Why should they do that... when they're halfway through St Quentin already?
Because Flanders is a flat country!
- No mountains, no obstructions!
- There's too many rivers there!
[ Professor ] From the farms they have gone;
from the schools, from the factories.
They have gone bravely, nobly, ever forward... realizing there is no other duty now but to save the fatherland.
Paul!
How are you, Paul?
Glad to see you, Professor.
You've come at the right moment, Baumer!
Just at the right moment.
And as if to prove all I have said, here is one of the first to go.
A lad who sat before me on these very benches... who gave up all to serve in the first year of the war;
one of the iron youth who have made Germany invincible in the field.
Look at him-- sturdy and bronze and clear-eyed.
The kind of soldier every one of you should envy.
Oh, lad, you must speak to them.
You must tell them what it means to serve your fatherland.
- No, I can't tell them anything.
- You must, Paul.
Just a word.Just tell them how much they're needed out there.
Tell them why you went and what it meant to you.
I can't say anything.
You can remember some deed of heroism, some touch of nobility.
- Tell about it.
- [ Enthusiastic Chattering ]
I can't tell you anything you don't know.
We live in the trenches out there.
We fight.
We try not to be killed;
sometimes we are.
That's all.
[ Professor ] No.
No, Paul.
I've been there!
I know what it's like.
That's not what one dwells on, Paul.
I heard you in here reciting that same old stuff... making more iron men, more young heroes.
You still think it's beautiful and sweet to die for your country, don't you?
We used to think you knew.
The first bombardment taught us better.
It's dirty and painful to die for your country.
When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all!
There are millions out there dying for their countries, and what good is it?
- [ All Chattering ] - [ Professor ] Paul!
You asked me to tell them how much they're needed out there.
He tells you, "Go out and die."
Oh, but if you'll pardon me, it's easier to say "Go out and die" than it is to do it.
- [ Boy ] Coward!
- And it's easier to say it than to watch it happen.
- [ Angry Clamouring ] - [ Professor ] No!
No!
Boys, boys!
- I'm sorry, Baumer, but I must say--
- It's no use talking like this.
You won't know what I mean.
Only, it's been a long while since we enlisted out of this classroom.
So long I thought maybe the whole world had learned by this time.
Only now they're sending babies, and they won't last a week!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
Up at the front you're alive or you're dead, and that's all!
You can't fool anybody about that very long.
Up there we know we're lost and done for whether we're dead or alive.
Three years we've had of it-- four years.
Every day a year and every night a century.
Our bodies are earth and our thoughts are clay... and we sleep and eat with death.
We're done for because you can't live that way and keep anything inside you!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
I'll go back tomorrow.
I've got four days more, but I can't stand it here!
I'll go back tomorrow!
Sorry.
Mother, you'll catch cold here.
You must go to sleep.
There'll be plenty of time to sleep... when you're gone.
Must you go tomorrow, Paul?
Must you?
Yes, Mother.
Orders were changed.
Are you very much afraid, Paul?
No, Mother.
There's something I want to say to you, Paul.
It's--
Just be on your guard against the women out there.
They're no good.
Where we are, there aren't any women, Mother.
Be very careful at the front, Paul.
Yes, Mother, I will.
I'll pray for you every day.
And if you could, get a job that's not quite so dangerous.
Yes, Mother.
I'll try and get in the cookhouse.
- That can easily be done.
- You do it then, and if the others say anything--
That won't worry me, Mother.
Now, you must go to bed and you must get well quickly before I come back.
I put two sets of underwear-- new ones-- in your pack.
They'll keep you nice and warm.
[ Choking ] They're all wool.
That's sweet of you.
Goodnight... my son.
Goodnight, Mother.
Oh, Mother, Mother.
You still think I'm a child.
Why can't I put my head in your lap and cry?
- Is this the 2nd Company?
- Yes, sir.
♪ [ Concertina ]
♪ [ Whistling ]
- Is this all of it?
- Yes, sir.
We had 150 men, but this is all that came back yesterday.
But now they're going to give us enough to make 150 again.
How old are you?
Sixteen.
No use.
I couldn't find anything.
- We'll have to eat the sawdust.
- [ Discontented Grumbles ]
Not me!
I'll go hungry first.
It makes me sick.
Now it's gonna be a real war again.
Paul!
How's old Paul?
Here I am.
You know, the 2nd Company's getting hard to find.
Nobody seemed to know where you were.
I'm glad you found it.
I guess I don't get much of this.
There used to be some food in the sawdust.
Now it's all sawdust.
No joke, either.
Eats ya up inside.
This doesn't look much like the old 2nd Company.
The replacements are all like that.
Not even old enough to carry a pack.
All they know how to do is die.
I guess... some of the old-timers are here yet.
Paul, they're tryin' to invent somethin' to kill me right now.
Where's Westhus?
Messenger dog was wounded.
He went out to get it. [ Clucks Tongue ]
- Is it true about the armistice?
- Doesn't look that way back there.
- You mean they want us to go on fighting?
- That's what they say.
They're crazy!
Germany'll be empty pretty soon.
Where is-- Where is Detering?
He got homesick.
You remember about the cherry blossoms?
I guess he never got over that.
He started out one night to go home and help his wife with the farm.
They got him behind the lines, and we never heard of him since.
He was just homesick, but probably they couldn't see it that way.
- Where's Kat?
Is he-- - [ Chuckles ]
Not Kat!
If he were out, the war would be over.
You remember what he always says:
They're savin' him for the last.
- Where is he?
- He's out lookin' for food, something to make soup with.
- Which way?
- Down the road about two miles that way.
I'll see you later.
Kat!
Paul!
Hello, Paul.
- How's the side?
- Oh, it's all right now.
It's fine.
- Have any luck?
- No, the general's staff's been over this country with a rake.
[ Chuckles ] Let's sit down there.
Tell me, Paul...
how was it at home?
Have a good leave?
- In spots.
- What's the matter?
Ohh...
I'm no good for back there any more, Kat.
None of us are.
We've been in this too long.
The young men thought I was a coward because I told them that... we learn that death is stronger than duty to one's country.
The old men said, "Go on.
Push on to Paris."
My father even wanted me to wear my uniform around him.
It's not home back there any more.
All I could think of was, "I'd like to get back and see Kat again."
You're all I've got left, Kat.
I'm not much to have left.
I missed you, Paul.
At least we know what it's all about out here.
There're no lies here.
Push on to Paris?
You ought to see what they've got on the other side.
They eat white bread over there.
They've got dozens of aeroplanes to our one... and tanks that'll go over anything.
What've we got left?
Guns so worn they drop shells on our own men.
No food, no ammunition, no officers.
Push on to Paris!
So that's the way they talk back there. [ Chuckles ]
I guess we'd better be going.
How I lied to my poor mother.
I told her it wasn't so bad out here because there was always a lot of us together.
Now that I'm with you, I'm beginning to believe that I told her the truth.
Down!
That's another one that missed us.
Come on.
Let's go.
Wait a minute.
Looks like the old bread wagon's broke down.
- I guess I don't walk the rest of the way.
- Did that get ya, Kat?
Aah, I think it broke my shin.
That's not so bad.
Hold it together.
-Just my luck, huh?
- Good luck.
That means the war is over.
Oh, no, sir!
This war don't end till they really get me.
- [ Chuckles ]
- Now this one--
- Aah.
- Easy, now.
- Hey!
- Easy!
Easy!
Come on.
I'll take you in.
Give me your hand.
Easy.
[ Grunts ]
All right.
Well, kid...
now we're gonna be separated.
Maybe we can do something together later on when the war is over.
- Yes, kid.
- You give me your address, I'll give you mine.
You can't get both of us in one day.
Ah, we'll surely see each other again, Kat.
Remember that day when you brought the whole pig into the factory?
And that day in the woods when you taught us how to dodge shells?
And my first bombardment.
How I cried.
I was a young recruit then.
Here we are.
Here we are.
[ Grunts ] All right now, Kat.
You could've spared yourself the trouble.
He's dead.
Oh, no.
He's just fainted.
He was hit in the shin.
He's dead.
Would you like to take his pay book?
- You're not related, are you?
- No, we're not related.
Your deal.
Get his name and number?
Yeah, Corporal Stanislaus Katczinsky, 306.
-Thirty thousand.
- From the Russians?
No, from the French.
From the Russians we capture more than that every day.
Mr. Postman.
War is war and schnapps is schnapps, and business must go on.
You didn't leave the mail yet this morning.
Ah, I'm sorry, Mr. Meyer.
Hello, Himmelstoss.
Anything for us today?
- No, no, Master Peter.
- Oh, there must be something.
Here, here you go, young lad.
There.
This is the last mail I deliver anyhow.
- What?
- Tomorrow I change uniforms.
- You're going in the army?
- Yes, I was called.
I'm a sergeant in the reserves, you know.
I'll be called myself, if it doesn't end in a few months.
- It will, though.
- I'm sure you're right, Mr. Meyer.
...defending our country, our fatherland.
Now, my beloved class, this is what we must do:
Strike with all our power.
Give every ounce of strength... to win victory before the end of the year.
It is with reluctance that I bring this subject up again.
You are the life of the fatherland, you boys.
You are the iron men of Germany.
You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy... when you are called upon to do so.
It is not for me to suggest that any of you... should stand up and offer to defend his country.
But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads.
I know that in one of the schools, the boys have risen up in the classroom... and enlisted in a mass.
But, of course, if such a thing should happen here, you would not blame me for a feeling of pride.
Perhaps some will say... that you should not be allowed to go yet, that you are too young, that you have homes, mothers, fathers, that you should not be torn away.
Are your fathers so forgetful of their fatherland... that they would let it perish rather than you?
Are your mothers so weak that they cannot send a son... to defend the land which gave them birth?
And after all, is a little experience... such a bad thing for a boy?
Is the honor of wearing a uniform... something from which we should run?
And if our young ladies glory in those who wear it, is that anything to be ashamed of?
I know you have never desired the adulation of heroes.
That has not been part of my teaching.
We have sought to make ourselves worthy, and let a claim come when it would.
But to be foremost in battle... is a virtue not to be despised.
I believe it will be a quick war, that there will be few losses.
But if losses there must be, then let us remember the Latin phrase... which must have come to the lips of many a Roman... when he stood embattled in a foreign land:
"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."
"Sweet and fitting it is to die for the fatherland."
Some of you may have ambitions.
I know of one young man who has great promise as a writer, and he has written the first act of a tragedy... which would be a credit to one of the masters.
And he is dreaming, I suppose, of following in the footsteps of Goethe and Schiller, and I hope he will.
But now our country calls.
The fatherland needs leaders.
Personal ambition must be thrown aside... in the one great sacrifice for our country.
Here is a glorious beginning to your lives.
The field of honor calls you.
Why are we here?
You, Kropp, what has kept you back?
You, Mueller, you know how much you are needed?
Ah, I see you look at your leader.
And I, too, look to you, Paul Baumer, and I wonder what you are going to do.
- I'll go.
- I want to go.
- Me too.
- I'm ready.
- I'm not gonna stay home!
Follow me!
Enlist now!
- No more classes!
- No more classes!
- Don't be a quitter!
- Come on, Behn!
Stick together.
That's what we've got to do.
- Let's all stick together.
- Come on, Behn.
All right.
All right.
- I'll go.
- That's the way!
Let's go!
Hey!
Let's sing!
Come on!
- Keep in line there, soldiers.
- Anything you say, General.
Detail, halt!
Left face!
Get into uniform, ready to report.
Fall out!
I betcha a place like this gets you in good condition.
You have to be for the long marches.
I'm gonna get in the cavalry and ride.
No cavalry for me.
Infantry's where you see the fighting.
Where are all the guns?
That's what I want to know.
Oh, you don't get a gun for a long while yet.
If I'm gonna bump off the enemy, I gotta have some practice.
Ow!
Bayonet drill.
That's what I want.
Ah!
You won a medal that time, Mueller.
You wait.
In about a month I'll be covered with 'em.
Say, keep your boots out of my face!
Why, it's an honor to have those boots in your face.
They're the best pair in the army!
My uncle gave 'em to me.
Just look at that special imported leather.
Put 'em anyplace you like, except in my face.
Not even a kitchen maid'll look at me in this!
Attention!
Well, for the love of -- It's Himmelstoss!
- So it is.
- And all dressed up.
Hello, Himmie.
You didn't think you'd see me again so soon, did you?
- You see my rank?
- Sure.
Fall back, then!
- Himmelstoss, we certainly are glad to see you.
- What did you say?
- I was going to say--
- Never mind!
- What's the matter with you?
- When you address your superior officer, say "sir"!
- Where'd he get such a nice uniform?
- Any mail for us, Himmie?
- Quiet!
- My dear fellow, you're shouting.
Ah, come on, Himmelstoss.
We know ya.
Take off the false whiskers.
- I believe you mean it!
- You'll find out that I mean it.
- But only three days ago you were our postman.
- Silence!
Come back here!
Line up!
Line up!
Get in some kind of a line!
All of you!
Line up, I say!
Hmm.
What a pretty sight that is!
Have you never heard of standing in line?
You make a fine mess of it.
Well, I'll have to teach you.
We'll spend the whole day on it, huh?
You may be stupid, but I'm used to that.
And then there'll be plenty of other things too.
Oh, I'll not neglect you.
Hmm.
You're not much to begin with, but I'll do my best.
I see that we have come here with a slight misunderstanding, and we'll correct that, too, won't we, huh?
And the first thing to do is to forget everything you ever knew.
Everything you ever learned, forget!
See?
Forget what you've been and what you think you're going to be.
You're going to be soldiers, and that's all!
I'll take the mother's milk out of you!
I'll make you hard-boiled!
I'll make soldiers out of you or kill you!
Now... salute!
A-ten-hut!
Detachment...
lie down!
Down!
Head down!
Keep your head down, Baumer!
Detachment... get up!
Now sing!
Do you call that singing?
Detachment, halt!
So... we have no spirit, huh?
We are in no mood for recreation.
Work is what we want.
Good!
Then we'll go back to work!
Detachment, lie down!
Keep your head down!
Now sing!
Men... halt!
Order, arms!
Inspection at 3:00.
Dismissed!
Oh, that swine!
That means we get no time off.
It will take four hours to get ready for inspection.
- I'd like to know what's in his mind.
- He hasn't got any!
I'm gonna cut him open sometime and find out!
He's too thick-skinned.
He won't cut.
This is the fourth time he's made me disappoint that poor girl.
Arms!
Order, arms!
Left shoulder, arms!
Squad right.
To the right, march!
Left, left, left, left.
Follow right, march!
Squad, left march!
Forward... march!
Detachment... halt!
Present arms!
Himmelstoss.
Excellent work.
They're going up front tomorrow.
- I recommend leave till midnight.
- Very good, sir.
Left, left, left.
Detachment...
lie down!
Crawl forward!
He spoiled our leave.
I'll never forgive him for that.
- The rat!
- Leave till midnight.
Hmm!
It'll take till midnight to dry our clothes.
There goes the filthy ape now.
While we slave over this mud, he goes off to have a few drinks!
Someday I'm going to take one smack at him-- just one.
Me too.
That's gonna be my life's work from now on.
Why only one?
I'm gonna take several.
I might even kick him while he's down.
I feel mean.
What are you doing?
You're not going to desert, are you?
What?
Listen.
I've got an idea.
Crawl forward!
Lie down!
Lie down!
Crawl forward!
Oh!
What?
Ow!
Ow!
- Cover!
- Paul, you all right?
Behn!
Behn!
Behn!
Come on!
Behn, come on!
You fool!
Behn!
Get up!
Come on.
- Sounds like more replacements coming in.
Yeah.
Tjaden must have gone home for that wood.
There's some more, fresh from the turnip patch.
I suppose this is where we bunk.
That's me, "l.
Westhus,"
and this is where I live.
- I didn't know!
- Well, you know now!
Yes.
Yes, of course.
- It's all right.
- Here's a bunk, Paul.
- When did we eat last?
- Don't remind me.
- I was fine until you spoke.
- Where are we anyway?
I don't know.
The name on the railroad station's been shot off.
There must be something to eat somewhere.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll ask those fellas.
Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Westhus.
Oh.
Meet Detering.
A better farmer never lived.
- And Mr. Tjaden.
- Sit down.
You see, we haven't eaten since breakfast.
We thought maybe you could tell us what we ought to do about it.
Eat without further delay.
Well, what's funny about that?
This is a bad town to bring an appetite to, soldier.
We've been here since yesterday morning, living on baled hay and razor blades.
We're willing to buy our food.
Where's the canteen?
The only canteen in these regions is out looking for supplies.
- Ever hear of Katczinsky?
- Who?
Katczinsky.
He's uncanny.
If there's any food within 25 miles, he'll be the one to get it.
- Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hup!
- Hup!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Attention!
- What is this?
- Volunteers for the future generals' staff.
Sometime I'm gonna take one of you volunteers apart... and find out what makes you leave school and join the army.
At ease.
This is no parade ground.
- Hungry?
- Yes.
Wait!
Wait a minute!
That's no invitation.
Can you pay?
I have some money.
No, not money.
That's just pieces of paper.
Have you got any cigarettes, cigars,
- or soap, cognac--
- Yeah, yeah.
- Chewing tobacco?
- Yeah, yeah.
Are you crazy?
There ain't enough here for us.
I wish you three would get bumped off.
I'm tired of feeding ya for nothing.
- Bring everything you got.
- I'm so hungry--
- I'd be glad to give you--
- Come on!
- Is this enough, sir?
- Kat!
- Hmm?
- You've got the wiring detail tonight.
- Where?
- Past the graveyard.
- With this bunch?
It's quiet tonight.
You can teach 'em a couple of things.
Thanks.
I'd rather do it alone.
- These babes get killed off too fast.
- Well, the lorry's waiting.
Last night I was too hungry to sleep, and tonight, when I get the wrinkles out of my gut, they think up wiring duty.
Well, here's your chance, heroes.
For the fatherland!
Come on, get your stuff and let's get out of here.
- Is that any way to drive?
- Let him drive any way he wants.
Suppose he breaks your arm.
You get sent home, don't you?
A lot better than havin' a hole in your guts.
If there's any of you left, I'll pick you up in the morning.
Well, if that ride you gave us didn't kill us, nothing will.
- And be on time.
I don't want to miss my breakfast.
- Huh?
- You better wait for your army, Papa.
Here, here.
Don't be so backward.
Listen, children.
All we got to do is to string a little wire.
We pick it up at the dump and carry it to where we need it.
Now, you're gonna see some shell fire, and you're gonna be scared, see?
It's all right, boy.
Get up.
Here.
Never mind.
It's happened to better men than you, and it's happened to me.
When we come back, I'll get you all some nice clean underwear.
That kind of shell you don't have to pay much attention to.
Those big fellas just make a lot of noise and land about five miles behind the line.
The things we've got to watch out for are the light ones.
They don't give you much warning.
They go "waa-aa-aah zing."
And when you hear that, down!
Mother Earth.
Press yourselves down upon her.
Bury yourselves deep into her.
Just keep your eyes on me.
When you see me flop, you flop, only try to beat me to it.
Shh-shh.
Now listen.
I'll show you how it's done.
Give me a couple of those.
That's to kill the noise.
Tjaden.
See that?
- What's that mean?
- Bombardment.
My eyes!
I'm blind!
I can't see!
God!
- My eyes!
I can't see!
- I can't see!
- It's Behn!
It's Behn!
- I'll go get him--
- You'll get killed!
- Let me--
- Lay down and stay there!
He's dead.
- He's dead!
- Why did you risk your life bringing' him in?
But it's Behn!
- My friend.
- He's a corpse, no matter who it is.
Now, don't any of you ever do that again.
Put him over there.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
All right, come on.
All right, come on.
Get your packs and fall in.
Hurry up!
Come on.
Hurry up.
Make it snappy.
Get your packs and fall in.
Kat, what are we doing?
What's happening?
You heard him.
Orders to march.
- But where to, for the love of --
- Another party.
And this one is gonna last a long time.
Come on.
Here we go.
Company, attention!
Shoulder arms!
March right, march!
- Take your hands off that!
- Queen takes it!
- Well, if you think that's a queen, look again.
Ah, it's a jack.
- Yeah.
- Honest, these cards all look alike.
It's too noisy!
I can't play.
- I suppose your delicate nerves can't stand it.
- Get up!
That's Oscar.
The son of a--
Look at that!
Don't be so snooty.
You may wish you had this back.
About two more days of this... and this rat-bitten end of a piece of bread's gonna taste like a hunk of fruitcake.
It wouldn't-
- It wouldn't last two more days, would it?
Didn't I tell you this was gonna be a bad one?
I don't mind the days so much.
It's keeping up all night--
Ah, two more days makes a week, kid.
Then you can say you've been under fire!
You're not scared, are you?
No.
I was just asking.
That's all.
- Wanna play some more?
- Do you?
- Sure.
- All right.
My deal.
You better get your boot back before Oscar eats that!
- The kid's all right.
Behn!
Behn.
Yeah, yeah.
Let him sleep.
He's dreamin'.
Oh, God.
Can't you see it's Behn?
He didn't want to come to war!
No, no.
It isn't Behn.
It isn't Behn!
It's Kemmerick!
It's me!
Shut up, will you?
It's bad enough in here as it is.
Every--
Everything's all right, Franz.
You're dreaming.
You're just dreaming, I guess.
- Attention!
- At ease.
The barrage is gettin' worse.
The men in two more dugouts gone.
However, we'll do our best to get some food up here by evening.
Stop!
Stop!
Let me out!
- What did you do that for?
- Shut up!
Grab him.
- No.
- Now hold him.
You all right now?
I think so.
I couldn't hold out much longer.
- Oh, God, it's Franz!
- Get him over there!
No, he's been hit in the stomach.
He can't have anything to drink.
Get a stretcher.
Where'd they get you, Kemmerick?
Oh.
- Here it is, sir.
- Take his head.
All right.
Take him out.
- Is it serious, sir?
- I'm not sure.
- Tell the others he's all right.
- Yes, sir.
If we're going to fight, why don't we fight?
Why don't we go over?
You could go crazy staying here.
Let's do something!
- Let's go after 'em!
- Sit down!
If that cook of ours had any guts, he'd try to bring something through.
He's so far behind the lines he can't hear the shooting!
- Here's Kat.
Get anything?
- Any luck?
- We'll have to split this up among us.
- Something to eat!
We need butter too.
Yes.
And dessert.
And a feather bed to sleep on.
- Rats!
- Rats!
Get out of the way!
What's that?
- Come on!
Grab your rifles!
Come on!
- Here they come.
- Get your grenades here.
Hurry up.
Come on, hurry up.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Back to your own lines!
- Fill it up.
- And hurry up.
I've got other things to do.
I've been waiting for this for three weeks.
When they all get here.
What do you want?
Beans, you homely-lookin' son of a frog's leg.
- What do you think I want?
- We're hungry.
Shut up!
I'll feed you when you're all here.
- We're all here now.
- Only half the company's here.
Get the rest.
- Wake 'em up.
I wish I could wake 'em up.
There's 80 of us left.
The rest is in dressing stations or pushing' up daisies.
Eighty?
And I cooked for 150!
All right.
We'll have enough for once.
Come on.
Dish out!
You mean you've cooked beans for 150... and you've got bread for 150... and sausage for 150, and tobacco for 150?
Everything!
It's all wrong.
I should have been notified.
What a feast!
- Everyone gets two issues.
- Get back in line!
Get back in line!
- Oh, no!
That won't do.
I can't give 80 men what's meant for 150.
Listen.
You drew rations for the 2nd Company, didn't ya?
Yeah.
All right.
We're the 2nd Company.
- I've got my orders.
- Kat's right.
- We're the 2nd Company.
And if only half of us get back, that's our good luck.
- Come on.
Dish it out.
- Come on!
- No!
- Hey!
You're the yellowest baboon that ever drew a cook wagon, and you're scared-- it shows.
All we want to hear out of you is one more little yip, and we'll cut ya up and eat ya raw.
Why, you keep your kitchen so far back of the lines, we never get anything to eat until it's cold and we're asleep!
Now, you low-down rat, get out...
- or we wreck the joint!
- Come on!
Give us--
- Attention!
At ease.
What's goin' on here?
He's cooked for 150, sir, and he only wants to give us half.
- Looks pretty good.
- Yes, sir.
- Serve the whole issue.
The men can use it.
- Yes, sir.
- And bring me a plate too.
- Yes, sir.
All right.
Take it all.
Take everything.
Give 'em honey.
Give 'em what they want.
- Fill it up!
- Fill it up!
-Don't mind me.
-Oh, that's all right.
Don't mention it.
You know...
I could do with some more beans.
Go help yourself.
There's more over there.
- It's too far.
- I wonder, when are we going back to the front?
- Tomorrow.
It's enough to take away a man's appetite.
You know, if they're gonna march us in again tomorrow, we ought to go see how Kemmerick is.
- That's a good idea.
- Let's do that.
- How far is the dressing station?
- About two miles.
- We could take his things to him.
- Good.
It seemed rotten to think of a thing like that happening to him, a nice fellow like Kemmerick.
Ah, the French certainly deserve to be punished for starting this war.
Everybody says it's somebody else.
Well, how do they start a war?
Well, one country offends another.
How could one country offend another?
You mean there's a mountain over in Germany gets mad at a field over in France?
- Well, stupid, one people offends another.
Oh, if that's it, I shouldn't be here at all.
I don't feel offended.
It don't apply to tramps like you.
Good.
Then I can be going home right away.
- Ah, you just try it.
- Yeah.
You wanna get shot?
- The kaiser and me--
Me and the kaiser felt just alike about this war.
We didn't either of us want any war, so I'm going home.
- He's there already.
- Somebody must have wanted it.
Maybe it was the English.
No, I don't want to shoot any Englishmen.
I never saw one till I came up here.
And I suppose most of them never saw a German till they came up here.
- No, I'm sure they weren't asked about it.
- No.
Well... it must be doing somebody some good.
- Not me and the kaiser.
- I think maybe the kaiser wanted a war.
You leave us out of this!
I don't see that.
The kaiser's got everything he needs.
Well, he never had a war before.
Every full-grown emperor needs one war to make him famous.
- Why, that's history.
- Yeah, generals too.
They need war.
- And manufacturers.
They get rich.
I think it's more a kind of fever.
Nobody wants it in particular, and then all at once, there it is.
We didn't want it.
The English didn't want it.
And here we are fighting.
I'll tell you how it should all be done.
Whenever there's a big war comin' on,
- you should rope off a big field--
- And sell tickets.
Yeah.
And--
And on the big day, you should take all the kings and their cabinets and their generals, put them in the center dressed in their underpants, and let 'em fight it out with clubs.
The best country wins.
Well, now that Kat's settled everything, let's go see Kemmerick.
- Something interesting might happen on the way.
- Might cheer him up.
Boys, me and the kaiser want you back in time to march tomorrow.
Don't forget.
- We'll be back.
- Give the boy my regards.
There he is.
- Hello, Kemmerick.
- How's it going?
How are things going?
Are they looking after you all right?
How are they treating you?
Franz?
They're robbers here.
Robbers.
They stole my watch!
I always told you, nobody should carry as good a watch as that.
- They took it while I was under ether!
- Franz, you'll get it back.
Do you feel all right?
- Just look at my hand.
- That's because you lost so much blood.
- Just eat decently and you'll get well again.
- Oh, no.
You must eat.
That's the main thing.
It looks good too.
I have such a terrible pain in my foot.
Every toe on my right foot hurts.
Well, how can your foot hurt when your leg's been--
I know what you mean!
I know!
I know now!
They cut my leg off.
Why didn't they tell me?
Why-
- Why didn't they tell me?
- Franz!
Franz!
- Now I can't walk anymore!
You must be thankful that you've come off with only that.
I wanted to be a forester once.
You can yet.
They make artificial legs that are wonderful.
And you're through too.
You can go home.
Think of that.
We brought your things for you.
See?
Put 'em under the bed.
That's a marvelous pair of boots.
Look at that leather!
What comfort.
I was just thinking.
If you're not going to be using these, Franz, why don't you leave 'em with us?
What good are they to you?
I can use 'em.
My boots give me blister after blister--
Well, we'll be going, Franz.
Oh, don't go.
Stay just a little while longer.
- I'll come right back.
- We'll be coming soon again, Franz.
- I know you'll be feeling better.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Good-bye, Franz.
You think he'll last till after mess?
- I don't think--
- Done for.
Boys, you go along.
I'll see you later.
Good-bye.
All right, Paul.
I'm sorry, Paul.
I wouldn't touch a thing of his if he could use it.
I'd go barefoot over barbed wire for him if it'd do him any good.
Only-
- Only why should some orderly get those boots?
I understand, Mueller.
We're all alike out here.
And good boots are scarce.
Tell the doctor to come, please.
Doctor, the man in the next bed would like to see you, sir.
I've done everything I can for him.
There's no helping him.
Poor little fella.
He says next time, Franz.
Do you think I'll ever get well?
Why, of course.
- Do you really think so?
- Sure, once you get over the operation.
I don't think so.
Franz!
Don't talk nonsense.
Why, you'll be as good as new.
They fix up worse things than that.
Perhaps you'll go to the convalescent home... in Klosterberg among the villagers.
Then you can look out of the windows, across the fields... to the two trees on the horizon.
The loveliest time of the year now when the corn ripens.
You can go out without asking anyone.
You can even play piano if you want to.
Oh-
- Oh, but, Franz, you must try to sleep now.
O God, this is Franz Kemmerick, only 19 years old.
He doesn't want to die.
Please don't let him die.
Paul.
- Paul.
- Franz.
Take my boots home for Mueller.
Oh, no, Franz, no.
And if...
Paul... you find my watch, send it home.
Franz!
Doctor.
Doctor!
Doctor!
Doctor!
Where's the doctor?
Why isn't there a doctor here?
- Doctor, come quick.
Franz Kemmerick is dying!
- Which one is that?
- Amputated leg.
- I've amputated a dozen legs today.
- Bed 26, sir.
- You see to it.
I'm due in the operating room.
One operation after another since 5:00 this morning.
Sixteen dead today, and yours is the 17th.
There'll probably be 20 by the morning.
You're lookin' good.
Very good today.
What's your hurry?
Hey!
I'll bet he stole those boots!
- I got it, Kat.
- Hmm?
Listen: "The sum of an arithmetic series... is S = A + L x N over 2."
- lnteresting, isn't it?
- What do you wanna learn that stuff for?
One day you'll stop a bullet and it'll all be worthless.
- I get a lot of fun out of it.
- Aah!
My boots!
Mueller.
I saw him die.
I didn't know what it was like to die before.
And then-- then I came outside... and it felt-- it felt so good to be alive that I started in to walk fast.
I began to think of the strangest things, like being out in the fields.
Things like that.
You know-- girls.
And it felt as if there were... something electric running from the ground up through me.
And I started.
I began to run hard.
I passed soldiers and I heard voices calling to me.
I ran and I ran.
I felt as if I couldn't breathe enough air into me.
And-- And now I'm hungry.
I don't mind the war now.
Be a pleasure to go to the front in boots like these.
It's a good invention just the same.
If you crack each separate louse, think of all the energy you use up.
Watch.
Burned to death.
- How was patrol?
Bad?
- Must've been terrible if they had time to gather the harvest.
We passed a cherry tree and when he saw it, he went crazy.
I could hardly drag him away.
It was... beautiful.
I have a big orchard with cherry trees at home.
When they're in full blossom, from the hayloft it looks like one single sheet.
So white.
- Perhaps you can get leave soon.
- You may even be sent back as a farmer.
A woman can't run a farm alone.
That's no good, you know?
No matter how hard she works.
Harvest coming on again.
What's the matter with him?
Got a letter yesterday from his wife.
He wants to get back to his farm.
We'd all like to get back home.
I wonder what we'd do if it were suddenly peacetime again?
Get drunk and look for women!
I'd go looking for a Cinderella... that could wear this for a garter.
And when I'd found her, nobody'd see me for two weeks.
I'll go back to the peat fields... and those pleasant hours in the beer gardens.
And there's worse things than cobbling too.
Look.
My family.
I oughta give you a kick in the backside for startin' all this.
It's all right for all you to talk.
You've got something to go back to:
wives, children, jobs.
But what about us?
What have we got to go back to?
- School?
- Why not?
You know everything already.
A man can't take all that rubbish they teach you seriously... after three years of shells and bombs.
- You can't peel that off easily.
- They never taught us anything really useful, like how to light a cigarette in the wind or make a fire out of wet wood... or bayonet a man in the belly instead of the ribs where it gets jammed.
What can happen to us afterwards?
I'll tell ya.
Take our class.
Out of 20, three are officers, nine dead,
Mueller and three others wounded... and one in the madhouse.
We'll all be dead someday, so let's forget it.
Hurry up!
Get in there!
Hurry up!
Himmelstoss!
What's up?
- What are you, crazy?
- It's Himmelstoss!
Himmelstoss?
There is justice in the army!
Well, well.
So, we are all here, huh?
-A bit longer than you, Himmie.
-Since when have we become so familiar?
Stand up and click your heels together!
All of you!
- Take a running jump at yourself!
- Who's your friend?
Would somebody get General Ludendorff a nice, comfortable chair?
I command you as your superior officer!
- Do you want to be court-martialed?
- I do!
There's going to be a big attack tonight and I'd just love to get out of it.
Will you obey my orders?
Kiss my butt!
It isn't customary to ask for salutes here.
But I'll tell you what we'll do.
We're going to attack a town that we tried to take once before.
Many killed and many wounded.
It was great fun.
This time you're going with us.
If any of us stops a bullet, before we die... we're going to come to you, click our heels together and ask stiffly,
- "Please, Sergeant Himmelstoss, may we go?"
- You'll--
You'll pay for this, you--
There it is.
Right on time.
Better get ready, boys.
I'm wounded!
I'm wounded!
It's just a scratch, you yellow rat!
Up!
Get out with the others!
- Up!
- No!
No!
No!
You yellow rat!
Stinking yellow rat!
Let the others do it, eh?
Get up!
Get up!
- Aa-aah!
- Get up!
Forward!
- Get out here!
- Command... was forward.
Command was forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Counterattack.
I want to help you.
I want to help you.
Stop that!
Stop it, stop it.
I can bear the rest of it.
I can't listen to that!
Why do you take so long dying?
You're going to die anyway!
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
You won't die.
Oh, no.
You won't die.
They're only little wounds.
You'll get home.
You'll be all right.
You'll get home long before I will.
You know I can't run away.
That's why you accuse me.
I tell you, I didn't want to kill you.
I tried to keep you alive.
If you jumped in here again, I wouldn't do it.
When you jumped in here you were my enemy, and I was afraid of you.
But you're just a man like me, and I killed you.
Forgive me, comrade.
Say that for me.
Say you forgive me.
Oh, no.
You're dead.
You're better off than I am.
You're through.
They can't do any more to you now.
Oh, God, why did they do this to us?
We only wanted to live, you and I.
Why should they send us out to fight each other?
If we threw away these rifles and these uniforms, you could be my brother just like Kat and Albert.
You'll have to forgive me, comrade.
I'll do all I can.
I'll write to your parents.
I'll write to--
I'll write to your wife.
I'll write to her.
I promise she'll not want for anything.
I'll help her and your parents too.
Only forgive me.
Forgive me!
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Terrible thing happened yesterday.
I stabbed a man.
With my own hands, stabbed him.
I know how it is.
Your first time.
Never mind.
The stretcher-bearers will find him.
- He's dead.
I watched him die.
- You couldn't do anything about it.
We have to kill.
We can't help it.
That's what we are here for.
Uh-
- Look there, for instance.
Hah!
That got him.
You should've seen how he leaped in the air.
That fellow had to shoot with us for today with three hits.
If he keeps it up, he'll have a decoration for his buttonhole this evening.
Don't you lose any more sleep over this business.
Maybe it was 'cause I was out there with him so long, huh?
Sure, that's it.
After all, war is war.
March!
Forward!
Forward, march!
Quick there!
Forward!
Company... halt!
Dismissed!
Uncommissioned officers, enlisted men, dismiss!
Hooray!
Come on!
Let's get outta here!
- Give me your best sausage.
- Two.
Give me a beer.
One, two, three!
Hey, come on.
A beer.
Hey, get out of here!
Come on.
Give me a beer.
Oh, ho ho!
A beer.
One b--
Here's hoping we get falling-down drunk tonight.
Here's how it started.
I'd forgotten there were girls like that.
There aren't.
Just look at those thin, little shoes.
She couldn't march many miles in those.
Paul!
Don't speak about marching.
You're boring the young lady.
A thousand pardons.
- How old do you think she is?
- Oh, about 22.
No, that'd make her older than us.
She's... 17.
A girl like that.
That'd be good, eh, Albert?
We wouldn't have much of a chance with him around.
- We could take a bath, wash our clothes--
- All right.
and I might even go so far as to get deloused.
Wait a minute!
She's a long way from here now.
Look at the date.
May, 1917.
- Four months ago.
- That's true.
Well, here's to her anyway.
Here's to 'em all, everywhere.
Albert,
- we might as well wash up anyway.
- All right.
Personally, I like 'em bigger around.
This conversation was on a high moral plane up to now.
Now we do need a bath.
- A bath?
- For what?
Hm.
You wouldn't understand.
This water is freezing.
This romantic business has gone too far.
- Ahh, but think of her beautiful eyes!
- Oh!
Oh, and her hair.
- Here we are!
- We're not gonna miss a thing!
- What are you doing here?
- Bathing!
They tell me there's some people in this world takes a bath every week!
Women!
Mademoiselle, you want to swim?
Mademoiselle!
Aw, baby!
Aw, no, girls!
Don't go away!
Aw, mama!
- Please don't go!
- Don't go away!
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!
Food!
Food!
Whoo-hoo!
Halt!
You know you're forbidden to cross.
You fellows stay on this side or you'll get yourselves in a lot of trouble.
- What are they jabbering' about?
- They want us to swing over tonight.
They're expecting us.
- That's fine!
- That blonde's crazy about me.
- But there's four of us and only three of them.
- I was the one that stopped 'em!
That blonde piece of work is mine.
You three fight for what's left.
Fight's the word.
All's fair in love and war.
Huh?
What do you mean?
What're you gonna do?
You'll find out.
Au revoir!
Au revoir!
- C'est moi, blondie!
- Bon ami!
Bon ami!
Vos camarades!
Vos camarades!
Ooh!
She means the door.
Not only modest, but dashing!
A perfect fit.
It might've been made for me.
An officer's coat.
We're calling distinguished company.
Ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Merci.
Have another little drink, comrade.
Is this your birthday or mine?
Why?
You've been buying me drink after drink for two hours.
What I'm tryin' to figure out is why.
Why?
Why?
Oh!
Ha-ha!
Oh.
I-It's just that the boys... told me to amuse you for a little while.
Oh, nice boys.
Yeah!
They-They said you'd understand.
Ehh... heh.
Huh?
I've been betrayed!
Yeah, you certainly have.
Take that for a minute!
I'll give you more!
Ahh.
It's too loud.
Suzanne.
And I wouldn't even know you if I did.
And yet, I'll remember you always.
Toujours.
Oh, if you could only know how different this is from the women we soldiers meet.
You.
That's what I'm talking about.
Vous.
It seems as though all war and terror and grossness... had fallen away from me... like a miracle.
Like something I never believed.
Pauvre garcon.
Pauvre garcon.
Frau Paul.
We're going, Paul.
Have a look.
Nice, new coffins.
Huh!
For us.
I must say, that's a very cheerful preparation for this offensive.
That's very considerate of them.
But I don't see any long enough for our comrade Tjaden.
Mind you, I'm not speaking to you, you traitors.
- But no coffin's gonna get me.
- I should say not, heartbreaker.
You'll be thankful if they slip a waterproof sheet...
- around that Aunt Sally of a carcass of yours.
Oh-Oh, my side!
My side.
Catholic hospital, Albert.
They say you always get good food and good treatment.
- We're lucky.
- After that rainy dressing station... and 24 hours on the train, we deserve to have some luck.
I'm Hamacher.
Yeah, that's my name.
I got a crack in the head and they gave me a certificate stating,
"Josef Hamacher is periodically... not responsible for his actions."
And ever since then, Hamacher has been having a grand time.
I hope you boys are not too badly wounded.
The others die off so quickly we don't have time to get acquainted.
You'll get to know us...
very well.
Thank you.
You too.
I'm sorry, my dear.
It's time to go now.
Yes, sister.
Watch.
If they take his clothes away, you've seen the last of him.
- See?
They're taking him to the dying room.
- Dying room?
When you're ready to kick the bucket, they get you out of the way so they can use the bed.
In the corner of the building there's a little room... right next to the morgue!
It's so convenient.
It saves a lot of trouble.
But suppose he gets well?
I've seen a lot of 'em go in that dying room, but nobody ever comes back.
Sister.
Sister.
Sister.
- Is that you ringing, Paul?
- Yes.
- Is something going on?
- I think I have a hemorrhage.
The bandage is all wet.
I've been ringing forever and nobody comes.
- I think I'm bleeding.
- Sister, get me a sterile dressing and an ice pack.
- Why didn't someone call me?
- He's been ringing.
Nobody can walk, Sister.
- Sister, is it bad?
- No.
No, we'll be all right.
We've got it in time.
What's the matter?
What are you doing?
We must rearrange your bandages.
Wh-
- Where are you taking me?
To the bandaging ward.
- No, no!
I'm not going!
I'm staying here!
- Paul!
Paul!
- Now, now!
- I'm not going to the dying room!
- We're going to the bandaging ward.
- Why are you taking my clothes?
You're lying to me!
But I'll come back.
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'm not going to die!
I'll come back!
Sister Libertine, how is he?
Poor boy.
They had to amputate his leg.
Paul.
Paul.
Paul.
Oh, he is... gone.
Gone.
Hello.
Welcome home, Albert!
- How do you feel, kid?
- All right.
But I've got such an awful pain.
My foot hur --
Hamacher.
Did they cut my leg off?
Of course not!
How many did you have?
Two?
You still got 'em!
One, two!
Don't play the fool, Hamacher.
Tell me truthfully.
Of course not.
And you look fine.
Look.
See?
- I won't be a cripple.
- Now, now.
- I won't live like that!
- Be calm.
- I'll kill myself the first chance I get!
- Albert!
- I won't live!
I won't live!
- Yes, you will.
Albert!
Albert!
Albert, I've come back!
I told you I'd come back.
Look, everybody!
I've come back!
- Paul!
Paul!
- That's not where I'm going.
I live over there.
Paul, I'm so happy.
Hamacher, I've come back from the dead!
- It's most irregular.
Never happened before.
- Albert, get well quickly... so we can go home soon.
- Everything will be all right now.
- Yes, Paul.
Everything will be all right... now.
Oh!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul.
- What's the matter, Paul?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
Paul.
Give me your handkerchief.
- Mother?
- Here I am, Paul.
Here I am.
Mother's ill.
- Are you wounded?
- No, Mother.
I got leave.
Here I am cryin' instead of being glad.
Anna, get down the jar of blackberries.
You still like them, don't you?
Yes, Mother.
I haven't had any for a long time.
We might almost have known you were coming.
- I'm making potato cakes.
- Don't let them burn.
Paul... sit down... beside me.
My Paul.
My baby.
I almost forgot, Mother.
I've got some little presents for you.
Look, Mother.
Bread, sausage and rice.
- Paul, you've been starving yourself.
- Hmm-mm.
Hadn't I better go and tell Father Paul's home?
- Paul could watch the things on the stove.
- No, I'm getting up.
Oh, Paul, you're a soldier now, aren't you?
But somehow, I don't seem to know you.
I'll take these off, Mother.
I'll get your suit.
It's in the wardrobe, just where you left it.
Are you really here, Paul?
You won't--
You won't disappear, will you?
No.
I'm here.
Your things are ready for you, Paul.
- I remember when you caught that one.
- Yes.
And you took it away from me, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
We're behind the lines, but we know how to honor the soldier... who goes on in spite of blood and death.
Gentlemen, my son.
- Prosit.
- Cheers.
I'm glad to know you, young man, I am glad to know you.
How are things out there?
Terrible, eh?
Terrible.
But we must carry on.
After all, you do at least get decent food out there.
Naturally, it's worse here.
Naturally.
But the best for our soldiers all the time.
That's our motto.
The best for our soldiers.
But...
- you must give the Frenchies a good licking!
And, if you boys want to come home, ehh,
let me show you what you must do before you can come home.
Give us a hand there, men.
Now, then, there's the line.
Runs so, in a "V".
Here is St. Quentin.
You can see for yourself.
You're almost through now.
All right?
Shove ahead out there and don't stick to that everlasting French warfare!
Smash through the johnnies!
And then you will have peace.
When you get in it... the war isn't the way it looks back here.
Oh!
You don't know anything about it.
Of course, you know about the details, but this relates to the whole!
You can't judge that.
Of course, you do your duty and you risk your life.
But for that, you receive the highest honor.
I said that every man in the war ought to have the lron Cross.
First, the enemy lines must be broken through in Flanders.
- On to Paris!
Push on to Paris!
- Right.
No, not in Flanders.
I'll tell you just where the break should come.
- Here.
- The enemy has too many reserves there.
- I insist upon Flanders!
- Why should they do that... when they're halfway through St. Quentin already?
Because Flanders is a flat country!
- No mountains, no obstructions!
- There's too many rivers there!
From the farms they have gone;
from the schools, from the factories.
They have gone bravely, nobly, ever forward, realizing there is no other duty now but to save the fatherland.
Paul!
How are you, Paul?
Glad to see you, Professor.
You've come at the right moment, Baumer!
Just at the right moment.
And as if to prove all I have said, here is one of the first to go.
A lad who sat before me on these very benches... who gave up all to serve in the first year of the war;
one of the iron youth who have made Germany invincible in the field.
Look at him-- sturdy and bronze and clear -eyed.
The kind of soldier every one of you should envy.
Oh, lad, you must speak to them.
You must tell them what it means to serve your fatherland.
- No, I can't tell them anything.
- You must, Paul.
Just a word.
Just tell them how much they're needed out there.
Tell them why you went and what it meant to you.
I can't say anything.
You can remember some deed of heroism, some touch of nobility.
Tell about it.
I can't tell you anything you don't know.
We live in the trenches out there.
We fight.
We try not to be killed;
sometimes we are.
That's all.
No.
No, Paul.
I've been there!
I know what it's like.
That's not what one dwells on, Paul.
I heard you in here reciting that same old stuff, making more iron men, more young heroes.
You still think it's beautiful and sweet to die for your country, don't you?
We used to think you knew.
The first bombardment taught us better.
It's dirty and painful to die for your country.
When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all!
There are millions out there dying for their countries, and what good is it?
You asked me to tell them how much they're needed out there.
He tells you, "Go out and die."
Oh, but if you'll pardon me, it's easier to say "Go out and die" than it is to do it.
- Coward!
- And it's easier to say it than to watch it happen.
No!
No!
Boys, boys!
- I'm sorry, Baumer, but I must say--
- It's no use talking like this.
You won't know what I mean.
Only, it's been a long while since we enlisted out of this classroom.
So long I thought maybe the whole world had learned by this time.
Only now they're sending babies, and they won't last a week!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
Up at the front you're alive or you're dead, and that's all!
You can't fool anybody about that very long.
Up there we know we're lost and done for whether we're dead or alive.
Three years we've had of it-- four years.
Every day a year and every night a century.
Our bodies are earth and our thoughts are clay, and we sleep and eat with death.
We're done for because you can't live that way and keep anything inside you!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
I'll go back tomorrow.
I've got four days more, but I can't stand it here!
I'll go back tomorrow!
Sorry.
Mother, you'll catch cold here.
You must go to sleep.
There'll be plenty of time to sleep... when you're gone.
Must you go tomorrow, Paul?
Must you?
Yes, Mother.
Orders were changed.
Are you very much afraid, Paul?
No, Mother.
There's something I want to say to you, Paul.
It's--
Just be on your guard against the women out there.
They're no good.
Where we are, there aren't any women, Mother.
Be very careful at the front, Paul.
Yes, Mother, I will.
I'll pray for you every day.
And if you could, get a job that's not quite so dangerous.
Yes, Mother.
I'll try and get in the cookhouse.
- That can easily be done.
- You do it then, and if the others say anything--
That won't worry me, Mother.
Now, you must go to bed and you must get well quickly before I come back.
I put two sets of underwear -- new ones-- in your pack.
They'll keep you nice and warm.
They're all wool.
That's sweet of you.
Good night...
my son.
Good night, Mother.
Oh, Mother, Mother.
You still think I'm a child.
Why can't I put my head in your lap and cry?
- Is this the 2nd Company?
- Yes, sir.
- Is this all of it?
- Yes, sir.
We had 150 men, but this is all that came back yesterday.
But now they're going to give us enough to make 150 again.
How old are you?
Sixteen.
No use.
I couldn't find anything.
- We'll have to eat the sawdust.
Not me!
I'll go hungry first.
It makes me sick.
Now it's gonna be a real war again.
Paul!
How's old Paul?
Here I am.
You know, the 2nd Company's getting hard to find.
Nobody seemed to know where you were.
I'm glad you found it.
I guess I don't get much of this.
There used to be some food in the sawdust.
Now it's all sawdust.
No joke, either.
Eats ya up inside.
This doesn't look much like the old 2nd Company.
The replacements are all like that.
Not even old enough to carry a pack.
All they know how to do is die.
I guess... some of the old-timers are here yet.
Paul, they're tryin' to invent somethin' to kill me right now.
Where's Westhus?
Messenger dog was wounded.
He went out to get it.
- Is it true about the armistice?
- Doesn't look that way back there.
- You mean they want us to go on fighting?
- That's what they say.
They're crazy!
Germany'll be empty pretty soon.
Where is-- Where is Detering?
He got homesick.
You remember about the cherry blossoms?
I guess he never got over that.
He started out one night to go home and help his wife with the farm.
They got him behind the lines, and we never heard of him since.
He was just homesick, but probably they couldn't see it that way.
Where's Kat?
Is he--
Not Kat!
If he were out, the war would be over.
You remember what he always says:
They're savin' him for the last.
- Where is he?
- He's out lookin' for food, something to make soup with.
-Which way?
-Down the road about two miles that way.
I'll see you later.
Kat!
Paul!
Hello, Paul.
- How's the side?
- Oh, it's all right now.
It's fine.
- Have any luck?
- No, the general's staff's been over this country with a rake.
Let's sit down there.
Tell me, Paul...
how was it at home?
Have a good leave?
- In spots.
- What's the matter?
Ohh...
I'm no good for back there anymore, Kat.
None of us are.
We've been in this too long.
The young men thought I was a coward because I told them that... we learn that death is stronger than duty to one's country.
The old men said, "Go on.
Push on to Paris."
My father even wanted me to wear my uniform around him.
It's not home back there anymore.
All I could think of was, "I'd like to get back and see Kat again."
You're all I've got left, Kat.
I'm not much to have left.
I missed you, Paul.
At least we know what it's all about out here.
There're no lies here.
Push on to Paris?
You ought to see what they've got on the other side.
They eat white bread over there.
They've got dozens of airplanes to our one, and tanks that'll go over anything.
What've we got left?
Guns so worn they drop shells on our own men.
No food, no ammunition, no officers.
Push on to Paris!
So that's the way they talk back there.
I guess we'd better be going.
How I lied to my poor mother.
I told her it wasn't so bad out here because there was always a lot of us together.
Now that I'm with you, I'm beginning to believe that I told her the truth.
Down!
That's another one that missed us.
Come on.
Let's go.
Wait a minute.
Looks like the old bread wagon's broke down.
- I guess I don't walk the rest of the way.
- Did that get ya, Kat?
Aah, I think it broke my shin.
That's not so bad.
Hold it together.
- Just my luck, huh?
- Good luck.
That means the war is over.
Oh, no, sir!
This war don't end till they really get me.
Now this one--
- Aah.
- Easy, now.
- Hey!
- Easy!
Easy!
Come on.
I'll take you in.
Give me your hand.
Easy.
All right.
Well, kid...
now we're gonna be separated.
Maybe we can do something together later on when the war is over.
- Yes, kid.
- You give me your address, I'll give you mine.
You can't get both of us in one day.
Ah, we'll surely see each other again, Kat.
Remember that day when you brought the whole pig into the factory?
And that day in the woods when you taught us how to dodge shells?
And my first bombardment.
How I cried.
I was a young recruit then.
Here we are.
Here we are.
All right now, Kat.
You could've spared yourself the trouble.
He's dead.
Oh, no.
He's just fainted.
He was hit in the shin.
He's dead.
Would you like to take his pay book?
- You're not related, are you?
- No, we're not related.
Your deal.
Get his name and number?
Yeah, Corporal Stanislaus Katczinsky, 306.
"ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT"
This story is neither an... accusation nor a confession... and least of all an adventure... for death is not an adventure... to those who stand face to face... with it.
It will try simply to... tell of a generation of men who.
even though they may have... escaped its shells, were destroyed... by the war...
- Thirty thousand.
- From the Russians?
No, from the French.
From the Russians we capture more than that every day.
Mr. Postman.
War is war and schnapps is schnapps, and business must go on.
You didn't leave the mail yet this morning.
Ah, I'm sorry, Mr. Meyer.
Hello, Himmelstoss.
Anything for us today?
- No, no, Master Peter.
- Oh, there must be something.
Here, here you go, young lad.
There.
This is the last mail deliver anyhow.
- What?
- Tomorrow I change uniforms.
- You're going in the army?
- Yes, I was called.
I'm a sergeant in the reserves, you know.
I'll be called my self, if it doesn't end in a few months.
- It will, though.
- I'm sure you're right, Mr. Meyer.
...defending our country, our father land.
Now, my beloved class, this is what we must do.
Strike with all our power.
Give every ounce of strength... to win victory before the end of the year.
It is with reluctance that I bring this subject up again.
You are the life of the fatherland, you boys.
You are the iron men of Germany.
You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy... when you are called upon to do so.
It is not for me to suggest that any of you... should stand up and offer to defend his country.
But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads.
I know that in one of the schools... the boys have risen up in the classroom... and enlisted in a mass.
But, of course, if such a thing should happen here... you would not blame me for a feeling of pride.
Perhaps some will say... that you should not be allowed to go yet... that you are too young, that you have homes, mothers.
Fathers... that you should not be torn away.
Are your fathers so forgetful of their fatherland... that they would let it perish father than you?
Are your mothers so weak that they cannot send a son... to defend the land which gave them birth?
And after all, is a little experience... such a had thing for a boy?
Is the honour of wearing a uniform... something from which we should run?
And if our young ladies glory in those who wear it... is that anything to be ashamed of?
I know you have never desired the adulation of heroes.
That has not been part of my teaching.
We have sought to make ourselves worthy... and let a claim come when it would.
But to he foremost in battle... is a virtue not to be despised.
I believe it will he a quick war... that there will he few losses.
But if losses there must be... then let us remember the Latin phrase... which must have come to the lips of many a Roman... when he stood embattled in a foreign land:
"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."
"Sweet and fitting it is to die for the fatherland."
Some of you may have ambitions.
I know of one young man who has great promise as a writer... and he has written the first act of a tragedy... which would be a credit to one of the masters.
And he is dreaming, I suppose... of following in the footsteps of Goethe and Schiller... and I hope he will.
But now our country calls.
The fatherland needs leaders.
Personal ambition must be thrown aside... in the one great sacrifice for our country.
Here is a glorious beginning to your fives.
The field of honour calls you.
Why are we here?
You, Kropp, what has kept you back?
You, Mueller, you know how much you are needed?
Ah, I see you look at your leader.
And I, too, look to you, Paul Baumer... and I wonder what you are going to do.
- I'll go.
- I want to go.
Count on me.
- Me too.
- I'm ready.
I'm not gonna stay home!
Follow me!
Enlist now!
- No more classes!
- No more classes!
- Don't be a quitter!
- Come on, Behn!
Stick together.
That's what we've got to do.
- Let's all stick together.
- Come on, Behn.
All right.
All right.
- I'll go.
- That's the way!
Let's go!
Hey!
Let's sing!
Come on!
Keep in line there, soldiers.
Anything you say, General.
Detail, halt!
Left face!
Get into uniform, ready to report.
Fall out!
I betcha a place like this gets you in good condition.
You have to be for the long marches.
I'm gonna get in the cavalry and ride.
No cavalry for me.
Infantry's where you see the fighting.
Where are all the guns?
That's what I want to know.
Oh, you don't get a gun for a long while yet.
If I'm gonna bump off the enemy, I gotta have some practice.
Bayonet drill.
That's what I want.
You won a medal that times, Mueller.
You wait.
In about a month I'll be covered with them.
Say, keep your boots out of my face!
Why, it's an Honor to have those boots in your face.
They're the best pair in the army!
My uncle gave them to me.
Just look at that special imported leather.
Put them anyplace you like, except in my face.
Not even a kitchen maid'll look at me in this!
Attention!
Well, for the love of...
It's Himmelstoss!
- So it is.
- And all dressed up.
Hello, Himmie.
You didn't think you'd see me again so soon, did you?
- You see my rank?
- Sure.
Fall back, then!
Himmelstoss, we certainly are glad to see you.
What did you say?
- I was going to say...
- Never mind!
What's the matter with you?
When you address your superior officer, say "sir"!
- Where'd he get such a nice uniform?
- Any mail for us, Himmie?
- Quiet!
- My dear fellow, you're shouting.
Ah, come on, Himmelstoss.
We know ya.
Take off the false whiskers.
- I believe you mean it!
- You'll find out that I mean it.
But only three days ago you were our postman.
Silence!
Come back here!
Line up!
Line up!
Get in some kind of a line!
All of you!
Line up, I say!
What a pretty sight that is!
Have you never heard of standing in line?
You make a fine mess of it.
Well, I'll have to teach you.
We'll append the whole day on it, huh?
You may be stupid but I'm used to that.
And then there'll be plenty of other things too.
Oh, I'll not neglect you.
You're not much to begin with... but I'll do my best.
I see that we have come here with a slight misunderstanding... and we'll correct that, too, won't we, huh?
And the first thing to do is to forget everything you ever knew.
Everything you ever learned, forget!
See?
Forget what you've been and what you think you're going to be.
You're going to be soldiers, and that's all!
I'll take the mother's milk out of you!
I'll make you hard-boiled!
I'll make soldiers out of you or kill you!
Now... salute!
Detachment...
lie down!
Head down!
Keep your head down, Baumer!
Detachment... get up!
Now sing!
Do you call that singing?
Detachment, halt!
So... we have no spirit, huh?
We are in no mood for recreation.
Work is what we want.
Good!
Then we'll go back to work!
Detachment...
lie down!
Keep your head down!
Now sing!
Men... halt!
Order, arms!
Inspection at 3:00.
Dismissed!
Oh, that swine!
That means we get no time off.
It will take four hours to get ready for inspection.
- I'd like to know what's in his mind.
- He hasn't got any!
I'm gonna cut him open sometime and find out!
He's too thick-skinned.
He won't cut.
This is the fourth time he's made me disappoint that poor girl.
Arms!
Order, arms!
Left shoulder, arms!
Squad right.
To the right, march!
Left, left, left, left.
Follow right, march!
Squad, left march!
Forward... march!
Detachment... halt!
Present arms!
Himmelstoss.
Excellent work.
They're going up front tomorrow.
- I recommend leave till midnight.
- Very good, sir.
Left, left, left.
Detachment...
lie down!
Crawl forward!
He spoiled our leave.
I'll never forgive him for that.
- The rat!
- Leave till midnight.
It'll take till midnight to dry our clothes.
There goes the filthy ape now.
While we slave over this mud, he goes off to have a few drinks!
Someday I'm going to take one smack at him... just one.
Me too.
That's gonna be my life's work from now on.
Why only one?
I'm gonna take several.
I might even kick him while he's down I feel mean.
What are you doing?
You're not going to desert, are you?
What?
Listen.
I've got an idea.
Crawl forward!
Lie down!
Lie down!
Crawl forward!
Oh!
What?
Cover!
Paul, you all right?
Behn!
Behn!
Behn!
Come on!
Behn, come on!
You fool!
Behn!
Get up!
Come on.
Sounds like more replacements coming in.
Yeah.
Tjaden must have gone home, for that wood.
There's some more, fresh from the turnip patch.
I suppose this is where we bunk.
That's me, "I. Westhus..."
and this is where I live.
- I didn't know!
- Well, you know now!
Yes.
Yes, of course.
- It's all right.
- Here's a bunk, Paul.
- When did we eat last?
- Don't remind me.
- I was fine until you spoke.
- Where are we anyway?
I don't know.
The name on the railroad station's been shot off.
There must be something to eat somewhere.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll ask those fellas.
Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Westhus.
Oh.
Meet Detering.
A better farmer never lived.
- And Mr. Tjaden.
- Sit down.
You see, we haven't eaten since breakfast.
We thought maybe you could tell us what we ought to do about it.
Eat without further delay.
Well, what's funny about that?
This is a bad town to bring an appetite to, soldier.
We've been here since yesterday morning living on baled hay and razor blades.
We're willing to buy our food.
Where's the canteen?
The only canteen in these regions is out looking for supplies.
- Ever hear of Katczinsky?
- Who?
Katczinsky.
He's uncanny.
If there's any food within 25 miles, he'll be the one to get it.
Attention!
What's this?
Volunteers for the future general's staff.
Sometime I'm gonna take one of you volunteers apart... and find out what makes you leave school and join the army.
At ease.
This is no parade ground.
- Hungry?
- Yes.
Wait!
Wait a minute!
That's no invitation.
- Can you pay?
- Yeah, sure.
I have some money.
No, not money.
That's just pieces of paper.
Have you got any cigarettes, cigars...
- Or soap, cognac...
- Yeah.
- Chewing tobacco?
- Yeah, yeah.
Kat!
Are you crazy?
There ain't enough here for us.
I wish you three would get bumped off.
I'm tired of feeding ya for nothing.
Bring everything you got.
- I'm so hungry...
- I'd be glad to give you...
- Come on!
- Is this enough, sir?
Kat!
- You've got the wiring detail tonight.
- Where?
- Past the graveyard.
- With this bunch?
It's quiet tonight.
You can teach them a couple of things.
Thanks.
I'd rather do it alone.
- These babes get killed off too fast.
- Well, the lorry's waiting.
Last night I was too hungry to sleep... and tonight, when I get the wrinkles out of my gut, they think up wiring duty.
Well, here's your chances, heroes.
For the fatherland!
Come on, get your stuff and let's get out of here.
- Is that any way to drive?
- Let him drive any way he wants.
Suppose he breaks your arm.
You get sent home, don't you?
A lot better than having a hole in your guts.
If there's any of you left, I'll pick you up in the morning.
Well, if that ride you gave us didn't kill us, nothing will.
And be on time.
I don't want to miss my breakfast.
You better wait for your army, Papa.
Here, here.
Don't be so backward.
Listen, children.
All we got to do is to string a little wire.
We pick it up at the dump and carry it to where we need it.
Now, you're gonna see some shell fire, and you're gonna be scared, see?
It's all right, boy.
Get up.
Here.
Never mind.
It's happened to better men than you, and it's happened to me.
When we come back, I'll get you all some nice clean underwear.
That kind of shell you don't have to pay much attention to.
Those big fellas just make a lot of noise and land about... five miles behind the line.
The things we've got to watch out for are the light ones.
They don't give you much warning.
They go "waa-aa-aah zing."
And when you hear that, down!
Mother Earth.
Press yourselves down upon her.
Bury yourselves deep into her.
Just keep your eyes on me.
When you see me flop, you flop... only try to beat me to it.
Now listen.
I'll show you how it's done.
Give me a couple of those.
That's to kill the noise.
Tjaden.
See that?
- What's that mean?
- Bombardment.
My eyes!
I'm blind!
I can't see!
God!
My eyes!
I can't see!
- I can't see!
- It's Behn!
It's Behn!
- I'll go get him...
- You'll get killed!
- Let me...
- Lay down and stay there!
He's dead.
- He's dead!
- Why did you risk your life... bringing him in?
But it's Behn!
- My friend.
- He's a corpse, no matter who it is.
Now, don't any of you ever do that again.
Put him over there.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
All right, come on.
All right, come on.
Get your packs and fall in.
Hurry up!
Come on.
Hurry up.
Make it snappy.
Get your packs and fall in.
Kat, what are we doing?
What's happening?
You heard him.
Orders to march.
- But where to, for the love of...
- Another party.
And this one is gonna last a long time.
Come on.
Here we go.
Company, attention!
Shoulder arms!
March right, march!
Take your hands off that!
- Queen takes it!
- Well, if you think... that's a queen, look again.
Ah, it's a jack.
- Yeah.
- Honest, these cards all look alike.
It's too noisy!
I can't play.
I suppose your delicate nerves...
- Can't stand it.
- Get up!
That's Oscar.
The son of a...
Look at that!
Don't be so snooty.
You may wish you had this back.
About two more days of this... and this rat-bitten and of a piece of bread's gonna taste... like a hunk of fruitcake.
It wouldn't...
It wouldn't last two more days, would it?
Didn't I tell you this was gonna be a bad one?
I don't mind the days so much.
It's keeping up all night...
Ah, two more days makes a week, kid.
Then you can say you've been under fire!
You're not scared, are you?
No.
I was just asking.
That's all.
- Wanna play some more?
- Do you?
- Sure.
- All right.
My deal.
You better get your boot back before Oscar eats that!
The kid's all right.
Yeah, yeah.
Let him sleep.
He's dreaming.
Oh, God.
Can't you see it's Behn?
He didn't want to come to war!
No, no.
It isn't Behn.
It isn't Behn!
It's Kemmerick!
It's me!
Shut up, will you?
It's bad enough in here as it is.
Every...
Everything's all right, Franz.
You're dreaming.
You're just dreaming, I guess.
- Attention!
- At ease.
The barrage is getting worse.
The men in two more dugouts gone.
However, we'll do our best to get some food up here by evening.
Stop!
Stop!
Let me out!
- What did you do that for?
- Shut up!
Grab him.
- No.
- Now hold him.
You all right now?
I think so.
I couldn't hold out much longer.
- Oh, god, it's Franz!
- Get him over there!
No, he's been hit in the stomach.
He can't have anything to drink.
Get a stretcher.
Where'd they get you, Kemmerick?
- Here it is, sir.
- Take his head.
All right.
Take him out.
- Is it serious, sir?
- I'm not sure.
- Tell the others he's all right.
- Yes, sir.
If we're going to fight, why don't we fight?
Why don't we go over?
You could go crazy staying here.
Let's do something!
- Let's go after them!
- Sit down!
If that cook of ours had any guts, he'd try to bring something through.
He's so far behind the lines he can't hear the shooting!
- Here's Kat.
Get anything?
- Any luck?
- We'll have to split this up among us.
- Something to eat!
We need butter too.
Yes.
And dessert.
And a feather bed to sleep on.
- Rats!
Rats!
- Rats!
Get out of the way!
What's that?
Come on!
Grab your rifles!
Come on!
- Here they come.
- Get your grenades here.
Hurry up.
Come on, hurry up.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Back to your own lines!
- Fill it up.
- And hurry up.
I've got other things to do.
I've been waiting for this for three weeks.
When they all get here.
What do you want?
Beans, you homely - looking son of a frog's leg.
- What do you think I want?
- We're hungry.
Shut up!
I'll feed you when you're all here.
- We're all here now.
- Only half the company's here.
Get the rest.
Wake them up.
I wish I could wake them up.
There's 80 of us left.
The rest is in dressing stations or pushing up daisies.
Eighty?
And I cooked for 150!
All right.
We'll have enough for once.
Come on.
Dish out!
You mean you've cooked beans for 150... and you've got bread for 150... and sausage for 150, and tobacco for 150?
Everything!
It's all wrong.
I should have been notified.
What a feast!
Everyone gets two issues.
- Get back in line!
Get back in line!
- Oh, no!
That won't do.
I can't give 80 men what's meant for 150.
Listen.
You drew rations for the 2nd Company, didn't ya?
Yeah.
All right.
We're the 2nd Company.
I've got my orders.
- Kat's right.
- We're the 2nd Company?
And if only half of us get back, that's our good luck.
- Come on.
Dish it out.
- Come on!
- No!
- Hey!
You're the yellowest baboon that ever drew a cook wagon... and you're scared...
it shows.
All we want to hear out of you is one more little yip... and we'll cut ya up and eat ya raw.
Why, you keep your kitchen so far back of the lines... we never get anything to eat until it's cold and we're asleep!
Now, you low-down rat, get out... or we wreck the joint!
- Come on!
Give us...
- Attention!
At ease.
What's going on here?
He's cooked for 150, sir, and he only wants to give us half.
- Looks pretty good.
- Yes, sir.
Serve the whole issue.
- The men can use it.
- Yes, sir.
- And bring me a plate too.
- Yes, sir.
All right.
Take it all.
Take everything.
Give them honey.
Give them what they want.
- Fill it up!
- Fill it up!
- Don't mind me.
- Oh, that's all right.
Don't mention it.
You know...
I could do with some more beans.
Go help yourself.
There's more ever there.
It's too far.
I wonder, when are we going back to the front?
Tomorrow.
It's enough to take away a man's appetite.
You know, if they're gonna march us in again tomorrow... we ought to go see how Kemmerick is.
- That's a good idea.
- Let's do that.
- How far is the dressing station?
- About two miles.
- We could take his things to him.
- Good!
It seemed rotten to think of a thing like that happening to him... a nice fellow like Kemmerick.
Ah, the French certainly deserve to be punished for starting this war.
Everybody says it's somebody else.
Well, how do they start a war?
Well, one country offends another.
How could one country offend another?
You mean there's a mountain over in Germany gets mad... at a field over in France?
Well, stupid, one people offends another.
Oh, if that's it, I shouldn't be here at all.
I don't feel offended.
It don't apply to tramps like you.
Good.
Then I can be going home right away.
- Ah, you just try it.
- Yeah.
You wanna get shot?
The Kaiser and me...
Me and the Kaiser felt just alike about this war.
We didn't either of us want any war, so I'm going home.
- He's there already.
- Somebody must have wanted it.
Maybe it was the English.
No, I don't want to shoot any Englishmen.
I never saw one till I came up here.
And I suppose most of them never saw a German till they came up here.
No, I'm sure they weren't asked about it.
No.
Well... it must be doing somebody some good.
- Not me and the Kaiser.
- I think maybe the Kaiser... wanted a war.
You leave us out of this.
I don't see that.
The Kaiser's got everything he needs.
Well, he never had a war before.
Every full-grown emperor needs one war to make him famous.
- Why, that's history.
- Yeah, generals too.
They need war.
And manufacturers.
They get rich.
I think it's more a kind of fever.
Nobody wants it in particular... and then all at once, there it is.
We didn't want it.
The English didn't want it.
And here we are fighting.
I'll tell you how it should all be done.
Whenever there's a big war coming on...
- You should rope off a big field...
- And sell tickets.
Yeah.
And...
And on the big day... you should take all the kings and their cabinets and their generals... put them in the center dressed in their underpants... and let them fight it out with clubs.
The best country wins.
Well, now that Kat's settled everything, let's go see Kemmerick.
Something interesting might happen on the way.
Might cheer him up.
Boys, me and the Kaiser want you back in time to march tomorrow.
Don't forget.
- We'll be back.
- Give the boy my regards.
There he is.
- Hello, Kemmerick.
- How are you?
How's it going?
How are things going?
Are they looking after you all right?
How are they treating you?
Franz?
They're robbers here.
Robbers.
They stole my watch!
I always told you, nobody should carry as good a watch as that.
- They took it while I was under ether!
- Franz, you'll get it back.
Do you feel all right?
- Just look at my hand.
- That's because you lost... so much blood.
Just eat decently and you'll get well again.
You must eat.
What's the main thing.
It looks good too.
I have such a terrible pain in my foot.
Every toe on my right foot hurts.
Well, how can your foot hurt when your leg's been...
I know what you mean!
I know!
I know now!
They cut my leg off.
Why didn't they tell me?
Why...
Why didn't they tell me?
- Franz!
Franz!
- Now I can't walk anymore!
You must be thankful that you've come off with only that.
I wanted to be a forester once.
You can yet.
They make artificial legs that are wonderful.
And you're through too.
You can go home.
Think of that.
We brought your things for you.
See?
Put them under the bed.
That's a marvellous pair of boots.
Look at that leather!
What comfort.
I was just thinking.
If you're not going to be using these, Franz... why din't you leave them with us?
What good are they to you?
I can use them.
My boots give me blister after blister...
Well, we'll be going, Franz.
Oh, don't go.
Stay just a little while longer.
- I'll come right back.
We'll be coming soon again, Franz.
- I know you'll be feeling better.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Good-bye, Franz.
You think he'll last till after mess?
- I don't think...
- Done for.
Boys, you go along.
I'll see you later.
Good-bye.
All right, Paul.
I'm sorry, Paul.
I wouldn't touch a thing of his if he could use it.
I'd go barefoot over barbed wire for him if it'd do him any good.
Only...
Only why should some orderly get those boots?
I understand, Mueller.
We're all alike out here.
And good boots are scarce.
Tell the doctor to come, please.
Doctor, the man in the next bed would like to see you, sir.
I've done everything I can for him.
There's no helping him.
Poor little fella.
He says next time, Franz.
Do you think I'll ever get well?
Why, of course.
- Do you really think so?
- Sure, once you get... over the operation.
I don't think so.
Franz!
Don't talk nonsense.
Why, you'll be as good as new.
They fix up worse things than that.
Perhaps you'll go to the convalescent home... in Klosterberg among the villagers.
Then you can look out of the windows, across the fields... to the two trees on the horizon.
The loveliest time of the year now when the corn ripens.
You can go out without asking anyone.
You can even play piano if you want to.
Oh...
Oh, but, Franz, you must try to sleep now.
O God... this is Franz Kemmerick... only 19 years old.
He doesn't want to die.
Please don't let him die.
Paul.
- Paul.
- Franz.
Take my boots home for Mueller.
Oh, no, Franz, no.
And if...
Paul... you find my watch, send it home.
Franz!
Doctor!
Doctor!
Doctor!
Doctor!
Where's the doctor?
Why isn't there a doctor here?
Doctor, come quick!
- Franz Kemmerick is dying!
- Which one is that?
- Amputated leg.
- I've amputated a dozen legs today.
- Bed 26, sir.
- You see to it.
I'm due in the operating room.
One operating after another since 5:00 this morning.
Sixteen dead today, and yours is the 17th.
There'll probably be 20 by the morning.
You're looking good.
Very good today.
What's your hurry?
Hey!
I'll bet he stole those boots!
I got it, Kat.
Listen: "The sum of an arithmetic series... is S = A + L x N over 2."
Interesting, isn't it?
What do you wanna learn that stuff for?
One day you'll stop a bullet and it'll all be worthless.
I get a lot of fun out of it.
My boots!
Mueller.
I saw him die.
I didn't know what it was like to die before.
And then... then I came outside... and it felt... it felt so good to be alive that I started in to walk fast.
I began to think of the strangest things... like being out in the fields.
Things like that.
You know... girls.
And it felt as if there were... something electric running from the ground up through me.
And I started.
I began to run hard.
I passed soldiers and I heard voices calling to me.
I ran and I ran.
I felt as if I couldn't breathe enough air into me.
And...
And now I'm hungry.
I don't mind the war now.
Be a pleasure to go to the front in boots like these.
It's a good invention just the same.
If you crack each separate louse, think of all the energy you use up.
Watch.
Burned to death.
How was patrol?
Bad?
Must've been terrible if they had time to gather the harvest.
We passed a cherry tree and when he saw it, he went crazy.
I could hardly drag him away.
It was... beautiful.
I have a big orchard with cherry trees at home.
When they're in full blossom... from the hayloft it looks like one single sheet.
So white.
- Perhaps you can get leave soon.
- You may even be sent... back as a farmer.
A woman can't run a farm alone.
That's no good, you know?
No matter how hard she works.
Harvest coming on again.
What's the matter with him?
Got a letter yesterday from his wife.
He wants to get back to his farm.
We'd all like to get back home.
I wonder what we'd do if it were suddenly peacetime again?
Get drunk and look for women!
I'd go looking for a Cinderella... that could wear this for a garter.
And when I'd found her, nobody'd see me for two weeks.
I'll go back to the peat fields... and those pleasant hours in the beer gardens.
And there's worse things than cobbling too.
Look.
My family.
I oughta give you a kick in the backside for starting all this.
It's all right for all you to talk.
You've got something to go back to.
Wives, children, jobs.
But what about us?
What have we got to go back to?
- School?
- Why not?
You know everything already.
A man can't take all that rubbish they teach you seriously... after three years of shells and bombs.
You can't peel that off easily.
They never taught us anything really useful... like how to light a cigarette in the wind or make a fire out of wet wood... or bayonet a man in the belly instead of the ribs where it gets jammed.
What can happen to us afterwards?
I'll tell you.
Take our class.
Out of 20, three are officers... nine dead...
Mueller and three others wounded... and one in the madhouse.
We'll all be dead someday, so let's forget it.
Hurry up!
Get in there!
Hurry up!
Himmelstoss!
What's up?
- What are you, crazy?
- It's Himmelstoss!
Himmelstoss?
There is justice in the army!
Well, well.
So, we are all here, huh?
A bit longer than you, Himmie.
Since when have we become so familiar?
Stand up and click your heels together!
All of you!
- Take a running jump at yourself!
- Who's your friend?
Would somebody get General Ludendorff a nice, comfortable chair?
I command you as your superior officer!
- Do you want to be court-martialed?
- I do!
There's going to be a big attack tonight... and I'd just love to get out of it.
Kiss my butt!
It isn't customary to ask for salutes here.
But I'll tell you what we'll do.
We're going to attack a town that we tried to take once before.
Many killed and many wounded.
It was great fun.
This time you're going with us.
If any of us stops a bullet, before we die... we're going to come to you, click our heels together and ask stiffly...
"Please, Sergeant Himmelstoss, may we go?"
You'll...
You'll pay for this, you...
There it is.
Right on time.
Better get ready, boys.
I'm wounded!
I'm wounded!
It's just a scratch, you yellow rat!
Up!
Get out with the others!
- Up!
- No!
No!
No!
You yellow rat!
Stinking yellow rat!
Let the others do it, eh?
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!
Forward!
- Get out here.
- Command... was forward.
Command was forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Counterattack.
I want to help you.
I want to help you.
Stop that!
Stop it, stop it.
I can bear the rest of it.
I can't listen to that!
Why do you take so long dying?
You're going to die anyway!
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
You won't die.
Oh, no.
You won't die.
They're only little wounds.
You'll get home.
You'll be all right.
You'll get home long before I will.
You know I can't run away.
That's why you accuse me.
I tell you, I didn't want to kill you.
I tried to keep you alive.
If you jumped in here again, I wouldn't do it.
When you jumped in here you were my enemy, and I was afraid of you.
But you're just a man like me, and I killed you.
Forgive me, comrade.
Say that for me.
Say you forgive me.
Oh, no.
You're dead.
You're better off than I am.
You're through.
They can't do any more to you now.
Oh, God, why did they do this to us?
We only wanted to live, you and I.
Why should they send us out to fight each other?
If we threw away these rifles and these uniforms... you could be my brother just like Kat and Albert.
You'll have to forgive me, comrade.
I'll do all I can.
I'll write to your parents.
I'll write to...
I'll write to your wife.
I'll write to her.
I promise she'll not want for anything.
I'll help her and your parents too.
Only forgive me.
Forgive me!
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Terrible thing happened yesterday.
I stabbed a man.
With my own hands, stabbed him.
I know how it is.
Your first time.
Never mind.
The stretcher-bearers will find him.
- He's dead.
I watched him die.
- You couldn't do anything about it.
We have to kill.
We can't help it.
That's what we are here for.
Look there, for instance.
That got him.
You should've seen how he leaped in the air.
That fellow had to shoot with us for today with three hits.
If he keeps it up, he'll have a decoration for his... buttonhole this evening.
Don't you lose any more sleep over this business.
Maybe it was because I was out there with him so long, huh?
Sure, that's it.
After all, war is war.
March!
Forward!
Forward, march!
Quick there!
Forward!
Company... halt!
Dismissed!
Uncommissioned officers, enlisted men... dismiss!
Come on!
Let's get outta here!
- Give me your best sausage.
- Two.
Give me a beer.
One, two, three!
Hey, come on.
A beer.
Hey, get out of here!
Come on.
Give me a beer.
A beer.
One b... here's hoping we get falling-down drunk tonight.
Here's how it started.
I'd forgotten there were girls like that.
There aren't.
Just look at those thin, little shoes.
She couldn't march many miles in those.
Paul!
Don't speak about marching.
You're boring the young lady.
A thousand pardons.
- How old you think she is?
- Oh, about 22.
No, that'd make her older than us.
She's... 17.
A girl like that.
That'd be good, Albert?
We wouldn't have much of a chance with him around.
We could take a bath wash our clothes...
All right.
And I might even go so far as to get deloused.
Wait a minute!
She's a long way from here now.
Look at the date.
May, 1917.
- Four months ago.
- That's true.
Well, here's to her anyway.
Here's to them all, everywhere.
Albert...
- We might as well wash up anyway.
- All right.
Personally, I like them bigger around.
This conversation was on a high moral plane up to now.
Now we do need a bath.
- A bath?
- For what?
You wouldn't understand.
This water is freezing.
This romantic business has gone too far.
Ahh, but think of her beautiful eyes!
Oh, and her hair.
- Here we are!
- We're not gonna miss a thing!
Go away!
- What are you doing here?
- Bathing!
They tell me there's some people in this world takes a bath every week!
Women!
Mademoiselle, you want to swim?
Mademoiselle!
Aw, baby!
Aw, no, girls!
Don't go away!
Aw, mama!
- Please don't go!
- Don't go away!
Food!
Food!
Halt!
You know you're forbidden to cross.
You fellows stay on this side or you'll get... yourselves in a lot of trouble.
What are they jabbering about?
They want us to swing over tonight.
They're expecting us.
- That's fine!
- We'll do it!
That blonde's crazy about me.
But there's four of us and only three of them.
I was the one that stopped them!
That blonde piece of work is mine.
You three fight for what's left.
Fight's the word.
All's fair in love and war.
What do you mean?
What're you gonna do?
You'll find out.
Au revoir!
Au revoir!
- C'est moi, blondie!
- Bon ami!
Bon ami!
Vos camarades!
Vos camarades!
She means the door.
Not only modest, but dashing!
A perfect fit.
It might've been made for me.
An officer's coat.
We're calling distinguished company.
Merci.
Have another little drink, comrade.
Is this your birthday or mine?
Why?
You've been buying me drink after drink for two hours.
What I'm trying to figure out is why.
Why?
Why?
Oh.
I it's just that the boys... told me to amuse you for a little while.
Oh, nice boys.
They...
They said you'd understand.
I've been betrayed!
Yeah, you certainly have.
Take that for a minute!
I'll give you more!
It's too loud.
Suzanne.
And I wouldn't even know you if I did.
And yet, I'll remember you always.
Toujours.
Oh, if you could only know how different this is... from the women we soldiers meet.
You.
That's what I'm talking about.
Vous.
It seems as though all war and terror and grossness... had fallen away from me... like a miracle.
Like something I never believed.
Pauvre gar‡on.
Pauvre gar‡on.
Frau Paul.
We're going, Paul.
Have a look.
Nice, new coffins.
Huh!
For us.
I must say, that's a very cheerful preparation for this offensive.
That's very considerate of them.
But I don't see any long... enough for our comrade Tjaden.
Mind you, I'm not speaking to you, you traitors.
- But no coffin's gonna get me.
- I should say not, heartbreaker.
You'll be thankful if they slip a waterproof sheet... around that Aunt Sally of a carcass of yours.
Oh...
Oh, my side!
My side.
Catholic hospital, Albert.
They say you always get good food and good treatment.
- We're lucky.
- After that rainy dressing station... and 24 hours on the train, we deserve to have some luck.
I'm Hamacher.
Yeah, that's my name.
I got a crack in the head and they gave me a certificate stating...
"Josef Hamacher is periodically... not responsible for his actions."
And ever since then, Hamacher has been having a grand time.
I hope you boys are not too badly wounded.
The others die off so quickly we don't have time to get acquainted.
You'll get to know us...
very well.
Thank you.
You too.
I'm sorry, my dear.
It's time to go now.
Yes, sister.
Watch.
If they take his clothes away, you've seen the last of him.
See?
They're taking him to the dying room.
Dying room?
When you're ready to kick the bucket, they get you out... of the way so they can use the bed.
In the corner of the building there's a little room... right next to the morgue!
It's so convenient.
It saves a lot of trouble.
But suppose he gets well?
I've seen a lot of them go in that dying room... but nobody ever comes back.
Sister.
Sister.
Sister.
- Is that you ringing, Paul?
- Yes.
- Is something going on?
- I think I have a haemorrhage.
The bandage is all wet.
I've been ringing forever and nobody comes.
I think I'm bleeding.
Sister, get me a sterile dressing and an ice pack.
- Why didn't someone call me?
- He's been ringing.
Nobody can walk, Sister.
- Sister, is it bad?
- No.
No, we'll be all right.
We've got it in time.
What's the matter?
What are you doing?
We must rearrange your bandages.
Where are you taking me?
To the bandaging ward.
No, no!
I'm not going!
I'm staying here!
Paul!
Paul!
- Now, now!
- I'm not going to the dying room!
- We're going to the bandaging ward.
- Why are you taking my clothes?
You're lying to me!
But I'll come back.
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'm not going to die!
I'll come back!
Sister Libertine, how is he?
Poor boy.
They had to amputate his leg.
Paul.
Paul.
Paul.
Oh, he is... gone.
Gone.
Hello.
Welcome home, Albert!
- How do you fell, kid?
- All right.
But I've got such an awful pain.
My foot hur...
Hamacher.
Did they cut my leg off?
Of course not!
How many did you have?
Two?
You still got them!
One, two!
Don't play the fool, Hamacher.
Tell me truthfully.
Of course not.
And you look fine.
Look.
See?
- I won't be a cripple.
- Now, now.
- I won't live like that!
- Be calm.
I'll kill myself the first chance I get!
Albert!
- I won't live!
I won't live!
- Yes, you will.
Albert!
Albert!
Albert, I've come back!
I told you I'd come back.
Look, everybody!
I've come back!
Paul.
Paul.
That's not where I'm going.
I live over there.
Paul, I'm so happy.
Hamacher, I've come back from the dead!
It's most irregular.
Never happened before.
Albert, get well quickly... so we can go home soon.
- Everything will be all right now.
- Yes, Paul.
Everything will be all right...
now.
Oh!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul.
- What's the matter, Paul?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
Paul.
Give me your hanky chief.
- Mother?
- Here I am, Paul.
Here I am.
Mother's ill.
- Are you wounded?
- No, Mother.
I got leave.
Here I am crying instead of being glad.
Anna, get down the jar of blackberries.
You still like them, don't you?
Yes, Mother.
I haven't had any for a long time.
We might almost have known you were coming.
- I'm making potato cakes.
- Don't let them burn.
Paul... sit down... beside me.
My Paul.
My baby.
I almost forgot, Mother.
I've got some little presents for you.
Look, Mother.
Bread, sausage and rice.
Paul, you've been starving yourself.
Hadn't I better go and tell father Paul's home?
Paul could watch the things on the stove.
No, I'm getting up.
Oh, Paul, you're a soldier now, aren't you?
But somehow, I don't seem to know you.
I'll take these off, mother.
I'll get your suit.
It's in the wardrobe, just where you left it.
Are you really here, Paul?
You won't...
You won't disappear, will you?
No.
I'm here.
Your things are ready for you, Paul.
I remember when you caught that one.
Yes.
And you took it away from me, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
We're behind the lines, but we know how to honour the soldier... who goes on in spite of blood and death.
Gentlemen, my son.
- Prosit.
- Prosit.
Cheers.
I'm glad to know you, young man, I am glad to know you.
How are things out there?
Terrible, eh?
Terrible.
But we must carry on.
After all, you do at least get decent food out there.
Naturally, it's worse here.
Naturally.
But the best for our soldiers all the time.
That's our motto.
The best for our soldiers.
But... you must give the Frenchies a good licking!
And, if you boys want to come home... let me show you what you must do before you can come home.
Give us a hand there, men.
Now, then, there's the line.
Runs so, in a "V".
Here is St. Quentin.
You can see for yourself.
You're almost through now.
All right?
Shove ahead out there and don't stick to that... everlasting French warfare!
Smash through the johnnies!
And then you will have peace.
When you get in it... the war isn't the way it looks back here.
Oh!
You don't know anything about it.
Of course, you know about the details... but this relates to the whole!
You can't judge that.
Of course, you do your duty and you risk your life.
But for that, you receive the highest honour.
I said that every man in the war ought to have the Iron cross.
First, the enemy lines must be broken through in Flanders.
- On to Paris!
Push on to Paris!
- Right.
No, not in Flanders.
I'll tell you just where the... break should come.
Here.
The enemy has too many reserves there.
- I insist upon Flanders!
- Why should they do that... when they're halfway through St. Quentin already?
Because Flanders is a flat country!
- No mountains, no obstructions!
- There's too many rivers there!
From the farms they have gone;... from the schools, from the factories.
They have gone bravely, nobly, ever forward... realizing there is no other duty now but to save the fatherland.
Paul!
How are you, Paul?
Glad to see you, Professor.
You've come at the right moment, Baumer!
Just at the right moment.
And as if to prove all have said, here is one of the first to go.
A lad who sat before me on these very benches... who gave up all to serve in the first year of the war... one of the iron youth who have made Germany invincible in the field.
Look at him... sturdy and bronze and clear-eyed.
The kind of soldier every one of you should envy.
Oh, lad, you must speak to them.
You must tell them what it means to serve your fatherland.
- No, I can't tell them anything.
- You must, Paul.
Just a word...
Just tell them how much they're needed out there.
Tell them why you went and what it meant to you.
I can't say anything.
You can remember some deed of heroism, some touch of nobility.
Tell about it.
I can't tell you anything you don't know.
We live in the trenches out there.
We fight.
We try not to be killed, sometimes we are.
That's all.
No.
No, Paul.
I've been there!
I know what it's like.
That's not what one dwells on, Paul.
I heard you in here reciting that same old stuff... making more iron men, more young heroes.
You still think it's beautiful and sweet to die... for your country, don't you?
We used to think you knew.
The first bombardment taught us better.
It's dirty and painful to die for your country.
When it comes to dying for your country... it's better not to die at all!
There are millions out there dying for their countries... and what good is it?
Paul!
You asked me to tell them how much they're needed out there.
He tells you, "Go out and die."
Oh, but if you'll pardon me, it's easier to say "Go out and die"
than it is to do it.
Coward!
And it's easier to say it than to watch it happen.
No!
No!
Boys, boys!
- I'm sorry, Baumer, but I must say...
- It's no use talking like this.
You won't know what I mean.
Only, it's been a long while since we enlisted out of this classroom.
So long I thought maybe the whole world had learned by this time.
Only now they're sending babies, and they won't last a week!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
Up at the front you're alive or you're dead, and that's all!
You can't fool anybody about that very long.
Up there we know we're lost and done for whether we're dead or alive.
Three years we've had of it... four years.
Every day a year and every night a century.
Our bodies are earth and our thoughts are clay... and we sleep and eat with death.
We're done for because you can't live that way... and keep anything inside you!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
I'll go back tomorrow.
I've got four days more, but I can't stand it here!
I'll go back tomorrow!
Sorry.
Mother, you'll catch clod here.
You must go to sleep.
There'll be plenty of time to sleep... when you're gone.
Must you go tomorrow, Paul?
Must you?
Yes, Mother.
Orders were changed.
Are you very much afraid, Paul?
No, Mother.
There's something I want to say to you, Paul.
It's...
Just be on your guard against the women out there.
They're no good.
Where we are, there aren't any women, Mother.
Be very careful at the front, Paul.
Yes, Mother, I will.
I'll pray for you every day.
And if you could, get a job that's not quite so dangerous.
Yes, Mother.
I'll try and get in the cookhouse.
- That can easily be done.
- You do it then, and if...
- The others say anything...
- That won't worry me, Mother.
Now, you must go to bed and you must get well... quickly before I come back.
I put two sets of underwear...
new ones... in your pack.
They'll keep you nice and warm.
They're all wool.
That's sweet of you.
Good night...
my son.
Good night, Mother.
Oh, Mother, Mother.
You still think I'm a child.
Why can't I put my head in your lap and cry?
- Is this the 2nd Company?
- Yes, sir.
- Is this all of it?
- Yes, sir.
We had 150 men, but this is all that came back yesterday.
But now they're going to give us enough to make 150 again.
How old are you?
Sixteen.
No use.
I couldn't find anything.
We'll have to eat the sawdust.
Not me!
I'll go hungry first.
It makes me sick.
Now it's gonna be a real war again.
Paul!
How's old Paul?
Here I am.
You know, the 2nd Company's getting hard to find.
Nobody seemed to know where you were.
I'm glad you found it.
I guess I don't get much of this.
There used to be some food in the sawdust.
Now it's all sawdust.
No joke, either.
Eats ya up inside.
This doesn't look much like the old 2nd Company.
The replacements are all like that.
Not even old enough to carry a pack.
All they know how to do is die.
I guess... some of the old-timers are here yet.
Paul, they're trying to invent something to kill me right now.
Where's Westhus?
Messenger dog was wounded.
He went out to get it.
- Is it true about the armistice?
- Doesn't look that way back there.
You mean they want us to go on fighting?
That's what they say.
They're crazy!
Germany'll be empty pretty soon.
Where is...
Where is Detering?
He got homesick.
You remember about the cherry blossoms?
I guess he never got over that.
He started out one night to go home and help his wife with the farm.
They got him behind the lines, and we never heard of him since.
He was just homesick, but probably they couldn't see it that way.
Where's Kat?
Is he...
Not Kat!
If he were out, the war would be over.
You remember what he always says:
They're saving him for the last.
- Where is he?
- He's out looking for food... something to make soup with.
- Which way?
- Down the road about... two miles that way.
I'll see you later.
Kat!
Paul!
Hello, Paul.
- How's the side?
- Oh, it's all right now.
It's fine.
- Have any luck?
- No, the general's staff's been... over this country with a rake.
Let's sit down there.
Tell me, Paul... how was it at home?
Have a good leave?
- In spots.
- What's the matter?
I'm no good for back there anymore, Kat.
None of us are.
We've been in this too long.
The young men thought I was a coward because I told them that... we learn that death is stronger than duty to one's country.
The old men said "Go on.
Push on to Paris."
My father even wanted me to wear my uniform around him.
It's not home back there anymore.
All I could think of was, "I'd like to get back and see Kat again."
You're all I've got left, Kat.
I'm not much to have left.
I missed you, Paul.
At least we know what it's all about out here.
There're no lies here.
Push on to Paris?
You ought to see what they've got on the other side.
They eat white bread over there.
They've got dozens of airplanes to our one... and tanks that'll go over anything.
What've we got left?
Guns so worn they drop shells on our own men.
No food, no ammunition, no officers.
Push on to Paris!
So that's the way they talk back there.
I guess we'd better be going.
How I lied to my poor mother.
I told her it wasn't so bad out here because there was... always a lot of us together.
Now that I'm with you, I'm beginning to believe that I told her the truth.
Down!
That's another one that missed us.
Come on.
Let's go.
Wait a minute.
Looks like the old bread wagon's broke down.
I guess I don't walk the rest of the way.
Did that get ya, Kat?
Aah, I think it broke my shin.
That's not so bad.
Hold it together.
- Just my luck?
- Good luck.
That means the war is over.
Oh, no, sir!
This war don't end till they really get me.
Now this one...
Easy, now.
- Hey!
- Easy!
Easy!
Come on.
I'll take you in.
Give me your hand.
Easy.
All right.
Well, kid... now we're gonna be separated.
Maybe we can do something together later on when the war is over.
Yes, kid.
You give me your address, I'll give you mine.
You can't get both of us in one day.
Ah, we'll surely see each other again, Kat.
Remember that day when you brought the whole pig into the factory?
And that day in the woods when you taught us how to dodge shells?
And my first bombardment.
How I cried.
I was a young recruit then.
Here we are.
Here we are.
All right now, Kat.
You could've spared yourself the trouble.
He's dead.
Oh, no.
He's just fainted.
He was hit in the shin.
He's dead.
Would you like to take his pay book?
- You're not related, are you?
- No, we're not related.
Your deal.
Get his name and number?
Yeah, Corporal Stanislaus Katczinsky, 306.
THE END
-Thirty thousand.
- From the Russians?
No, from the French.
From the Russians we capture more than that every day.
Mr. Postman.
War is war and schnapps is schnapps, and business must go on.
You didn't leave the mail yet this morning.
Ah, I'm sorry, Mr. Meyer.
Hello, Himmelstoss.
Anything for us today?
- No, no, Master Peter.
- Oh, there must be something.
Here, here you go, young lad.
There.
This is the last mail I deliver anyhow.
- What?
- Tomorrow I change uniforms.
- You're going in the army?
- Yes, I was called.
I'm a sergeant in the reserves, you know.
I'll be called myself, if it doesn't end in a few months.
- It will, though.
- I'm sure you're right, Mr. Meyer.
...defending our country, our fatherland.
Now, my beloved class, this is what we must do:
Strike with all our power.
Give every ounce of strength... to win victory before the end of the year.
It is with reluctance that I bring this subject up again.
You are the life of the fatherland, you boys.
You are the iron men of Germany.
You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy... when you are called upon to do so.
It is not for me to suggest that any of you... should stand up and offer to defend his country.
But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads.
I know that in one of the schools, the boys have risen up in the classroom... and enlisted in a mass.
But, of course, if such a thing should happen here, you would not blame me for a feeling of pride.
Perhaps some will say... that you should not be allowed to go yet, that you are too young, that you have homes, mothers, fathers, that you should not be torn away.
Are your fathers so forgetful of their fatherland... that they would let it perish rather than you?
Are your mothers so weak that they cannot send a son... to defend the land which gave them birth?
And after all, is a little experience... such a bad thing for a boy?
Is the honor of wearing a uniform... something from which we should run?
And if our young ladies glory in those who wear it, is that anything to be ashamed of?
I know you have never desired the adulation of heroes.
That has not been part of my teaching.
We have sought to make ourselves worthy, and let a claim come when it would.
But to be foremost in battle... is a virtue not to be despised.
I believe it will be a quick war, that there will be few losses.
But if losses there must be, then let us remember the Latin phrase... which must have come to the lips of many a Roman... when he stood embattled in a foreign land:
"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."
"Sweet and fitting it is to die for the fatherland."
Some of you may have ambitions.
I know of one young man who has great promise as a writer, and he has written the first act of a tragedy... which would be a credit to one of the masters.
And he is dreaming, I suppose, of following in the footsteps of Goethe and Schiller, and I hope he will.
But now our country calls.
The fatherland needs leaders.
Personal ambition must be thrown aside... in the one great sacrifice for our country.
Here is a glorious beginning to your lives.
The field of honor calls you.
Why are we here?
You, Kropp, what has kept you back?
You, Mueller, you know how much you are needed?
Ah, I see you look at your leader.
And I, too, look to you, Paul Baumer, and I wonder what you are going to do.
- I'll go.
- I want to go.
- Me too.
- I'm ready.
- I'm not gonna stay home!
Follow me!
Enlist now!
- No more classes!
- No more classes!
- Don't be a quitter!
- Come on, Behn!
Stick together.
That's what we've got to do.
- Let's all stick together.
- Come on, Behn.
All right.
All right.
- I'll go.
- That's the way!
Let's go!
Hey!
Let's sing!
Come on!
- Keep in line there, soldiers.
- Anything you say, General.
Detail, halt!
Left face!
Get into uniform, ready to report.
Fall out!
I betcha a place like this gets you in good condition.
You have to be for the long marches.
I'm gonna get in the cavalry and ride.
No cavalry for me.
Infantry's where you see the fighting.
Where are all the guns?
That's what I want to know.
Oh, you don't get a gun for a long while yet.
If I'm gonna bump off the enemy, I gotta have some practice.
Ow!
Bayonet drill.
That's what I want.
Ah!
You won a medal that time, Mueller.
You wait.
In about a month I'll be covered with 'em.
Say, keep your boots out of my face!
Why, it's an honor to have those boots in your face.
They're the best pair in the army!
My uncle gave 'em to me.
Just look at that special imported leather.
Put 'em anyplace you like, except in my face.
Not even a kitchen maid'll look at me in this!
Attention!
Well, for the love of -- It's Himmelstoss!
- So it is.
- And all dressed up.
Hello, Himmie.
You didn't think you'd see me again so soon, did you?
- You see my rank?
- Sure.
Fall back, then!
- Himmelstoss, we certainly are glad to see you.
- What did you say?
- I was going to say--
- Never mind!
- What's the matter with you?
- When you address your superior officer, say "sir"!
- Where'd he get such a nice uniform?
- Any mail for us, Himmie?
- Quiet!
- My dear fellow, you're shouting.
Ah, come on, Himmelstoss.
We know ya.
Take off the false whiskers.
- I believe you mean it!
- You'll find out that I mean it.
- But only three days ago you were our postman.
- Silence!
Come back here!
Line up!
Line up!
Get in some kind of a line!
All of you!
Line up, I say!
Hmm.
What a pretty sight that is!
Have you never heard of standing in line?
You make a fine mess of it.
Well, I'll have to teach you.
We'll spend the whole day on it, huh?
You may be stupid, but I'm used to that.
And then there'll be plenty of other things too.
Oh, I'll not neglect you.
Hmm.
You're not much to begin with, but I'll do my best.
I see that we have come here with a slight misunderstanding, and we'll correct that, too, won't we, huh?
And the first thing to do is to forget everything you ever knew.
Everything you ever learned, forget!
See?
Forget what you've been and what you think you're going to be.
You're going to be soldiers, and that's all!
I'll take the mother's milk out of you!
I'll make you hard-boiled!
I'll make soldiers out of you or kill you!
Now... salute!
A-ten-hut!
Detachment...
lie down!
Down!
Head down!
Keep your head down, Baumer!
Detachment... get up!
Now sing!
Do you call that singing?
Detachment, halt!
So... we have no spirit, huh?
We are in no mood for recreation.
Work is what we want.
Good!
Then we'll go back to work!
Detachment, lie down!
Keep your head down!
Now sing!
Men... halt!
Order, arms!
Inspection at 3:00.
Dismissed!
Oh, that swine!
That means we get no time off.
It will take four hours to get ready for inspection.
- I'd like to know what's in his mind.
- He hasn't got any!
I'm gonna cut him open sometime and find out!
He's too thick-skinned.
He won't cut.
This is the fourth time he's made me disappoint that poor girl.
Arms!
Order, arms!
Left shoulder, arms!
Squad right.
To the right, march!
Left, left, left, left.
Follow right, march!
Squad, left march!
Forward... march!
Detachment... halt!
Present arms!
Himmelstoss.
Excellent work.
They're going up front tomorrow.
- I recommend leave till midnight.
- Very good, sir.
Left, left, left.
Detachment...
lie down!
Crawl forward!
He spoiled our leave.
I'll never forgive him for that.
- The rat!
- Leave till midnight.
Hmm!
It'll take till midnight to dry our clothes.
There goes the filthy ape now.
While we slave over this mud, he goes off to have a few drinks!
Someday I'm going to take one smack at him-- just one.
Me too.
That's gonna be my life's work from now on.
Why only one?
I'm gonna take several.
I might even kick him while he's down.
I feel mean.
What are you doing?
You're not going to desert, are you?
What?
Listen.
I've got an idea.
Crawl forward!
Lie down!
Lie down!
Crawl forward!
Oh!
What?
Ow!
Ow!
- Cover!
- Paul, you all right?
Behn!
Behn!
Behn!
Come on!
Behn, come on!
You fool!
Behn!
Get up!
Come on.
- Sounds like more replacements coming in.
Yeah.
Tjaden must have gone home for that wood.
There's some more, fresh from the turnip patch.
I suppose this is where we bunk.
That's me, "l.
Westhus,"
and this is where I live.
- I didn't know!
- Well, you know now!
Yes.
Yes, of course.
- It's all right.
- Here's a bunk, Paul.
- When did we eat last?
- Don't remind me.
- I was fine until you spoke.
- Where are we anyway?
I don't know.
The name on the railroad station's been shot off.
There must be something to eat somewhere.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll ask those fellas.
Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Westhus.
Oh.
Meet Detering.
A better farmer never lived.
- And Mr. Tjaden.
- Sit down.
You see, we haven't eaten since breakfast.
We thought maybe you could tell us what we ought to do about it.
Eat without further delay.
Well, what's funny about that?
This is a bad town to bring an appetite to, soldier.
We've been here since yesterday morning, living on baled hay and razor blades.
We're willing to buy our food.
Where's the canteen?
The only canteen in these regions is out looking for supplies.
- Ever hear of Katczinsky?
- Who?
Katczinsky.
He's uncanny.
If there's any food within 25 miles, he'll be the one to get it.
- Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hup!
- Hup!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Attention!
- What is this?
- Volunteers for the future generals' staff.
Sometime I'm gonna take one of you volunteers apart... and find out what makes you leave school and join the army.
At ease.
This is no parade ground.
- Hungry?
- Yes.
Wait!
Wait a minute!
That's no invitation.
Can you pay?
I have some money.
No, not money.
That's just pieces of paper.
Have you got any cigarettes, cigars,
- or soap, cognac--
- Yeah, yeah.
- Chewing tobacco?
- Yeah, yeah.
Are you crazy?
There ain't enough here for us.
I wish you three would get bumped off.
I'm tired of feeding ya for nothing.
- Bring everything you got.
- I'm so hungry--
- I'd be glad to give you--
- Come on!
- Is this enough, sir?
- Kat!
- Hmm?
- You've got the wiring detail tonight.
- Where?
- Past the graveyard.
- With this bunch?
It's quiet tonight.
You can teach 'em a couple of things.
Thanks.
I'd rather do it alone.
- These babes get killed off too fast.
- Well, the lorry's waiting.
Last night I was too hungry to sleep, and tonight, when I get the wrinkles out of my gut, they think up wiring duty.
Well, here's your chance, heroes.
For the fatherland!
Come on, get your stuff and let's get out of here.
- Is that any way to drive?
- Let him drive any way he wants.
Suppose he breaks your arm.
You get sent home, don't you?
A lot better than havin' a hole in your guts.
If there's any of you left, I'll pick you up in the morning.
Well, if that ride you gave us didn't kill us, nothing will.
- And be on time.
I don't want to miss my breakfast.
- Huh?
- You better wait for your army, Papa.
Here, here.
Don't be so backward.
Listen, children.
All we got to do is to string a little wire.
We pick it up at the dump and carry it to where we need it.
Now, you're gonna see some shell fire, and you're gonna be scared, see?
It's all right, boy.
Get up.
Here.
Never mind.
It's happened to better men than you, and it's happened to me.
When we come back, I'll get you all some nice clean underwear.
That kind of shell you don't have to pay much attention to.
Those big fellas just make a lot of noise and land about five miles behind the line.
The things we've got to watch out for are the light ones.
They don't give you much warning.
They go "waa-aa-aah zing."
And when you hear that, down!
Mother Earth.
Press yourselves down upon her.
Bury yourselves deep into her.
Just keep your eyes on me.
When you see me flop, you flop, only try to beat me to it.
Shh-shh.
Now listen.
I'll show you how it's done.
Give me a couple of those.
That's to kill the noise.
Tjaden.
See that?
- What's that mean?
- Bombardment.
My eyes!
I'm blind!
I can't see!
God!
- My eyes!
I can't see!
- I can't see!
- It's Behn!
It's Behn!
- I'll go get him--
- You'll get killed!
- Let me--
- Lay down and stay there!
He's dead.
- He's dead!
- Why did you risk your life bringing' him in?
But it's Behn!
- My friend.
- He's a corpse, no matter who it is.
Now, don't any of you ever do that again.
Put him over there.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
All right, come on.
All right, come on.
Get your packs and fall in.
Hurry up!
Come on.
Hurry up.
Make it snappy.
Get your packs and fall in.
Kat, what are we doing?
What's happening?
You heard him.
Orders to march.
- But where to, for the love of --
- Another party.
And this one is gonna last a long time.
Come on.
Here we go.
Company, attention!
Shoulder arms!
March right, march!
- Take your hands off that!
- Queen takes it!
- Well, if you think that's a queen, look again.
Ah, it's a jack.
- Yeah.
- Honest, these cards all look alike.
It's too noisy!
I can't play.
- I suppose your delicate nerves can't stand it.
- Get up!
That's Oscar.
The son of a--
Look at that!
Don't be so snooty.
You may wish you had this back.
About two more days of this... and this rat-bitten end of a piece of bread's gonna taste like a hunk of fruitcake.
It wouldn't-
- It wouldn't last two more days, would it?
Didn't I tell you this was gonna be a bad one?
I don't mind the days so much.
It's keeping up all night--
Ah, two more days makes a week, kid.
Then you can say you've been under fire!
You're not scared, are you?
No.
I was just asking.
That's all.
- Wanna play some more?
- Do you?
- Sure.
- All right.
My deal.
You better get your boot back before Oscar eats that!
- The kid's all right.
Behn!
Behn.
Yeah, yeah.
Let him sleep.
He's dreamin'.
Oh, God.
Can't you see it's Behn?
He didn't want to come to war!
No, no.
It isn't Behn.
It isn't Behn!
It's Kemmerick!
It's me!
Shut up, will you?
It's bad enough in here as it is.
Every--
Everything's all right, Franz.
You're dreaming.
You're just dreaming, I guess.
- Attention!
- At ease.
The barrage is gettin' worse.
The men in two more dugouts gone.
However, we'll do our best to get some food up here by evening.
Stop!
Stop!
Let me out!
- What did you do that for?
- Shut up!
Grab him.
- No.
- Now hold him.
You all right now?
I think so.
I couldn't hold out much longer.
- Oh, God, it's Franz!
- Get him over there!
No, he's been hit in the stomach.
He can't have anything to drink.
Get a stretcher.
Where'd they get you, Kemmerick?
Oh.
- Here it is, sir.
- Take his head.
All right.
Take him out.
- Is it serious, sir?
- I'm not sure.
- Tell the others he's all right.
- Yes, sir.
If we're going to fight, why don't we fight?
Why don't we go over?
You could go crazy staying here.
Let's do something!
- Let's go after 'em!
- Sit down!
If that cook of ours had any guts, he'd try to bring something through.
He's so far behind the lines he can't hear the shooting!
- Here's Kat.
Get anything?
- Any luck?
- We'll have to split this up among us.
- Something to eat!
We need butter too.
Yes.
And dessert.
And a feather bed to sleep on.
- Rats!
- Rats!
Get out of the way!
What's that?
- Come on!
Grab your rifles!
Come on!
- Here they come.
- Get your grenades here.
Hurry up.
Come on, hurry up.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Back to your own lines!
- Fill it up.
- And hurry up.
I've got other things to do.
I've been waiting for this for three weeks.
When they all get here.
What do you want?
Beans, you homely-lookin' son of a frog's leg.
- What do you think I want?
- We're hungry.
Shut up!
I'll feed you when you're all here.
- We're all here now.
- Only half the company's here.
Get the rest.
- Wake 'em up.
I wish I could wake 'em up.
There's 80 of us left.
The rest is in dressing stations or pushing' up daisies.
Eighty?
And I cooked for 150!
All right.
We'll have enough for once.
Come on.
Dish out!
You mean you've cooked beans for 150... and you've got bread for 150... and sausage for 150, and tobacco for 150?
Everything!
It's all wrong.
I should have been notified.
What a feast!
- Everyone gets two issues.
- Get back in line!
Get back in line!
- Oh, no!
That won't do.
I can't give 80 men what's meant for 150.
Listen.
You drew rations for the 2nd Company, didn't ya?
Yeah.
All right.
We're the 2nd Company.
- I've got my orders.
- Kat's right.
- We're the 2nd Company.
And if only half of us get back, that's our good luck.
- Come on.
Dish it out.
- Come on!
- No!
- Hey!
You're the yellowest baboon that ever drew a cook wagon, and you're scared-- it shows.
All we want to hear out of you is one more little yip, and we'll cut ya up and eat ya raw.
Why, you keep your kitchen so far back of the lines, we never get anything to eat until it's cold and we're asleep!
Now, you low-down rat, get out...
- or we wreck the joint!
- Come on!
Give us--
- Attention!
At ease.
What's goin' on here?
He's cooked for 150, sir, and he only wants to give us half.
- Looks pretty good.
- Yes, sir.
- Serve the whole issue.
The men can use it.
- Yes, sir.
- And bring me a plate too.
- Yes, sir.
All right.
Take it all.
Take everything.
Give 'em honey.
Give 'em what they want.
- Fill it up!
- Fill it up!
-Don't mind me.
-Oh, that's all right.
Don't mention it.
You know...
I could do with some more beans.
Go help yourself.
There's more over there.
- It's too far.
- I wonder, when are we going back to the front?
- Tomorrow.
It's enough to take away a man's appetite.
You know, if they're gonna march us in again tomorrow, we ought to go see how Kemmerick is.
- That's a good idea.
- Let's do that.
- How far is the dressing station?
- About two miles.
- We could take his things to him.
- Good.
It seemed rotten to think of a thing like that happening to him, a nice fellow like Kemmerick.
Ah, the French certainly deserve to be punished for starting this war.
Everybody says it's somebody else.
Well, how do they start a war?
Well, one country offends another.
How could one country offend another?
You mean there's a mountain over in Germany gets mad at a field over in France?
- Well, stupid, one people offends another.
Oh, if that's it, I shouldn't be here at all.
I don't feel offended.
It don't apply to tramps like you.
Good.
Then I can be going home right away.
- Ah, you just try it.
- Yeah.
You wanna get shot?
- The kaiser and me--
Me and the kaiser felt just alike about this war.
We didn't either of us want any war, so I'm going home.
- He's there already.
- Somebody must have wanted it.
Maybe it was the English.
No, I don't want to shoot any Englishmen.
I never saw one till I came up here.
And I suppose most of them never saw a German till they came up here.
- No, I'm sure they weren't asked about it.
- No.
Well... it must be doing somebody some good.
- Not me and the kaiser.
- I think maybe the kaiser wanted a war.
You leave us out of this!
I don't see that.
The kaiser's got everything he needs.
Well, he never had a war before.
Every full-grown emperor needs one war to make him famous.
- Why, that's history.
- Yeah, generals too.
They need war.
- And manufacturers.
They get rich.
I think it's more a kind of fever.
Nobody wants it in particular, and then all at once, there it is.
We didn't want it.
The English didn't want it.
And here we are fighting.
I'll tell you how it should all be done.
Whenever there's a big war comin' on,
- you should rope off a big field--
- And sell tickets.
Yeah.
And--
And on the big day, you should take all the kings and their cabinets and their generals, put them in the center dressed in their underpants, and let 'em fight it out with clubs.
The best country wins.
Well, now that Kat's settled everything, let's go see Kemmerick.
- Something interesting might happen on the way.
- Might cheer him up.
Boys, me and the kaiser want you back in time to march tomorrow.
Don't forget.
- We'll be back.
- Give the boy my regards.
There he is.
- Hello, Kemmerick.
- How's it going?
How are things going?
Are they looking after you all right?
How are they treating you?
Franz?
They're robbers here.
Robbers.
They stole my watch!
I always told you, nobody should carry as good a watch as that.
- They took it while I was under ether!
- Franz, you'll get it back.
Do you feel all right?
- Just look at my hand.
- That's because you lost so much blood.
- Just eat decently and you'll get well again.
- Oh, no.
You must eat.
That's the main thing.
It looks good too.
I have such a terrible pain in my foot.
Every toe on my right foot hurts.
Well, how can your foot hurt when your leg's been--
I know what you mean!
I know!
I know now!
They cut my leg off.
Why didn't they tell me?
Why-
- Why didn't they tell me?
- Franz!
Franz!
- Now I can't walk anymore!
You must be thankful that you've come off with only that.
I wanted to be a forester once.
You can yet.
They make artificial legs that are wonderful.
And you're through too.
You can go home.
Think of that.
We brought your things for you.
See?
Put 'em under the bed.
That's a marvelous pair of boots.
Look at that leather!
What comfort.
I was just thinking.
If you're not going to be using these, Franz, why don't you leave 'em with us?
What good are they to you?
I can use 'em.
My boots give me blister after blister--
Well, we'll be going, Franz.
Oh, don't go.
Stay just a little while longer.
- I'll come right back.
- We'll be coming soon again, Franz.
- I know you'll be feeling better.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Good-bye, Franz.
You think he'll last till after mess?
- I don't think--
- Done for.
Boys, you go along.
I'll see you later.
Good-bye.
All right, Paul.
I'm sorry, Paul.
I wouldn't touch a thing of his if he could use it.
I'd go barefoot over barbed wire for him if it'd do him any good.
Only-
- Only why should some orderly get those boots?
I understand, Mueller.
We're all alike out here.
And good boots are scarce.
Tell the doctor to come, please.
Doctor, the man in the next bed would like to see you, sir.
I've done everything I can for him.
There's no helping him.
Poor little fella.
He says next time, Franz.
Do you think I'll ever get well?
Why, of course.
- Do you really think so?
- Sure, once you get over the operation.
I don't think so.
Franz!
Don't talk nonsense.
Why, you'll be as good as new.
They fix up worse things than that.
Perhaps you'll go to the convalescent home... in Klosterberg among the villagers.
Then you can look out of the windows, across the fields... to the two trees on the horizon.
The loveliest time of the year now when the corn ripens.
You can go out without asking anyone.
You can even play piano if you want to.
Oh-
- Oh, but, Franz, you must try to sleep now.
O God, this is Franz Kemmerick, only 19 years old.
He doesn't want to die.
Please don't let him die.
Paul.
- Paul.
- Franz.
Take my boots home for Mueller.
Oh, no, Franz, no.
And if...
Paul... you find my watch, send it home.
Franz!
Doctor.
Doctor!
Doctor!
Doctor!
Where's the doctor?
Why isn't there a doctor here?
- Doctor, come quick.
Franz Kemmerick is dying!
- Which one is that?
- Amputated leg.
- I've amputated a dozen legs today.
- Bed 26, sir.
- You see to it.
I'm due in the operating room.
One operation after another since 5:00 this morning.
Sixteen dead today, and yours is the 17th.
There'll probably be 20 by the morning.
You're lookin' good.
Very good today.
What's your hurry?
Hey!
I'll bet he stole those boots!
- I got it, Kat.
- Hmm?
Listen: "The sum of an arithmetic series... is S = A + L x N over 2."
- lnteresting, isn't it?
- What do you wanna learn that stuff for?
One day you'll stop a bullet and it'll all be worthless.
- I get a lot of fun out of it.
- Aah!
My boots!
Mueller.
I saw him die.
I didn't know what it was like to die before.
And then-- then I came outside... and it felt-- it felt so good to be alive that I started in to walk fast.
I began to think of the strangest things, like being out in the fields.
Things like that.
You know-- girls.
And it felt as if there were... something electric running from the ground up through me.
And I started.
I began to run hard.
I passed soldiers and I heard voices calling to me.
I ran and I ran.
I felt as if I couldn't breathe enough air into me.
And-- And now I'm hungry.
I don't mind the war now.
Be a pleasure to go to the front in boots like these.
It's a good invention just the same.
If you crack each separate louse, think of all the energy you use up.
Watch.
Burned to death.
- How was patrol?
Bad?
- Must've been terrible if they had time to gather the harvest.
We passed a cherry tree and when he saw it, he went crazy.
I could hardly drag him away.
It was... beautiful.
I have a big orchard with cherry trees at home.
When they're in full blossom, from the hayloft it looks like one single sheet.
So white.
- Perhaps you can get leave soon.
- You may even be sent back as a farmer.
A woman can't run a farm alone.
That's no good, you know?
No matter how hard she works.
Harvest coming on again.
What's the matter with him?
Got a letter yesterday from his wife.
He wants to get back to his farm.
We'd all like to get back home.
I wonder what we'd do if it were suddenly peacetime again?
Get drunk and look for women!
I'd go looking for a Cinderella... that could wear this for a garter.
And when I'd found her, nobody'd see me for two weeks.
I'll go back to the peat fields... and those pleasant hours in the beer gardens.
And there's worse things than cobbling too.
Look.
My family.
I oughta give you a kick in the backside for startin' all this.
It's all right for all you to talk.
You've got something to go back to:
wives, children, jobs.
But what about us?
What have we got to go back to?
- School?
- Why not?
You know everything already.
A man can't take all that rubbish they teach you seriously... after three years of shells and bombs.
- You can't peel that off easily.
- They never taught us anything really useful, like how to light a cigarette in the wind or make a fire out of wet wood... or bayonet a man in the belly instead of the ribs where it gets jammed.
What can happen to us afterwards?
I'll tell ya.
Take our class.
Out of 20, three are officers, nine dead,
Mueller and three others wounded... and one in the madhouse.
We'll all be dead someday, so let's forget it.
Hurry up!
Get in there!
Hurry up!
Himmelstoss!
What's up?
- What are you, crazy?
- It's Himmelstoss!
Himmelstoss?
There is justice in the army!
Well, well.
So, we are all here, huh?
-A bit longer than you, Himmie.
-Since when have we become so familiar?
Stand up and click your heels together!
All of you!
- Take a running jump at yourself!
- Who's your friend?
Would somebody get General Ludendorff a nice, comfortable chair?
I command you as your superior officer!
- Do you want to be court-martialed?
- I do!
There's going to be a big attack tonight and I'd just love to get out of it.
Will you obey my orders?
Kiss my butt!
It isn't customary to ask for salutes here.
But I'll tell you what we'll do.
We're going to attack a town that we tried to take once before.
Many killed and many wounded.
It was great fun.
This time you're going with us.
If any of us stops a bullet, before we die... we're going to come to you, click our heels together and ask stiffly,
- "Please, Sergeant Himmelstoss, may we go?"
- You'll--
You'll pay for this, you--
There it is.
Right on time.
Better get ready, boys.
I'm wounded!
I'm wounded!
It's just a scratch, you yellow rat!
Up!
Get out with the others!
- Up!
- No!
No!
No!
You yellow rat!
Stinking yellow rat!
Let the others do it, eh?
Get up!
Get up!
- Aa-aah!
- Get up!
Forward!
- Get out here!
- Command... was forward.
Command was forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Counterattack.
I want to help you.
I want to help you.
Stop that!
Stop it, stop it.
I can bear the rest of it.
I can't listen to that!
Why do you take so long dying?
You're going to die anyway!
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
You won't die.
Oh, no.
You won't die.
They're only little wounds.
You'll get home.
You'll be all right.
You'll get home long before I will.
You know I can't run away.
That's why you accuse me.
I tell you, I didn't want to kill you.
I tried to keep you alive.
If you jumped in here again, I wouldn't do it.
When you jumped in here you were my enemy, and I was afraid of you.
But you're just a man like me, and I killed you.
Forgive me, comrade.
Say that for me.
Say you forgive me.
Oh, no.
You're dead.
You're better off than I am.
You're through.
They can't do any more to you now.
Oh, God, why did they do this to us?
We only wanted to live, you and I.
Why should they send us out to fight each other?
If we threw away these rifles and these uniforms, you could be my brother just like Kat and Albert.
You'll have to forgive me, comrade.
I'll do all I can.
I'll write to your parents.
I'll write to--
I'll write to your wife.
I'll write to her.
I promise she'll not want for anything.
I'll help her and your parents too.
Only forgive me.
Forgive me!
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Terrible thing happened yesterday.
I stabbed a man.
With my own hands, stabbed him.
I know how it is.
Your first time.
Never mind.
The stretcher-bearers will find him.
- He's dead.
I watched him die.
- You couldn't do anything about it.
We have to kill.
We can't help it.
That's what we are here for.
Uh-
- Look there, for instance.
Hah!
That got him.
You should've seen how he leaped in the air.
That fellow had to shoot with us for today with three hits.
If he keeps it up, he'll have a decoration for his buttonhole this evening.
Don't you lose any more sleep over this business.
Maybe it was 'cause I was out there with him so long, huh?
Sure, that's it.
After all, war is war.
March!
Forward!
Forward, march!
Quick there!
Forward!
Company... halt!
Dismissed!
Uncommissioned officers, enlisted men, dismiss!
Hooray!
Come on!
Let's get outta here!
- Give me your best sausage.
- Two.
Give me a beer.
One, two, three!
Hey, come on.
A beer.
Hey, get out of here!
Come on.
Give me a beer.
Oh, ho ho!
A beer.
One b--
Here's hoping we get falling-down drunk tonight.
Here's how it started.
I'd forgotten there were girls like that.
There aren't.
Just look at those thin, little shoes.
She couldn't march many miles in those.
Paul!
Don't speak about marching.
You're boring the young lady.
A thousand pardons.
- How old do you think she is?
- Oh, about 22.
No, that'd make her older than us.
She's... 17.
A girl like that.
That'd be good, eh, Albert?
We wouldn't have much of a chance with him around.
- We could take a bath, wash our clothes--
- All right.
and I might even go so far as to get deloused.
Wait a minute!
She's a long way from here now.
Look at the date.
May, 1917.
- Four months ago.
- That's true.
Well, here's to her anyway.
Here's to 'em all, everywhere.
Albert,
- we might as well wash up anyway.
- All right.
Personally, I like 'em bigger around.
This conversation was on a high moral plane up to now.
Now we do need a bath.
- A bath?
- For what?
Hm.
You wouldn't understand.
This water is freezing.
This romantic business has gone too far.
- Ahh, but think of her beautiful eyes!
- Oh!
Oh, and her hair.
- Here we are!
- We're not gonna miss a thing!
- What are you doing here?
- Bathing!
They tell me there's some people in this world takes a bath every week!
Women!
Mademoiselle, you want to swim?
Mademoiselle!
Aw, baby!
Aw, no, girls!
Don't go away!
Aw, mama!
- Please don't go!
- Don't go away!
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!
Food!
Food!
Whoo-hoo!
Halt!
You know you're forbidden to cross.
You fellows stay on this side or you'll get yourselves in a lot of trouble.
- What are they jabbering' about?
- They want us to swing over tonight.
They're expecting us.
- That's fine!
- That blonde's crazy about me.
- But there's four of us and only three of them.
- I was the one that stopped 'em!
That blonde piece of work is mine.
You three fight for what's left.
Fight's the word.
All's fair in love and war.
Huh?
What do you mean?
What're you gonna do?
You'll find out.
Au revoir!
Au revoir!
- C'est moi, blondie!
- Bon ami!
Bon ami!
Vos camarades!
Vos camarades!
Ooh!
She means the door.
Not only modest, but dashing!
A perfect fit.
It might've been made for me.
An officer's coat.
We're calling distinguished company.
Ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Merci.
Have another little drink, comrade.
Is this your birthday or mine?
Why?
You've been buying me drink after drink for two hours.
What I'm tryin' to figure out is why.
Why?
Why?
Oh!
Ha-ha!
Oh.
I-It's just that the boys... told me to amuse you for a little while.
Oh, nice boys.
Yeah!
They-They said you'd understand.
Ehh... heh.
Huh?
I've been betrayed!
Yeah, you certainly have.
Take that for a minute!
I'll give you more!
Ahh.
It's too loud.
Suzanne.
And I wouldn't even know you if I did.
And yet, I'll remember you always.
Toujours.
Oh, if you could only know how different this is from the women we soldiers meet.
You.
That's what I'm talking about.
Vous.
It seems as though all war and terror and grossness... had fallen away from me... like a miracle.
Like something I never believed.
Pauvre garcon.
Pauvre garcon.
Frau Paul.
We're going, Paul.
Have a look.
Nice, new coffins.
Huh!
For us.
I must say, that's a very cheerful preparation for this offensive.
That's very considerate of them.
But I don't see any long enough for our comrade Tjaden.
Mind you, I'm not speaking to you, you traitors.
- But no coffin's gonna get me.
- I should say not, heartbreaker.
You'll be thankful if they slip a waterproof sheet...
- around that Aunt Sally of a carcass of yours.
Oh-Oh, my side!
My side.
Catholic hospital, Albert.
They say you always get good food and good treatment.
- We're lucky.
- After that rainy dressing station... and 24 hours on the train, we deserve to have some luck.
I'm Hamacher.
Yeah, that's my name.
I got a crack in the head and they gave me a certificate stating,
"Josef Hamacher is periodically... not responsible for his actions."
And ever since then, Hamacher has been having a grand time.
I hope you boys are not too badly wounded.
The others die off so quickly we don't have time to get acquainted.
You'll get to know us...
very well.
Thank you.
You too.
I'm sorry, my dear.
It's time to go now.
Yes, sister.
Watch.
If they take his clothes away, you've seen the last of him.
- See?
They're taking him to the dying room.
- Dying room?
When you're ready to kick the bucket, they get you out of the way so they can use the bed.
In the corner of the building there's a little room... right next to the morgue!
It's so convenient.
It saves a lot of trouble.
But suppose he gets well?
I've seen a lot of 'em go in that dying room, but nobody ever comes back.
Sister.
Sister.
Sister.
- Is that you ringing, Paul?
- Yes.
- Is something going on?
- I think I have a hemorrhage.
The bandage is all wet.
I've been ringing forever and nobody comes.
- I think I'm bleeding.
- Sister, get me a sterile dressing and an ice pack.
- Why didn't someone call me?
- He's been ringing.
Nobody can walk, Sister.
- Sister, is it bad?
- No.
No, we'll be all right.
We've got it in time.
What's the matter?
What are you doing?
We must rearrange your bandages.
Wh-
- Where are you taking me?
To the bandaging ward.
- No, no!
I'm not going!
I'm staying here!
- Paul!
Paul!
- Now, now!
- I'm not going to the dying room!
- We're going to the bandaging ward.
- Why are you taking my clothes?
You're lying to me!
But I'll come back.
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'm not going to die!
I'll come back!
Sister Libertine, how is he?
Poor boy.
They had to amputate his leg.
Paul.
Paul.
Paul.
Oh, he is... gone.
Gone.
Hello.
Welcome home, Albert!
- How do you feel, kid?
- All right.
But I've got such an awful pain.
My foot hur --
Hamacher.
Did they cut my leg off?
Of course not!
How many did you have?
Two?
You still got 'em!
One, two!
Don't play the fool, Hamacher.
Tell me truthfully.
Of course not.
And you look fine.
Look.
See?
- I won't be a cripple.
- Now, now.
- I won't live like that!
- Be calm.
- I'll kill myself the first chance I get!
- Albert!
- I won't live!
I won't live!
- Yes, you will.
Albert!
Albert!
Albert, I've come back!
I told you I'd come back.
Look, everybody!
I've come back!
- Paul!
Paul!
- That's not where I'm going.
I live over there.
Paul, I'm so happy.
Hamacher, I've come back from the dead!
- It's most irregular.
Never happened before.
- Albert, get well quickly... so we can go home soon.
- Everything will be all right now.
- Yes, Paul.
Everything will be all right... now.
Oh!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul.
- What's the matter, Paul?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
Paul.
Give me your handkerchief.
- Mother?
- Here I am, Paul.
Here I am.
Mother's ill.
- Are you wounded?
- No, Mother.
I got leave.
Here I am cryin' instead of being glad.
Anna, get down the jar of blackberries.
You still like them, don't you?
Yes, Mother.
I haven't had any for a long time.
We might almost have known you were coming.
- I'm making potato cakes.
- Don't let them burn.
Paul... sit down... beside me.
My Paul.
My baby.
I almost forgot, Mother.
I've got some little presents for you.
Look, Mother.
Bread, sausage and rice.
- Paul, you've been starving yourself.
- Hmm-mm.
Hadn't I better go and tell Father Paul's home?
- Paul could watch the things on the stove.
- No, I'm getting up.
Oh, Paul, you're a soldier now, aren't you?
But somehow, I don't seem to know you.
I'll take these off, Mother.
I'll get your suit.
It's in the wardrobe, just where you left it.
Are you really here, Paul?
You won't--
You won't disappear, will you?
No.
I'm here.
Your things are ready for you, Paul.
- I remember when you caught that one.
- Yes.
And you took it away from me, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
We're behind the lines, but we know how to honor the soldier... who goes on in spite of blood and death.
Gentlemen, my son.
- Prosit.
- Cheers.
I'm glad to know you, young man, I am glad to know you.
How are things out there?
Terrible, eh?
Terrible.
But we must carry on.
After all, you do at least get decent food out there.
Naturally, it's worse here.
Naturally.
But the best for our soldiers all the time.
That's our motto.
The best for our soldiers.
But...
- you must give the Frenchies a good licking!
And, if you boys want to come home, ehh,
let me show you what you must do before you can come home.
Give us a hand there, men.
Now, then, there's the line.
Runs so, in a "V".
Here is St. Quentin.
You can see for yourself.
You're almost through now.
All right?
Shove ahead out there and don't stick to that everlasting French warfare!
Smash through the johnnies!
And then you will have peace.
When you get in it... the war isn't the way it looks back here.
Oh!
You don't know anything about it.
Of course, you know about the details, but this relates to the whole!
You can't judge that.
Of course, you do your duty and you risk your life.
But for that, you receive the highest honor.
I said that every man in the war ought to have the lron Cross.
First, the enemy lines must be broken through in Flanders.
- On to Paris!
Push on to Paris!
- Right.
No, not in Flanders.
I'll tell you just where the break should come.
- Here.
- The enemy has too many reserves there.
- I insist upon Flanders!
- Why should they do that... when they're halfway through St. Quentin already?
Because Flanders is a flat country!
- No mountains, no obstructions!
- There's too many rivers there!
From the farms they have gone;
from the schools, from the factories.
They have gone bravely, nobly, ever forward, realizing there is no other duty now but to save the fatherland.
Paul!
How are you, Paul?
Glad to see you, Professor.
You've come at the right moment, Baumer!
Just at the right moment.
And as if to prove all I have said, here is one of the first to go.
A lad who sat before me on these very benches... who gave up all to serve in the first year of the war;
one of the iron youth who have made Germany invincible in the field.
Look at him-- sturdy and bronze and clear -eyed.
The kind of soldier every one of you should envy.
Oh, lad, you must speak to them.
You must tell them what it means to serve your fatherland.
- No, I can't tell them anything.
- You must, Paul.
Just a word.
Just tell them how much they're needed out there.
Tell them why you went and what it meant to you.
I can't say anything.
You can remember some deed of heroism, some touch of nobility.
Tell about it.
I can't tell you anything you don't know.
We live in the trenches out there.
We fight.
We try not to be killed;
sometimes we are.
That's all.
No.
No, Paul.
I've been there!
I know what it's like.
That's not what one dwells on, Paul.
I heard you in here reciting that same old stuff, making more iron men, more young heroes.
You still think it's beautiful and sweet to die for your country, don't you?
We used to think you knew.
The first bombardment taught us better.
It's dirty and painful to die for your country.
When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all!
There are millions out there dying for their countries, and what good is it?
You asked me to tell them how much they're needed out there.
He tells you, "Go out and die."
Oh, but if you'll pardon me, it's easier to say "Go out and die" than it is to do it.
- Coward!
- And it's easier to say it than to watch it happen.
No!
No!
Boys, boys!
- I'm sorry, Baumer, but I must say--
- It's no use talking like this.
You won't know what I mean.
Only, it's been a long while since we enlisted out of this classroom.
So long I thought maybe the whole world had learned by this time.
Only now they're sending babies, and they won't last a week!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
Up at the front you're alive or you're dead, and that's all!
You can't fool anybody about that very long.
Up there we know we're lost and done for whether we're dead or alive.
Three years we've had of it-- four years.
Every day a year and every night a century.
Our bodies are earth and our thoughts are clay, and we sleep and eat with death.
We're done for because you can't live that way and keep anything inside you!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
I'll go back tomorrow.
I've got four days more, but I can't stand it here!
I'll go back tomorrow!
Sorry.
Mother, you'll catch cold here.
You must go to sleep.
There'll be plenty of time to sleep... when you're gone.
Must you go tomorrow, Paul?
Must you?
Yes, Mother.
Orders were changed.
Are you very much afraid, Paul?
No, Mother.
There's something I want to say to you, Paul.
It's--
Just be on your guard against the women out there.
They're no good.
Where we are, there aren't any women, Mother.
Be very careful at the front, Paul.
Yes, Mother, I will.
I'll pray for you every day.
And if you could, get a job that's not quite so dangerous.
Yes, Mother.
I'll try and get in the cookhouse.
- That can easily be done.
- You do it then, and if the others say anything--
That won't worry me, Mother.
Now, you must go to bed and you must get well quickly before I come back.
I put two sets of underwear -- new ones-- in your pack.
They'll keep you nice and warm.
They're all wool.
That's sweet of you.
Good night...
my son.
Good night, Mother.
Oh, Mother, Mother.
You still think I'm a child.
Why can't I put my head in your lap and cry?
- Is this the 2nd Company?
- Yes, sir.
- Is this all of it?
- Yes, sir.
We had 150 men, but this is all that came back yesterday.
But now they're going to give us enough to make 150 again.
How old are you?
Sixteen.
No use.
I couldn't find anything.
- We'll have to eat the sawdust.
Not me!
I'll go hungry first.
It makes me sick.
Now it's gonna be a real war again.
Paul!
How's old Paul?
Here I am.
You know, the 2nd Company's getting hard to find.
Nobody seemed to know where you were.
I'm glad you found it.
I guess I don't get much of this.
There used to be some food in the sawdust.
Now it's all sawdust.
No joke, either.
Eats ya up inside.
This doesn't look much like the old 2nd Company.
The replacements are all like that.
Not even old enough to carry a pack.
All they know how to do is die.
I guess... some of the old-timers are here yet.
Paul, they're tryin' to invent somethin' to kill me right now.
Where's Westhus?
Messenger dog was wounded.
He went out to get it.
- Is it true about the armistice?
- Doesn't look that way back there.
- You mean they want us to go on fighting?
- That's what they say.
They're crazy!
Germany'll be empty pretty soon.
Where is-- Where is Detering?
He got homesick.
You remember about the cherry blossoms?
I guess he never got over that.
He started out one night to go home and help his wife with the farm.
They got him behind the lines, and we never heard of him since.
He was just homesick, but probably they couldn't see it that way.
Where's Kat?
Is he--
Not Kat!
If he were out, the war would be over.
You remember what he always says:
They're savin' him for the last.
- Where is he?
- He's out lookin' for food, something to make soup with.
-Which way?
-Down the road about two miles that way.
I'll see you later.
Kat!
Paul!
Hello, Paul.
- How's the side?
- Oh, it's all right now.
It's fine.
- Have any luck?
- No, the general's staff's been over this country with a rake.
Let's sit down there.
Tell me, Paul...
how was it at home?
Have a good leave?
- In spots.
- What's the matter?
Ohh...
I'm no good for back there anymore, Kat.
None of us are.
We've been in this too long.
The young men thought I was a coward because I told them that... we learn that death is stronger than duty to one's country.
The old men said, "Go on.
Push on to Paris."
My father even wanted me to wear my uniform around him.
It's not home back there anymore.
All I could think of was, "I'd like to get back and see Kat again."
You're all I've got left, Kat.
I'm not much to have left.
I missed you, Paul.
At least we know what it's all about out here.
There're no lies here.
Push on to Paris?
You ought to see what they've got on the other side.
They eat white bread over there.
They've got dozens of airplanes to our one, and tanks that'll go over anything.
What've we got left?
Guns so worn they drop shells on our own men.
No food, no ammunition, no officers.
Push on to Paris!
So that's the way they talk back there.
I guess we'd better be going.
How I lied to my poor mother.
I told her it wasn't so bad out here because there was always a lot of us together.
Now that I'm with you, I'm beginning to believe that I told her the truth.
Down!
That's another one that missed us.
Come on.
Let's go.
Wait a minute.
Looks like the old bread wagon's broke down.
- I guess I don't walk the rest of the way.
- Did that get ya, Kat?
Aah, I think it broke my shin.
That's not so bad.
Hold it together.
- Just my luck, huh?
- Good luck.
That means the war is over.
Oh, no, sir!
This war don't end till they really get me.
Now this one--
- Aah.
- Easy, now.
- Hey!
- Easy!
Easy!
Come on.
I'll take you in.
Give me your hand.
Easy.
All right.
Well, kid...
now we're gonna be separated.
Maybe we can do something together later on when the war is over.
- Yes, kid.
- You give me your address, I'll give you mine.
You can't get both of us in one day.
Ah, we'll surely see each other again, Kat.
Remember that day when you brought the whole pig into the factory?
And that day in the woods when you taught us how to dodge shells?
And my first bombardment.
How I cried.
I was a young recruit then.
Here we are.
Here we are.
All right now, Kat.
You could've spared yourself the trouble.
He's dead.
Oh, no.
He's just fainted.
He was hit in the shin.
He's dead.
Would you like to take his pay book?
- You're not related, are you?
- No, we're not related.
Your deal.
Get his name and number?
Yeah, Corporal Stanislaus Katczinsky, 306.
- Thirty thousand.
- From the Russians?
No, from the French.
From the Russians we capture more than that every day.
[People Shouting, Chattering]
Mr Postman.
War is war and schnapps is schnapps, and business must go on.
You didn't leave the mail yet this morning.
Ah, I'm sorry, Mr Meyer.
Hello, Himmelstoss.
Anything for us today?
- No, no, Master Peter.
- Oh, there must be something.
Here, here you go, young rascal.
[Laughing]
There.
This is the last mail I deliver anyhow.
- What?
- Tomorrow I change uniforms.
- You're going in the army?
- Yes, I was called.
I'm a sergeant in the reserves, you know.
I'll be called myself, if it doesn't end in a few months.
- It will, though.
- I'm sure you're right, Mr Meyer.

[Speaking, Inaudible]
... defending our country, our fatherland.
Now, my beloved class, this is what we must do:
Strike with all our power.
Give every ounce of strength... to win victory before the end of the year.
It is with reluctance that I bring this subject up again.
You are the life of the fatherland, you boys.
You are the iron men of Germany.
You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy... when you are called upon to do so.
It is not for me to suggest that any of you... should stand up and offer to defend his country.
But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads.
I know that in one of the schools... the boys have risen up in the classroom... and enlisted in a mass.
But, of course, if such a thing should happen here... you would not blame me for a feeling of pride.
Perhaps some will say... that you should not be allowed to go yet... that you are too young, that you have homes, mothers, fathers... that you should not be torn away.
Are your fathers so forgetful of their fatherland... that they would let it perish rather than you?
Are your mothers so weak that they cannot send a son... to defend the land which gave them birth?
And after all, is a little experience... such a bad thing for a boy?
Is the honour of wearing a uniform... something from which we should run?
And if our young ladies glory in those who wear it... is that anything to be ashamed of?
I know you have never desired the adulation of heroes.
That has not been part of my teaching.
We have sought to make ourselves worthy... and let acclaim come when it would.
But to be foremost in battle... is a virtue not to be despised.
I believe it will be a quick war... that there will be few losses.
But if losses there must be... then let us remember the Latin phrase... which must have come to the lips of many a Roman... when he stood embattled in a foreign land. :
"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."
"Sweet and fitting it is to die for the fatherland."
Some of you may have ambitions.
I know of one young man who has great promise as a writer... and he has written the first act of a tragedy... which would be a credit to one of the masters.
And he is dreaming, I suppose... of following in the footsteps of Goethe and Schiller... and I hope he will.
But now our country calls.
The fatherland needs leaders.
Personal ambition must be thrown aside... in the one great sacrifice for our country.
Here is a glorious beginning to your lives.
The field of honour calls you.
Why are we here?
You, Kropp, what has kept you back?
You, Mueller, you know how much you are needed?
Ah, I see you look at your leader.
And I, too, look to you, Paul Baumer... and I wonder what you are going to do.
- I'll go.
- I want to go.
- Count on me.
- Me too.

No cavalry for me.
Infantry's where you see the fighting.
Where are all the guns?
That's what I want to know.
Oh, you don't get a gun for a long while yet.
If I'm gonna bump off the enemy, I gotta have some practise.
Ow!
Bayonet drill.
That's what I want.
Ah!
You won a medal that time, Mueller.
You wait.
In about a month I'll be covered with 'em.
Say, keep your boots out of my face!
Why, it's an honour to have those boots in your face.
They're the best pair in the army!
My uncle gave 'em to me.
Just look at that special imported leather.
Put 'em anyplace you like, except in my face.
Not even a kitchen maid'll look at me in this!
Attention!
Well, for the love of-- It's Himmelstoss!
- So it is.

Hello, Himmie.
You didn't think you'd see me again so soon, did you?
- You see my rank?
- Sure.
Fall back, then!
- Himmelstoss, we certainly are glad to see you.
- What did you say?
- I was going to say--
- Never mind!
- What's the matter with you?
- When you address your superior officer, say " sir"!
- Where'd he get such a nice uniform?
- Any mail for us, Himmie?
- Quiet!
- My dear fellow, you're shouting.
Ah, come on, Himmelstoss.

You make a fine mess of it.
Well, I'll have to teach you.
We'll spend the whole day on it, huh?
You may be stupid, but I'm used to that.
And then there'll be plenty of other things too.
Oh, I'll not neglect you.
Hmm.
You're not much to begin with... but I'll do my best.
I see that we have come here with a slight misunderstanding... and we'll correct that, too, won't we, huh?
And the first thing to do is to forget everything you ever knew.
Everything you ever learned, forget!
See?
Forget what you've been and what you think you're going to be.
You're going to be soldiers, and that's all!

[Paul] I suppose this is where we bunk.
That's me, "I. Westhus,"
and this is where I live.
- I didn't know!
- Well, you know now!
Yes.
Yes, of course.
- It's all right.
- [Soldier] Here's a bunk, Paul.
- When did we eat last?
- Don't remind me.
- I was fine until you spoke.
- Where are we anyway?
I don't know.
The name on the railroad station's been shot off.
There must be something to eat somewhere.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll ask those fellas.
Sorry to disturb you, Mr Westhus.
Oh.
Meet Detering.
A better farmer never lived.
- And Mr Tjaden.
- Sit down.
You see, we haven't eaten since breakfast.
We thought maybe you could tell us what we ought to do about it.
Eat without further delay.
[Detering, Tjaden Laughing]
Well, what's funny about that?
This is a bad town to bring an appetite to, soldier.
We've been here since yesterday morning, living on baled hay and razor blades.
We're willing to buy our food.
Where's the canteen?
[Laughing] The only canteen in these regions is out looking for supplies.
- Ever hear of Katczinsky?
- Who?
Katczinsky.
He's uncanny.
If there's any food within 25 miles, he'll be the one to get it.
- Hey!
- [Grunts]
[Grunts]
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hup!
- Hup!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[Chattering]
Attention!
[Laughing]
- What is this?
- Volunteers for the future generals' staff.
Sometime I'm gonna take one of you volunteers apart... and find out what makes you leave school and join the army.
At ease.
This is no parade ground.
- Hungry?
- [All Shouting] Yes.
Wait!
Wait a minute!
That's no invitation.
- Can you pay?
- Yeah, sure.
- I have some money.
No, not money.
That's just pieces of paper.
Have you got any cigarettes, cigars...
- or soap, cognac--
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Chewing tobacco?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Kat!
Are you crazy?
There ain't enough here for us.
I wish you three would get bumped off.
I'm tired of feeding ya for nothing.
- Bring everything you got.
- [All Chattering]
- [Boy #1] I'm so hungry-- - [Boy #2] I'd be glad to give you--
- Come on!
- Is this enough, sir?
- Kat!
- Hmm?
- You've got the wiring detail tonight.
- Where?
- Past the graveyard.
- With this bunch?
It's quiet tonight.
You can teach 'em a couple of things.
Thanks.
I'd rather do it alone.
- These babes get killed off too fast.
- Well, the lorry's waiting.
Last night I was too hungry to sleep... and tonight, when I get the wrinkles out of my gut, they think up wiring duty.
Well, here's your chance, heroes.
Come on, get your stuff and let's get out of here.
- Is that any way to drive?
- Let him drive any way he wants.
Suppose he breaks your arm.
You get sent home, don't you?
A lot better than havin' a hole in your guts.
If there's any of you left, I'll pick you up in the morning.
Well, if that ride you gave us didn't kill us, nothing will.
- And be on time.
I don't want to miss my breakfast.
- [Laughing]
- Huh?
- You better wait for your army, Papa.
Here, here.
Don't be so backward.
Listen, children.
All we got to do is to string a little wire.
We pick it up at the dump and carry it to where we need it.
Now, you're gonna see some shell fire, and you're gonna be scared, see?
[Shell Whistling, Explosion]
It's all right, boy.
Get up.
Here.
Never mind.
It's happened to better men than you, and it's happened to me.
When we come back, I'll get you all some nice clean underwear. [Chuckles]
That kind of shell you don't have to pay much attention to.
Those big fellas just make a lot of noise and land about five miles behind the line.
The things we've got to watch out for are the light ones.
They don't give you much warning.
They go "waa-aa-aah zing."
And when you hear that, down!
Mother Earth.
Press yourselves down upon her.
Bury yourselves deep into her.
Just keep your eyes on me.
When you see me flop, you flop... only try to beat me to it.
[Explosion]
Shh-shh.
Now listen.
I'll show you how it's done.
Give me a couple of those.
That's to kill the noise.
Tjaden.
[Explosion]
[Machine Gun Fire, Explosions]
See that?
- What's that mean?
- Bombardment.
[Screaming, Crying]
[Screaming]
My eyes!
I'm blind!
I can't see!
God!
- [Explosions Continue]
- My eyes!
I can't see!
[Continues Screaming]
- [Screaming] I can't see!
- It's Behn!
It's Behn!
[Machine Gun Fire]
- I'll go get him--
- You'll get killed!
[Shouting]
- Let me--
- Lay down and stay there!
He's dead.
- He's dead!
- Why did you risk your life bringing' him in?
But it's Behn!
- My friend.
- He's a corpse, no matter who it is.
Now, don't any of you ever do that again.
Put him over there.
- [All] Mind the wire.
- [Kat] Mind the wire.
- [All] Mind the wire.
- [Kat] Mind the wire.
- [All] Mind the wire.
- [Kat] Mind the wire.
All right, come on.
All right, come on.
Get your packs and fall in.
Hurry up!
Come on.
Hurry up.
Make it snappy.
Get your packs and fall in.
Kat, what are we doing?
What's happening?
You heard him.
Orders to march.
- But where to, for the love of--
- Another party.
And this one is gonna last a long time.
Come on.
Here we go.
Company, attention!
Shoulder arms!
March right, march!
- [Explosions]
- Take your hands off that!
- Q
- Queen takes it!
- Well, if you think that's a queen, look again.
Ah, it's a jack.
- Yeah.
- Honest, these cards all look alike.
[Laughing]
It's too noisy!
I can't play.
- I suppose your delicate nerves can't stand it.
- Get up!
That's Oscar.
The son of a--
Look at that!
Don't be so snooty.
You may wish you had this back.
About two more days of this... and this rat-bitten end of a piece of bread's gonna taste like a hunk of fruit cake.
It wouldn't-
- It wouldn't last two more days, would it?
Didn't I tell you this was gonna be a bad one?
I don't mind the days so much.
It's keeping up all night--
Ah, two more days makes a week, kid.
Then you can say you've been under fire!
You're not scared, are you?
No.
I was just asking.
That's all.
- Wanna play some more?
- Do you?
- Sure.
- All right.
My deal.
You better get your boot back before Oscar eats that!
- [Laughing]
- The kid's all right.
[Explosions Continue]
[Soldier Groaning] Behn!
Behn.
[Kat] Yeah, yeah.
Let him sleep.
He's dreamin'.
Oh, God.
Can't you see it's Behn?
He didn't want to come to war!
No, no.
It isn't Behn.
[Shouting] It isn't Behn!
It's Kemmerick!
It's me!
Shut up, will you?
It's bad enough in here as it is.
[Paul] Every--
Everything's all right, Franz.
You're dreaming.
You're just dreaming, I guess.
- Attention!
- At ease.
The barrage is gettin' worse.
The men in two more dugouts gone.
[Explosions Continue]
However, we'll do our best to get some food up here by evening.
[Whimpering, Moaning]
[Screaming]
Stop!
Stop!
[All Shouting]
[Kemmerick] Let me out!
- What did you do that for?
- Shut up!
Grab him.
- No.
- Now hold him.
[Sobbing]
You all right now?
I think so.
I couldn't hold out much longer.
[Screaming]
[Screaming]
[Paul Shouting]
- Oh, God, it's Franz!
- Get him over there!
No, he's been hit in the stomach.
He can't have anything to drink.
Get a stretcher.
Where'd they get you, Kemmerick?
Oh.
- Here it is, sir.
- Take his head.
All right.
Take him out.
- Is it serious, sir?
- I'm not sure.
- Tell the others he's all right.
- Yes, sir.
If we're going to fight, why don't we fight?
Why don't we go over?
You could go crazy staying here.
Let's do something!
- Let's go after 'em!
- Sit down!
If that cook of ours had any guts, he'd try to bring something through.
He's so far behind the lines he can't hear the shooting!
- Here's Kat.
Get anything?
- Any luck?
- We'll have to split this up among us.
- Something to eat!
[All Shouting]
We need butter too.
Yes.
And dessert.
And a feather bed to sleep on.
- Rats!
- Rats!
- Rats!
Get out of the way!
[All Shouting]
- That's enough.
- That's enough, boys.
[Explosions Cease]
What's that?
- [Whistle Blowing]
- Come on!
Grab your rifles!
[All Shouting]
Come on!
[Whistle Blowing]
- [Soldier #1] Here they come.
- [Soldier #2] Get your grenades here.
Hurry up.
Come on, hurry up.
[Distant Rumbling]
[Shells Whistling, Exploding]
[Shouting]
[Shouting Continues]
[All Shouting]
Let's go!
Let's go!
We can't hold this position.
Back to your own lines!
[Gunfire, Explosions Continue]
# [Singing Together In German]
- Fill it up.
- And hurry up.
I've got other things to do.
I've been waiting for this for three weeks.
When they all get here.
What do you want?
Beans, you homely-lookin' son of a frog's leg.
- What do you think I want?
- [Man] We're hungry.
[All Shouting]
Shut up!
I'll feed you when you're all here.
- We're all here now.
- Only half the company's here.
Get the rest.
- Wake 'em up.
- [All Laughing]
I wish I could wake 'em up.
There's 80 of us left.
The rest is in dressing stations or pushing' up daisies.
Eighty?
And I cooked for 150!
All right.
We'll have enough for once.
Come on.
Dish out!
You mean you've cooked beans for 150... and you've got bread for 150... and sausage for 150, and tobacco for 150?
Everything!
It's all wrong.
I should have been notified.
What a feast!
- Everyone gets two issues.
- [All Shouting]
- Get back in line!
Get back in line!
- Oh, no!
That won't do.
I can't give 80 men what's meant for 150.
[All Grumbling]
Listen.
You drew rations for the 2nd Company, didn't ya?
Yeah.
All right.
We're the 2nd Company.
- [Approving Shouts]
- I've got my orders.
- Kat's right.
- We're the 2nd Company.
And if only half of us get back, that's our good luck.
- Come on.
Dish it out.
- [Men Shouting] Come on!
- No!
- [All] Hey!
You're the yellowest baboon that ever drew a cook wagon... and you're scared-- it shows.
All we want to hear out of you is one more little yip... and we'll cut ya up and eat ya raw.
Why, you keep your kitchen so far back of the lines... we never get anything to eat until it's cold and we're asleep!
Now, you low-down rat, get out...
- or we wreck the joint!
- [Approving Shouts]
- Come on!
Give us--
- Attention!
At ease.
What's goin' on here?
He's cooked for 150, sir, and he only wants to give us half.
- Looks pretty good.
- Yes, sir.
- Serve the whole issue.
The men can use it.
- Yes, sir.
- And bring me a plate too.
- Yes, sir.
All right.
Take it all.
Take everything.
Give 'em honey.
Give 'em what they want.
- Fill it up!
- Fill it up!
[All Chattering]
- Don't mind me.
- Oh, that's all right.
Don't mention it.
You know...
I could do with some more beans.
Go help yourself.
There's more over there.
[Groaning]
- It's too far.
- [Kat Chuckling]
- I wonder, when are we going back to the front?
- Tomorrow.
It's enough to take away a man's appetite.
You know, if they're gonna march us in again tomorrow... we ought to go see how Kemmerick is.
- That's a good idea.
- Let's do that.
- How far is the dressing station?
- About two miles.
- We could take his things to him.
- Good.
It seemed rotten to think of a thing like that happening to him... a nice fellow like Kemmerick.
Ah, the French certainly deserve to be punished for starting this war.
Everybody says it's somebody else.
Well, how do they start a war?
Well, one country offends another.
How could one country offend another?
You mean there's a mountain over in Germany gets mad at a field over in France?
- [All Laughing]
- Well, stupid, one people offends another.
Oh, if that's it, I shouldn't be here at all.
I don't feel offended.
It don't apply to tramps like you.
Good.
Then I can be going home right away.
- Ah, you just try it.
- [Kat] Yeah.
You wanna get shot?
- The kaiser and me-- - [Jeering, Snickering]
Me and the kaiser felt just alike about this war.
We didn't either of us want any war, so I'm going home.
- He's there already.
- Somebody must have wanted it.
Maybe it was the English.
No, I don't want to shoot any Englishmen.
I never saw one till I came up here.
And I suppose most of them never saw a German till they came up here.
- No, I'm sure they weren't asked about it.
- No.
Well... it must be doing somebody some good.
- Not me and the kaiser.
- I think maybe the kaiser wanted a war.
You leave us out of this!
I don't see that.
The kaiser's got everything he needs.
Well, he never had a war before.
Every full-grown emperor needs one war to make him famous.
- Why, that's history.
- Yeah, generals too.
They need war.
- And manufacturers.
They get rich.
- [Murmurs Of Agreement]
I think it's more a kind of fever.
Nobody wants it in particular... and then all at once, there it is.
We didn't want it.
The English didn't want it.
And here we are fighting.
I'll tell you how it should all be done.
Whenever there's a big war comin' on...
- you should rope off a big field--
- And sell tickets.
Yeah.
And--
And on the big day... you should take all the kings and their cabinets and their generals... put them in the centre dressed in their underpants... and let 'em fight it out with clubs.
- The best country wins.
- [All Groan, Murmur]
Well, now that Kat's settled everything, let's go see Kemmerick.
- Something interesting might happen on the way.
- Might cheer him up.
Boys, me and the kaiser want you back in time to march tomorrow.
Don't forget.
- We'll be back.
- Give the boy my regards.
[Soldiers Chattering]
There he is.
- Hello, Kemmerick.
- How are ya?
- How's it going?
- How are things going?
- Are they looking after you all right?
How are they treating you?
Franz?
[Groaning]
They're robbers here.
Robbers.
They stole my watch!
I always told you, nobody should carry as good a watch as that.
- They took it while I was under ether!
- Franz, you'll get it back.
Do you feel all right?
- Just look at my hand.
- That's because you lost so much blood.
- Just eat decently and you'll get well again.
- Oh, no.
You must eat.
That's the main thing.
It looks good too.
I have such a terrible pain in my foot.
Every toe on my right foot hurts.
Well, how can your foot hurt when your leg's been--
[Hysterically] I know what you mean!
I know!
I know now!
They cut my leg off.
Why didn't they tell me?
Why-
- Why didn't they tell me?
- Franz!
Franz!
- Now I can't walk any more!
You must be thankful that you've come off with only that.
I wanted to be a forester once.
You can yet.
They make artificial legs that are wonderful.
And you're through too.
You can go home.
Think of that.
We brought your things for you.
See?
Put 'em under the bed.
That's a marvellous pair of boots.
Look at that leather!
What comfort.
I was just thinking.
If you're not going to be using these, Franz, why don't you leave 'em with us?
What good are they to you?
I can use 'em.
My boots give me blister after blister--
Well, we'll be going, Franz.
Oh, don't go.
Stay just a little while longer.
- I'll come right back.
- We'll be coming soon again, Franz.
- I know you'll be feeling better.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Goodbye, Franz.
[Albert] You think he'll last till after mess?
- I don't think--
- Done for.
[Paul] Boys, you go along.
I'll see you later.
[Soldiers] Goodbye.
All right, Paul.
I'm sorry, Paul.
I wouldn't touch a thing of his if he could use it.
I'd go barefoot over barbed wire for him if it'd do him any good.
Only-
- Only why should some orderly get those boots?
I understand, Mueller.
We're all alike out here.
And good boots are scarce.
Tell the doctor to come, please.
Doctor, the man in the next bed would like to see you, sir.
I've done everything I can for him.
There's no helping him.
Poor little fella.
He says next time, Franz.
Do you think I'll ever get well?
Why, of course.
- Do you really think so?
- Sure, once you get over the operation.
I don't think so.
Franz!
Don't talk nonsense.
Why, you'll be as good as new.
They fix up worse things than that.
Perhaps you'll go to the convalescent home... in Klosterberg among the villagers.
Then you can look out of the windows, across the fields... to the two trees on the horizon.
The loveliest time of the year now when the corn ripens.
You can go out without asking anyone.
You can even play piano if you want to.
Oh-
- Oh, but, Franz, you must try to sleep now.
[Sobbing]
O God... this is Franz Kemmerick... only 19 years old.
He doesn't want to die.
Please don't let him die.
[Whimpering] Paul.
- Paul.
- Franz.
Take my boots home for Mueller.
Oh, no, Franz, no.
And if...
Paul... you find my watch, send it home.
Franz!
Doctor.
Doctor!
Doctor!
Doctor!
Where's the doctor?
Why isn't there a doctor here?
- Doctor, come quick.
Franz Kemmerick is dying!
- Which one is that?
- Amputated leg.
- I've amputated a dozen legs today.
- Bed 26, sir.
- You see to it.
I'm due in the operating room.
- [Seething]
- One operation after another since 5:00 this morning.
Sixteen dead today, and yours is the 17th.
There'll probably be 20 by the morning.
[Soldiers Chattering]
[Soldier #1] You're lookin' good.
Very good today.
[Soldier #2] What's your hurry?
Hey!
I'll bet he stole those boots!
[Laughing]
- I got it, Kat.
- Hmm?
Listen: "The sum of an arithmetic series... is S = A + L x N over 2."
- Interesting, isn't it?
- What do you wanna learn that stuff for?
One day you'll stop a bullet and it'll all be worthless.
- I get a lot of fun out of it.
- Aah!
My boots!
Mueller.
I saw him die.
I didn't know what it was like to die before.
And then-- then I came outside... and it felt-- it felt so good to be alive that I started in to walk fast.
I began to think of the strangest things... like being out in the fields.
Things like that.
You know-- girls.
And it felt as if there were... something electric running from the ground up through me.
And I started.
I began to run hard.
I passed soldiers and I heard voices calling to me.
I ran and I ran.
I felt as if I couldn't breathe enough air into me.
And-- And now I'm hungry.
I don't mind the war now.
Be a pleasure to go to the front in boots like these.
[Gunfire, Explosions]
[Gunfire, Explosions Continue]
[Whistle Blows]
[Men Laughing]
It's a good invention just the same.
If you crack each separate louse, think of all the energy you use up.
Watch.
- Burned to death.
- [Laughing]
- How was patrol?
Bad?
- Must've been terrible if they had time to gather the harvest.
We passed a cherry tree and when he saw it, he went crazy.
I could hardly drag him away.
It was... beautiful.
I have a big orchard with cherry trees at home.
When they're in full blossom... from the hayloft it looks like one single sheet.
So white.
- Perhaps you can get leave soon.
- You may even be sent back as a farmer.
A woman can't run a farm alone.
That's no good, you know?
No matter how hard she works.
Harvest coming on again.
What's the matter with him?
Got a letter yesterday from his wife.
He wants to get back to his farm.
We'd all like to get back home.
I wonder what we'd do if it were suddenly peacetime again?
Get drunk and look for women!
I'd go looking for a Cinderella... that could wear this for a garter.
And when I'd found her, nobody'd see me for two weeks.
I'll go back to the peat fields... and those pleasant hours in the beer gardens.
And there's worse things than cobbling too.
Look.
My family.
I oughta give you a kick in the backside for startin' all this.
It's all right for all you to talk.
You've got something to go back to:
wives, children, jobs.
But what about us?
What have we got to go back to?
- School?
- Why not?
You know everything already.
A man can't take all that rubbish they teach you seriously... after three years of shells and bombs.
- You can't peel that off easily.
- They never taught us anything really useful... like how to light a cigarette in the wind or make a fire out of wet wood... or bayonet a man in the belly instead of the ribs where it gets jammed.
What can happen to us afterwards?
I'll tell ya.
Take our class.
Out of 20, three are officers... nine dead...
Mueller and three others wounded... and one in the madhouse.
We'll all be dead someday, so let's forget it.
[Man Shouting] Hurry up!
Get in there!
Hurry up!
Himmelstoss!
[Laughing]
- [Laughing Continues]
- What's up?
- What are you, crazy?
- It's Himmelstoss!
Himmelstoss?
There is justice in the army!
Well, well.
So, we are all here, huh?
- A bit longer than you, Himmie.
- Since when have we become so familiar?
Stand up and click your heels together!
All of you!
- Take a running jump at yourself!
[Laughs]
- Who's your friend?
Would somebody get General Ludendorff a nice, comfortable chair?
- [Laughing]
- I command you as your superior officer!
- Do you want to be court-martialled?
- I do!
There's going to be a big attack tonight and I'd just love to get out of it.
- [Laughing]
- Will you obey my orders?
Kiss my butt!
It isn't customary to ask for salutes here.
But I'll tell you what we'll do.
We're going to attack a town that we tried to take once before.
Many killed and many wounded.
It was great fun.
This time you're going with us.
If any of us stops a bullet, before we die... we're going to come to you, click our heels together and ask stiffly...
- "Please, Sergeant Himmelstoss, may we go?"
- You'll--
You'll pay for this, you--
[Distant Explosion]
- There it is.
- [Explosions Continue]
Right on time.
Better get ready, boys.
[Explosions Continue]
[Blows Whistle]
[Shells Whistling]
[Whimpering]
I'm wounded!
I'm wounded!
It's just a scratch, you yellow rat!
Up!
Get out with the others!
- Up!
- No!
No!
No!
- You yellow rat!
- [Whimpering]
Stinking yellow rat!
Let the others do it, eh?
Get up!
Get up!
- Aa-aah!
- Get up!
Forward!
- Get out here!
- Command... was forward.
Command was forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
- Forward!
- [Men Shouting]
Forward!
[Shells Continue Whistling]
[Bombing Ceases]
Counter-attack.
- [Men Shouting] - [Explosions Resume]
[Machine Gun Fire]
[Screaming]
[Wheezing]
I want to help you.
I want to help you.
[Explosions, Gunfire Continue]
- [Wheezing]
- Stop that!
Stop it, stop it.
I can bear the rest of it.
I can't listen to that!
Why do you take so long dying?
You're going to die anyway!
Oh, no.
[Indistinct]
Oh, no.
You won't die.
Oh, no.
You won't die.
They're only little wounds.
You'll get home.
You'll be all right.
You'll get home long before I will.
[Explosions, Gunfire Continue]
You know I can't run away.
That's why you accuse me.
I tell you, I didn't want to kill you.
I tried to keep you alive.
If you jumped in here again, I wouldn't do it.
When you jumped in here you were my enemy, and I was afraid of you.
But you're just a man like me, and I killed you.
Forgive me, comrade.
Say that for me.
Say you forgive me.
Oh, no.
You're dead.
You're better off than I am.
You're through.
They can't do any more to you now.
Oh, God, why did they do this to us?
We only wanted to live, you and I.
Why should they send us out to fight each other?
If we threw away these rifles and these uniforms... you could be my brother just like Kat and Albert.
You'll have to forgive me, comrade.
I'll do all I can.
I'll write to your parents.
I'll write to--
I'll write to your wife.
I'll write to her.
I promise she'll not want for anything.
I'll help her and your parents too.
Only forgive me.
Forgive me!
[Sobbing] Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Terrible thing happened yesterday.
I stabbed a man.
With my own hands, stabbed him.
I know how it is.
Your first time.
Never mind.
The stretcher-bearers will find him.
- He's dead.
I watched him die.
- You couldn't do anything about it.
We have to kill.
We can't help it.
That's what we are here for.
Uh-
- Look there, for instance.
- [Fires]
- Hah!
That got him.
You should've seen how he leaped in the air.
That fellow had to shoot with us for today with three hits.
If he keeps it up, he'll have a decoration for his buttonhole this evening.
Don't you lose any more sleep over this business.
Maybe it was 'cause I was out there with him so long, huh?
Sure, that's it.
After all, war is war.

Here's hoping we get falling-down drunk tonight.
Here's how it started.
I'd forgotten there were girls like that.
There aren't.
Just look at those thin, little shoes.
She couldn't march many miles in those.
Paul!
Don't speak about marching.
You're boring the young lady.
A thousand pardons.
- How old do you think she is?
- Oh, about 22.
No, that'd make her older than us.
She's... 17.
A girl like that.
That'd be good, eh, Albert?
We wouldn't have much of a chance with him around.
- We could take a bath, wash our clothes--
- All right.
and I might even go so far as to get deloused.
Wait a minute!
She's a long way from here now.
Look at the date.
May, 1917.
- Four months ago.
- That's true.
Well, here's to her anyway.
Here's to 'em all, everywhere.
Albert...
- we might as well wash up anyway.
- All right.
Personally, I like 'em bigger around.
This conversation was on a high moral plane up to now.
Now we do need a bath.
- A bath?
- For what?
Hm.
You wouldn't understand.
This water is freezing.
This romantic business has gone too far.
- Ahh, but think of her beautiful eyes!
- Oh!
Oh, and her hair.
- Here we are!
- We're not gonna miss a thing!
- Go away!
- What are you doing here?
- Bathing!
They tell me there's some people in this world takes a bath every week!

They're expecting us.
- That's fine!
- We'll do it!
- That blonde's crazy about me.

- I was the one that stopped 'em!

Oh!

Oh.

Yeah!

Ehh... heh.
Huh?
I've been betrayed!
Yeah, you certainly have.

Camille?
Oh, mon nom.
Suzanne.
Suzanne.
Et toi?
Quel est ton nom?
- Paul.
- Paul.
C'est un joli nom.
Suzanne, I wish I could tell you something.
- I wish you could understand.
- Oh, non, non.
Il faut pas--
Darling, I'll never see you again.
I know that.
And I wouldn't even know you if I did.
And yet, I'll remember you always.
Toujours.
Oh, if you could only know how different this is from the women we soldiers meet.
Oh, non, non, Il faut tout oublier.
C'est cette guerre, cette terrible guerre!
No, no, no.
Not the war.
You.
That's what I'm talking about.
Vous.
It seems as though all war and terror and grossness... had fallen away from me... like a miracle.
Like something I never believed.
Pauvre garçon.
Pauvre garçon.
Call Paul.
We're going, Paul.
[Paul] Have a look.
Nice, new coffins.
Huh!
For us.
I must say, that's a very cheerful preparation for this offensive.
That's very considerate of them.
But I don't see any long enough for our comrade Tjaden.
Mind you, I'm not speaking to you, you traitors.
- But no coffin's gonna get me.
- I should say not, heartbreaker.
You'll be thankful if they slip a waterproof sheet...
- around that Aunt Sally of a carcass of yours.

[Groaning]
Oh-Oh, my side!
[Groaning]
My side.
Catholic hospital, Albert.
[Groans] They say you always get good food and good treatment.
- We're lucky.
- After that rainy dressing station... and 24 hours on the train, we deserve to have some luck.
[Wheezing Laughter]
I'm Hamacher.
Yeah, that's my name.
I got a crack in the head and they gave me a certificate stating...
"Josef Hamacher is periodically... not responsible for his actions."
And ever since then, Hamacher has been having a grand time.
I hope you boys are not too badly wounded. [Laughing]
The others die off so quickly we don't have time to get acquainted.
You'll get to know us...
very well.
Thank you.
You too.
I'm sorry, my dear.
It's time to go now.
Yes, sister.
Watch.
If they take his clothes away, you've seen the last of him.
- See?
They're taking him to the dying room.
- Dying room?
When you're ready to kick the bucket, they get you out of the way so they can use the bed.
In the corner of the building there's a little room... right next to the morgue!
[Laughs]
It's so convenient.
It saves a lot of trouble.
But suppose he gets well?
I've seen a lot of'em go in that dying room... but nobody ever comes back.
[Quietly] Sister.
Sister.
Sister.
- [Albert] Is that you ringing, Paul?
- Yes.
- [Hamacher] Is something going on?
- I think I have a hemorrhage.
The bandage is all wet.
I've been ringing forever and nobody comes.
- I think I'm bleeding.
- Sister, get me a sterile dressing and an ice pack.
- Why didn't someone call me?
- [Albert] He's been ringing.
[Hamacher] Nobody can walk, Sister.
- [Albert] Sister, is it bad?
- No.
No, we'll be all right.
We've got it in time.
[Paul Whimpering]
What's the matter?
What are you doing?
We must rearrange your bandages.
Wh-
- Where are you taking me?
To the bandaging ward.
- No, no!
I'm not going!
I'm staying here!
- [Albert] Paul!
Paul!
- Now, now!
- I'm not going to the dying room!
- We're going to the bandaging ward.
- Why are you taking my clothes?
You're lying to me!
But I'll come back.
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'm not going to die!
I'll come back!
[Hamacher] Sister Libertine, how is he?
Poor boy.
They had to amputate his leg.
Paul.
Paul.
Paul.
Oh, he is... gone.
Gone.
Hello.
Welcome home, Albert!
- How do you feel, kid?
- All right.
But I've got such an awful pain.
My foot hur--
Hamacher.
Did they cut my leg off?
Of course not!
How many did you have?
Two?
You still got 'em!
One, two!
[Laughs]
Don't play the fool, Hamacher.
Tell me truthfully.
Of course not.
And you look fine.
Look.
See?
- [Gasps] I won't be a cripple.
- Now, now.
- I won't live like that!
- Be calm.
- I'll kill myself the first chance I get!
- Albert!
- I won't live!
I won't live!
- Yes, you will.
Albert!
Albert!
Albert, I've come back!
I told you I'd come back.
Look, everybody!
I've come back!
- [Albert] Paul!
Paul!
- That's not where I'm going.
I live over there.
Paul, I'm so happy.
Hamacher, I've come back from the dead!
- It's most irregular.
Never happened before.
- Albert, get well quickly... so we can go home soon.
- Everything will be all right now.
- Yes, Paul.
Everything will be all right... now.
[Bell Ringing]
Oh!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul.
- What's the matter, Paul?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
Paul.
Give me your handkerchief.
- Mother?
- [Woman] Here I am, Paul.
Here I am.
Mother's ill.
- Are you wounded?
- No, Mother.
I got leave.
[Relieved Sigh]
[Sobbing]
Here I am cryin' instead of being glad.
Anna, get down the jar of blackberries.
You still like them, don't you?
Yes, Mother.
I haven't had any for a long time.
We might almost have known you were coming.
- I'm making potato cakes.
- [Mother] Don't let them burn.
Paul... sit down... beside me.
My Paul.
My baby.
I almost forgot, Mother.
I've got some little presents for you.
Look, Mother.
Bread, sausage and rice.
- Paul, you've been starving yourself.
- Hmm-mm.
Hadn't I better go and tell Father Paul's home?
- Paul could watch the things on the stove.
- No, I'm getting up.
Oh, Paul, you're a soldier now, aren't you?
But somehow, I don't seem to know you.
I'll take these off, Mother.
I'll get your suit.
It's in the wardrobe, just where you left it.
Are you really here, Paul?
You won't--
You won't disappear, will you?
No.
I'm here.
Your things are ready for you, Paul.
- I remember when you caught that one.
- Yes.
And you took it away from me, didn't you?
- [Giggles]
- Yes, I did.
We're behind the lines, but we know how to honour the soldier... who goes on in spite of blood and death.
Gentlemen, my son.
- Prosit.
- Prosit.
I'm glad to know you, young man, I am glad to know you.
How are things out there?
Terrible, eh?
Terrible.
But we must carry on.
After all, you do at least get decent food out there.
Naturally, it's worse here.
Naturally.
But the best for our soldiers all the time.
That's our motto.
- The best for our soldiers.
- [Murmurs Of Agreement]
But...
[Chuckles]
- you must give the Frenchies a good licking!
- [All Laughing]
And, if you boys want to come home, eh... let me show you what you must do before you can come home.
Give us a hand there, men.
Now, then, there's the line.
Runs so, in a "V".
Here is St Quentin.
You can see for yourself.
You're almost through now.
All right?
Shove ahead out there and don't stick to that everlasting trench warfare!
Smash through the johnnies!
And then you will have peace.
When you get in it... the war isn't the way it looks back here.
Oh!
You don't know anything about it.
Of course, you know about the details... but this relates to the whole!
You can't judge that.
Of course, you do your duty and you risk your life.
But for that, you receive the highest honour.
I said that every man in the war ought to have the Iron Cross.
First, the enemy lines must be broken through in Flanders.
- On to Paris!
Push on to Paris!
- Right.
No, not in Flanders.
I'll tell you just where the break should come.
- Here.
- The enemy has too many reserves there.
- I insist upon Flanders!
- Why should they do that... when they're halfway through St Quentin already?
Because Flanders is a flat country!
- No mountains, no obstructions!
- There's too many rivers there!
[Professor] From the farms they have gone;
from the schools, from the factories.
They have gone bravely, nobly, ever forward... realizing there is no other duty now but to save the fatherland.
Paul!
How are you, Paul?
Glad to see you, Professor.
You've come at the right moment, Baumer!
Just at the right moment.
And as if to prove all I have said, here is one of the first to go.
A lad who sat before me on these very benches... who gave up all to serve in the first year of the war;
one of the iron youth who have made Germany invincible in the field.
Look at him-- sturdy and bronze and clear-eyed.
The kind of soldier every one of you should envy.
Oh, lad, you must speak to them.
You must tell them what it means to serve your fatherland.
- No, I can't tell them anything.
- You must, Paul.
Just a word.
Just tell them how much they're needed out there.
Tell them why you went and what it meant to you.
I can't say anything.
You can remember some deed of heroism, some touch of nobility.
- Tell about it.
- [Enthusiastic Chattering]
I can't tell you anything you don't know.
We live in the trenches out there.
We fight.
We try not to be killed;
sometimes we are.
That's all.
[Professor] No.
No, Paul.
I've been there!
I know what it's like.
That's not what one dwells on, Paul.
I heard you in here reciting that same old stuff... making more iron men, more young heroes.
You still think it's beautiful and sweet to die for your country, don't you?
We used to think you knew.
The first bombardment taught us better.
It's dirty and painful to die for your country.
When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all!
There are millions out there dying for their countries, and what good is it?
- [All Chattering] - [Professor] Paul!
You asked me to tell them how much they're needed out there.
He tells you, "Go out and die."
Oh, but if you'll pardon me, it's easier to say "Go out and die" than it is to do it.
- [Boy] Coward!
- And it's easier to say it than to watch it happen.
- [Angry Clamouring] - [Professor] No!
No!
Boys, boys!
- I'm sorry, Baumer, but I must say--
- It's no use talking like this.
You won't know what I mean.
Only, it's been a long while since we enlisted out of this classroom.
So long I thought maybe the whole world had learned by this time.
Only now they're sending babies, and they won't last a week!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
Up at the front you're alive or you're dead, and that's all!
You can't fool anybody about that very long.
Up there we know we're lost and done for whether we're dead or alive.
Three years we've had of it-- four years.
Every day a year and every night a century.
Our bodies are earth and our thoughts are clay... and we sleep and eat with death.
We're done for because you can't live that way and keep anything inside you!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
I'll go back tomorrow.
I've got four days more, but I can't stand it here!
I'll go back tomorrow!
Sorry.
Mother, you'll catch cold here.
You must go to sleep.
There'll be plenty of time to sleep... when you're gone.
Must you go tomorrow, Paul?
Must you?
Yes, Mother.
Orders were changed.
Are you very much afraid, Paul?
No, Mother.
There's something I want to say to you, Paul.
It's--
Just be on your guard against the women out there.
They're no good.
Where we are, there aren't any women, Mother.
Be very careful at the front, Paul.
Yes, Mother, I will.
I'll pray for you every day.
And if you could, get a job that's not quite so dangerous.
Yes, Mother.
I'll try and get in the cookhouse.
- That can easily be done.
- You do it then, and if the others say anything--
That won't worry me, Mother.
Now, you must go to bed and you must get well quickly before I come back.
I put two sets of underwear-- new ones-- in your pack.
They'll keep you nice and warm.
[Choking] They're all wool.
That's sweet of you.
Goodnight... my son.
Goodnight, Mother.
Oh, Mother, Mother.
You still think I'm a child.
Why can't I put my head in your lap and cry?
- Is this the 2nd Company?
- Yes, sir.
# [Concertina]
# [Whistling]
- Is this all of it?
- Yes, sir.
We had 150 men, but this is all that came back yesterday.
But now they're going to give us enough to make 150 again.
How old are you?
Sixteen.
No use.
I couldn't find anything.
- We'll have to eat the sawdust.
- [Discontented Grumbles]
Not me!
I'll go hungry first.
It makes me sick.
Now it's gonna be a real war again.
Paul!
How's old Paul?
Here I am.
You know, the 2nd Company's getting hard to find.
Nobody seemed to know where you were.
I'm glad you found it.
I guess I don't get much of this.
There used to be some food in the sawdust.
Now it's all sawdust.
No joke, either.
Eats ya up inside.
This doesn't look much like the old 2nd Company.
The replacements are all like that.
Not even old enough to carry a pack.
All they know how to do is die.
I guess... some of the old-timers are here yet.
Paul, they're tryin' to invent somethin' to kill me right now.
Where's Westhus?
Messenger dog was wounded.
He went out to get it. [Clucks Tongue]
- Is it true about the armistice?
- Doesn't look that way back there.
- You mean they want us to go on fighting?
- That's what they say.
They're crazy!
Germany'll be empty pretty soon.
Where is-- Where is Detering?
He got homesick.
You remember about the cherry blossoms?
I guess he never got over that.
He started out one night to go home and help his wife with the farm.
They got him behind the lines, and we never heard of him since.
He was just homesick, but probably they couldn't see it that way.
- Where's Kat?
Is he-- - [Chuckles]
Not Kat!
If he were out, the war would be over.
You remember what he always says:
They're savin' him for the last.
- Where is he?
- He's out lookin' for food, something to make soup with.
- Which way?
- Down the road about two miles that way.
I'll see you later.
Kat!
Paul!
Hello, Paul.
- How's the side?
- Oh, it's all right now.
It's fine.
- Have any luck?
- No, the general's staff's been over this country with a rake.
[Chuckles] Let's sit down there.
Tell me, Paul...
how was it at home?
Have a good leave?
- In spots.
- What's the matter?
Ohh...
I'm no good for back there any more, Kat.
None of us are.
We've been in this too long.
The young men thought I was a coward because I told them that... we learn that death is stronger than duty to one's country.
The old men said, "Go on.
Push on to Paris."
My father even wanted me to wear my uniform around him.
[Laughing]
It's not home back there any more.
All I could think of was, "I'd like to get back and see Kat again."
You're all I've got left, Kat.
I'm not much to have left.
I missed you, Paul.
At least we know what it's all about out here.
There're no lies here.
Push on to Paris?
You ought to see what they've got on the other side.
They eat white bread over there.
They've got dozens of aeroplanes to our one... and tanks that'll go over anything.
What've we got left?
Guns so worn they drop shells on our own men.
No food, no ammunition, no officers.
Push on to Paris!
So that's the way they talk back there. [Chuckles]
I guess we'd better be going.
How I lied to my poor mother.
I told her it wasn't so bad out here because there was always a lot of us together.
Now that I'm with you, I'm beginning to believe that I told her the truth.
Down!
That's another one that missed us.
Come on.
Let's go.
Wait a minute.
Looks like the old bread wagon's broke down.
- I guess I don't walk the rest of the way.
- Did that get ya, Kat?
Aah, I think it broke my shin.
That's not so bad.
Hold it together.
- Just my luck, huh?
- Good luck.
That means the war is over.
Oh, no, sir!
This war don't end till they really get me.
- [Chuckles]
- Now this one--
- Aah.
- Easy, now.
- Hey!
- Easy!
Easy!
Come on.
I'll take you in.
Give me your hand.
Easy.
[Grunts]
All right.
Well, kid...
now we're gonna be separated.
Maybe we can do something together later on when the war is over.
- Yes, kid.
- You give me your address, I'll give you mine.
[Explosion]
[Debris Clattering]
You can't get both of us in one day.
Ah, we'll surely see each other again, Kat.
Remember that day when you brought the whole pig into the factory?
And that day in the woods when you taught us how to dodge shells?
And my first bombardment.
How I cried.
I was a young recruit then.
Here we are.
Here we are.
[Grunts] All right now, Kat.
You could've spared yourself the trouble.
He's dead.
Oh, no.
He's just fainted.
He was hit in the shin.
He's dead.
Would you like to take his pay book?
- You're not related, are you?
- No, we're not related.
Your deal.
Get his name and number?
Yeah, Corporal Stanislaus Katczinsky, 306.
[Muttering, Indistinct]
- # [Harmonica] - [Distant Explosions]
[Gunshot]
- Thirty thousand.
- From the Russians?
No, from the French.
From the Russians we capture more than that every day.
Mr Postman.
War is war and schnapps is schnapps, and business must go on.
You didn't leave the mail yet this morning.
Ah, I'm sorry, Mr Meyer.
Hello, Himmelstoss.
Anything for us today?
- No, no, Master Peter.
- Oh, there must be something.
Here, here you go, young rascal.
There.
This is the last mail I deliver anyhow.
- What?
- Tomorrow I change uniforms.
- You're going in the army?
- Yes, I was called.
I'm a sergeant in the reserves, you know.
I'll be called myself, if it doesn't end in a few months.
- It will, though.
- I'm sure you're right, Mr Meyer.
...defending our country, our fatherland.
Now, my beloved class, this is what we must do:
Strike with all our power.
Give every ounce of strength... to win victory before the end of the year.
It is with reluctance that I bring this subject up again.
You are the life of the fatherland, you boys.
You are the iron men of Germany.
You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy... when you are called upon to do so.
It is not for me to suggest that any of you... should stand up and offer to defend his country.
But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads.
I know that in one of the schools... the boys have risen up in the classroom... and enlisted in a mass.
But, of course, if such a thing should happen here... you would not blame me for a feeling of pride.
Perhaps some will say... that you should not be allowed to go yet... that you are too young, that you have homes, mothers, fathers... that you should not be torn away.
Are your fathers so forgetful of their fatherland... that they would let it perish rather than you?
Are your mothers so weak that they cannot send a son... to defend the land which gave them birth?
And after all, is a little experience... such a bad thing for a boy?
Is the honour of wearing a uniform... something from which we should run?
And if our young ladies glory in those who wear it... is that anything to be ashamed of?
I know you have never desired the adulation of heroes.
That has not been part of my teaching.
We have sought to make ourselves worthy... and let acclaim come when it would.
But to be foremost in battle... is a virtue not to be despised.
I believe it will be a quick war... that there will be few losses.
But if losses there must be... then let us remember the Latin phrase... which must have come to the lips of many a Roman... when he stood embattled in a foreign land.
"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori. "
"Sweet and fitting it is to die for the fatherland. "
Some of you may have ambitions.
I know of one young man who has great promise as a writer... and he has written the first act of a tragedy... which would be a credit to one of the masters.
And he is dreaming, I suppose... of following in the footsteps of Goethe and Schiller... and I hope he will.
But now our country calls.
The fatherland needs leaders.
Personal ambition must be thrown aside... in the one great sacrifice for our country.
Here is a glorious beginning to your lives.
The field of honour calls you.
Why are we here?
You, Kropp, what has kept you back?
You, Mueller, you know how much you are needed?
Ah, I see you look at your leader.
And I, too, look to you, Paul Baumer... and I wonder what you are going to do.
- I'll go.
- I want to go.
- Count on me.
- Me too.
- I'm ready.
I'm not gonna stay home!
Follow me!
Enlist now!
- No more classes!
- No more classes!
- Don't be a quitter!
- Come on, Behn!
Stick together.
That's what we've got to do.
- Let's all stick together.
- Come on, Behn.
All right.
All right.
- I'll go.
- That's the way!
Let's go!
Hey!
Let's sing!
Come on!
Keep in line there, soldiers.
Anything you say, General.
Detail, halt!
Left face!
Get into uniform, ready to report.
Fall out!
I bet you a place like this gets you in good condition.
You have to be for the long marches.
I'm gonna get in the cavalry and ride.
No cavalry for me.
Infantry's where you see the fighting.
Where are all the guns?
That's what I want to know.
Oh, you don't get a gun for a long while yet.
If I'm gonna bump off the enemy, I gotta have some practise.
Ow!
Bayonet drill.
That's what I want.
Ah!
You won a medal that time, Mueller.
You wait.
In about a month I'll be covered with 'em.
Say, keep your boots out of my face!
Why, it's an honour to have those boots in your face.
They're the best pair in the army!
My uncle gave 'em to me.
just look at that special imported leather.
Put 'em anyplace you like, except in my face.
Not even a kitchen maid'll look at me in this!
Attention!
Well, for the love of...
It's Himmelstoss!
- So it is.
- And all dressed up.
Hello, Himmie.
You didn't think you'd see me again so soon, did you?
- You see my rank?
- Sure.
Fall back, then!
- Himmelstoss, we certainly are glad to see you.
- What did you say?
- I was going to say..
- Never mind!
What's the matter with you?
- When you address your superior officer, say "sir"!
- Where'd he get such a nice uniform?
- Any mail for us, Himmie?
- Quiet!
- My dear fellow, you're shouting.
Ah, come on, Himmelstoss.
We know ya.
Take off the false whiskers.
- I believe you mean it!
- You'll find out that I mean it.
- But only three days ago you were our postman.
- Silence!
Come back here!
Line up!
Line up!
Get in some kind of a line!
All of you!
Line up, I say!
Hmm.
What a pretty sight that is!
Have you never heard of standing in line?
You make a fine mess of it.
Well, I'll have to teach you.
We'll spend the whole day on it, huh?
You may be stupid, but I'm used to that.
And then there'll be plenty of other things too.
Oh, I'll not neglect you.
Hmm.
You're not much to begin with... but I'll do my best.
I see that we have come here with a slight misunderstanding... and we'll correct that, too, won't we, huh?
And the first thing to do is to forget everything you ever knew.
Everything you ever learned, forget!
See?
Forget what you've been and what you think you're going to be.
You're going to be soldiers, and that's all!
I'll take the mother's milk out of you!
I'll make you hard-boiled!
I'll make soldiers out of you or kill you!
Now... salute!
A- ten-hut!
Detachment...
lie down!
Down!
Head down!
Keep your head down, Baumer!
Detachment... get up!
Now sing!
Do you call that singing?
Detachment, halt!
So... we have no spirit, huh?
We are in no mood for recreation.
Work is what we want.
Good!
Then we'll go back to work!
Detachment, lie down!
Keep your head down!
Now sing!
Men... halt!
Order, arms!
Inspection at 3.00.
Dismissed!
Oh, that swine!
That means we get no time off.
It will take four hours to get ready for inspection.
- I'd like to know what's in his mind.
- He hasn't got any!
I'm gonna cut him open sometime and find out!
He's too thick-skinned.
He won't cut.
This is the fourth time he's made me disappoint that poor girl.
Arms!
Order, arms!
Left shoulder, arms!
Squad right.
To the right, march!
Left, left, left, left.
Column left, march!
Squad, left march!
Forward... march!
Detachment... halt!
Present arms!
Himmelstoss.
Excellent work.
They're going up front tomorrow.
- I recommend leave till midnight.
- Very good, sir.
Left, left, left.
Detachment...
lie down!
Crawl forward!
He spoilt our leave.
I'll never forgive him for that.
- The rat!
- Leave till midnight.
Hmm!
It'll take till midnight to dry our clothes.
There goes the filthy ape now.
While we slave over this mud, he goes off to have a few drinks!
Someday I'm going to take one smack at him, just one.
Me too.
That's gonna be my life's work from now on.
Why only one?
I'm gonna take several.
I might even kick him while he's down.
I feel mean.
What are you doing?
You're not going to desert, are you?
What?
Listen.
I've got an idea.
Crawl forward!
Lie down!
Lie down!
Crawl forward!
Oh!
What?
Ow!
Ow!
Paul, you all right?
Behn!
Behn!
Behn!
Come on!
Behn, come on!
You fool!
Behn!
Get up!
Come on.
Sounds like more replacements coming in.
Yeah.
Tjaden must have gone home for that wood.
There's some more, fresh from the turnip patch.
I suppose this is where we bunk.
That's me, "I. Westhus,"
and this is where I live.
- I didn't know!
- Well, you know now!
Yes.
Yes, of course.
It's all right.
Here's a bunk, Paul.
- When did we eat last?
- Don't remind me.
- I was fine until you spoke.
- Where are we anyway?
I don't know.
The name on the railroad station's been shot off.
There must be something to eat somewhere.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll ask those fellas.
Sorry to disturb you, Mr Westhus.
Oh.
Meet Detering.
A better farmer never lived.
- And Mr Tjaden.
- Sit down.
You see, we haven't eaten since breakfast.
We thought maybe you could tell us what we ought to do about it.
Eat without further delay.
Well, what's funny about that?
This is a bad town to bring an appetite to, soldier.
We've been here since yesterday morning, living on baled hay and razor blades.
We're willing to buy our food.
Where's the canteen?
The only canteen in these regions is out looking for supplies.
- Ever hear of Katczinsky?
- Who?
Katczinsky.
He's uncanny.
If there's any food within 25 miles, he'll be the one to get it.
Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hup!
- Hup!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Attention!
- What is this?
- Volunteers for the future generals' staff.
Sometime I'm gonna take one of you volunteers apart... and find out what makes you leave school and join the army.
At ease.
This is no parade ground.
- Hungry?
- Yes.
Wait!
Wait a minute!
That's no invitation.
- Can you pay?
- Yeah, sure.
- I have some money.
No, not money.
That's just pieces of paper.
Have you got any cigarettes, cigars...
- or soap, cognac
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Chewing tobacco?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Kat!
Are you crazy?
There ain't enough here for us.
I wish you three would get bumped off.
I'm tired of feeding ya for nothing.
Bring everything you got.
I'm so hungry-
- I'd be glad to give you-
- Come on!
- Is this enough, sir?
- Kat!
- Hmm?
- You've got the wiring detail tonight.
- Where?
- Past the graveyard.
- With this bunch?
It's quiet tonight.
You can teach 'em a couple of things.
Thanks.
I'd rather do it alone.
- These babes get killed off too fast.
- Well, the lorry's waiting.
Last night I was too hungry to sleep... and tonight, when I get the wrinkles out of my gut, they think up wiring duty.
Well, here's your chance, heroes.
For the fatherland!
Come on, get your stuff and let's get out of here.
- Is that any way to drive?
- Let him drive any way he wants.
Suppose he breaks your arm.
You get sent home, don't you?
A lot better than havin' a hole in your guts.
If there's any of you left, I'll pick you up in the morning.
Well, if that ride you gave us didn't kill us, nothing will.
- And be on time.
I don't want to miss my breakfast.
- Huh?
- You better wait for your army, Papa.
Here, here.
Don't be so backward.
Listen, children.
All we got to do is to string a little wire.
We pick it up at the dump and carry it to where we need it.
Now, you're gonna see some shell fire, and you're gonna be scared, see?
It's all right, boy.
Get up.
Here.
Never mind.
It's happened to better men than you, and it's happened to me.
When we come back, I'll get you all some nice clean underwear.
That kind of shell you don't have to pay much attention to.
Those big fellas just make a lot of noise and land about five miles behind the line.
The things we've got to watch out for are the light ones.
They don't give you much warning.
They go "waa-aa-aah zing. "
And when you hear that, down!
Mother Earth.
Press yourselves down upon her.
Bury yourselves deep into her.
just keep your eyes on me.
When you see me flop, you flop... only try to beat me to it.
Shh-shh.
Now listen.
I'll show you how it's done.
Give me a couple of those.
That's to kill the noise.
Tjaden.
See that?
- What's that mean?
- Bombardment.
My eyes!
I'm blind!
I can't see!
God!
My eyes!
I can't see!
I can't see!
- It's Behn!
It's Behn!
- I'll go get him-
- You'll get killed!
- Let me-
- Lay down and stay there!
He's dead.
- He's dead!
- Why did you risk your life bringing' him in?
But it's Behn!
- My friend.
- He's a corpse, no matter who it is.
Now, don't any of you ever do that again.
Put him over there.
Mind the wire.
Mind the wire.
Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
All right, come on.
All right, come on.
Get your packs and fall in.
Hurry up!
Come on.
Hurry up.
Make it snappy.
Get your packs and fall in.
Kat, what are we doing?
What's happening?
You heard him.
Orders to march.
- But where to, for the love of-
- Another party.
And this one is gonna last a long time.
Come on.
Here we go.
Company, attention!
Shoulder arms!
March right, march!
Take your hands off that!
- Queen takes it!
- Well, if you think that's a queen, look again.
Ah, it's a jack.
- Yeah.
- Honest, these cards all look alike.
It's too noisy!
I can't play.
- I suppose your delicate nerves can't stand it.
- Get up!
That's Oscar.
The son of a...
Look at that!
Don't be so snooty.
You may wish you had this back.
About two more days of this... and this rat-bitten end of a piece of bread's gonna taste like a hunk of fruit cake.
It wouldn't
- It wouldn't last two more days, would it?
Didn't I tell you this was gonna be a bad one?
I don't mind the days so much.
It's keeping up all night...
Ah, two more days makes a week, kid.
Then you can say you've been under fire!
You're not scared, are you?
No.
I was just asking.
That's all.
- Wanna play some more?
- Do you?
- Sure.
- All right.
My deal.
You better get your boot back before Oscar eats that!
The kid's all right.
Behn!
Behn.
Yeah, yeah.
Let him sleep.
He's dreamin:
Oh, God.
Can't you see it's Behn?
He didn't want to come to war!
No, no.
It isn't Behn.
It isn't Behn!
It's Kemmerick!
It's me!
Shut up, will you?
It's bad enough in here as it is.
Every...
Everything's all right, Franz.
You're dreaming.
You're just dreaming, I guess.
- Attention!
- At ease.
The barrage is gettin' worse.
The men in two more dugouts gone.
However, we'll do our best to get some food up here by evening.
Stop!
Stop!
Let me out!
- What did you do that for?
- Shut up!
Grab him.
- No.
- Now hold him.
You all right now?
I think so.
I couldn't hold out much longer.
- Oh, God, it's Franz!
- Get him over there!
No, he's been hit in the stomach.
He can't have anything to drink.
Get a stretcher.
Where'd they get you, Kemmerick?
Oh.
- Here it is, sir.
- Take his head.
All right.
Take him out.
- Is it serious, sir?
- I'm not sure.
- Tell the others he's all right.
- Yes, sir.
If we're going to fight, why don't we fight?
Why don't we go over?
You could go crazy staying here.
Let's do something!
- Let's go after 'em!
- Sit down!
If that cook of ours had any guts, he'd try to bring something through.
He's so far behind the lines he can't hear the shooting!
- Here's Kat.
Get anything?
- Any luck?
- We'll have to split this up among us.
- Something to eat!
We need butter too.
Yes.
And dessert.
And a feather bed to sleep on.
- Rats!
- Rats!
- Rats!
Get out of the way!
- That's enough.
- That's enough, boys.
What's that?
Come on!
Grab your rifles!
Come on!
Here they come.
- Get your grenades here.
Hurry up.
Come on, hurry up.
Let's go!
Let's go!
We can't hold this position.
Back to your own lines!
- Fill it up.
- And hurry up.
I've got other things to do.
I've been waiting for this for three weeks.
When they all get here.
What do you want?
Beans, you homely-lookin' son of a frog's leg.
- What do you think I want?
We're hungry.
Shut up!
I'll feed you when you're all here.
- We're all here now.
- Only half the company's here.
Get the rest.
Wake 'em up.
I wish I could wake 'em up.
There's 80 of us left.
The rest is in dressing stations or pushing' up daisies.
Eighty?
And I cooked for 150!
All right.
We'll have enough for once.
Come on.
Dish out!
You mean you've cooked beans for 150... and you've got bread for 150... and sausage for 150, and tobacco for 150?
Everything!
It's all wrong.
I should have been notified.
What a feast!
Everyone gets two issues.
- Get back in line!
Get back in line!
- Oh, no!
That won't do.
I can't give 80 men what's meant for 150.
Listen.
You drew rations for the 2nd Company, didn't ya?
Yeah.
All right.
We're the 2nd Company.
I've got my orders.
- Kat's right.
- We're the 2nd Company.
And if only half of us get back, that's our good luck.
- Come on.
Dish it out.
- Come on!
- No!
- Hey!
You're the yellowest baboon that ever drew a cook wagon... and you're scared, it shows.
All we want to hear out of you is one more little yip... and we'll cut ya up and eat ya raw.
Why, you keep your kitchen so far back of the lines... we never get anything to eat until it's cold and we're asleep!
Now, you low-down rat, get out... or we wreck the joint!
- Come on!
Give us...
- Attention!
At ease.
What's goin' on here?
He's cooked for 150, sir, and he only wants to give us half.
- Looks pretty good.
- Yes, sir.
- Serve the whole issue.
The men can use it.
- Yes, sir.
- And bring me a plate too.
- Yes, sir.
All right.
Take it all.
Take everything.
Give 'em honey.
Give 'em what they want.
- Fill it up!
- Fill it up!
- Don't mind me.
- Oh, that's all right.
Don't mention it.
You know...
I could do with some more beans.
Go help yourself.
There's more over there.
It's too far.
- I wonder, when are we going back to the front?
- Tomorrow.
It's enough to take away a man's appetite.
You know, if they're gonna march us in again tomorrow... we ought to go see how Kemmerick is.
- That's a good idea.
- Let's do that.
- How far is the dressing station?
- About two miles.
- We could take his things to him.
- Good.
It seemed rotten to think of a thing like that happening to him... a nice fellow like Kemmerick.
Ah, the French certainly deserve to be punished for starting this war.
Everybody says it's somebody else.
Well, how do they start a war?
Well, one country offends another.
How could one country offend another?
You mean there's a mountain over in Germany gets mad at a field over in France?
- Well, stupid, one people offends another.
Oh, if that's it, I shouldn't be here at all.
I don't feel offended.
It don't apply to tramps like you.
Good.
Then I can be going home right away.
- Ah, you just try it.
Yeah.
You wanna get shot?
The kaiser and me..
Me and the kaiser felt just alike about this war.
We didn't either of us want any war, so I'm going home.
- He's there already.
- Somebody must have wanted it.
Maybe it was the English.
No, I don't want to shoot any Englishmen.
I never saw one till I came up here.
And I suppose most of them never saw a German till they came up here.
- No, I'm sure they weren't asked about it.
- No.
Well... it must be doing somebody some good.
- Not me and the kaiser.
- I think maybe the kaiser wanted a war.
You leave us out of this!
I don't see that.
The kaiser's got everything he needs.
Well, he never had a war before.
Every full-grown emperor needs one war to make him famous.
- Why, that's history.
- Yeah, generals too.
They need war.
- And manufacturers.
They get rich.
I think it's more a kind of fever.
Nobody wants it in particular... and then all at once, there it is.
We didn't want it.
The English didn't want it.
And here we are fighting.
I'll tell you how it should all be done.
Whenever there's a big war comin' on...
- you should rope off a big field..
- And sell tickets.
Yeah.
And..
And on the big day... you should take all the kings and their cabinets and their generals... put them in the centre dressed in their underpants... and let 'em fight it out with clubs.
The best country wins.
Well, now that Kat's settled everything, let's go see Kemmerick.
- Something interesting might happen on the way.
- Might cheer him up.
Boys, me and the kaiser want you back in time to march tomorrow.
Don't forget.
- We'll be back.
- Give the boy my regards.
There he is.
- Hello, Kemmerick.
- How are ya?
- How's it going?
- How are things going?
- Are they looking after you all right?
How are they treating you?
Franz?
They're robbers here.
Robbers.
They stole my watch!
I always told you, nobody should carry as good a watch as that.
- They took it while I was under ether!
- Franz, you'll get it back.
Do you feel all right?
- just look at my hand.
- That's because you lost so much blood.
- just eat decently and you'll get well again.
- Oh, no.
You must eat.
That's the main thing.
It looks good too.
I have such a terrible pain in my foot.
Every toe on my right foot hurts.
Well, how can your foot hurt when your leg's been..
I know what you mean!
I know!
I know now!
They cut my leg off.
Why didn't they tell me?
Why..
Why didn't they tell me?
- Franz!
Franz!
- Now I can't walk any more!
You must be thankful that you've come off with only that.
I wanted to be a forester once.
You can yet.
They make artificial legs that are wonderful.
And you're through too.
You can go home.
Think of that.
We brought your things for you.
See?
Put 'em under the bed.
That's a marvellous pair of boots.
Look at that leather!
What comfort.
I was just thinking.
If you're not going to be using these, Franz, why don't you leave 'em with us?
What good are they to you?
I can use 'em.
My boots give me blister after blister...
Well, we'll be going, Franz.
Oh, don't go.
Stay just a little while longer.
- I'll come right back.
- We'll be coming soon again, Franz.
- I know you'll be feeling better.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Goodbye, Franz.
You think he'll last till after mess?
- I don't think..
- Done for.
Boys, you go along.
I'll see you later.
Goodbye.
All right, Paul.
I'm sorry, Paul.
I wouldn't touch a thing of his if he could use it.
I'd go barefoot over barbed wire for him if it'd do him any good.
Only
- Only why should some orderly get those boots?
I understand, Mueller.
We're all alike out here.
And good boots are scarce.
Tell the doctor to come, please.
Doctor, the man in the next bed would like to see you, sir.
I've done everything I can for him.
There's no helping him.
Poor little fella.
He says next time, Franz.
Do you think I'll ever get well?
Why, of course.
- Do you really think so?
- Sure, once you get over the operation.
I don't think so.
Franz!
Don't talk nonsense.
Why, you'll be as good as new.
They fix up worse things than that.
Perhaps you'll go to the convalescent home... in Klosterberg among the villagers.
Then you can look out of the windows, across the fields... to the two trees on the horizon.
The loveliest time of the year now when the corn ripens.
You can go out without asking anyone.
You can even play piano if you want to.
Oh...
Oh, but, Franz, you must try to sleep now.
O God... this is Franz Kemmerick... only 19 years old.
He doesn't want to die.
Please don't let him die.
Paul.
- Paul.
- Franz.
Take my boots home for Mueller.
Oh, no, Franz, no.
And if...
Paul... you find my watch, send it home.
Franz!
Doctor.
Doctor!
Doctor!
Doctor!
Where's the doctor?
Why isn't there a doctor here?
- Doctor, come quick.
Franz Kemmerick is dying!
- Which one is that?
- Amputated leg.
- I've amputated a dozen legs today.
Bed 26, sir.
- You see to it.
I'm due in the operating room.
- One operation after another since 5.00 this morning.
Sixteen dead today, and yours is the 17th.
There'll probably be 20 by the morning.
You're lookin'good.
Very good today.
What's your hurry?
- Hey!
I'll bet he stole those boots!
- I got it, Kat.
- Hmm?
Listen; "The sum of an arithmetic series... is S
- A + L x N over 2."
- Interesting, isn't it?
- What do you wanna learn that stuff for?
One day you'll stop a bullet and it'll all be worthless.
- I get a lot of fun out of it.
- Aah!
My boots!
Mueller.
I saw him die.
I didn't know what it was like to die before.
And then..
then I came outside... and it felt..
it felt so good to be alive that I started in to walk fast.
I began to think of the strangest things... like being out in the fields.
Things like that.
You know.. girls.
And it felt as if there were... something electric running from the ground up through me.
And I started.
I began to run hard.
I passed soldiers and I heard voices calling to me.
I ran and I ran.
I felt as if I couldn't breathe enough air into me.
And...
And now I'm hungry.
I don't mind the war now.
Be a pleasure to go to the front in boots like these.
It's a good invention just the same.
If you crack each separate louse, think of all the energy you use up.
Watch.
Burned to death.
How was patrol?
Bad?
- Must've been terrible if they had time to gather the harvest.
We passed a cherry tree and when he saw it, he went crazy.
I could hardly drag him away.
It was... beautiful.
I have a big orchard with cherry trees at home.
When they're in full blossom... from the hayloft it looks like one single sheet.
So white.
- Perhaps you can get leave soon.
- You may even be sent back as a farmer.
A woman can't run a farm alone.
That's no good, you know?
No matter how hard she works.
Harvest coming on again.
What's the matter with him?
Got a letter yesterday from his wife.
He wants to get back to his farm.
We'd all like to get back home.
I wonder what we'd do if it were suddenly peacetime again?
Get drunk and look for women!
I'd go looking for a Cinderella... that could wear this for a garter.
And when I'd found her, nobody'd see me for two weeks.
I'll go back to the peat fields... and those pleasant hours in the beer gardens.
And there's worse things than cobbling too.
Look.
My family.
I oughta give you a kick in the backside for startin' all this.
It's all right for all you to talk.
You've got something to go back to:
wives, children, jobs.
But what about us?
What have we got to go back to?
- School?
- Why not?
You know everything already.
A man can't take all that rubbish they teach you seriously... after three years of shells and bombs.
You can't peel that off easily.
- They never taught us anything really useful... like how to light a cigarette in the wind or make a fire out of wet wood... or bayonet a man in the belly instead of the ribs where it gets jammed.
What can happen to us afterwards?
I'll tell ya.
Take our class.
Out of 20, three are officers... nine dead...
Mueller and three others wounded... and one in the madhouse.
We'll all be dead someday, so let's forget it.
Hurry up!
- Get in there!
Hurry up!
Himmelstoss!
What's up?
- What are you, crazy?
- It's Himmelstoss!
Himmelstoss?
There is justice in the army!
Well, well.
So, we are all here, huh?
- A bit longer than you, Himmie.
- Since when have we become so familiar?
Stand up and click your heels together!
All of you!
- Take a running jump at yourself!
- Who's your friend?
Would somebody get General Ludendorff a nice, comfortable chair?
- I command you as your superior officer!
- Do you want to be court-martialled?
- I do!
There's going to be a big attack tonight and I'd just love to get out of it.
Will you obey my orders?
Kiss my butt!
It isn't customary to ask for salutes here.
But I'll tell you what we'll do.
We're going to attack a town that we tried to take once before.
Many killed and many wounded.
It was great fun.
This time you're going with us.
If any of us stops a bullet, before we die... we're going to come to you, click our heels together and ask stiffly...
- "Please, Sergeant Himmelstoss, may we go?"
- You'll..
You'll pay for this, you...
There it is.
Right on time.
Better get ready, boys.
I'm wounded!
I'm wounded!
It's just a scratch, you yellow rat!
Up!
Get out with the others!
- Up!
- No!
No!
No!
You yellow rat!
Stinking yellow rat!
Let the others do it, eh?
Get up!
Get up!
- Aa-aah!
- Get up!
Forward!
- Get out here!
- Command... was forward.
Command was forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Counter-attack.
I want to help you.
Stop that!
Stop it, stop it.
I can bear the rest of it.
I can't listen to that!
Why do you take so long dying?
You're going to die anyway!
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
You won't die.
Oh, no.
You won't die.
They're only little wounds.
You'll get home.
You'll be all right.
You'll get home long before I will.
You know I can't run away.
That's why you accuse me.
I tell you, I didn't want to kill you.
I tried to keep you alive.
If you jumped in here again, I wouldn't do it.
When you jumped in here you were my enemy, and I was afraid of you.
But you'rejust a man like me, and I killed you.
Forgive me, comrade.
Say that for me.
Say you forgive me.
Oh, no.
You're dead.
You're better off than I am.
You're through.
They can't do any more to you now.
Oh, God, why did they do this to us?
We only wanted to live, you and I.
Why should they send us out to fight each other?
If we threw away these rifles and these uniforms... you could be my brother just like Kat and Albert.
You'll have to forgive me, comrade.
I'll do all I can.
I'll write to your parents.
I'll write to...
I'll write to your wife.
I'll write to her.
I promise she'll not want for anything.
I'll help her and your parents too.
Only forgive me.
Forgive me!
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Terrible thing happened yesterday.
I stabbed a man.
With my own hands, stabbed him.
I know how it is.
Your first time.
Never mind.
The stretcher-bearers will find him.
- He's dead.
I watched him die.
- You couldn't do anything about it.
We have to kill.
We can't help it.
That's what we are here for.
Uh...
Look there, for instance.
Hah!
That got him.
You should've seen how he leaped in the air.
That fellow had to shoot with us for today with three hits.
If he keeps it up, he'll have a decoration for his buttonhole this evening.
Don't you lose any more sleep over this business.
Maybe it was 'cause I was out there with him so long, huh?
Sure, that's it.
After all, war is war.
March!
Forward!
Forward, march!
Quick there!
Forward!
Company... halt!
Dismissed!
Uncommissioned officers, enlisted men... dismissed!
Hooray!
Come on!
Let's get outta here!
- Give me your best sausage.
- Two.
Give me a beer.
One, two, three!
Hey, come on.
A beer.
d De da de de de de d
Hey, get out of here!
Come on.
Give me a beer.
Oh, ho ho!
A beer.
One b...
Here's hoping we get falling-down drunk tonight.
Here's how it started.
I'd forgotten there were girls like that.
There aren't.
just look at those thin, little shoes.
She couldn't march many miles in those.
Paul!
Don't speak about marching.
You're boring the young lady.
A thousand pardons.
- How old do you think she is?
- Oh, about 22.
No, that'd make her older than us.
She's... 17.
A girl like that.
That'd be good, eh, Albert?
We wouldn't have much of a chance with him around.
- We could take a bath, wash our clothes...
- All right.
and I might even go so far as to get deloused.
Wait a minute!
She's a long way from here now.
Look at the date.
May, 1917.
- Four months ago.
- That's true.
Well, here's to her anyway.
Here's to 'em all, everywhere.
Albert...
- we might as well wash up anyway.
- All right.
Personally, I like 'em bigger around.
This conversation was on a high moral plane up to now.
Now we do need a bath.
- A bath?
- For what?
Hm.
You wouldn't understand.
This water is freezing.
This romantic business has gone too far.
- Ahh, but think of her beautiful eyes!
- Oh!
Oh, and her hair.
- Here we are!
- We're not gonna miss a thing!
- Go away!
- What are you doing here?
- Bathing!
They tell me there's some people in this world takes a bath every week!
Women!
Mademoiselle, you want to swim?
Mademoiselle!
Aw, baby!
Aw, no, girls!
Don't go away!
Aw, mama!
- Please don't go!
- Don't go away!
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!
Food!
Food!
Whoo-hoo!
Halt!
You know you're forbidden to cross.
You fellows stay on this side or you'll get yourselves in a lot of trouble.
What are they jabbering' about?
- They want us to swing over tonight.
They're expecting us.
- That's fine!
- We'll do it!
- That blonde's crazy about me.
- But there's four of us and only three of them.
- I was the one that stopped 'em!
That blonde piece of work is mine.
You three fight for what's left.
Fight's the word.
All's fair in love and war.
Huh?
What do you mean?
What're you gonna do?
You'll find out.
Au revoir!
Au revoir!
- C'est moi, blondie!
- Bon ami!
Bon ami!
Vos camarades!
Vos camarades!
Ooh!
She means the door.
Not only modest, but dashing!
A perfect fit.
It might've been made for me.
- An officer's coat.
We're calling distinguished company.
Ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Merci.
- Have another little drink, comrade.
Is this your birthday or mine?
Why?
You've been buying me drink after drink for two hours.
What I'm tryin' to figure out is why.
Why?
Oh!
Ha-ha!
Oh.
I-It's just that the boys... told me to amuse you for a little while.
Oh, nice boys.
Yeah!
They-They said you'd understand.
Ehh... heh.
Huh?
I've been betrayed!
Yeah, you certainly have.
Take that for a minute!
I'll give you more!
Ahh.
It's too loud.
Pauvre garçon.
Pauvre petit garçon.
- Darling.
- Quoi?
- What's your name?
Je ne comprends pas.
Name.
How do you say name?
Georgette?
Camille?
Oh, mon nom.
Suzanne.
Suzanne.
Et toi?
Quel est ton nom?
- Paul.
- Paul.
C'est un joli nom.
Suzanne, I wish I could tell you something.
- I wish you could understand.
- Oh, non, non.
Il faut pas...
Darling, I'll never see you again.
I know that.
And I wouldn't even know you if I did.
And yet, I'll remember you always.
Toujours.
Oh, if you could only know how different this is from the women we soldiers meet.
Oh, non, non, il faut tout oublier.
C'est cette guerre, cette terrible guerre!
No, no, no.
Not the war.
You.
That's what I'm talking about.
Vous.
It seems as though all war and terror and grossness... had fallen away from me... like a miracle.
Like something I never believed.
Pauvre garçon.
Pauvre garçon.
Call Paul.
We're going, Paul.
Have a look.
Nice, new coffins.
Huh!
For us.
I must say, that's a very cheerful preparation for this offensive.
That's very considerate of them.
But I don't see any long enough for our comrade Tjaden.
Mind you, I'm not speaking to you, you traitors.
- But no coffin's gonna get me.
- I should say not, heartbreaker.
You'll be thankful if they slip a waterproof sheet...
- around that Aunt Sally of a carcass of yours.
Oh-Oh, my side!
My side.
Catholic hospital, Albert.
They say you always get good food and good treatment.
- We're lucky.
- After that rainy dressing station... and 24 hours on the train, we deserve to have some luck.
I'm Hamacher.
Yeah, that's my name.
I got a crack in the head and they gave me a certificate stating...
"Josef Hamacher is periodically... not responsible for his actions. "
And ever since then, Hamacher has been having a grand time.
I hope you boys are not too badly wounded.
The others die off so quickly we don't have time to get acquainted.
You'll get to know us...
very well.
Thank you.
You too.
I'm sorry, my dear.
It's time to go now.
Yes, sister.
Watch.
If they take his clothes away, you've seen the last of him.
- See?
They're taking him to the dying room.
- Dying room?
When you're ready to kick the bucket, they get you out of the way so they can use the bed.
In the corner of the building there's a little room... right next to the morgue!
It's so convenient.
It saves a lot of trouble.
But suppose he gets well?
I've seen a lot of'em go in that dying room... but nobody ever comes back.
Sister.
Sister.
Sister.
Is that you ringing, Paul?
- Yes.
Is something going on?
- I think I have a haemorrhage.
The bandage is all wet.
I've been ringing forever and nobody comes.
I think I'm bleeding.
- Sister, get me a sterile dressing and an ice pack.
- Why didn't someone call me?
He's been ringing.
Nobody can walk, Sister.
Sister, is it bad?
- No.
No, we'll be all right.
We've got it in time.
What's the matter?
What are you doing?
We must rearrange your bandages.
Wh...
Where are you taking me?
To the bandaging ward.
- No, no!
I'm not going!
I'm staying here!
Paul!
Paul!
- Now, now!
- I'm not going to the dying room!
- We're going to the bandaging ward.
- Why are you taking my clothes?
You're lying to me!
But I'll come back.
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'm not going to die!
I'll come back!
Sister Libertine, how is he?
Poor boy.
They had to amputate his leg.
Paul.
Paul.
Paul.
Oh, he is... gone.
Gone.
Hello.
Welcome home, Albert!
- How do you feel, kid?
- All right.
But I've got such an awful pain.
My foot hur...
Hamacher.
Did they cut my leg off?
Of course not!
How many did you have?
Two?
You still got 'em!
One, two!
Don't play the fool, Hamacher.
Tell me truthfully.
Of course not.
And you look fine.
Look.
See?
I won't be a cripple.
- Now, now.
- I won't live like that!
- Be calm.
- I'll kill myself the first chance I get!
- Albert!
- I won't live!
I won't live!
- Yes, you will.
Albert!
Albert!
Albert, I've come back!
I told you I'd come back.
Look, everybody!
I've come back!
Paul!
Paul!
- That's not where I'm going.
I live over there.
Paul, I'm so happy.
Hamacher, I've come back from the dead!
It's most irregular.
Never happened before.
- Albert, get well quickly... so we can go home soon.
- Everything will be all right now.
- Yes, Paul.
Everything will be all right... now.
Oh!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul.
- What's the matter, Paul?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
Paul.
Give me your handkerchief.
- Mother?
- Here I am, Paul.
Here I am.
Mother's ill.
- Are you wounded?
- No, Mother.
I got leave.
Here I am cryin' instead of being glad.
Anna, get down the jar of blackberries.
You still like them, don't you?
Yes, Mother.
I haven't had any for a long time.
We might almost have known you were coming.
- I'm making potato cakes.
Don't let them burn.
Paul... sit down... beside me.
My Paul.
My baby.
I almost forgot, Mother.
I've got some little presents for you.
Look, Mother.
Bread, sausage and rice.
- Paul, you've been starving yourself.
- Hmm-mm.
Hadn't I better go and tell Father Paul's home?
- Paul could watch the things on the stove.
- No, I'm getting up.
Oh, Paul, you're a soldier now, aren't you?
But somehow, I don't seem to know you.
I'll take these off, Mother.
I'll get your suit.
It's in the wardrobe, just where you left it.
Are you really here, Paul?
You won't...
You won't disappear, will you?
No.
I'm here.
Your things are ready for you, Paul.
- I remember when you caught that one.
- Yes.
And you took it away from me, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
We're behind the lines, but we know how to honour the soldier... who goes on in spite of blood and death.
Gentlemen, my son.
- Prosit.
- Prosit.
I'm glad to know you, young man, I am glad to know you.
How are things out there?
Terrible, eh?
Terrible.
But we must carry on.
After all, you do at least get decent food out there.
Naturally, it's worse here.
Naturally.
But the best for our soldiers all the time.
That's our motto.
The best for our soldiers.
But...
- you must give the Frenchies a good licking!
And, if you boys want to come home, eh... let me show you what you must do before you can come home.
Give us a hand there, men.
Now, then, there's the line.
Runs so, in a "V".
Here is St Quentin.
You can see for yourself.
You're almost through now.
All right?
Shove ahead out there and don't stick to that everlasting trench warfare!
Smash through the johnnies!
And then you will have peace.
When you get in it... the war isn't the way it looks back here.
Oh!
You don't know anything about it.
Of course, you know about the details... but this relates to the whole!
You can't judge that.
Of course, you do your duty and you risk your life.
But for that, you receive the highest honour.
I said that every man in the war ought to have the Iron Cross.
First, the enemy lines must be broken through in Flanders.
- On to Paris!
Push on to Paris!
- Right.
No, not in Flanders.
I'll tell you just where the break should come.
- Here.
- The enemy has too many reserves there.
- I insist upon Flanders!
- Why should they do that... when they're halfway through St Quentin already?
Because Flanders is a flat country!
- No mountains, no obstructions!
- There's too many rivers there!
From the farms they have gone, from the schools, from the factories.
They have gone bravely, nobly, ever forward... realizing there is no other duty now but to save the fatherland.
Paul!
How are you, Paul?
Glad to see you, Professor.
You've come at the right moment, Baumer!
just at the right moment.
And as if to prove all I have said, here is one of the first to go.
A lad who sat before me on these very benches... who gave up all to serve in the first year of the war, one of the iron youth who have made Germany invincible in the field.
Look at him... sturdy and bronze and clear-eyed.
The kind of soldier every one of you should envy.
Oh, lad, you must speak to them.
You must tell them what it means to serve your fatherland.
- No, I can't tell them anything.
- You must, Paul.
just a word. just tell them how much they're needed out there.
Tell them why you went and what it meant to you.
I can't say anything.
You can remember some deed of heroism, some touch of nobility.
Tell about it.
I can't tell you anything you don't know.
We live in the trenches out there.
We fight.
We try not to be killed, sometimes we are.
That's all.
No.
No, Paul.
I've been there!
I know what it's like.
That's not what one dwells on, Paul.
I heard you in here reciting that same old stuff... making more iron men, more young heroes.
You still think it's beautiful and sweet to die for your country, don't you?
We used to think you knew.
The first bombardment taught us better.
It's dirty and painful to die for your country.
When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all!
There are millions out there dying for their countries, and what good is it?
Paul!
You asked me to tell them how much they're needed out there.
He tells you, "Go out and die. "
Oh, but if you'll pardon me, it's easier to say "Go out and die" than it is to do it.
Coward!
- And it's easier to say it than to watch it happen.
No!
No!
Boys, boys!
- I'm sorry, Baumer, but I must say..
- It's no use talking like this.
You won't know what I mean.
Only, it's been a long while since we enlisted out of this classroom.
So long I thought maybe the whole world had learned by this time.
Only now they're sending babies, and they won't last a week!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
Up at the front you're alive or you're dead, and that's all!
You can't fool anybody about that very long.
Up there we know we're lost and done for whether we're dead or alive.
Three years we've had of it..
four years.
Every day a year and every night a century.
Our bodies are earth and our thoughts are clay... and we sleep and eat with death.
We're done for because you can't live that way and keep anything inside you!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
I'll go back tomorrow.
I've got four days more, but I can't stand it here!
I'll go back tomorrow!
Sorry.
Mother, you'll catch cold here.
You must go to sleep.
There'll be plenty of time to sleep... when you're gone.
Must you go tomorrow, Paul?
Must you?
Yes, Mother.
Orders were changed.
Are you very much afraid, Paul?
No, Mother.
There's something I want to say to you, Paul.
It's... just be on your guard against the women out there.
They're no good.
Where we are, there aren't any women, Mother.
Be very careful at the front, Paul.
Yes, Mother, I will.
I'll pray for you every day.
And if you could, get a job that's not quite so dangerous.
Yes, Mother.
I'll try and get in the cookhouse.
- That can easily be done.
- You do it then, and if the others say anything-
That won't worry me, Mother.
Now, you must go to bed and you must get well quickly before I come back.
I put two sets of underwear..
new ones.. in your pack.
They'll keep you nice and warm.
They're all wool.
That's sweet of you.
Goodnight... my son.
Goodnight, Mother.
Oh, Mother, Mother.
You still think I'm a child.
Why can't I put my head in your lap and cry?
- Is this the 2nd Company?
- Yes, sir.
- Is this all of it?
- Yes, sir.
We had 150 men, but this is all that came back yesterday.
But now they're going to give us enough to make 150 again.
How old are you?
Sixteen.
No use.
I couldn't find anything.
We'll have to eat the sawdust.
Not me!
I'll go hungry first.
It makes me sick.
Now it's gonna be a real war again.
Paul!
How's old Paul?
Here I am.
You know, the 2nd Company's getting hard to find.
Nobody seemed to know where you were.
I'm glad you found it.
I guess I don't get much of this.
There used to be some food in the sawdust.
Now it's all sawdust.
No joke, either.
Eats ya up inside.
This doesn't look much like the old 2nd Company.
The replacements are all like that.
Not even old enough to carry a pack.
All they know how to do is die.
I guess... some of the old-timers are here yet.
Paul, they're tryin' to invent somethin' to kill me right now.
Where's Westhus?
Messenger dog was wounded.
He went out to get it.
- Is it true about the armistice?
- Doesn't look that way back there.
- You mean they want us to go on fighting?
- That's what they say.
They're crazy!
Germany'll be empty pretty soon.
Where is...
Where is Detering?
He got homesick.
You remember about the cherry blossoms?
I guess he never got over that.
He started out one night to go home and help his wife with the farm.
They got him behind the lines, and we never heard of him since.
He was just homesick, but probably they couldn't see it that way.
Where's Kat?
Is he...
Not Kat!
If he were out, the war would be over.
You remember what he always says:
They're savin' him for the last.
- Where is he?
- He's out lookin' for food, something to make soup with.
- Which way?
- Down the road about two miles that way.
I'll see you later.
Kat!
Paul!
Hello, Paul.
- How's the side?
- Oh, it's all right now.
It's fine.
Have any luck?
- No, the general's staff's been over this country with a rake.
Let's sit down there.
Tell me, Paul...
how was it at home?
Have a good leave?
- In spots.
- What's the matter?
Ohh...
I'm no good for back there any more, Kat.
None of us are.
We've been in this too long.
The young men thought I was a coward because I told them that... we learn that death is stronger than duty to one's country.
The old men said, "Go on.
Push on to Paris. "
My father even wanted me to wear my uniform around him.
It's not home back there any more.
All I could think of was, "I'd like to get back and see Kat again. "
You're all I've got left, Kat.
I'm not much to have left.
I missed you, Paul.
At least we know what it's all about out here.
There're no lies here.
Push on to Paris?
You ought to see what they've got on the other side.
They eat white bread over there.
They've got dozens of aeroplanes to our one... and tanks that'll go over anything.
What've we got left?
Guns so worn they drop shells on our own men.
No food, no ammunition, no officers.
Push on to Paris!
So that's the way they talk back there.
I guess we'd better be going.
How I lied to my poor mother.
I told her it wasn't so bad out here because there was always a lot of us together.
Now that I'm with you, I'm beginning to believe that I told her the truth.
Down!
That's another one that missed us.
Come on.
Let's go.
Wait a minute.
Looks like the old bread wagon's broke down.
- I guess I don't walk the rest of the way.
- Did that get ya, Kat?
Aah, I think it broke my shin.
That's not so bad.
Hold it together.
- just my luck, huh?
- Good luck.
That means the war is over.
Oh, no, sir!
This war don't end till they really get me.
Now this one...
- Aah.
- Easy, now.
- Hey!
- Easy!
Easy!
Come on.
I'll take you in.
Give me your hand.
Easy.
All right.
Well, kid...
now we're gonna be separated.
Maybe we can do something together later on when the war is over.
- Yes, kid.
- You give me your address, I'll give you mine.
You can't get both of us in one day.
Ah, we'll surely see each other again, Kat.
Remember that day when you brought the whole pig into the factory?
And that day in the woods when you taught us how to dodge shells?
And my first bombardment.
How I cried.
I was a young recruit then.
Here we are.
Here we are.
All right now, Kat.
You could've spared yourself the trouble.
He's dead.
Oh, no.
He's just fainted.
He was hit in the shin.
He's dead.
Would you like to take his pay book?
- You're not related, are you?
- No, we're not related.
Your deal.
Get his name and number?
Yeah, Corporal Stanislaus Katczinsky, 306.
Subtitles Boris J.
- Thirty thousand.
- From the Russians?
No, from the French.
From the Russians we capture more than that every day.
Mr Postman.
War is war and schnapps is schnapps, and business must go on.
You didn't leave the mail yet this morning.
Ah, I'm sorry, Mr Meyer.
Hello, Himmelstoss.
Anything for us today?
- No, no, Master Peter.
- Oh, there must be something.
Here, here you go, young rascal.
There.
This is the last mail I deliver anyhow.
- What?
- Tomorrow I change uniforms.
- You're going in the army?
- Yes, I was called.
I'm a sergeant in the reserves, you know.
I'll be called myself, if it doesn't end in a few months.
- It will, though.
- I'm sure you're right, Mr Meyer.
...defending our country, our fatherland.
Now, my beloved class, this is what we must do:
Strike with all our power.
Give every ounce of strength... to win victory before the end of the year.
It is with reluctance that I bring this subject up again.
You are the life of the fatherland, you boys.
You are the iron men of Germany.
You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy... when you are called upon to do so.
It is not for me to suggest that any of you... should stand up and offer to defend his country.
But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads.
I know that in one of the schools... the boys have risen up in the classroom... and enlisted in a mass.
But, of course, if such a thing should happen here... you would not blame me for a feeling of pride.
Perhaps some will say... that you should not be allowed to go yet... that you are too young, that you have homes, mothers, fathers... that you should not be torn away.
Are your fathers so forgetful of their fatherland... that they would let it perish rather than you?
Are your mothers so weak that they cannot send a son... to defend the land which gave them birth?
And after all, is a little experience... such a bad thing for a boy?
Is the honour of wearing a uniform... something from which we should run?
And if our young ladies glory in those who wear it... is that anything to be ashamed of?
I know you have never desired the adulation of heroes.
That has not been part of my teaching.
We have sought to make ourselves worthy... and let acclaim come when it would.
But to be foremost in battle... is a virtue not to be despised.
I believe it will be a quick war... that there will be few losses.
But if losses there must be... then let us remember the Latin phrase... which must have come to the lips of many a Roman... when he stood embattled in a foreign land:
"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."
"Sweet and fitting it is to die for the fatherland."
Some of you may have ambitions.
I know of one young man who has great promise as a writer... and he has written the first act of a tragedy... which would be a credit to one of the masters.
And he is dreaming, I suppose... of following in the footsteps of Goethe and Schiller... and I hope he will.
But now our country calls.
The fatherland needs leaders.
Personal ambition must be thrown aside... in the one great sacrifice for our country.
Here is a glorious beginning to your lives.
The field of honour calls you.
Why are we here?
You, Kropp, what has kept you back?
You, Mueller, you know how much you are needed?
Ah, I see you look at your leader.
And I, too, look to you, Paul Baumer... and I wonder what you are going to do.
- I'll go.
- I want to go.
- Count on me.
- Me too.
- I'm ready.
I'm not gonna stay home!
Follow me!
Enlist now!
- No more classes!
- No more classes!
- Don't be a quitter!
- Come on, Behn!
Stick together.
That's what we've got to do.
- Let's all stick together.
- Come on, Behn.
All right.
All right.
- I'll go.
- That's the way!
Let's go!
Hey!
Let's sing!
Come on!
Keep in line there, soldiers.
Anything you say, General.
Detail, halt!
Left face!
Get into uniform, ready to report.
Fall out!
I bet you a place like this gets you in good condition.
You have to be for the long marches.
I'm gonna get in the cavalry and ride.
No cavalry for me.
Infantry's where you see the fighting.
Where are all the guns?
That's what I want to know.
Oh, you don't get a gun for a long while yet.
If I'm gonna bump off the enemy, I gotta have some practise.
Ow!
Bayonet drill.
That's what I want.
Ah!
You won a medal that time, Mueller.
You wait.
In about a month I'll be covered with 'em.
Say, keep your boots out of my face!
Why, it's an honour to have those boots in your face.
They're the best pair in the army!
My uncle gave 'em to me.
Just look at that special imported leather.
Put 'em anyplace you like, except in my face.
Not even a kitchen maid'll look at me in this!
Attention!
Well, for the love of-- It's Himmelstoss!
- So it is.
- And all dressed up.
Hello, Himmie.
You didn't think you'd see me again so soon, did you?
- You see my rank?
- Sure.
Fall back, then!
- Himmelstoss, we certainly are glad to see you.
- What did you say?
- I was going to say--
- Never mind!
- What's the matter with you?
- When you address your superior officer, say "sir"!
- Where'd he get such a nice uniform?
- Any mail for us, Himmie?
- Quiet!
- My dear fellow, you're shouting.
Ah, come on, Himmelstoss.
We know ya.
Take off the false whiskers.
- I believe you mean it!
- You'll find out that I mean it.
- But only three days ago you were our postman.
- Silence!
Come back here!
Line up!
Line up!
Get in some kind of a line!
All of you!
Line up, I say!
Hmm.
What a pretty sight that is!
Have you never heard of standing in line?
You make a fine mess of it.
Well, I'll have to teach you.
We'll spend the whole day on it, huh?
You may be stupid, but I'm used to that.
And then there'll be plenty of other things too.
Oh, I'll not neglect you.
Hmm.
You're not much to begin with... but I'll do my best.
I see that we have come here with a slight misunderstanding... and we'll correct that, too, won't we, huh?
And the first thing to do is to forget everything you ever knew.
Everything you ever learned, forget!
See?
Forget what you've been and what you think you're going to be.
You're going to be soldiers, and that's all!
I'll take the mother's milk out of you!
I'll make you hard-boiled!
I'll make soldiers out of you or kill you!
Now... salute!
A-ten-hut!
Detachment...
lie down!
Down!
Head down!
Keep your head down, Baumer!
Detachment... get up!
Now sing!
Do you call that singing?
Detachment, halt!
So... we have no spirit, huh?
We are in no mood for recreation.
Work is what we want.
Good!
Then we'll go back to work!
Detachment, lie down!
Keep your head down!
Now sing!
Men... halt!
Order, arms!
Inspection at 3:00.
Dismissed!
Oh, that swine!
That means we get no time off.
It will take four hours to get ready for inspection.
- I'd like to know what's in his mind.
- He hasn't got any!
I'm gonna cut him open sometime and find out!
He's too thick-skinned.
He won't cut.
This is the fourth time he's made me disappoint that poor girl.
Arms!
Order, arms!
Left shoulder, arms!
Squad right.
To the right, march!
Left, left, left, left.
Column left, march!
Squad, left march!
Forward... march!
Detachment... halt!
Present arms!
Himmelstoss.
Excellent work.
They're going up front tomorrow.
- I recommend leave till midnight.
- Very good, sir.
Left, left, left.
Detachment...
lie down!
Crawl forward!
He spoilt our leave.
I'll never forgive him for that.
- The rat!
- Leave till midnight.
Hmm!
It'll take till midnight to dry our clothes.
There goes the filthy ape now.
While we slave over this mud, he goes off to have a few drinks!
Someday I'm going to take one smack at him--just one.
Me too.
That's gonna be my life's work from now on.
Why only one?
I'm gonna take several.
I might even kick him while he's down.
I feel mean.
What are you doing?
You're not going to desert, are you?
What?
Listen.
I've got an idea.
Lie down!
Crawl forward!
Lie down!
Crawl forward!
Oh!
What?
Ow!
Ow!
Cover!
Paul, you all right?
Behn!
Behn!
Behn!
Come on!
Behn, come on!
You fool!
Behn!
Get up!
Come on.
Sounds like more replacements coming in.
Yeah.
Tjaden must have gone home for that wood.
There's some more, fresh from the turnip patch.
I suppose this is where we bunk.
That's me, "I. Westhus,"
and this is where I live.
- I didn't know!
- Well, you know now!
Yes.
Yes, of course.
- It's all right.
- Here's a bunk, Paul.
- When did we eat last?
- Don't remind me.
- I was fine until you spoke.
- Where are we anyway?
I don't know.
The name on the railroad station's been shot off.
There must be something to eat somewhere.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll ask those fellas.
Sorry to disturb you, Mr Westhus.
Oh.
Meet Detering.
A better farmer never lived.
- And Mr Tjaden.
- Sit down.
You see, we haven't eaten since breakfast.
We thought maybe you could tell us what we ought to do about it.
Eat without further delay.
Well, what's funny about that?
This is a bad town to bring an appetite to, soldier.
We've been here since yesterday morning, living on baled hay and razor blades.
We're willing to buy our food.
Where's the canteen?
The only canteen in these regions is out looking for supplies.
- Ever hear of Katczinsky?
- Who?
Katczinsky.
He's uncanny.
If there's any food within 25 miles, he'll be the one to get it.
Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hup!
- Hup!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Attention!
- What is this?
- Volunteers for the future generals' staff.
Sometime I'm gonna take one of you volunteers apart... and find out what makes you leave school and join the army.
At ease.
This is no parade ground.
- Hungry?
- Yes.
Wait!
Wait a minute!
That's no invitation.
- Can you pay?
- Yeah, sure.
- I have some money.
No, not money.
That's just pieces of paper.
Have you got any cigarettes, cigars...
- or soap, cognac--
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Chewing tobacco?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Kat!
Are you crazy?
There ain't enough here for us.
I wish you three would get bumped off.
I'm tired of feeding ya for nothing.
Bring everything you got.
- I'm so hungry--
- I'd be glad to give you--
- Come on!
- Is this enough, sir?
- Kat!
- Hmm?
- You've got the wiring detail tonight.
- Where?
- Past the graveyard.
- With this bunch?
It's quiet tonight.
You can teach 'em a couple of things.
Thanks.
I'd rather do it alone.
- These babes get killed off too fast.
- Well, the lorry's waiting.
Last night I was too hungry to sleep... and tonight, when I get the wrinkles out of my gut, they think up wiring duty.
Well, here's your chance, heroes.
Come on, get your stuff and let's get out of here.
- Is that any way to drive?
- Let him drive any way he wants.
Suppose he breaks your arm.
You get sent home, don't you?
A lot better than havin' a hole in your guts.
If there's any of you left, I'll pick you up in the morning.
Well, if that ride you gave us didn't kill us, nothing will.
And be on time.
I don't want to miss my breakfast.
- Huh?
- You better wait for your army, Papa.
Here, here.
Don't be so backward.
Listen, children.
All we got to do is to string a little wire.
We pick it up at the dump and carry it to where we need it.
Now, you're gonna see some shell fire, and you're gonna be scared, see?
It's all right, boy.
Get up.
Here.
Never mind.
It's happened to better men than you, and it's happened to me.
When we come back, I'll get you all some nice clean underwear.
That kind of shell you don't have to pay much attention to.
Those big fellas just make a lot of noise and land about five miles behind the line.
The things we've got to watch out for are the light ones.
They don't give you much warning.
They go "waa-aa-aah zing."
And when you hear that, down!
Mother Earth.
Press yourselves down upon her.
Bury yourselves deep into her.
Just keep your eyes on me.
When you see me flop, you flop... only try to beat me to it.
Shh-shh.
Now listen.
I'll show you how it's done.
Give me a couple of those.
That's to kill the noise.
Tjaden.
See that?
- What's that mean?
- Bombardment.
My eyes!
I'm blind!
I can't see!
God!
My eyes!
I can't see!
- I can't see!
- It's Behn!
It's Behn!
- I'll go get him--
- You'll get killed!
- Let me--
- Lay down and stay there!
He's dead.
- He's dead!
- Why did you risk your life bringing' him in?
But it's Behn!
- My friend.
- He's a corpse, no matter who it is.
Now, don't any of you ever do that again.
Put him over there.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
All right, come on.
All right, come on.
Get your packs and fall in.
Hurry up!
Come on.
Hurry up.
Make it snappy.
Get your packs and fall in.
Kat, what are we doing?
What's happening?
You heard him.
Orders to march.
- But where to, for the love of--
- Another party.
And this one is gonna last a long time.
Come on.
Here we go.
Company, attention!
Shoulder arms!
March right, march!
Take your hands off that!
- Q
- Queen takes it!
- Well, if you think that's a queen, look again.
Ah, it's a jack.
- Yeah.
- Honest, these cards all look alike.
It's too noisy!
I can't play.
- I suppose your delicate nerves can't stand it.
- Get up!
That's Oscar.
The son of a--
Look at that!
Don't be so snooty.
You may wish you had this back.
About two more days of this... and this rat-bitten end of a piece of bread's gonna taste like a hunk of fruit cake.
It wouldn't-
- It wouldn't last two more days, would it?
Didn't I tell you this was gonna be a bad one?
I don't mind the days so much.
It's keeping up all night--
Ah, two more days makes a week, kid.
Then you can say you've been under fire!
You're not scared, are you?
No.
I was just asking.
That's all.
- Wanna play some more?
- Do you?
- Sure.
- All right.
My deal.
You better get your boot back before Oscar eats that!
The kid's all right.
Behn!
Behn.
Yeah, yeah.
Let him sleep.
He's dreamin'.
Oh, God.
Can't you see it's Behn?
He didn't want to come to war!
No, no.
It isn't Behn.
It isn't Behn!
It's Kemmerick!
It's me!
Shut up, will you?
It's bad enough in here as it is.
Every--
Everything's all right, Franz.
You're dreaming.
You're just dreaming, I guess.
- Attention!
- At ease.
The barrage is gettin' worse.
The men in two more dugouts gone.
However, we'll do our best to get some food up here by evening.
Stop!
Stop!
Let me out!
- What did you do that for?
- Shut up!
Grab him.
- No.
- Now hold him.
You all right now?
I think so.
I couldn't hold out much longer.
- Oh, God, it's Franz!
- Get him over there!
No, he's been hit in the stomach.
He can't have anything to drink.
Get a stretcher.
Where'd they get you, Kemmerick?
Oh.
- Here it is, sir.
- Take his head.
All right.
Take him out.
- Is it serious, sir?
- I'm not sure.
- Tell the others he's all right.
- Yes, sir.
If we're going to fight, why don't we fight?
Why don't we go over?
You could go crazy staying here.
Let's do something!
- Let's go after 'em!
- Sit down!
If that cook of ours had any guts, he'd try to bring something through.
He's so far behind the lines he can't hear the shooting!
- Here's Kat.
Get anything?
- Any luck?
- We'll have to split this up among us.
- Something to eat!
We need butter too.
Yes.
And dessert.
And a feather bed to sleep on.
- Rats!
- Rats!
- Rats!
Get out of the way!
- That's enough.
- That's enough, boys.
What's that?
Come on!
Grab your rifles!
Come on!
- Here they come.
- Get your grenades here.
Hurry up.
Come on, hurry up.
Let's go!
Let's go!
We can't hold this position.
Back to your own lines!
- Fill it up.
- And hurry up.
I've got other things to do.
I've been waiting for this for three weeks.
When they all get here.
What do you want?
Beans, you homely-lookin' son of a frog's leg.
- What do you think I want?
- We're hungry.
Shut up!
I'll feed you when you're all here.
- We're all here now.
- Only half the company's here.
Get the rest.
Wake 'em up.
I wish I could wake 'em up.
There's 80 of us left.
The rest is in dressing stations or pushing' up daisies.
Eighty?
And I cooked for 150!
All right.
We'll have enough for once.
Come on.
Dish out!
You mean you've cooked beans for 150... and you've got bread for 150... and sausage for 150, and tobacco for 150?
Everything!
It's all wrong.
I should have been notified.
What a feast!
Everyone gets two issues.
- Get back in line!
Get back in line!
- Oh, no!
That won't do.
I can't give 80 men what's meant for 150.
Listen.
You drew rations for the 2nd Company, didn't ya?
Yeah.
All right.
We're the 2nd Company.
I've got my orders.
- Kat's right.
- We're the 2nd Company.
And if only half of us get back, that's our good luck.
- Come on.
Dish it out.
- Come on!
- No!
- Hey!
You're the yellowest baboon that ever drew a cook wagon... and you're scared-- it shows.
All we want to hear out of you is one more little yip... and we'll cut ya up and eat ya raw.
Why, you keep your kitchen so far back of the lines... we never get anything to eat until it's cold and we're asleep!
Now, you low-down rat, get out... or we wreck the joint!
- Come on!
Give us--
- Attention!
At ease.
What's goin' on here?
He's cooked for 150, sir, and he only wants to give us half.
- Looks pretty good.
- Yes, sir.
- Serve the whole issue.
The men can use it.
- Yes, sir.
- And bring me a plate too.
- Yes, sir.
All right.
Take it all.
Take everything.
Give 'em honey.
Give 'em what they want.
- Fill it up!
- Fill it up!
- Don't mind me.
- Oh, that's all right.
Don't mention it.
You know...
I could do with some more beans.
Go help yourself.
There's more over there.
It's too far.
- I wonder, when are we going back to the front?
- Tomorrow.
It's enough to take away a man's appetite.
You know, if they're gonna march us in again tomorrow... we ought to go see how Kemmerick is.
- That's a good idea.
- Let's do that.
- How far is the dressing station?
- About two miles.
- We could take his things to him.
- Good.
It seemed rotten to think of a thing like that happening to him... a nice fellow like Kemmerick.
Ah, the French certainly deserve to be punished for starting this war.
Everybody says it's somebody else.
Well, how do they start a war?
Well, one country offends another.
How could one country offend another?
You mean there's a mountain over in Germany gets mad at a field over in France?
Well, stupid, one people offends another.
Oh, if that's it, I shouldn't be here at all.
I don't feel offended.
It don't apply to tramps like you.
Good.
Then I can be going home right away.
- Ah, you just try it.
- Yeah.
You wanna get shot?
The kaiser and me--
Me and the kaiser felt just alike about this war.
We didn't either of us want any war, so I'm going home.
- He's there already.
- Somebody must have wanted it.
Maybe it was the English.
No, I don't want to shoot any Englishmen.
I never saw one till I came up here.
And I suppose most of them never saw a German till they came up here.
- No, I'm sure they weren't asked about it.
- No.
Well... it must be doing somebody some good.
- Not me and the kaiser.
- I think maybe the kaiser wanted a war.
You leave us out of this!
I don't see that.
The kaiser's got everything he needs.
Well, he never had a war before.
Every full-grown emperor needs one war to make him famous.
- Why, that's history.
- Yeah, generals too.
They need war.
And manufacturers.
They get rich.
I think it's more a kind of fever.
Nobody wants it in particular... and then all at once, there it is.
We didn't want it.
The English didn't want it.
And here we are fighting.
I'll tell you how it should all be done.
Whenever there's a big war comin' on...
- you should rope off a big field--
- And sell tickets.
Yeah.
And--
And on the big day... you should take all the kings and their cabinets and their generals... put them in the centre dressed in their underpants... and let 'em fight it out with clubs.
The best country wins.
Well, now that Kat's settled everything, let's go see Kemmerick.
- Something interesting might happen on the way.
- Might cheer him up.
Boys, me and the kaiser want you back in time to march tomorrow.
Don't forget.
- We'll be back.
- Give the boy my regards.
There he is.
- Hello, Kemmerick.
- How are ya?
- How's it going?
- How are things going?
- Are they looking after you all right?
How are they treating you?
Franz?
They're robbers here.
Robbers.
They stole my watch!
I always told you, nobody should carry as good a watch as that.
- They took it while I was under ether!
- Franz, you'll get it back.
Do you feel all right?
- Just look at my hand.
- That's because you lost so much blood.
- Just eat decently and you'll get well again.
- Oh, no.
You must eat.
That's the main thing.
It looks good too.
I have such a terrible pain in my foot.
Every toe on my right foot hurts.
Well, how can your foot hurt when your leg's been--
I know what you mean!
I know!
I know now!
They cut my leg off.
Why didn't they tell me?
Why-
- Why didn't they tell me?
- Franz!
Franz!
- Now I can't walk any more!
You must be thankful that you've come off with only that.
I wanted to be a forester once.
You can yet.
They make artificial legs that are wonderful.
And you're through too.
You can go home.
Think of that.
We brought your things for you.
See?
Put 'em under the bed.
That's a marvellous pair of boots.
Look at that leather!
What comfort.
I was just thinking.
If you're not going to be using these, Franz, why don't you leave 'em with us?
What good are they to you?
I can use 'em.
My boots give me blister after blister--
Well, we'll be going, Franz.
Oh, don't go.
Stay just a little while longer.
- I'll come right back.
- We'll be coming soon again, Franz.
- I know you'll be feeling better.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Goodbye, Franz.
You think he'll last till after mess?
- I don't think--
- Done for.
Boys, you go along.
I'll see you later.
Goodbye.
All right, Paul.
I'm sorry, Paul.
I wouldn't touch a thing of his if he could use it.
I'd go barefoot over barbed wire for him if it'd do him any good.
Only-
- Only why should some orderly get those boots?
I understand, Mueller.
We're all alike out here.
And good boots are scarce.
Tell the doctor to come, please.
Doctor, the man in the next bed would like to see you, sir.
I've done everything I can for him.
There's no helping him.
Poor little fella.
He says next time, Franz.
Do you think I'll ever get well?
Why, of course.
- Do you really think so?
- Sure, once you get over the operation.
I don't think so.
Franz!
Don't talk nonsense.
Why, you'll be as good as new.
They fix up worse things than that.
Perhaps you'll go to the convalescent home... in Klosterberg among the villagers.
Then you can look out of the windows, across the fields... to the two trees on the horizon.
The loveliest time of the year now when the corn ripens.
You can go out without asking anyone.
You can even play piano if you want to.
Oh-
- Oh, but, Franz, you must try to sleep now.
O God... this is Franz Kemmerick... only 19 years old.
He doesn't want to die.
Please don't let him die.
Paul.
- Paul.
- Franz.
Take my boots home for Mueller.
Oh, no, Franz, no.
And if...
Paul... you find my watch, send it home.
Franz!
Doctor.
Doctor!
Doctor!
Doctor!
Where's the doctor?
Why isn't there a doctor here?
- Doctor, come quick.
Franz Kemmerick is dying!
- Which one is that?
- Amputated leg.
- I've amputated a dozen legs today.
- Bed 26, sir.
- You see to it.
I'm due in the operating room.
One operation after another since 5:00 this morning.
Sixteen dead today, and yours is the 17th.
There'll probably be 20 by the morning.
You're lookin' good.
Very good today.
What's your hurry?
Hey!
I'll bet he stole those boots!
- I got it, Kat.
- Hmm?
"The sum of an arithmetic series... is S = A + L x N over 2."
- Interesting, isn't it?
- What do you wanna learn that stuff for?
One day you'll stop a bullet and it'll all be worthless.
- I get a lot of fun out of it.
- Aah!
My boots!
Mueller.
I saw him die.
I didn't know what it was like to die before.
And then-- then I came outside... and it felt-- it felt so good to be alive that I started in to walk fast.
I began to think of the strangest things... like being out in the fields.
Things like that.
You know-- girls.
And it felt as if there were... something electric running from the ground up through me.
And I started.
I began to run hard.
I passed soldiers and I heard voices calling to me.
I ran and I ran.
I felt as if I couldn't breathe enough air into me.
And-- And now I'm hungry.
I don't mind the war now.
Be a pleasure to go to the front in boots like these.
It's a good invention just the same.
If you crack each separate louse, think of all the energy you use up.
Watch.
Burned to death.
- How was patrol?
Bad?
- Must've been terrible if they had time to gather the harvest.
We passed a cherry tree and when he saw it, he went crazy.
I could hardly drag him away.
It was... beautiful.
I have a big orchard with cherry trees at home.
When they're in full blossom... from the hayloft it looks like one single sheet.
So white.
- Perhaps you can get leave soon.
- You may even be sent back as a farmer.
A woman can't run a farm alone.
That's no good, you know?
No matter how hard she works.
Harvest coming on again.
What's the matter with him?
Got a letter yesterday from his wife.
He wants to get back to his farm.
We'd all like to get back home.
I wonder what we'd do if it were suddenly peacetime again?
Get drunk and look for women!
I'd go looking for a Cinderella... that could wear this for a garter.
And when I'd found her, nobody'd see me for two weeks.
I'll go back to the peat fields... and those pleasant hours in the beer gardens.
And there's worse things than cobbling too.
Look.
My family.
I oughta give you a kick in the backside for startin' all this.
It's all right for all you to talk.
You've got something to go back to:
wives, children, jobs.
But what about us?
What have we got to go back to?
- School?
- Why not?
You know everything already.
A man can't take all that rubbish they teach you seriously... after three years of shells and bombs.
- You can't peel that off easily.
- They never taught us anything really useful... like how to light a cigarette in the wind or make a fire out of wet wood... or bayonet a man in the belly instead of the ribs where it gets jammed.
What can happen to us afterwards?
I'll tell ya.
Take our class.
Out of 20, three are officers... nine dead...
Mueller and three others wounded... and one in the madhouse.
We'll all be dead someday, so let's forget it.
Hurry up!
Get in there!
Hurry up!
Himmelstoss!
What's up?
- What are you, crazy?
- It's Himmelstoss!
Himmelstoss?
There is justice in the army!
Well, well.
So, we are all here, huh?
- A bit longer than you, Himmie.
- Since when have we become so familiar?
Stand up and click your heels together!
All of you!
Take a running jump at yourself!
- Who's your friend?
Would somebody get General Ludendorff a nice, comfortable chair?
I command you as your superior officer!
- Do you want to be court-martialled?
- I do!
There's going to be a big attack tonight and I'd just love to get out of it.
Will you obey my orders?
Kiss my butt!
It isn't customary to ask for salutes here.
But I'll tell you what we'll do.
We're going to attack a town that we tried to take once before.
Many killed and many wounded.
It was great fun.
This time you're going with us.
If any of us stops a bullet, before we die... we're going to come to you, click our heels together and ask stiffly...
- "Please, Sergeant Himmelstoss, may we go?"
- You'll--
You'll pay for this, you--
There it is.
Right on time.
Better get ready, boys.
I'm wounded!
I'm wounded!
It's just a scratch, you yellow rat!
Up!
Get out with the others!
- Up!
- No!
No!
No!
You yellow rat!
Stinking yellow rat!
Let the others do it, eh?
Get up!
Get up!
- Aa-aah!
- Get up!
Forward!
- Get out here!
- Command... was forward.
Command was forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Counter-attack.
I want to help you.
I want to help you.
Stop that!
Stop it, stop it.
I can bear the rest of it.
I can't listen to that!
Why do you take so long dying?
You're going to die anyway!
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
You won't die.
Oh, no.
You won't die.
They're only little wounds.
You'll get home.
You'll be all right.
You'll get home long before I will.
You know I can't run away.
That's why you accuse me.
I tell you, I didn't want to kill you.
I tried to keep you alive.
If you jumped in here again, I wouldn't do it.
When you jumped in here you were my enemy, and I was afraid of you.
But you'rejust a man like me, and I killed you.
Forgive me, comrade.
Say that for me.
Say you forgive me.
Oh, no.
You're dead.
You're better off than I am.
You're through.
They can't do any more to you now.
Oh, God, why did they do this to us?
We only wanted to live, you and I.
Why should they send us out to fight each other?
If we threw away these rifles and these uniforms... you could be my brother just like Kat and Albert.
You'll have to forgive me, comrade.
I'll do all I can.
I'll write to your parents.
I'll write to--
I'll write to your wife.
I'll write to her.
I promise she'll not want for anything.
I'll help her and your parents too.
Only forgive me.
Forgive me!
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Terrible thing happened yesterday.
I stabbed a man.
With my own hands, stabbed him.
I know how it is.
Your first time.
Never mind.
The stretcher-bearers will find him.
- He's dead.
I watched him die.
- You couldn't do anything about it.
We have to kill.
We can't help it.
That's what we are here for.
Uh-
- Look there, for instance.
Hah!
That got him.
You should've seen how he leaped in the air.
That fellow had to shoot with us for today with three hits.
If he keeps it up, he'll have a decoration for his buttonhole this evening.
Don't you lose any more sleep over this business.
Maybe it was 'cause I was out there with him so long, huh?
Sure, that's it.
After all, war is war.
March!
Forward!
Forward, march!
Quick there!
Forward!
Company... halt!
Dismissed!
Uncommissioned officers, enlisted men... dismissed!
Hooray!
Come on!
Let's get outta here!
- Give me your best sausage.
- Two.
Give me a beer.
One, two, three!
Hey, come on.
A beer.
∮ De da de de de de ∮
Hey, get out of here!
Come on.
Give me a beer.
Oh, ho ho!
A beer.
One b--
Here's hoping we get falling-down drunk tonight.
Here's how it started.
I'd forgotten there were girls like that.
There aren't.
Just look at those thin, little shoes.
She couldn't march many miles in those.
Paul!
Don't speak about marching.
You're boring the young lady.
A thousand pardons.
- How old do you think she is?
- Oh, about 22.
No, that'd make her older than us.
She's... 17.
A girl like that.
That'd be good, eh, Albert?
We wouldn't have much of a chance with him around.
- We could take a bath, wash our clothes--
- All right.
and I might even go so far as to get deloused.
Wait a minute!
She's a long way from here now.
Look at the date.
May, 1917.
- Four months ago.
- That's true.
Well, here's to her anyway.
Here's to 'em all, everywhere.
Albert...
- we might as well wash up anyway.
- All right.
Personally, I like 'em bigger around.
This conversation was on a high moral plane up to now.
Now we do need a bath.
- A bath?
- For what?
Hm.
You wouldn't understand.
This water is freezing.
This romantic business has gone too far.
- Ahh, but think of her beautiful eyes!
- Oh!
Oh, and her hair.
- Here we are!
- We're not gonna miss a thing!
- Go away!
- What are you doing here?
- Bathing!
They tell me there's some people in this world takes a bath every week!
Women!
Mademoiselle, you want to swim?
Aw, baby!
Aw, no, girls!
Don't go away!
Aw, mama!
- Please don't go!
- Don't go away!
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!
Food!
Food!
Whoo-hoo!
Halt!
You know you're forbidden to cross.
You fellows stay on this side or you'll get yourselves in a lot of trouble.
- What are they jabbering' about?
- They want us to swing over tonight.
They're expecting us.
- That's fine!
- We'll do it!
- That blonde's crazy about me.
- But there's four of us and only three of them.
- I was the one that stopped 'em!
That blonde piece of work is mine.
You three fight for what's left.
Fight's the word.
all's fair in love and war.
Huh?
What do you mean?
What're you gonna do?
You'll find out.
Au revoir!
Au revoir!
- C'est moi, blondie!
- Bon ami!
Bon ami!
Vos camarades!
Vos camarades!
Ooh!
She means the door.
Not only modest, but dashing!
A perfect fit.
- It might've been made for me.
- An officer's coat.
We're calling distinguished company.
Ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Merci.
Have another little drink, comrade.
Is this your birthday or mine?
Why?
You've been buying me drink after drink for two hours.
What I'm tryin' to figure out is why.
Why?
Why?
Oh!
Ha-ha!
Oh.
I-It's just that the boys... told me to amuse you for a little while.
Oh, nice boys.
Yeah!
They-They said you'd understand.
Ehh... heh.
Huh?
I've been betrayed!
Yeah, you certainly have.
Take that for a minute!
I'll give you more!
Ahh.
It's too loud.
Pauvre garcon.
Pauvre petit garcon.
- Darling.
- Quoi?
- What's your name?
- Je ne comprends pas.
Name.
How do you say name?
Georgette?
Camille?
Oh, mon nom.
Suzanne.
Suzanne.
Et toi?
Quel est ton nom?
- Paul.
- Paul.
C'est un joli nom.
Suzanne, I wish I could tell you something.
- I wish you could understand.
- Oh, non, non. I faut pas--
Darling, I'll never see you again.
I know that.
And I wouldn't even know you if I did.
And yet, I'll remember you always.
Toujours.
Oh, if you could only know how different this is from the women we soldiers meet.
Oh, non, non, I faut tout oublier.
C'est cette guerre, cette terrible guerre!
No, no, no.
Not the war.
You.
That's what I'm talking about.
Vous.
It seems as though all war and terror and grossness... had fallen away from me... like a miracle.
Like something I never believed.
Pauvre garcon.
Pauvre garcon.
Call Paul.
We're going, Paul.
Have a look.
Nice, new coffins.
Huh!
For us.
I must say, that's a very cheerful preparation for this offensive.
That's very considerate of them.
But I don't see any long enough for our comrade Tjaden.
Mind you, I'm not speaking to you, you traitors.
- But no coffin's gonna get me.
- I should say not, heartbreaker.
You'll be thankful if they slip a waterproof sheet... around that Aunt Sally of a carcass of yours.
Oh-Oh, my side!
My side.
Catholic hospital, Albert.
They say you always get good food and good treatment.
- We're lucky.
- After that rainy dressing station... and 24 hours on the train, we deserve to have some luck.
I'm Hamacher.
Yeah, that's my name.
I got a crack in the head and they gave me a certificate stating...
"Josef Hamacher is periodically... not responsible for his actions."
And ever since then, Hamacher has been having a grand time.
I hope you boys are not too badly wounded.
The others die off so quickly we don't have time to get acquainted.
You'll get to know us...
very well.
Thank you.
You too.
I'm sorry, my dear.
It's time to go now.
Yes, sister.
Watch.
If they take his clothes away, you've seen the last of him.
- See?
They're taking him to the dying room.
- Dying room?
When you're ready to kick the bucket, they get you out of the way so they can use the bed.
In the corner of the building there's a little room... right next to the morgue!
It's so convenient.
It saves a lot of trouble.
But suppose he gets well?
I've seen a lot of'em go in that dying room... but nobody ever comes back.
Sister.
Sister.
Sister.
- Is that you ringing, Paul?
- Yes.
- Is something going on?
- I think I have a haemorrhage.
The bandage is all wet.
I've been ringing forever and nobody comes.
- I think I'm bleeding.
- Sister, get me a sterile dressing and an ice pack.
- Why didn't someone call me?
- He's been ringing.
Nobody can walk, Sister.
- Sister, is it bad?
- No.
No, we'll be all right.
We've got it in time.
What's the matter?
What are you doing?
We must rearrange your bandages.
Wh-
- Where are you taking me?
To the bandaging ward.
- No, no!
I'm not going!
I'm staying here!
- Paul!
Paul!
- Now, now!
- I'm not going to the dying room!
- We're going to the bandaging ward.
- Why are you taking my clothes?
You're lying to me!
But I'll come back.
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'm not going to die!
I'll come back!
Sister Libertine, how is he?
Poor boy.
They had to amputate his leg.
Paul.
Paul.
Paul.
Oh, he is... gone.
Gone.
Hello.
Welcome home, Albert!
- How do you feel, kid?
- All right.
But I've got such an awful pain.
My foot hur--
Hamacher.
Did they cut my leg off?
Of course not!
How many did you have?
Two?
You still got 'em!
One, two!
Don't play the fool, Hamacher.
Tell me truthfully.
Of course not.
And you look fine.
Look.
See?
- I won't be a cripple.
- Now, now.
- I won't live like that!
- Be calm.
- I'll kill myself the first chance I get!
- Albert!
- I won't live!
I won't live!
- Yes, you will.
Albert!
Albert!
Albert, I've come back!
I told you I'd come back.
Look, everybody!
I've come back!
Paul!
Paul!
- That's not where I'm going.
I live over there.
Paul, I'm so happy.
Hamacher, I've come back from the dead!
- It's most irregular.
Never happened before.
- Albert, get well quickly... so we can go home soon.
- Everything will be all right now.
- Yes, Paul.
Everything will be all right... now.
Oh!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul.
- What's the matter, Paul?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
Paul.
Give me your handkerchief.
- Mother?
- Here I am, Paul.
Here I am.
Mother's ill.
- Are you wounded?
- No, Mother.
I got leave.
Here I am cryin' instead of being glad.
Anna, get down the jar of blackberries.
You still like them, don't you?
Yes, Mother.
I haven't had any for a long time.
We might almost have known you were coming.
- I'm making potato cakes.
- Don't let them burn.
Paul... sit down... beside me.
My Paul.
My baby.
I almost forgot, Mother.
I've got some little presents for you.
Look, Mother.
Bread, sausage and rice.
- Paul, you've been starving yourself.
- Hmm-mm.
Hadn't I better go and tell Father paul's home?
- Paul could watch the things on the stove.
- No, I'm getting up.
Oh, Paul, you're a soldier now, aren't you?
But somehow, I don't seem to know you.
I'll take these off, Mother.
I'll get your suit.
It's in the wardrobe, just where you left it.
Are you really here, Paul?
You won't--
You won't disappear, will you?
No.
I'm here.
Your things are ready for you, Paul.
- I remember when you caught that one.
- Yes.
And you took it away from me, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
We're behind the lines, but we know how to honour the soldier... who goes on in spite of blood and death.
Gentlemen, my son.
- Prosit.
- Prosit.
I'm glad to know you, young man, I am glad to know you.
How are things out there?
Terrible, eh?
Terrible.
But we must carry on.
After all, you do at least get decent food out there.
Naturally, it's worse here.
Naturally.
But the best for our soldiers all the time.
That's our motto.
The best for our soldiers.
But... you must give the Frenchies a good licking!
And, if you boys want to come home, eh... let me show you what you must do before you can come home.
Give us a hand there, men.
Now, then, there's the line.
Runs so, in a "V".
Here is St Quentin.
You can see for yourself.
You're almost through now.
All right?
Shove ahead out there and don't stick to that everlasting trench warfare!
Smash through the johnnies!
And then you will have peace.
When you get in it... the war isn't the way it looks back here.
Oh!
You don't know anything about it.
Of course, you know about the details... but this relates to the whole!
You can't judge that.
Of course, you do your duty and you risk your life.
But for that, you receive the highest honour.
I said that every man in the war ought to have the lron Cross.
First, the enemy lines must be broken through in Flanders.
- On to Paris!
Push on to Paris!
- Right.
No, not in Flanders.
I'll tell you just where the break should come.
- Here.
- The enemy has too many reserves there.
- I insist upon Flanders!
- Why should they do that... when they're halfway through St Quentin already?
Because Flanders is a flat country!
- No mountains, no obstructions!
- There's too many rivers there!
From the farms they have gone;
from the schools, from the factories.
They have gone bravely, nobly, ever forward... realizing there is no other duty now but to save the fatherland.
Paul!
How are you, Paul?
Glad to see you, Professor.
You've come at the right moment, Baumer!
Just at the right moment.
And as if to prove all I have said, here is one of the first to go.
A lad who sat before me on these very benches... who gave up all to serve in the first year of the war;
one of the iron youth who have made Germany invincible in the field.
Look at him-- sturdy and bronze and clear-eyed.
The kind of soldier every one of you should envy.
Oh, lad, you must speak to them.
You must tell them what it means to serve your fatherland.
- No, I can't tell them anything.
- You must, Paul.
Just a word.Just tell them how much they're needed out there.
Tell them why you went and what it meant to you.
I can't say anything.
You can remember some deed of heroism, some touch of nobility.
Tell about it.
I can't tell you anything you don't know.
We live in the trenches out there.
We fight.
We try not to be killed;
sometimes we are.
That's all.
No.
No, Paul.
I've been there!
I know what it's like.
That's not what one dwells on, Paul.
I heard you in here reciting that same old stuff... making more iron men, more young heroes.
You still think it's beautiful and sweet to die for your country, don't you?
We used to think you knew.
The first bombardment taught us better.
It's dirty and painful to die for your country.
When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all!
There are millions out there dying for their countries, and what good is it?
Paul!
You asked me to tell them how much they're needed out there.
He tells you, "Go out and die."
Oh, but if you'll pardon me, it's easier to say "Go out and die" than it is to do it.
Coward!
- And it's easier to say it than to watch it happen.
No!
No!
Boys, boys!
- I'm sorry, Baumer, but I must say--
- It's no use talking like this.
You won't know what I mean.
Only, it's been a long while since we enlisted out of this classroom.
So long I thought maybe the whole world had learned by this time.
Only now they're sending babies, and they won't last a week!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
Up at the front you're alive or you're dead, and that's all!
You can't fool anybody about that very long.
Up there we know we're lost and done for whether we're dead or alive.
Three years we've had of it-- four years.
Every day a year and every night a century.
Our bodies are earth and our thoughts are clay... and we sleep and eat with death.
We're done for because you can't live that way and keep anything inside you!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
I'll go back tomorrow.
I've got four days more, but I can't stand it here!
I'll go back tomorrow!
Sorry.
Mother, you'll catch cold here.
You must go to sleep.
There'll be plenty of time to sleep... when you're gone.
Must you go tomorrow, Paul?
Must you?
Yes, Mother.
Orders were changed.
Are you very much afraid, Paul?
No, Mother.
There's something I want to say to you, Paul.
It's--
Just be on your guard against the women out there.
They're no good.
Where we are, there aren't any women, Mother.
Be very careful at the front, Paul.
Yes, Mother, I will.
I'll pray for you every day.
And if you could, get a job that's not quite so dangerous.
Yes, Mother.
I'll try and get in the cookhouse.
- That can easily be done.
- You do it then, and if the others say anything--
That won't worry me, Mother.
Now, you must go to bed and you must get well quickly before I come back.
I put two sets of underwear-- new ones-- in your pack.
They'll keep you nice and warm.
They're all wool.
That's sweet of you.
Goodnight... my son.
Goodnight, Mother.
Oh, Mother, Mother.
You still think I'm a child.
Why can't I put my head in your lap and cry?
- Is this the 2nd Company?
- Yes, sir.
- Is this all of it?
- Yes, sir.
We had 150 men, but this is all that came back yesterday.
But now they're going to give us enough to make 150 again.
How old are you?
Sixteen.
No use.
I couldn't find anything.
We'll have to eat the sawdust.
Not me!
I'll go hungry first.
It makes me sick.
Now it's gonna be a real war again.
Paul!
How's old Paul?
Here I am.
You know, the 2nd Company's getting hard to find.
Nobody seemed to know where you were.
I'm glad you found it.
I guess I don't get much of this.
There used to be some food in the sawdust.
Now it's all sawdust.
No joke, either.
Eats ya up inside.
This doesn't look much like the old 2nd Company.
The replacements are all like that.
Not even old enough to carry a pack.
All they know how to do is die.
I guess... some of the old-timers are here yet.
Paul, they're tryin' to invent somethin' to kill me right now.
Where's Westhus?
Messenger dog was wounded.
He went out to get it.
- Is it true about the armistice?
- Doesn't look that way back there.
- You mean they want us to go on fighting?
- That's what they say.
They're crazy!
Germany'll be empty pretty soon.
Where is-- Where is Detering?
He got homesick.
You remember about the cherry blossoms?
I guess he never got over that.
He started out one night to go home and help his wife with the farm.
They got him behind the lines, and we never heard of him since.
He was just homesick, but probably they couldn't see it that way.
Where's Kat?
Is he--
Not Kat!
If he were out, the war would be over.
They're savin' him for the last.
- Where is he?
- He's out lookin' for food, something to make soup with.
- Which way?
- Down the road about two miles that way.
I'll see you later.
Kat!
Paul!
Hello, Paul.
- How's the side?
- Oh, it's all right now.
It's fine.
- Have any luck?
- No, the general's staff's been over this country with a rake.
Let's sit down there.
Tell me, Paul...
how was it at home?
Have a good leave?
- In spots.
- What's the matter?
Ohh...
I'm no good for back there any more, Kat.
None of us are.
We've been in this too long.
The young men thought I was a coward because I told them that... we learn that death is stronger than duty to one's country.
The old men said, "Go on.
Push on to Paris."
My father even wanted me to wear my uniform around him.
It's not home back there any more.
All I could think of was, "I'd like to get back and see Kat again."
You're all I've got left, Kat.
I'm not much to have left.
I missed you, Paul.
At least we know what it's all about out here.
There're no lies here.
Push on to Paris?
You ought to see what they've got on the other side.
They eat white bread over there.
They've got dozens of aeroplanes to our one... and tanks that'll go over anything.
What've we got left?
Guns so worn they drop shells on our own men.
No food, no ammunition, no officers.
Push on to Paris!
So that's the way they talk back there.
I guess we'd better be going.
How I lied to my poor mother.
I told her it wasn't so bad out here because there was always a lot of us together.
Now that I'm with you, I'm beginning to believe that I told her the truth.
Down!
That's another one that missed us.
Come on.
Let's go.
Wait a minute.
Looks like the old bread wagon's broke down.
- I guess I don't walk the rest of the way.
- Did that get ya, Kat?
Aah, I think it broke my shin.
That's not so bad.
Hold it together.
- Just my luck, huh?
- Good luck.
That means the war is over.
Oh, no, sir!
This war don't end till they really get me.
Now this one--
- Aah.
- Easy, now.
- Hey!
- Easy!
Easy!
Come on.
I'll take you in.
Give me your hand.
Easy.
All right.
Well, kid...
now we're gonna be separated.
Maybe we can do something together later on when the war is over.
- Yes, kid.
- You give me your address, I'll give you mine.
You can't get both of us in one day.
Ah, we'll surely see each other again, Kat.
Remember that day when you brought the whole pig into the factory?
And that day in the woods when you taught us how to dodge shells?
And my first bombardment.
How I cried.
I was a young recruit then.
Here we are.
Here we are.
All right now, Kat.
You could've spared yourself the trouble.
He's dead.
Oh, no.
He's just fainted.
He was hit in the shin.
He's dead.
Would you like to take his pay book?
- You're not related, are you?
- No, we're not related.
Your deal.
Get his name and number?
Yeah, Corporal Stanislaus Katczinsky, 306.
- Thirty thousand.
- From the Russians?
No, from the French.
From the Russians we capture more than that every day.
Mr. Postman.
War is war and schnapps is schnapps, and business must go on.
You didn't leave the mail yet this morning.
Ah, I'm sorry, Mr. Meyer.
Hello, Himmelstoss.
Anything for us today?
- No, no, Master Peter.
- Oh, there must be something.
Here, here you go, young lad.
There.
This is the last mail I deliver anyhow.
- What?
- Tomorrow I change uniforms.
- You're going in the army?
- Yes, I was called.
I'm a sergeant in the reserves, you know.
I'll be called myself, if it doesn't end in a few months.
- It will, though.
- I'm sure you're right, Mr. Meyer.
...defending our country, our fatherland.
Now, my beloved class, this is what we must do:
Strike with all our power.
Give every ounce of strength... to win victory before the end of the year.
It is with reluctance that I bring this subject up again.
You are the life of the fatherland, you boys.
You are the iron men of Germany.
You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy... when you are called upon to do so.
It is not for me to suggest that any of you... should stand up and offer to defend his country.
But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads.
I know that in one of the schools, the boys have risen up in the classroom... and enlisted in a mass.
But, of course, if such a thing should happen here, you would not blame me for a feeling of pride.
Perhaps some will say... that you should not be allowed to go yet, that you are too young, that you have homes, mothers, fathers, that you should not be torn away.
Are your fathers so forgetful of their fatherland... that they would let it perish rather than you?
Are your mothers so weak that they cannot send a son... to defend the land which gave them birth?
And after all, is a little experience... such a bad thing for a boy?
Is the honor of wearing a uniform... something from which we should run?
And if our young ladies glory in those who wear it, is that anything to be ashamed of?
I know you have never desired the adulation of heroes.
That has not been part of my teaching.
We have sought to make ourselves worthy, and let a claim come when it would.
But to be foremost in battle... is a virtue not to be despised.
I believe it will be a quick war, that there will be few losses.
But if losses there must be, then let us remember the Latin phrase... which must have come to the lips of many a Roman... when he stood embattled in a foreign land:
"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori. "
"Sweet and fitting it is to die for the fatherland. "
Some of you may have ambitions.
I know of one young man who has great promise as a writer, and he has written the first act of a tragedy... which would be a credit to one of the masters.
And he is dreaming, I suppose, of following in the footsteps of Goethe and Schiller, and I hope he will.
But now our country calls.
The fatherland needs leaders.
Personal ambition must be thrown aside... in the one great sacrifice for our country.
Here is a glorious beginning to your lives.
The field of honor calls you.
Why are we here?
You, Kropp, what has kept you back?
You, Mueller, you know how much you are needed?
Ah, I see you look at your leader.
And I, too, look to you, Paul Baumer, and I wonder what you are going to do.
- I'll go.
- I want to go.
- Me too.
- I'm ready.
- I'm not gonna stay home!
Follow me!
Enlist now!
- No more classes!
- No more classes!
- Don't be a quitter!
- Come on, Behn!
Stick together.
That's what we've got to do.
- Let's all stick together.
- Come on, Behn.
All right.
All right.
- I'll go.
- That's the way!
Let's go!
Hey!
Let's sing!
Come on!
- Keep in line there, soldiers.
- Anything you say, General.
Detail, halt!
Left face!
Get into uniform, ready to report.
Fall out!
I betcha a place like this gets you in good condition.
You have to be for the long marches.
I'm gonna get in the cavalry and ride.
No cavalry for me.
Infantry's where you see the fighting.
Where are all the guns?
That's what I want to know.
Oh, you don't get a gun for a long while yet.
If I'm gonna bump off the enemy, I gotta have some practice.
Ow!
Bayonet drill.
That's what I want.
Ah!
You won a medal that time, Mueller.
You wait.
In about a month I'll be covered with 'em.
Say, keep your boots out of my face!
Why, it's an honor to have those boots in your face.
They're the best pair in the army!
My uncle gave 'em to me.
Just look at that special imported leather.
Put 'em anyplace you like, except in my face.
Not even a kitchen maid'll look at me in this!
Attention!
Well, for the love of
- It's Himmelstoss!
- So it is.
- And all dressed up.
Hello, Himmie.
You didn't think you'd see me again so soon, did you?
- You see my rank?
- Sure.
Fall back, then!
- Himmelstoss, we certainly are glad to see you.
- What did you say?
- I was going to say-
- Never mind!
- What's the matter with you?
- When you address your superior officer, say "sir"!
- Where'd he get such a nice uniform?
- Any mail for us, Himmie?
- Quiet!
- My dear fellow, you're shouting.
Ah, come on, Himmelstoss.
We know ya.
Take off the false whiskers.
- I believe you mean it!
- You'll find out that I mean it.
- But only three days ago you were our postman.
- Silence!
Come back here!
Line up!
Line up!
Get in some kind of a line!
All of you!
Line up, I say!
Hmm.
What a pretty sight that is!
Have you never heard of standing in line?
You make a fine mess of it.
Well, I'll have to teach you.
We'll spend the whole day on it, huh?
You may be stupid, but I'm used to that.
And then there'll be plenty of other things too.
Oh, I'll not neglect you.
Hmm.
You're not much to begin with, but I'll do my best.
I see that we have come here with a slight misunderstanding, and we'll correct that, too, won't we, huh?
And the first thing to do is to forget everything you ever knew.
Everything you ever learned, forget!
See?
Forget what you've been and what you think you're going to be.
You're going to be soldiers, and that's all!
I'll take the mother's milk out of you!
I'll make you hard-boiled!
I'll make soldiers out of you or kill you!
Now... salute!
A- ten-hut!
Detachment...
lie down!
Down!
Head down!
Keep your head down, Baumer!
Detachment... get up!
Now sing!
Do you call that singing?
Detachment, halt!
So... we have no spirit, huh?
We are in no mood for recreation.
Work is what we want.
Good!
Then we'll go back to work!
Detachment, lie down!
Keep your head down!
Now sing!
Men... halt!
Order, arms!
Inspection at 3:00.
Dismissed!
Oh, that swine!
That means we get no time off.
It will take four hours to get ready for inspection.
- I'd like to know what's in his mind.
- He hasn't got any!
I'm gonna cut him open sometime and find out!
He's too thick-skinned.
He won't cut.
This is the fourth time he's made me disappoint that poor girl.
Arms!
Order, arms!
Left shoulder, arms!
Squad right.
To the right, march!
Left, left, left, left.
Follow right, march!
Squad, left march!
Forward... march!
Detachment... halt!
Present arms!
Himmelstoss.
Excellent work.
They're going up front tomorrow.
- I recommend leave till midnight.
- Very good, sir.
Left, left, left.
Detachment...
lie down!
Crawl forward!
He spoiled our leave.
I'll never forgive him for that.
- The rat!
- Leave till midnight.
Hmm!
It'll take till midnight to dry our clothes.
There goes the filthy ape now.
While we slave over this mud, he goes off to have a few drinks!
Someday I'm going to take one smack at him - just one.
Me too.
That's gonna be my life's work from now on.
Why only one?
I'm gonna take several.
I might even kick him while he's down.
I feel mean.
What are you doing?
You're not going to desert, are you?
What?
Listen.
I've got an idea.
Crawl forward!
Lie down!
Lie down!
Crawl forward!
Oh!
What?
Ow!
Ow!
- Cover!
- Paul, you all right?
Behn!
Behn!
Behn!
Come on!
Behn, come on!
You fool!
Behn!
Get up!
Come on.
- Sounds like more replacements coming in.
Yeah.
Tjaden must have gone home for that wood.
There's some more, fresh from the turnip patch.
I suppose this is where we bunk.
That's me, "I. Westhus,"
and this is where I live.
- I didn't know!
- Well, you know now!
Yes.
Yes, of course.
- It's all right.
- Here's a bunk, Paul.
- When did we eat last?
- Don't remind me.
- I was fine until you spoke.
- Where are we anyway?
I don't know.
The name on the railroad station's been shot off.
There must be something to eat somewhere.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll ask those fellas.
Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Westhus.
Oh.
Meet Detering.
A better farmer never lived.
- And Mr. Tjaden.
- Sit down.
You see, we haven't eaten since breakfast.
We thought maybe you could tell us what we ought to do about it.
Eat without further delay.
Well, what's funny about that?
This is a bad town to bring an appetite to, soldier.
We've been here since yesterday morning, living on baled hay and razor blades.
We're willing to buy our food.
Where's the canteen?
The only canteen in these regions is out looking for supplies.
- Ever hear of Katczinsky?
- Who?
Katczinsky.
He's uncanny.
If there's any food within 25 miles, he'll be the one to get it.
- Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hup!
- Hup!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Attention!
- What is this?
- Volunteers for the future generals' staff.
Sometime I'm gonna take one of you volunteers apart... and find out what makes you leave school and join the army.
At ease.
This is no parade ground.
- Hungry?
- Yes.
Wait!
Wait a minute!
That's no invitation.
Can you pay?
I have some money.
No, not money.
That's just pieces of paper.
Have you got any cigarettes, cigars,
- or soap, cognac-
- Yeah, yeah.
- Chewing tobacco?
- Yeah, yeah.
Are you crazy?
There ain't enough here for us.
I wish you three would get bumped off.
I'm tired of feeding ya for nothing.
- Bring everything you got.
- I'm so hungry-
- I'd be glad to give you-
- Come on!
- Is this enough, sir?
- Kat!
- Hmm?
- You've got the wiring detail tonight.
- Where?
- Past the graveyard.
- With this bunch?
It's quiet tonight.
You can teach 'em a couple of things.
Thanks.
I'd rather do it alone.
- These babes get killed off too fast.
- Well, the lorry's waiting.
Last night I was too hungry to sleep, and tonight, when I get the wrinkles out of my gut, they think up wiring duty.
Well, here's your chance, heroes.
For the fatherland!
Come on, get your stuff and let's get out of here.
- Is that any way to drive?
- Let him drive any way he wants.
Suppose he breaks your arm.
You get sent home, don't you?
A lot better than havin' a hole in your guts.
If there's any of you left, I'll pick you up in the morning.
Well, if that ride you gave us didn't kill us, nothing will.
- And be on time.
I don't want to miss my breakfast.
- Huh?
- You better wait for your army, Papa.
Here, here.
Don't be so backward.
Listen, children.
All we got to do is to string a little wire.
We pick it up at the dump and carry it to where we need it.
Now, you're gonna see some shell fire, and you're gonna be scared, see?
It's all right, boy.
Get up.
Here.
Never mind.
It's happened to better men than you, and it's happened to me.
When we come back, I'll get you all some nice clean underwear.
That kind of shell you don't have to pay much attention to.
Those big fellas just make a lot of noise and land about five miles behind the line.
The things we've got to watch out for are the light ones.
They don't give you much warning.
They go "waa-aa-aah zing. "
And when you hear that, down!
Mother Earth.
Press yourselves down upon her.
Bury yourselves deep into her.
Just keep your eyes on me.
When you see me flop, you flop, only try to beat me to it.
Shh-shh.
Now listen.
I'll show you how it's done.
Give me a couple of those.
That's to kill the noise.
Tjaden.
See that?
- What's that mean?
- Bombardment.
My eyes!
I'm blind!
I can't see!
God!
- My eyes!
I can't see!
- I can't see!
- It's Behn!
It's Behn!
- I'll go get him-
- You'll get killed!
- Let me-
- Lay down and stay there!
He's dead.
- He's dead!
- Why did you risk your life bringing' him in?
But it's Behn!
- My friend.
- He's a corpse, no matter who it is.
Now, don't any of you ever do that again.
Put him over there.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
All right, come on.
All right, come on.
Get your packs and fall in.
Hurry up!
Come on.
Hurry up.
Make it snappy.
Get your packs and fall in.
Kat, what are we doing?
What's happening?
You heard him.
Orders to march.
- But where to, for the love of -
- Another party.
And this one is gonna last a long time.
Come on.
Here we go.
Company, attention!
Shoulder arms!
March right, march!
- Take your hands off that!
- Queen takes it!
- Well, if you think that's a queen, look again.
Ah, it's a jack.
- Yeah.
- Honest, these cards all look alike.
It's too noisy!
I can't play.
- I suppose your delicate nerves can't stand it.
- Get up!
That's Oscar.
The son of a-
Look at that!
Don't be so snooty.
You may wish you had this back.
About two more days of this... and this rat-bitten end of a piece of bread's gonna taste like a hunk of fruitcake.
It wouldn't
- It wouldn't last two more days, would it?
Didn't I tell you this was gonna be a bad one?
I don't mind the days so much.
It's keeping up all night-
Ah, two more days makes a week, kid.
Then you can say you've been under fire!
You're not scared, are you?
No.
I was just asking.
That's all.
- Wanna play some more?
- Do you?
- Sure.
- All right.
My deal.
You better get your boot back before Oscar eats that!
- The kid's all right.
Behn!
Behn.
Yeah, yeah.
Let him sleep.
He's dreamin'.
Oh, God.
Can't you see it's Behn?
He didn't want to come to war!
No, no.
It isn't Behn.
It isn't Behn!
It's Kemmerick!
It's me!
Shut up, will you?
It's bad enough in here as it is.
Every-
Everything's all right, Franz.
You're dreaming.
You're just dreaming, I guess.
- Attention!
- At ease.
The barrage is gettin' worse.
The men in two more dugouts gone.
However, we'll do our best to get some food up here by evening.
Stop!
Stop!
Let me out!
- What did you do that for?
- Shut up!
Grab him.
- No.
- Now hold him.
You all right now?
I think so.
I couldn't hold out much longer.
- Oh, God, it's Franz!
- Get him over there!
No, he's been hit in the stomach.
He can't have anything to drink.
Get a stretcher.
Where'd they get you, Kemmerick?
Oh.
- Here it is, sir.
- Take his head.
All right.
Take him out.
- Is it serious, sir?
- I'm not sure.
- Tell the others he's all right.
- Yes, sir.
If we're going to fight, why don't we fight?
Why don't we go over?
You could go crazy staying here.
Let's do something!
- Let's go after 'em!
- Sit down!
If that cook of ours had any guts, he'd try to bring something through.
He's so far behind the lines he can't hear the shooting!
- Here's Kat.
Get anything?
- Any luck?
- We'll have to split this up among us.
- Something to eat!
We need butter too.
Yes.
And dessert.
And a feather bed to sleep on.
- Rats!
- Rats!
Get out of the way!
What's that?
- Come on!
Grab your rifles!
Come on!
- Here they come.
- Get your grenades here.
Hurry up.
Come on, hurry up.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Back to your own lines!
- Fill it up.
- And hurry up.
I've got other things to do.
I've been waiting for this for three weeks.
When they all get here.
What do you want?
Beans, you homely-lookin' son of a frog's leg.
- What do you think I want?
- We're hungry.
Shut up!
I'll feed you when you're all here.
- We're all here now.
- Only half the company's here.
Get the rest.
- Wake 'em up.
I wish I could wake 'em up.
There's 80 of us left.
The rest is in dressing stations or pushing' up daisies.
Eighty?
And I cooked for 150!
All right.
We'll have enough for once.
Come on.
Dish out!
You mean you've cooked beans for 150... and you've got bread for 150... and sausage for 150, and tobacco for 150?
Everything!
It's all wrong.
I should have been notified.
What a feast!
- Everyone gets two issues.
- Get back in line!
Get back in line!
- Oh, no!
That won't do.
I can't give 80 men what's meant for 150.
Listen.
You drew rations for the 2nd Company, didn't ya?
Yeah.
All right.
We're the 2nd Company.
- I've got my orders.
- Kat's right.
- We're the 2nd Company.
And if only half of us get back, that's our good luck.
- Come on.
Dish it out.
- Come on!
- No!
- Hey!
You're the yellowest baboon that ever drew a cook wagon, and you're scared - it shows.
All we want to hear out of you is one more little yip, and we'll cut ya up and eat ya raw.
Why, you keep your kitchen so far back of the lines, we never get anything to eat until it's cold and we're asleep!
Now, you low-down rat, get out...
- or we wreck the joint!
- Come on!
Give us-
- Attention!
At ease.
What's goin' on here?
He's cooked for 150, sir, and he only wants to give us half.
- Looks pretty good.
- Yes, sir.
- Serve the whole issue.
The men can use it.
- Yes, sir.
- And bring me a plate too.
- Yes, sir.
All right.
Take it all.
Take everything.
Give 'em honey.
Give 'em what they want.
- Fill it up!
- Fill it up!
- Don't mind me.
- Oh, that's all right.
Don't mention it.
You know...
I could do with some more beans.
Go help yourself.
There's more over there.
- It's too far.
- I wonder, when are we going back to the front?
- Tomorrow.
It's enough to take away a man's appetite.
You know, if they're gonna march us in again tomorrow, we ought to go see how Kemmerick is.
- That's a good idea.
- Let's do that.
- How far is the dressing station?
- About two miles.
- We could take his things to him.
- Good.
It seemed rotten to think of a thing like that happening to him, a nice fellow like Kemmerick.
Ah, the French certainly deserve to be punished for starting this war.
Everybody says it's somebody else.
Well, how do they start a war?
Well, one country offends another.
How could one country offend another?
You mean there's a mountain over in Germany gets mad at a field over in France?
- Well, stupid, one people offends another.
Oh, if that's it, I shouldn't be here at all.
I don't feel offended.
It don't apply to tramps like you.
Good.
Then I can be going home right away.
- Ah, you just try it.
- Yeah.
You wanna get shot?
- The Kaiser and me -
Me and the Kaiser felt just alike about this war.
We didn't either of us want any war, so I'm going home.
- He's there already.
- Somebody must have wanted it.
Maybe it was the English.
No, I don't want to shoot any Englishmen.
I never saw one till I came up here.
And I suppose most of them never saw a German till they came up here.
- No, I'm sure they weren't asked about it.
- No.
Well... it must be doing somebody some good.
- Not me and the Kaiser.
- I think maybe the Kaiser wanted a war.
You leave us out of this!
I don't see that.
The Kaiser's got everything he needs.
Well, he never had a war before.
Every full-grown emperor needs one war to make him famous.
- Why, that's history.
- Yeah, generals too.
They need war.
- And manufacturers.
They get rich.
I think it's more a kind of fever.
Nobody wants it in particular, and then all at once, there it is.
We didn't want it.
The English didn't want it.
And here we are fighting.
I'll tell you how it should all be done.
Whenever there's a big war comin' on,
- you should rope off a big field-
- And sell tickets.
Yeah.
And-
And on the big day, you should take all the kings and their cabinets and their generals, put them in the center dressed in their underpants, and let 'em fight it out with clubs.
The best country wins.
Well, now that Kat's settled everything, let's go see Kemmerick.
- Something interesting might happen on the way.
- Might cheer him up.
Boys, me and the Kaiser want you back in time to march tomorrow.
Don't forget.
- We'll be back.
- Give the boy my regards.
There he is.
- Hello, Kemmerick.
- How's it going?
How are things going?
Are they looking after you all right?
How are they treating you?
Franz?
They're robbers here.
Robbers.
They stole my watch!
I always told you, nobody should carry as good a watch as that.
- They took it while I was under ether!
- Franz, you'll get it back.
Do you feel all right?
- Just look at my hand.
- That's because you lost so much blood.
- Just eat decently and you'll get well again.
- Oh, no.
You must eat.
That's the main thing.
It looks good too.
I have such a terrible pain in my foot.
Every toe on my right foot hurts.
Well, how can your foot hurt when your leg's been-
I know what you mean!
I know!
I know now!
They cut my leg off.
Why didn't they tell me?
Why
- Why didn't they tell me?
- Franz!
Franz!
- Now I can't walk anymore!
You must be thankful that you've come off with only that.
I wanted to be a forester once.
You can yet.
They make artificial legs that are wonderful.
And you're through too.
You can go home.
Think of that.
We brought your things for you.
See?
Put 'em under the bed.
That's a marvelous pair of boots.
Look at that leather!
What comfort.
I was just thinking.
If you're not going to be using these, Franz, why don't you leave 'em with us?
What good are they to you?
I can use 'em.
My boots give me blister after blister-
Well, we'll be going, Franz.
Oh, don't go.
Stay just a little while longer.
- I'll come right back.
- We'll be coming soon again, Franz.
- I know you'll be feeling better.
- Bye.
- Bye. - Good-bye, Franz.
You think he'll last till after mess?
- I don't think-
- Done for.
Boys, you go along.
I'll see you later.
Good-bye.
All right, Paul.
I'm sorry, Paul.
I wouldn't touch a thing of his if he could use it.
I'd go barefoot over barbed wire for him if it'd do him any good.
Only
- Only why should some orderly get those boots?
I understand, Mueller.
We're all alike out here.
And good boots are scarce.
Tell the doctor to come, please.
Doctor, the man in the next bed would like to see you, sir.
I've done everything I can for him.
There's no helping him.
Poor little fella.
He says next time, Franz.
Do you think I'll ever get well?
Why, of course.
- Do you really think so?
- Sure, once you get over the operation.
I don't think so.
Franz!
Don't talk nonsense.
Why, you'll be as good as new.
They fix up worse things than that.
Perhaps you'll go to the convalescent home... in Klosterberg among the villagers.
Then you can look out of the windows, across the fields... to the two trees on the horizon.
The loveliest time of the year now when the corn ripens.
You can go out without asking anyone.
You can even play piano if you want to.
Oh
- Oh, but, Franz, you must try to sleep now.
O God, this is Franz Kemmerick, only 19 years old.
He doesn't want to die.
Please don't let him die.
Paul.
- Paul.
- Franz.
Take my boots home for Mueller.
Oh, no, Franz, no.
And if...
Paul... you find my watch, send it home.
Franz!
Doctor.
Doctor!
Doctor!
Doctor!
Where's the doctor?
Why isn't there a doctor here?
- Doctor, come quick.
Franz Kemmerick is dying!
- Which one is that?
- Amputated leg.
- I've amputated a dozen legs today.
- Bed 26, sir.
- You see to it.
I'm due in the operating room.
One operation after another since 5:00 this morning.
Sixteen dead today, and yours is the 17th.
There'll probably be 20 by the morning.
You're lookin' good.
Very good today.
What's your hurry?
Hey!
I'll bet he stole those boots!
- I got it, Kat.
- Hmm?
Listen: "The sum of an arithmetic series... is S = A + L x N over 2."
- Interesting, isn't it?
- What do you wanna learn that stuff for?
One day you'll stop a bullet and it'll all be worthless.
- I get a lot of fun out of it.
- Aah!
My boots!
Mueller.
I saw him die.
I didn't know what it was like to die before.
And then - then I came outside... and it felt- it felt so good to be alive that I started in to walk fast.
I began to think of the strangest things, like being out in the fields.
Things like that.
You know - girls.
And it felt as if there were... something electric running from the ground up through me.
And I started.
I began to run hard.
I passed soldiers and I heard voices calling to me.
I ran and I ran.
I felt as if I couldn't breathe enough air into me.
And
- And now I'm hungry.
I don't mind the war now.
Be a pleasure to go to the front in boots like these.
It's a good invention just the same.
If you crack each separate louse, think of all the energy you use up.
Watch.
Burned to death.
- How was patrol?
Bad?
- Must've been terrible if they had time to gather the harvest.
We passed a cherry tree and when he saw it, he went crazy.
I could hardly drag him away.
It was... beautiful.
I have a big orchard with cherry trees at home.
When they're in full blossom, from the hayloft it looks like one single sheet.
So white.
- Perhaps you can get leave soon.
- You may even be sent back as a farmer.
A woman can't run a farm alone.
That's no good, you know?
No matter how hard she works.
Harvest coming on again.
What's the matter with him?
Got a letter yesterday from his wife.
He wants to get back to his farm.
We'd all like to get back home.
I wonder what we'd do if it were suddenly peacetime again?
Get drunk and look for women!
I'd go looking for a Cinderella... that could wear this for a garter.
And when I'd found her, nobody'd see me for two weeks.
I'll go back to the peat fields... and those pleasant hours in the beer gardens.
And there's worse things than cobbling too.
Look.
My family.
I oughta give you a kick in the backside for startin' all this.
It's all right for all you to talk.
You've got something to go back to:
wives, children, jobs.
But what about us?
What have we got to go back to?
- School?
- Why not?
You know everything already.
A man can't take all that rubbish they teach you seriously... after three years of shells and bombs.
- You can't peel that off easily.
- They never taught us anything really useful, like how to light a cigarette in the wind or make a fire out of wet wood... or bayonet a man in the belly instead of the ribs where it gets jammed.
What can happen to us afterwards?
I'll tell ya.
Take our class.
Out of 20, three are officers, nine dead,
Mueller and three others wounded... and one in the madhouse.
We'll all be dead someday, so let's forget it.
Hurry up!
Get in there!
Hurry up!
Himmelstoss!
What's up?
- What are you, crazy?
- It's Himmelstoss!
Himmelstoss?
There is justice in the army!
Well, well.
So, we are all here, huh?
- A bit longer than you, Himmie.
- Since when have we become so familiar?
Stand up and click your heels together!
All of you!
- Take a running jump at yourself!
- Who's your friend?
Would somebody get General Ludendorff a nice, comfortable chair?
I command you as your superior officer!
- Do you want to be court-martialed?
- I do!
There's going to be a big attack tonight and I'd just love to get out of it.
Will you obey my orders?
Kiss my butt!
It isn't customary to ask for salutes here.
But I'll tell you what we'll do.
We're going to attack a town that we tried to take once before.
Many killed and many wounded.
It was great fun.
This time you're going with us.
If any of us stops a bullet, before we die... we're going to come to you, click our heels together and ask stiffly,
- "Please, Sergeant Himmelstoss, may we go?"
- You'll-
You'll pay for this, you-
There it is.
Right on time.
Better get ready, boys.
I'm wounded!
I'm wounded!
It's just a scratch, you yellow rat!
Up!
Get out with the others!
- Up!
- No!
No!
No!
You yellow rat!
Stinking yellow rat!
Let the others do it, eh?
Get up!
Get up!
- Aa-aah!
- Get up!
Forward!
- Get out here!
- Command... was forward.
Command was forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Counterattack.
I want to help you.
Stop that!
Stop it, stop it.
I can bear the rest of it.
I can't listen to that!
Why do you take so long dying?
You're going to die anyway!
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
You won't die.
Oh, no.
You won't die.
They're only little wounds.
You'll get home.
You'll be all right.
You'll get home long before I will.
You know I can't run away.
That's why you accuse me.
I tell you, I didn't want to kill you.
I tried to keep you alive.
If you jumped in here again, I wouldn't do it.
When you jumped in here you were my enemy, and I was afraid of you.
But you're just a man like me, and I killed you.
Forgive me, comrade.
Say that for me.
Say you forgive me.
Oh, no.
You're dead.
You're better off than I am.
You're through.
They can't do any more to you now.
Oh, God, why did they do this to us?
We only wanted to live, you and I.
Why should they send us out to fight each other?
If we threw away these rifles and these uniforms, you could be my brother just like Kat and Albert.
You'll have to forgive me, comrade.
I'll do all I can.
I'll write to your parents.
I'll write to-
I'll write to your wife.
I'll write to her.
I promise she'll not want for anything.
I'll help her and your parents too.
Only forgive me.
Forgive me!
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Terrible thing happened yesterday.
I stabbed a man.
With my own hands, stabbed him.
I know how it is.
Your first time.
Never mind.
The stretcher-bearers will find him.
- He's dead.
I watched him die.
- You couldn't do anything about it.
We have to kill.
We can't help it.
That's what we are here for.
Uh
- Look there, for instance.
Hah!
That got him.
You should've seen how he leaped in the air.
That fellow had to shoot with us for today with three hits.
If he keeps it up, he'll have a decoration for his buttonhole this evening.
Don't you lose any more sleep over this business.
Maybe it was 'cause I was out there with him so long, huh?
Sure, that's it.
After all, war is war.
March!
Forward!
Forward, march!
Quick there!
Forward!
Company... halt!
Dismissed!
Uncommissioned officers, enlisted men, dismiss!
Hooray!
Come on!
Let's get outta here!
- Give me your best sausage.
- Two.
Give me a beer.
One, two, three!
Hey, come on.
A beer.
Hey, get out of here!
Come on.
Give me a beer.
Oh, ho ho!
A beer.
One b-
Here's hoping we get falling-down drunk tonight.
Here's how it started.
I'd forgotten there were girls like that.
There aren't.
Just look at those thin, little shoes.
She couldn't march many miles in those.
Paul!
Don't speak about marching.
You're boring the young lady.
A thousand pardons.
- How old do you think she is?
- Oh, about 22.
No, that'd make her older than us.
She's... 17.
A girl like that.
That'd be good, eh, Albert?
We wouldn't have much of a chance with him around.
- We could take a bath, wash our clothes-
- All right.
and I might even go so far as to get deloused.
Wait a minute!
She's a long way from here now.
Look at the date.
May, 1917.
- Four months ago.
- That's true.
Well, here's to her anyway.
Here's to 'em all, everywhere.
Albert,
- we might as well wash up anyway.
- All right.
Personally, I like 'em bigger around.
This conversation was on a high moral plane up to now.
Now we do need a bath.
- A bath?
- For what?
Hm.
You wouldn't understand.
This water is freezing.
This romantic business has gone too far.
- Ahh, but think of her beautiful eyes!
- Oh!
Oh, and her hair.
- Here we are!
- We're not gonna miss a thing!
- What are you doing here?
- Bathing!
They tell me there's some people in this world takes a bath every week!
Women!
Mademoiselle, you want to swim?
Mademoiselle!
Aw, baby!
Aw, no, girls!
Don't go away!
Aw, mama!
- Please don't go!
- Don't go away!
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!
Food!
Food!
Whoo-hoo!
Halt!
You know you're forbidden to cross.
You fellows stay on this side or you'll get yourselves in a lot of trouble.
- What are they jabbering' about?
- They want us to swing over tonight.
They're expecting us.
- That's fine!
- That blonde's crazy about me.
- But there's four of us and only three of them.
- I was the one that stopped 'em!
That blonde piece of work is mine.
You three fight for what's left.
Fight's the word.
All's fair in love and war.
Huh?
What do you mean?
What're you gonna do?
You'll find out.
Au revoir!
Au revoir!
- C'est moi, blondie!
- Bon ami!
Bon ami!
Vos camarades!
Vos camarades!
Ooh!
She means the door.
Not only modest, but dashing!
A perfect fit.
It might've been made for me.
An officer's coat.
We're calling distinguished company.
Ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Merci.
Have another little drink, comrade.
Is this your birthday or mine?
Why?
You've been buying me drink after drink for two hours.
What I'm tryin' to figure out is why.
Why?
Oh!
Ha-ha!
Oh.
I-It's just that the boys... told me to amuse you for a little while.
Oh, nice boys.
Yeah!
They-They said you'd understand.
Ehh... heh.
Huh?
I've been betrayed!
Yeah, you certainly have.
Take that for a minute!
I'll give you more!
Ahh.
It's too loud.
Suzanne.
And I wouldn't even know you if I did.
And yet, I'll remember you always.
Toujours.
Oh, if you could only know how different this is from the women we soldiers meet.
You.
That's what I'm talking about.
Vous.
It seems as though all war and terror and grossness... had fallen away from me... like a miracle.
Like something I never believed.
Pauvre garcon.
Pauvre garcon.
Frau Paul.
We're going, Paul.
Have a look.
Nice, new coffins.
Huh!
For us.
I must say, that's a very cheerful preparation for this offensive.
That's very considerate of them.
But I don't see any long enough for our comrade Tjaden.
Mind you, I'm not speaking to you, you traitors.
- But no coffin's gonna get me.
- I should say not, heartbreaker.
You'll be thankful if they slip a waterproof sheet...
- around that Aunt Sally of a carcass of yours.
Oh-Oh, my side!
My side.
Catholic hospital, Albert.
They say you always get good food and good treatment.
- We're lucky.
- After that rainy dressing station... and 24 hours on the train, we deserve to have some luck.
I'm Hamacher.
Yeah, that's my name.
I got a crack in the head and they gave me a certificate stating,
"Josef Hamacher is periodically... not responsible for his actions. "
And ever since then, Hamacher has been having a grand time.
I hope you boys are not too badly wounded.
The others die off so quickly we don't have time to get acquainted.
You'll get to know us... very well.
Thank you.
You too.
I'm sorry, my dear.
It's time to go now.
Yes, sister.
Watch.
If they take his clothes away, you've seen the last of him.
- See?
They're taking him to the dying room.
- Dying room?
When you're ready to kick the bucket, they get you out of the way so they can use the bed.
In the corner of the building there's a little room... right next to the morgue!
It's so convenient.
It saves a lot of trouble.
But suppose he gets well?
I've seen a lot of 'em go in that dying room, but nobody ever comes back.
Sister.
Sister.
Sister.
- Is that you ringing, Paul?
- Yes.
- Is something going on?
- I think I have a hemorrhage.
The bandage is all wet.
I've been ringing forever and nobody comes.
- I think I'm bleeding.
- Sister, get me a sterile dressing and an ice pack.
- Why didn't someone call me?
- He's been ringing.
Nobody can walk, Sister.
- Sister, is it bad?
- No.
No, we'll be all right.
We've got it in time.
What's the matter?
What are you doing?
We must rearrange your bandages.
Wh
- Where are you taking me?
To the bandaging ward.
- No, no!
I'm not going!
I'm staying here!
- Paul!
Paul!
- Now, now!
- I'm not going to the dying room!
- We're going to the bandaging ward.
- Why are you taking my clothes?
You're lying to me!
But I'll come back.
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'm not going to die!
I'll come back!
Sister Libertine, how is he?
Poor boy.
They had to amputate his leg.
Paul.
Paul.
Paul.
Oh, he is... gone.
Gone.
Hello.
Welcome home, Albert!
- How do you feel, kid?
- All right.
But I've got such an awful pain.
My foot hur -
Hamacher.
Did they cut my leg off?
Of course not!
How many did you have?
Two?
You still got 'em!
One, two!
Don't play the fool, Hamacher.
Tell me truthfully.
Of course not.
And you look fine.
Look.
See?
- I won't be a cripple.
- Now, now.
- I won't live like that!
- Be calm.
- I'll kill myself the first chance I get!
- Albert!
- I won't live!
I won't live!
- Yes, you will.
Albert!
Albert!
Albert, I've come back!
I told you I'd come back.
Look, everybody!
I've come back!
- Paul!
Paul!
- That's not where I'm going.
I live over there.
Paul, I'm so happy.
Hamacher, I've come back from the dead!
- It's most irregular.
Never happened before.
- Albert, get well quickly... so we can go home soon.
- Everything will be all right now.
- Yes, Paul.
Everything will be all right... now.
Oh!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul.
- What's the matter, Paul?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
Paul.
Give me your handkerchief.
- Mother?
- Here I am, Paul.
Here I am.
Mother's ill.
- Are you wounded?
- No, Mother.
I got leave.
Here I am cryin' instead of being glad.
Anna, get down the jar of blackberries.
You still like them, don't you?
Yes, Mother.
I haven't had any for a long time.
We might almost have known you were coming.
- I'm making potato cakes.
- Don't let them burn.
Paul... sit down... beside me.
My Paul.
My baby.
I almost forgot, Mother.
I've got some little presents for you.
Look, Mother.
Bread, sausage and rice.
- Paul, you've been starving yourself.
- Hmm-mm.
Hadn't I better go and tell Father Paul's home?
- Paul could watch the things on the stove.
- No, I'm getting up.
Oh, Paul, you're a soldier now, aren't you?
But somehow, I don't seem to know you.
I'll take these off, Mother.
I'll get your suit.
It's in the wardrobe, just where you left it.
Are you really here, Paul?
You won't-
You won't disappear, will you?
No.
I'm here.
Your things are ready for you, Paul.
- I remember when you caught that one.
- Yes.
And you took it away from me, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
We're behind the lines, but we know how to honor the soldier... who goes on in spite of blood and death.
Gentlemen, my son.
- Prosit.
- Cheers.
I'm glad to know you, young man, I am glad to know you.
How are things out there?
Terrible, eh?
Terrible.
But we must carry on.
After all, you do at least get decent food out there.
Naturally, it's worse here.
Naturally.
But the best for our soldiers all the time.
That's our motto.
The best for our soldiers.
But...
- you must give the Frenchies a good licking!
And, if you boys want to come home, ehh, let me show you what you must do before you can come home.
Give us a hand there, men.
Now, then, there's the line.
Runs so, in a "V".
Here is St. Quentin.
You can see for yourself.
You're almost through now.
All right?
Shove ahead out there and don't stick to that everlasting French warfare!
Smash through the johnnies!
And then you will have peace.
When you get in it... the war isn't the way it looks back here.
Oh!
You don't know anything about it.
Of course, you know about the details, but this relates to the whole!
You can't judge that.
Of course, you do your duty and you risk your life.
But for that, you receive the highest honor.
I said that every man in the war ought to have the Iron Cross.
First, the enemy lines must be broken through in Flanders.
- On to Paris!
Push on to Paris!
- Right.
No, not in Flanders.
I'll tell you just where the break should come.
- Here.
- The enemy has too many reserves there.
- I insist upon Flanders!
- Why should they do that... when they're halfway through St. Quentin already?
Because Flanders is a flat country!
- No mountains, no obstructions!
- There's too many rivers there!
From the farms they have gone;
from the schools, from the factories.
They have gone bravely, nobly, ever forward, realizing there is no other duty now but to save the fatherland.
Paul!
How are you, Paul?
Glad to see you, Professor.
You've come at the right moment, Baumer!
Just at the right moment.
And as if to prove all I have said, here is one of the first to go.
A lad who sat before me on these very benches... who gave up all to serve in the first year of the war;
one of the iron youth who have made Germany invincible in the field.
Look at him- sturdy and bronze and clear -eyed.
The kind of soldier every one of you should envy.
Oh, lad, you must speak to them.
You must tell them what it means to serve your fatherland.
- No, I can't tell them anything.
- You must, Paul.
Just a word.
Just tell them how much they're needed out there.
Tell them why you went and what it meant to you.
I can't say anything.
You can remember some deed of heroism, some touch of nobility.
Tell about it.
I can't tell you anything you don't know.
We live in the trenches out there.
We fight.
We try not to be killed; sometimes we are.
That's all.
No.
No, Paul.
I've been there!
I know what it's like.
That's not what one dwells on, Paul.
I heard you in here reciting that same old stuff, making more iron men, more young heroes.
You still think it's beautiful and sweet to die for your country, don't you?
We used to think you knew.
The first bombardment taught us better.
It's dirty and painful to die for your country.
When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all!
There are millions out there dying for their countries, and what good is it?
You asked me to tell them how much they're needed out there.
He tells you, "Go out and die. "
Oh, but if you'll pardon me, it's easier to say "Go out and die" than it is to do it.
- Coward!
- And it's easier to say it than to watch it happen.
No!
No!
Boys, boys!
- I'm sorry, Baumer, but I must say-
- It's no use talking like this.
You won't know what I mean.
Only, it's been a long while since we enlisted out of this classroom.
So long I thought maybe the whole world had learned by this time.
Only now they're sending babies, and they won't last a week!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
Up at the front you're alive or you're dead, and that's all!
You can't fool anybody about that very long.
Up there we know we're lost and done for whether we're dead or alive.
Three years we've had of it - four years.
Every day a year and every night a century.
Our bodies are earth and our thoughts are clay, and we sleep and eat with death.
We're done for because you can't live that way and keep anything inside you!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
I'll go back tomorrow.
I've got four days more, but I can't stand it here!
I'll go back tomorrow!
Sorry.
Mother, you'll catch cold here.
You must go to sleep.
There'll be plenty of time to sleep... when you're gone.
Must you go tomorrow, Paul?
Must you?
Yes, Mother.
Orders were changed.
Are you very much afraid, Paul?
No, Mother.
There's something I want to say to you, Paul.
It's-
Just be on your guard against the women out there.
They're no good.
Where we are, there aren't any women, Mother.
Be very careful at the front, Paul.
Yes, Mother, I will.
I'll pray for you every day.
And if you could, get a job that's not quite so dangerous.
Yes, Mother.
I'll try and get in the cookhouse.
- That can easily be done.
- You do it then, and if the others say anything-
That won't worry me, Mother.
Now, you must go to bed and you must get well quickly before I come back.
I put two sets of underwear - new ones- in your pack.
They'll keep you nice and warm.
They're all wool.
That's sweet of you.
Good night... my son.
Good night, Mother.
Oh, Mother, Mother.
You still think I'm a child.
Why can't I put my head in your lap and cry?
- Is this the 2nd Company?
- Yes, sir.
- Is this all of it?
- Yes, sir.
We had 150 men, but this is all that came back yesterday.
But now they're going to give us enough to make 150 again.
How old are you?
Sixteen.
No use.
I couldn't find anything.
- We'll have to eat the sawdust.
Not me!
I'll go hungry first.
It makes me sick.
Now it's gonna be a real war again.
Paul!
How's old Paul?
Here I am.
You know, the 2nd Company's getting hard to find.
Nobody seemed to know where you were.
I'm glad you found it.
I guess I don't get much of this.
There used to be some food in the sawdust.
Now it's all sawdust.
No joke, either.
Eats ya up inside.
This doesn't look much like the old 2nd Company.
The replacements are all like that.
Not even old enough to carry a pack.
All they know how to do is die.
I guess... some of the old-timers are here yet.
Paul, they're tryin' to invent somethin' to kill me right now.
Where's Westhus?
Messenger dog was wounded.
He went out to get it.
- Is it true about the armistice?
- Doesn't look that way back there.
- You mean they want us to go on fighting?
- That's what they say.
They're crazy!
Germany'll be empty pretty soon.
Where is
- Where is Detering?
He got homesick.
You remember about the cherry blossoms?
I guess he never got over that.
He started out one night to go home and help his wife with the farm.
They got him behind the lines, and we never heard of him since.
He was just homesick, but probably they couldn't see it that way.
Where's Kat?
Is he-
Not Kat!
If he were out, the war would be over.
You remember what he always says:
They're savin' him for the last.
- Where is he?
- He's out lookin' for food, something to make soup with.
- Which way?
- Down the road about two miles that way.
I'll see you later.
Kat!
Paul!
Hello, Paul.
- How's the side?
- Oh, it's all right now.
It's fine.
- Have any luck?
- No, the general's staff's been over this country with a rake.
Let's sit down there.
Tell me, Paul... how was it at home?
Have a good leave?
- In spots.
- What's the matter?
Ohh...
I'm no good for back there anymore, Kat.
None of us are.
We've been in this too long.
The young men thought I was a coward because I told them that... we learn that death is stronger than duty to one's country.
The old men said, "Go on.
Push on to Paris. "
My father even wanted me to wear my uniform around him.
It's not home back there anymore.
All I could think of was, "I'd like to get back and see Kat again. "
You're all I've got left, Kat.
I'm not much to have left.
I missed you, Paul.
At least we know what it's all about out here.
There're no lies here.
Push on to Paris?
You ought to see what they've got on the other side.

- You give me your address, I'll give you mine.
You can't get both of us in one day.
Ah, we'll surely see each other again, Kat.
Remember that day when you brought the whole pig into the factory?
And that day in the woods when you taught us how to dodge shells?
And my first bombardment.

He was hit in the shin.

Would you like to take his pay book?

Yeah, Corporal Stanislaus Katczinsky, 306.

...defending our country, our fatherland.
Now, my beloved class, this is what we must do:
Strike with all our power.
Give every ounce of strength... to win victory before the end of the year.
It is with reluctance that I bring this subject up again.
You are the life of the fatherland, you boys.
You are the iron men of Germany.
You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy... when you are called upon to do so.
It is not for me to suggest that any of you... should stand up and offer to defend his country.
But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads.
I know that in one of the schools... the boys have risen up in the classroom... and enlisted in a mass.
But, of course, if such a thing should happen here... you would not blame me for a feeling of pride.
Perhaps some will say... that you should not be allowed to go yet... that you are too young, that you have homes, mothers, fathers... that you should not be torn away.
Are your fathers so forgetful of their fatherland... that they would let it perish rather than you?
Are your mothers so weak that they cannot send a son... to defend the land which gave them birth?
And after all, is a little experience... such a bad thing for a boy?
Is the honour of wearing a uniform... something from which we should run?
And if our young ladies glory in those who wear it... is that anything to be ashamed of?
I know you have never desired the adulation of heroes.
That has not been part of my teaching.
We have sought to make ourselves worthy... and let acclaim come when it would.
But to be foremost in battle... is a virtue not to be despised.
I believe it will be a quick war... that there will be few losses.
But if losses there must be... then let us remember the Latin phrase... which must have come to the lips of many a Roman... when he stood embattled in a foreign land.:
"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."
"Sweet and fitting it is to die for the fatherland. "
Some of you may have ambitions.
I know of one young man who has great promise as a writer... and he has written the first act of a tragedy... which would be a credit to one of the masters.
And he is dreaming, I suppose... of following in the footsteps of Goethe and Schiller... and I hope he will.
But now our country calls.
The fatherland needs leaders.
Personal ambition must be thrown aside... in the one great sacrifice for our country.
Here is a glorious beginning to your lives.
The field of honour calls you.
Why are we here?
You, Kropp, what has kept you back?
You, Mueller, you know how much you are needed?
Ah, I see you look at your leader.
And I, too, look to you, Paul Baumer... and I wonder what you are going to do.

- [ Murmurs Of Agreement ]
I think it's more a kind of fever.
Nobody wants it in particular... and then all at once, there it is.
We didn't want it.
The English didn't want it.
And here we are fighting.
I'll tell you how it should all be done.
Whenever there's a big war comin' on...
- you should rope off a big field--
- And sell tickets.
Yeah.
And--
And on the big day... you should take all the kings and their cabinets and their generals... put them in the centre dressed in their underpants... and let 'em fight it out with clubs.
- The best country wins.
- [ All Groan, Murmur ]
Well, now that Kat's settled everything, let's go see Kemmerick.
- Something interesting might happen on the way.
- Might cheer him up.
Boys, me and the kaiser want you back in time to march tomorrow.
Don't forget.
- We'll be back.
- Give the boy my regards.
[ Soldiers Chattering ]
There he is.
- Hello, Kemmerick.
- How are ya?
- How's it going?
- How are things going?
- Are they looking after you all right?
How are they treating you?
Franz?
[ Groaning ]
They're robbers here.
Robbers.
They stole my watch!
I always told you, nobody should carry as good a watch as that.
- They took it while I was under ether!
- Franz, you'll get it back.
Do you feel all right?
-Just look at my hand.
- That's because you lost so much blood.
-Just eat decently and you'll get well again.
- Oh, no.
You must eat.
That's the main thing.
It looks good too.
I have such a terrible pain in my foot.
Every toe on my right foot hurts.
Well, how can your foot hurt when your leg's been--
[ Hysterically ] I know what you mean!
I know!
I know now!
They cut my leg off.
Why didn't they tell me?
Why-
- Why didn't they tell me?
- Franz!
Franz!
- Now I can't walk any more!
You must be thankful that you've come off with only that.
I wanted to be a forester once.
You can yet.
They make artificial legs that are wonderful.
And you're through too.
You can go home.
Think of that.
We brought your things for you.
See?
Put 'em under the bed.
That's a marvellous pair of boots.
Look at that leather!
What comfort.
I was just thinking.
If you're not going to be using these, Franz, why don't you leave 'em with us?
What good are they to you?
I can use 'em.
My boots give me blister after blister--
Well, we'll be going, Franz.
Oh, don't go.
Stay just a little while longer.
- I'll come right back.
- We'll be coming soon again, Franz.
- I know you'll be feeling better.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Goodbye, Franz.
[ Albert ] You think he'll last till after mess?
- I don't think--
- Done for.
[ Paul ] Boys, you go along.
I'll see you later.
[ Soldiers ] Goodbye.
All right, Paul.
I'm sorry, Paul.
I wouldn't touch a thing of his if he could use it.
I'd go barefoot over barbed wire for him if it'd do him any good.
Only-
- Only why should some orderly get those boots?
I understand, Mueller.
We're all alike out here.
And good boots are scarce.
Tell the doctor to come, please.
Doctor, the man in the next bed would like to see you, sir.
I've done everything I can for him.
There's no helping him.
Poor little fella.
He says next time, Franz.
Do you think I'll ever get well?
Why, of course.
- Do you really think so?
- Sure, once you get over the operation.
I don't think so.
Franz!
Don't talk nonsense.
Why, you'll be as good as new.
They fix up worse things than that.
Perhaps you'll go to the convalescent home... in Klosterberg among the villagers.
Then you can look out of the windows, across the fields... to the two trees on the horizon.
The loveliest time of the year now when the corn ripens.
You can go out without asking anyone.
You can even play piano if you want to.
Oh-
- Oh, but, Franz, you must try to sleep now.
[ Sobbing ]
O God... this is Franz Kemmerick... only 19 years old.
He doesn't want to die.
Please don't let him die.
[ Whimpering ] Paul.
- Paul.
- Franz.
Take my boots home for Mueller.
Oh, no, Franz, no.
And if...
Paul... you find my watch, send it home.
Franz!
Doctor.
Doctor!
Doctor!
Doctor!
Where's the doctor?
Why isn't there a doctor here?
- Doctor, come quick.
Franz Kemmerick is dying!
- Which one is that?
- Amputated leg.
- I've amputated a dozen legs today.
- Bed 26, sir.
- You see to it.
I'm due in the operating room.
- [ Seething ]
- One operation after another since 5:00 this morning.
Sixteen dead today, and yours is the 17th.
There'll probably be 20 by the morning.
[ Soldiers Chattering ]
[ Soldier #1 ] You're lookin' good.
Very good today.
[ Soldier #2 ] What's your hurry?
Hey!
I'll bet he stole those boots!
[ Laughing ]
- I got it, Kat.
- Hmm?
Listen: "The sum of an arithmetic series... is S = A + L x N over 2."
- Interesting, isn't it?
- What do you wanna learn that stuff for?
One day you'll stop a bullet and it'll all be worthless.
- I get a lot of fun out of it.
- Aah!
My boots!
Mueller.
I saw him die.
I didn't know what it was like to die before.
And then-- then I came outside... and it felt-- it felt so good to be alive that I started in to walk fast.
I began to think of the strangest things... like being out in the fields.
Things like that.
You know-- girls.
And it felt as if there were... something electric running from the ground up through me.
And I started.
I began to run hard.
I passed soldiers and I heard voices calling to me.
I ran and I ran.
I felt as if I couldn't breathe enough air into me.
And-- And now I'm hungry.
I don't mind the war now.
Be a pleasure to go to the front in boots like these.

- How was patrol?
Bad?
- Must've been terrible if they had time to gather the harvest.
We passed a cherry tree and when he saw it, he went crazy.
I could hardly drag him away.
It was... beautiful.
I have a big orchard with cherry trees at home.
When they're in full blossom... from the hayloft it looks like one single sheet.
So white.
- Perhaps you can get leave soon.
- You may even be sent back as a farmer.
A woman can't run a farm alone.
That's no good, you know?
No matter how hard she works.
Harvest coming on again.
What's the matter with him?
Got a letter yesterday from his wife.
He wants to get back to his farm.
We'd all like to get back home.
I wonder what we'd do if it were suddenly peacetime again?
Get drunk and look for women!
I'd go looking for a Cinderella... that could wear this for a garter.
And when I'd found her, nobody'd see me for two weeks.
I'll go back to the peat fields... and those pleasant hours in the beer gardens.
And there's worse things than cobbling too.
Look.
My family.
I oughta give you a kick in the backside for startin' all this.
It's all right for all you to talk.
You've got something to go back to:
wives, children, jobs.
But what about us?
What have we got to go back to?
- School?
- Why not?
You know everything already.
A man can't take all that rubbish they teach you seriously... after three years of shells and bombs.
- You can't peel that off easily.
- They never taught us anything really useful... like how to light a cigarette in the wind or make a fire out of wet wood... or bayonet a man in the belly instead of the ribs where it gets jammed.
What can happen to us afterwards?
I'll tell ya.
Take our class.
Out of 20, three are officers... nine dead...
Mueller and three others wounded... and one in the madhouse.
We'll all be dead someday, so let's forget it.

It isn't customary to ask for salutes here.
But I'll tell you what we'll do.
We're going to attack a town that we tried to take once before.
Many killed and many wounded.
It was great fun.
This time you're going with us.
If any of us stops a bullet, before we die... we're going to come to you, click our heels together and ask stiffly...
-"Please, Sergeant Himmelstoss, may we go?"

I tried to keep you alive.
If you jumped in here again, I wouldn't do it.
When you jumped in here you were my enemy, and I was afraid of you.
But you'rejust a man like me, and I killed you.
Forgive me, comrade.
Say that for me.
Say you forgive me.
Oh, no.
You're dead.
You're better off than I am.
You're through.
They can't do any more to you now.
Oh, God, why did they do this to us?
We only wanted to live, you and I.
Why should they send us out to fight each other?
If we threw away these rifles and these uniforms... you could be my brother just like Kat and Albert.
You'll have to forgive me, comrade.
I'll do all I can.
I'll write to your parents.
I'll write to--
I'll write to your wife.
I'll write to her.
I promise she'll not want for anything.
I'll help her and your parents too.
Only forgive me.
Forgive me!
[ Sobbing ] Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Terrible thing happened yesterday.
I stabbed a man.
With my own hands, stabbed him.
I know how it is.
Your first time.
Never mind.
The stretcher-bearers will find him.
- He's dead.
I watched him die.
- You couldn't do anything about it.
We have to kill.
We can't help it.
That's what we are here for.
Uh-
- Look there, for instance.
- [ Fires ]
- Hah!
That got him.
You should've seen how he leaped in the air.
That fellow had to shoot with us for today with three hits.
If he keeps it up, he'll have a decoration for his buttonhole this evening.
Don't you lose any more sleep over this business.
Maybe it was 'cause I was out there with him so long, huh?
Sure, that's it.
After all, war is war.

Now, then, there's the line.
Runs so, in a "V".
Here is St Quentin.
You can see for yourself.
You're almost through now.
All right?
Shove ahead out there and don't stick to that everlasting trench warfare!
Smash through the johnnies!
And then you will have peace.
When you get in it... the war isn't the way it looks back here.
Oh!
You don't know anything about it.
Of course, you know about the details... but this relates to the whole!
You can't judge that.
Of course, you do your duty and you risk your life.
But for that, you receive the highest honour.
I said that every man in the war ought to have the lron Cross.
First, the enemy lines must be broken through in Flanders.
- On to Paris!
Push on to Paris!
- Right.
No, not in Flanders.
I'll tell you just where the break should come.
- Here.
- The enemy has too many reserves there.
- I insist upon Flanders!
- Why should they do that... when they're halfway through St Quentin already?
Because Flanders is a flat country!
- No mountains, no obstructions!
- There's too many rivers there!
[ Professor ] From the farms they have gone;
from the schools, from the factories.
They have gone bravely, nobly, ever forward... realizing there is no other duty now but to save the fatherland.
Paul!
How are you, Paul?
Glad to see you, Professor.
You've come at the right moment, Baumer!
Just at the right moment.
And as if to prove all I have said, here is one of the first to go.
A lad who sat before me on these very benches... who gave up all to serve in the first year of the war;
one of the iron youth who have made Germany invincible in the field.
Look at him-- sturdy and bronze and clear-eyed.
The kind of soldier every one of you should envy.
Oh, lad, you must speak to them.
You must tell them what it means to serve your fatherland.
- No, I can't tell them anything.
- You must, Paul.
Just a word.Just tell them how much they're needed out there.
Tell them why you went and what it meant to you.
I can't say anything.
You can remember some deed of heroism, some touch of nobility.
- Tell about it.
- [ Enthusiastic Chattering ]
I can't tell you anything you don't know.
We live in the trenches out there.
We fight.
We try not to be killed;
sometimes we are.
That's all.
[ Professor ] No.
No, Paul.
I've been there!
I know what it's like.
That's not what one dwells on, Paul.
I heard you in here reciting that same old stuff... making more iron men, more young heroes.
You still think it's beautiful and sweet to die for your country, don't you?
We used to think you knew.
The first bombardment taught us better.
It's dirty and painful to die for your country.
When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all!
There are millions out there dying for their countries, and what good is it?
- [ All Chattering ] - [ Professor ] Paul!
You asked me to tell them how much they're needed out there.
He tells you, "Go out and die."
Oh, but if you'll pardon me, it's easier to say "Go out and die" than it is to do it.
- [ Boy ] Coward!
- And it's easier to say it than to watch it happen.
- [ Angry Clamouring ] - [ Professor ] No!
No!
Boys, boys!
- I'm sorry, Baumer, but I must say--
- It's no use talking like this.
You won't know what I mean.
Only, it's been a long while since we enlisted out of this classroom.
So long I thought maybe the whole world had learned by this time.
Only now they're sending babies, and they won't last a week!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
Up at the front you're alive or you're dead, and that's all!
You can't fool anybody about that very long.
Up there we know we're lost and done for whether we're dead or alive.
Three years we've had of it-- four years.
Every day a year and every night a century.
Our bodies are earth and our thoughts are clay... and we sleep and eat with death.
We're done for because you can't live that way and keep anything inside you!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
I'll go back tomorrow.
I've got four days more, but I can't stand it here!
I'll go back tomorrow!
Sorry.
Mother, you'll catch cold here.
You must go to sleep.
There'll be plenty of time to sleep... when you're gone.
Must you go tomorrow, Paul?
Must you?
Yes, Mother.
Orders were changed.
Are you very much afraid, Paul?
No, Mother.
There's something I want to say to you, Paul.
It's--
Just be on your guard against the women out there.
They're no good.
Where we are, there aren't any women, Mother.
Be very careful at the front, Paul.
Yes, Mother, I will.
I'll pray for you every day.
And if you could, get a job that's not quite so dangerous.
Yes, Mother.
I'll try and get in the cookhouse.
- That can easily be done.
- You do it then, and if the others say anything--
That won't worry me, Mother.
Now, you must go to bed and you must get well quickly before I come back.
I put two sets of underwear-- new ones-- in your pack.
They'll keep you nice and warm.
[ Choking ] They're all wool.
That's sweet of you.
Goodnight... my son.
Goodnight, Mother.
Oh, Mother, Mother.
You still think I'm a child.
Why can't I put my head in your lap and cry?
- Is this the 2nd Company?
- Yes, sir.
♪ [ Concertina ]
♪ [ Whistling ]
- Is this all of it?
- Yes, sir.
We had 150 men, but this is all that came back yesterday.
But now they're going to give us enough to make 150 again.
How old are you?
Sixteen.
No use.
I couldn't find anything.
- We'll have to eat the sawdust.
- [ Discontented Grumbles ]
Not me!
I'll go hungry first.
It makes me sick.
Now it's gonna be a real war again.
Paul!
How's old Paul?
Here I am.
You know, the 2nd Company's getting hard to find.
Nobody seemed to know where you were.
I'm glad you found it.
I guess I don't get much of this.
There used to be some food in the sawdust.
Now it's all sawdust.
No joke, either.
Eats ya up inside.
This doesn't look much like the old 2nd Company.
The replacements are all like that.
Not even old enough to carry a pack.
All they know how to do is die.
I guess... some of the old-timers are here yet.
Paul, they're tryin' to invent somethin' to kill me right now.
Where's Westhus?
Messenger dog was wounded.
He went out to get it. [ Clucks Tongue ]
- Is it true about the armistice?
- Doesn't look that way back there.
- You mean they want us to go on fighting?
- That's what they say.
They're crazy!
Germany'll be empty pretty soon.
Where is-- Where is Detering?
He got homesick.
You remember about the cherry blossoms?
I guess he never got over that.
He started out one night to go home and help his wife with the farm.
They got him behind the lines, and we never heard of him since.
He was just homesick, but probably they couldn't see it that way.
- Where's Kat?
Is he-- - [ Chuckles ]
Not Kat!
If he were out, the war would be over.
You remember what he always says:
They're savin' him for the last.
- Where is he?
- He's out lookin' for food, something to make soup with.
- Which way?
- Down the road about two miles that way.
I'll see you later.
Kat!
Paul!
Hello, Paul.
- How's the side?
- Oh, it's all right now.
It's fine.
- Have any luck?
- No, the general's staff's been over this country with a rake.
[ Chuckles ] Let's sit down there.
Tell me, Paul...
how was it at home?
Have a good leave?
- In spots.
- What's the matter?
Ohh...
I'm no good for back there any more, Kat.
None of us are.
We've been in this too long.
The young men thought I was a coward because I told them that... we learn that death is stronger than duty to one's country.
The old men said, "Go on.
Push on to Paris."
My father even wanted me to wear my uniform around him.
[ Laughing ]
It's not home back there any more.
All I could think of was, "I'd like to get back and see Kat again."
You're all I've got left, Kat.
I'm not much to have left.
I missed you, Paul.
At least we know what it's all about out here.
There're no lies here.
Push on to Paris?
You ought to see what they've got on the other side.
They eat white bread over there.
They've got dozens of aeroplanes to our one... and tanks that'll go over anything.
What've we got left?
Guns so worn they drop shells on our own men.
No food, no ammunition, no officers.
Push on to Paris!
So that's the way they talk back there. [ Chuckles ]
I guess we'd better be going.
How I lied to my poor mother.
I told her it wasn't so bad out here because there was always a lot of us together.
Now that I'm with you, I'm beginning to believe that I told her the truth.
Down!
That's another one that missed us.
Come on.
Let's go.
Wait a minute.
Looks like the old bread wagon's broke down.
- I guess I don't walk the rest of the way.
- Did that get ya, Kat?
Aah, I think it broke my shin.
That's not so bad.
Hold it together.
-Just my luck, huh?
- Good luck.
That means the war is over.
Oh, no, sir!
This war don't end till they really get me.
- [ Chuckles ]
- Now this one--
- Aah.
- Easy, now.
- Hey!
- Easy!
Easy!
Come on.
I'll take you in.
Give me your hand.
Easy.
[ Grunts ]
All right.
Well, kid...
now we're gonna be separated.
Maybe we can do something together later on when the war is over.
- Yes, kid.
- You give me your address, I'll give you mine.
[ Explosion ]
[ Debris Clattering ]
You can't get both of us in one day.
Ah, we'll surely see each other again, Kat.
Remember that day when you brought the whole pig into the factory?
And that day in the woods when you taught us how to dodge shells?
And my first bombardment.
How I cried.
I was a young recruit then.
Here we are.
Here we are.
[ Grunts ] All right now, Kat.
You could've spared yourself the trouble.
He's dead.
Oh, no.
He's just fainted.
He was hit in the shin.
He's dead.
Would you like to take his pay book?
- You're not related, are you?
- No, we're not related.
Your deal.
Get his name and number?
Yeah, Corporal Stanislaus Katczinsky, 306.

"ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT"
This story is neither an... accusation nor a confession... and least of all an adventure... for death is not an adventure... to those who stand face to face... with it.
It will try simply to... tell of a generation of men who.
even though they may have... escaped its shells, were destroyed... by the war...
- Thirty thousand.
- From the Russians?
No, from the French.
From the Russians we capture more than that every day.
Mr. Postman.
War is war and schnapps is schnapps, and business must go on.
You didn't leave the mail yet this morning.
Ah, I'm sorry, Mr. Meyer.
Hello, Himmelstoss.
Anything for us today?
- No, no, Master Peter.
- Oh, there must be something.
Here, here you go, young lad.
There.
This is the last mail deliver anyhow.
- What?
- Tomorrow I change uniforms.
- You're going in the army?
- Yes, I was called.
I'm a sergeant in the reserves, you know.
I'll be called my self, if it doesn't end in a few months.
- It will, though.
- I'm sure you're right, Mr. Meyer.
...defending our country, our father land.
Now, my beloved class, this is what we must do.
Strike with all our power.
Give every ounce of strength... to win victory before the end of the year.
It is with reluctance that I bring this subject up again.
You are the life of the fatherland, you boys.
You are the iron men of Germany.
You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy... when you are called upon to do so.
It is not for me to suggest that any of you... should stand up and offer to defend his country.
But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads.
I know that in one of the schools... the boys have risen up in the classroom... and enlisted in a mass.
But, of course, if such a thing should happen here... you would not blame me for a feeling of pride.
Perhaps some will say... that you should not be allowed to go yet... that you are too young, that you have homes, mothers.
Fathers... that you should not be torn away.
Are your fathers so forgetful of their fatherland... that they would let it perish father than you?
Are your mothers so weak that they cannot send a son... to defend the land which gave them birth?
And after all, is a little experience... such a had thing for a boy?
Is the honour of wearing a uniform... something from which we should run?
And if our young ladies glory in those who wear it... is that anything to be ashamed of?
I know you have never desired the adulation of heroes.
That has not been part of my teaching.
We have sought to make ourselves worthy... and let a claim come when it would.
But to he foremost in battle... is a virtue not to be despised.
I believe it will he a quick war... that there will he few losses.
But if losses there must be... then let us remember the Latin phrase... which must have come to the lips of many a Roman... when he stood embattled in a foreign land:
"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."
"Sweet and fitting it is to die for the fatherland."
Some of you may have ambitions.
I know of one young man who has great promise as a writer... and he has written the first act of a tragedy... which would be a credit to one of the masters.
And he is dreaming, I suppose... of following in the footsteps of Goethe and Schiller... and I hope he will.
But now our country calls.
The fatherland needs leaders.
Personal ambition must be thrown aside... in the one great sacrifice for our country.
Here is a glorious beginning to your fives.
The field of honour calls you.
Why are we here?
You, Kropp, what has kept you back?
You, Mueller, you know how much you are needed?
Ah, I see you look at your leader.
And I, too, look to you, Paul Baumer... and I wonder what you are going to do.
- I'll go.
- I want to go.
Count on me.
- Me too.
- I'm ready.
I'm not gonna stay home!
Follow me!
Enlist now!
- No more classes!
- No more classes!
- Don't be a quitter!
- Come on, Behn!
Stick together.
That's what we've got to do.
- Let's all stick together.
- Come on, Behn.
All right.
All right.
- I'll go.
- That's the way!
Let's go!
Hey!
Let's sing!
Come on!
Keep in line there, soldiers.
Anything you say, General.
Detail, halt!
Left face!
Get into uniform, ready to report.
Fall out!
I betcha a place like this gets you in good condition.
You have to be for the long marches.
I'm gonna get in the cavalry and ride.
No cavalry for me.
Infantry's where you see the fighting.
Where are all the guns?
That's what I want to know.
Oh, you don't get a gun for a long while yet.
If I'm gonna bump off the enemy, I gotta have some practice.
Bayonet drill.
That's what I want.
You won a medal that times, Mueller.
You wait.
In about a month I'll be covered with them.
Say, keep your boots out of my face!
Why, it's an Honor to have those boots in your face.
They're the best pair in the army!
My uncle gave them to me.
Just look at that special imported leather.
Put them anyplace you like, except in my face.
Not even a kitchen maid'll look at me in this!
Attention!
Well, for the love of...
It's Himmelstoss!
- So it is.
- And all dressed up.
Hello, Himmie.
You didn't think you'd see me again so soon, did you?
- You see my rank?
- Sure.
Fall back, then!
Himmelstoss, we certainly are glad to see you.
What did you say?
- I was going to say...
- Never mind!
What's the matter with you?
When you address your superior officer, say "sir"!
- Where'd he get such a nice uniform?
- Any mail for us, Himmie?
- Quiet!
- My dear fellow, you're shouting.
Ah, come on, Himmelstoss.
We know ya.
Take off the false whiskers.
- I believe you mean it!
- You'll find out that I mean it.
But only three days ago you were our postman.
Silence!
Come back here!
Line up!
Line up!
Get in some kind of a line!
All of you!
Line up, I say!
What a pretty sight that is!
Have you never heard of standing in line?
You make a fine mess of it.
Well, I'll have to teach you.
We'll append the whole day on it, huh?
You may be stupid but I'm used to that.
And then there'll be plenty of other things too.
Oh, I'll not neglect you.
You're not much to begin with... but I'll do my best.
I see that we have come here with a slight misunderstanding... and we'll correct that, too, won't we, huh?
And the first thing to do is to forget everything you ever knew.
Everything you ever learned, forget!
See?
Forget what you've been and what you think you're going to be.
You're going to be soldiers, and that's all!
I'll take the mother's milk out of you!
I'll make you hard-boiled!
I'll make soldiers out of you or kill you!
Now... salute!
Detachment...
lie down!
Head down!
Keep your head down, Baumer!
Detachment... get up!
Now sing!
Do you call that singing?
Detachment, halt!
So... we have no spirit, huh?
We are in no mood for recreation.
Work is what we want.
Good!
Then we'll go back to work!
Detachment...
lie down!
Keep your head down!
Now sing!
Men... halt!
Order, arms!
Inspection at 3:00.
Dismissed!
Oh, that swine!
That means we get no time off.
It will take four hours to get ready for inspection.
- I'd like to know what's in his mind.
- He hasn't got any!
I'm gonna cut him open sometime and find out!
He's too thick-skinned.
He won't cut.
This is the fourth time he's made me disappoint that poor girl.
Arms!
Order, arms!
Left shoulder, arms!
Squad right.
To the right, march!
Left, left, left, left.
Follow right, march!
Squad, left march!
Forward... march!
Detachment... halt!
Present arms!
Himmelstoss.
Excellent work.
They're going up front tomorrow.
- I recommend leave till midnight.
- Very good, sir.
Left, left, left.
Detachment...
lie down!
Crawl forward!
He spoiled our leave.
I'll never forgive him for that.
- The rat!
- Leave till midnight.
It'll take till midnight to dry our clothes.
There goes the filthy ape now.
While we slave over this mud, he goes off to have a few drinks!
Someday I'm going to take one smack at him... just one.
Me too.
That's gonna be my life's work from now on.
Why only one?
I'm gonna take several.
I might even kick him while he's down I feel mean.
What are you doing?
You're not going to desert, are you?
What?
Listen.
I've got an idea.
Crawl forward!
Lie down!
Lie down!
Crawl forward!
Oh!
What?
Cover!
Paul, you all right?
Behn!
Behn!
Behn!
Come on!
Behn, come on!
You fool!
Behn!
Get up!
Come on.
Sounds like more replacements coming in.
Yeah.
Tjaden must have gone home, for that wood.
There's some more, fresh from the turnip patch.
I suppose this is where we bunk.
That's me, "I. Westhus..."
and this is where I live.
- I didn't know!
- Well, you know now!
Yes.
Yes, of course.
- It's all right.
- Here's a bunk, Paul.
- When did we eat last?
- Don't remind me.
- I was fine until you spoke.
- Where are we anyway?
I don't know.
The name on the railroad station's been shot off.
There must be something to eat somewhere.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll ask those fellas.
Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Westhus.
Oh.
Meet Detering.
A better farmer never lived.
- And Mr. Tjaden.
- Sit down.
You see, we haven't eaten since breakfast.
We thought maybe you could tell us what we ought to do about it.
Eat without further delay.
Well, what's funny about that?
This is a bad town to bring an appetite to, soldier.
We've been here since yesterday morning living on baled hay and razor blades.
We're willing to buy our food.
Where's the canteen?
The only canteen in these regions is out looking for supplies.
- Ever hear of Katczinsky?
- Who?
Katczinsky.
He's uncanny.
If there's any food within 25 miles, he'll be the one to get it.
Attention!
What's this?
Volunteers for the future general's staff.
Sometime I'm gonna take one of you volunteers apart... and find out what makes you leave school and join the army.
At ease.
This is no parade ground.
- Hungry?
- Yes.
Wait!
Wait a minute!
That's no invitation.
- Can you pay?
- Yeah, sure.
I have some money.
No, not money.
That's just pieces of paper.
Have you got any cigarettes, cigars...
- Or soap, cognac...
- Yeah.
- Chewing tobacco?
- Yeah, yeah.
Kat!
Are you crazy?
There ain't enough here for us.
I wish you three would get bumped off.
I'm tired of feeding ya for nothing.
Bring everything you got.
- I'm so hungry...
- I'd be glad to give you...
- Come on!
- Is this enough, sir?
Kat!
- You've got the wiring detail tonight.
- Where?
- Past the graveyard.
- With this bunch?
It's quiet tonight.
You can teach them a couple of things.
Thanks.
I'd rather do it alone.
- These babes get killed off too fast.
- Well, the lorry's waiting.
Last night I was too hungry to sleep... and tonight, when I get the wrinkles out of my gut, they think up wiring duty.
Well, here's your chances, heroes.
For the fatherland!
Come on, get your stuff and let's get out of here.
- Is that any way to drive?
- Let him drive any way he wants.
Suppose he breaks your arm.
You get sent home, don't you?
A lot better than having a hole in your guts.
If there's any of you left, I'll pick you up in the morning.
Well, if that ride you gave us didn't kill us, nothing will.
And be on time.
I don't want to miss my breakfast.
You better wait for your army, Papa.
Here, here.
Don't be so backward.
Listen, children.
All we got to do is to string a little wire.
We pick it up at the dump and carry it to where we need it.
Now, you're gonna see some shell fire, and you're gonna be scared, see?
It's all right, boy.
Get up.
Here.
Never mind.
It's happened to better men than you, and it's happened to me.
When we come back, I'll get you all some nice clean underwear.
That kind of shell you don't have to pay much attention to.
Those big fellas just make a lot of noise and land about... five miles behind the line.
The things we've got to watch out for are the light ones.
They don't give you much warning.
They go "waa-aa-aah zing."
And when you hear that, down!
Mother Earth.
Press yourselves down upon her.
Bury yourselves deep into her.
Just keep your eyes on me.
When you see me flop, you flop... only try to beat me to it.
Now listen.
I'll show you how it's done.
Give me a couple of those.
That's to kill the noise.
Tjaden.
See that?
- What's that mean?
- Bombardment.
My eyes!
I'm blind!
I can't see!
God!
My eyes!
I can't see!
- I can't see!
- It's Behn!
It's Behn!
- I'll go get him...
- You'll get killed!
- Let me...
- Lay down and stay there!
He's dead.
- He's dead!
- Why did you risk your life... bringing him in?
But it's Behn!
- My friend.
- He's a corpse, no matter who it is.
Now, don't any of you ever do that again.
Put him over there.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
All right, come on.
All right, come on.
Get your packs and fall in.
Hurry up!
Come on.
Hurry up.
Make it snappy.
Get your packs and fall in.
Kat, what are we doing?
What's happening?
You heard him.
Orders to march.
- But where to, for the love of...
- Another party.
And this one is gonna last a long time.
Come on.
Here we go.
Company, attention!
Shoulder arms!
March right, march!
Take your hands off that!
- Queen takes it!
- Well, if you think... that's a queen, look again.
Ah, it's a jack.
- Yeah.
- Honest, these cards all look alike.
It's too noisy!
I can't play.
I suppose your delicate nerves...
- Can't stand it.
- Get up!
That's Oscar.
The son of a...
Look at that!
Don't be so snooty.
You may wish you had this back.
About two more days of this... and this rat-bitten and of a piece of bread's gonna taste... like a hunk of fruitcake.
It wouldn't...
It wouldn't last two more days, would it?
Didn't I tell you this was gonna be a bad one?
I don't mind the days so much.
It's keeping up all night...
Ah, two more days makes a week, kid.
Then you can say you've been under fire!
You're not scared, are you?
No.
I was just asking.
That's all.
- Wanna play some more?
- Do you?
- Sure.
- All right.
My deal.
You better get your boot back before Oscar eats that!
The kid's all right.
Yeah, yeah.
Let him sleep.
He's dreaming.
Oh, God.
Can't you see it's Behn?
He didn't want to come to war!
No, no.
It isn't Behn.
It isn't Behn!
It's Kemmerick!
It's me!
Shut up, will you?
It's bad enough in here as it is.
Every...
Everything's all right, Franz.
You're dreaming.
You're just dreaming, I guess.
- Attention!
- At ease.
The barrage is getting worse.
The men in two more dugouts gone.
However, we'll do our best to get some food up here by evening.
Stop!
Stop!
Let me out!
- What did you do that for?
- Shut up!
Grab him.
- No.
- Now hold him.
You all right now?
I think so.
I couldn't hold out much longer.
- Oh, god, it's Franz!
- Get him over there!
No, he's been hit in the stomach.
He can't have anything to drink.
Get a stretcher.
Where'd they get you, Kemmerick?
- Here it is, sir.
- Take his head.
All right.
Take him out.
- Is it serious, sir?
- I'm not sure.
- Tell the others he's all right.
- Yes, sir.
If we're going to fight, why don't we fight?
Why don't we go over?
You could go crazy staying here.
Let's do something!
- Let's go after them!
- Sit down!
If that cook of ours had any guts, he'd try to bring something through.
He's so far behind the lines he can't hear the shooting!
- Here's Kat.
Get anything?
- Any luck?
- We'll have to split this up among us.
- Something to eat!
We need butter too.
Yes.
And dessert.
And a feather bed to sleep on.
- Rats!
Rats!
- Rats!
Get out of the way!
What's that?
Come on!
Grab your rifles!
Come on!
- Here they come.
- Get your grenades here.
Hurry up.
Come on, hurry up.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Back to your own lines!
- Fill it up.
- And hurry up.
I've got other things to do.
I've been waiting for this for three weeks.
When they all get here.
What do you want?
Beans, you homely - looking son of a frog's leg.
- What do you think I want?
- We're hungry.
Shut up!
I'll feed you when you're all here.
- We're all here now.
- Only half the company's here.
Get the rest.
Wake them up.
I wish I could wake them up.
There's 80 of us left.
The rest is in dressing stations or pushing up daisies.
Eighty?
And I cooked for 150!
All right.
We'll have enough for once.
Come on.
Dish out!
You mean you've cooked beans for 150... and you've got bread for 150... and sausage for 150, and tobacco for 150?
Everything!
It's all wrong.
I should have been notified.
What a feast!
Everyone gets two issues.
- Get back in line!
Get back in line!
- Oh, no!
That won't do.
I can't give 80 men what's meant for 150.
Listen.
You drew rations for the 2nd Company, didn't ya?
Yeah.
All right.
We're the 2nd Company.
I've got my orders.
- Kat's right.
- We're the 2nd Company?
And if only half of us get back, that's our good luck.
- Come on.
Dish it out.
- Come on!
- No!
- Hey!
You're the yellowest baboon that ever drew a cook wagon... and you're scared...
it shows.
All we want to hear out of you is one more little yip... and we'll cut ya up and eat ya raw.
Why, you keep your kitchen so far back of the lines... we never get anything to eat until it's cold and we're asleep!
Now, you low-down rat, get out... or we wreck the joint!
- Come on!
Give us...
- Attention!
At ease.
What's going on here?
He's cooked for 150, sir, and he only wants to give us half.
- Looks pretty good.
- Yes, sir.
Serve the whole issue.
- The men can use it.
- Yes, sir.
- And bring me a plate too.
- Yes, sir.
All right.
Take it all.
Take everything.
Give them honey.
Give them what they want.
- Fill it up!
- Fill it up!
- Don't mind me.
- Oh, that's all right.
Don't mention it.
You know...
I could do with some more beans.
Go help yourself.
There's more ever there.
It's too far.
I wonder, when are we going back to the front?
Tomorrow.
It's enough to take away a man's appetite.
You know, if they're gonna march us in again tomorrow... we ought to go see how Kemmerick is.
- That's a good idea.
- Let's do that.
- How far is the dressing station?
- About two miles.
- We could take his things to him.
- Good!
It seemed rotten to think of a thing like that happening to him... a nice fellow like Kemmerick.
Ah, the French certainly deserve to be punished for starting this war.
Everybody says it's somebody else.
Well, how do they start a war?
Well, one country offends another.
How could one country offend another?
You mean there's a mountain over in Germany gets mad... at a field over in France?
Well, stupid, one people offends another.
Oh, if that's it, I shouldn't be here at all.
I don't feel offended.
It don't apply to tramps like you.
Good.
Then I can be going home right away.
- Ah, you just try it.
- Yeah.
You wanna get shot?
The Kaiser and me...
Me and the Kaiser felt just alike about this war.
We didn't either of us want any war, so I'm going home.
- He's there already.
- Somebody must have wanted it.
Maybe it was the English.
No, I don't want to shoot any Englishmen.
I never saw one till I came up here.
And I suppose most of them never saw a German till they came up here.
No, I'm sure they weren't asked about it.
No.
Well... it must be doing somebody some good.
- Not me and the Kaiser.
- I think maybe the Kaiser... wanted a war.
You leave us out of this.
I don't see that.
The Kaiser's got everything he needs.
Well, he never had a war before.
Every full-grown emperor needs one war to make him famous.
- Why, that's history.
- Yeah, generals too.
They need war.
And manufacturers.
They get rich.
I think it's more a kind of fever.
Nobody wants it in particular... and then all at once, there it is.
We didn't want it.
The English didn't want it.
And here we are fighting.
I'll tell you how it should all be done.
Whenever there's a big war coming on...
- You should rope off a big field...
- And sell tickets.
Yeah.
And...
And on the big day... you should take all the kings and their cabinets and their generals... put them in the center dressed in their underpants... and let them fight it out with clubs.
The best country wins.
Well, now that Kat's settled everything, let's go see Kemmerick.
Something interesting might happen on the way.
Might cheer him up.
Boys, me and the Kaiser want you back in time to march tomorrow.
Don't forget.
- We'll be back.
- Give the boy my regards.
There he is.
- Hello, Kemmerick.
- How are you?
How's it going?
How are things going?
Are they looking after you all right?
How are they treating you?
Franz?
They're robbers here.
Robbers.
They stole my watch!
I always told you, nobody should carry as good a watch as that.
- They took it while I was under ether!
- Franz, you'll get it back.
Do you feel all right?
- Just look at my hand.
- That's because you lost... so much blood.
Just eat decently and you'll get well again.
You must eat.
What's the main thing.
It looks good too.
I have such a terrible pain in my foot.
Every toe on my right foot hurts.
Well, how can your foot hurt when your leg's been...
I know what you mean!
I know!
I know now!
They cut my leg off.
Why didn't they tell me?
Why...
Why didn't they tell me?
- Franz!
Franz!
- Now I can't walk anymore!
You must be thankful that you've come off with only that.
I wanted to be a forester once.
You can yet.
They make artificial legs that are wonderful.
And you're through too.
You can go home.
Think of that.
We brought your things for you.
See?
Put them under the bed.
That's a marvellous pair of boots.
Look at that leather!
What comfort.
I was just thinking.
If you're not going to be using these, Franz... why din't you leave them with us?
What good are they to you?
I can use them.
My boots give me blister after blister...
Well, we'll be going, Franz.
Oh, don't go.
Stay just a little while longer.
- I'll come right back.
We'll be coming soon again, Franz.
- I know you'll be feeling better.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Good-bye, Franz.
You think he'll last till after mess?
- I don't think...
- Done for.
Boys, you go along.
I'll see you later.
Good-bye.
All right, Paul.
I'm sorry, Paul.
I wouldn't touch a thing of his if he could use it.
I'd go barefoot over barbed wire for him if it'd do him any good.
Only...
Only why should some orderly get those boots?
I understand, Mueller.
We're all alike out here.
And good boots are scarce.
Tell the doctor to come, please.
Doctor, the man in the next bed would like to see you, sir.
I've done everything I can for him.
There's no helping him.
Poor little fella.
He says next time, Franz.
Do you think I'll ever get well?
Why, of course.
- Do you really think so?
- Sure, once you get... over the operation.
I don't think so.
Franz!
Don't talk nonsense.
Why, you'll be as good as new.
They fix up worse things than that.
Perhaps you'll go to the convalescent home... in Klosterberg among the villagers.
Then you can look out of the windows, across the fields... to the two trees on the horizon.
The loveliest time of the year now when the corn ripens.
You can go out without asking anyone.
You can even play piano if you want to.
Oh...
Oh, but, Franz, you must try to sleep now.
O God... this is Franz Kemmerick... only 19 years old.
He doesn't want to die.
Please don't let him die.
Paul.
- Paul.
- Franz.
Take my boots home for Mueller.
Oh, no, Franz, no.
And if...
Paul... you find my watch, send it home.
Franz!
Doctor!
Doctor!
Doctor!
Doctor!
Where's the doctor?
Why isn't there a doctor here?
Doctor, come quick!
- Franz Kemmerick is dying!
- Which one is that?
- Amputated leg.
- I've amputated a dozen legs today.
- Bed 26, sir.
- You see to it.
I'm due in the operating room.
One operating after another since 5:00 this morning.
Sixteen dead today, and yours is the 17th.
There'll probably be 20 by the morning.
You're looking good.
Very good today.
What's your hurry?
Hey!
I'll bet he stole those boots!
I got it, Kat.
Listen: "The sum of an arithmetic series... is S = A + L x N over 2."
Interesting, isn't it?
What do you wanna learn that stuff for?
One day you'll stop a bullet and it'll all be worthless.
I get a lot of fun out of it.
My boots!
Mueller.
I saw him die.
I didn't know what it was like to die before.
And then... then I came outside... and it felt... it felt so good to be alive that I started in to walk fast.
I began to think of the strangest things... like being out in the fields.
Things like that.
You know... girls.
And it felt as if there were... something electric running from the ground up through me.
And I started.
I began to run hard.
I passed soldiers and I heard voices calling to me.
I ran and I ran.
I felt as if I couldn't breathe enough air into me.
And...
And now I'm hungry.
I don't mind the war now.
Be a pleasure to go to the front in boots like these.
It's a good invention just the same.
If you crack each separate louse, think of all the energy you use up.
Watch.
Burned to death.
How was patrol?
Bad?
Must've been terrible if they had time to gather the harvest.
We passed a cherry tree and when he saw it, he went crazy.
I could hardly drag him away.
It was... beautiful.
I have a big orchard with cherry trees at home.
When they're in full blossom... from the hayloft it looks like one single sheet.
So white.
- Perhaps you can get leave soon.
- You may even be sent... back as a farmer.
A woman can't run a farm alone.
That's no good, you know?
No matter how hard she works.
Harvest coming on again.
What's the matter with him?
Got a letter yesterday from his wife.
He wants to get back to his farm.
We'd all like to get back home.
I wonder what we'd do if it were suddenly peacetime again?
Get drunk and look for women!
I'd go looking for a Cinderella... that could wear this for a garter.
And when I'd found her, nobody'd see me for two weeks.
I'll go back to the peat fields... and those pleasant hours in the beer gardens.
And there's worse things than cobbling too.
Look.
My family.
I oughta give you a kick in the backside for starting all this.
It's all right for all you to talk.
You've got something to go back to.
Wives, children, jobs.
But what about us?
What have we got to go back to?
- School?
- Why not?
You know everything already.
A man can't take all that rubbish they teach you seriously... after three years of shells and bombs.
You can't peel that off easily.
They never taught us anything really useful... like how to light a cigarette in the wind or make a fire out of wet wood... or bayonet a man in the belly instead of the ribs where it gets jammed.
What can happen to us afterwards?
I'll tell you.
Take our class.
Out of 20, three are officers... nine dead...
Mueller and three others wounded... and one in the madhouse.
We'll all be dead someday, so let's forget it.
Hurry up!
Get in there!
Hurry up!
Himmelstoss!
What's up?
- What are you, crazy?
- It's Himmelstoss!
Himmelstoss?
There is justice in the army!
Well, well.
So, we are all here, huh?
A bit longer than you, Himmie.
Since when have we become so familiar?
Stand up and click your heels together!
All of you!
- Take a running jump at yourself!
- Who's your friend?
Would somebody get General Ludendorff a nice, comfortable chair?
I command you as your superior officer!
- Do you want to be court-martialed?
- I do!
There's going to be a big attack tonight... and I'd just love to get out of it.
Kiss my butt!
It isn't customary to ask for salutes here.
But I'll tell you what we'll do.
We're going to attack a town that we tried to take once before.
Many killed and many wounded.
It was great fun.
This time you're going with us.
If any of us stops a bullet, before we die... we're going to come to you, click our heels together and ask stiffly...
"Please, Sergeant Himmelstoss, may we go?"
You'll...
You'll pay for this, you...
There it is.
Right on time.
Better get ready, boys.
I'm wounded!
I'm wounded!
It's just a scratch, you yellow rat!
Up!
Get out with the others!
- Up!
- No!
No!
No!
You yellow rat!
Stinking yellow rat!
Let the others do it, eh?
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!
Forward!
- Get out here.
- Command... was forward.
Command was forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Counterattack.
I want to help you.
I want to help you.
Stop that!
Stop it, stop it.
I can bear the rest of it.
I can't listen to that!
Why do you take so long dying?
You're going to die anyway!
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
You won't die.
Oh, no.
You won't die.
They're only little wounds.
You'll get home.
You'll be all right.
You'll get home long before I will.
You know I can't run away.
That's why you accuse me.
I tell you, I didn't want to kill you.
I tried to keep you alive.
If you jumped in here again, I wouldn't do it.
When you jumped in here you were my enemy, and I was afraid of you.
But you're just a man like me, and I killed you.
Forgive me, comrade.
Say that for me.
Say you forgive me.
Oh, no.
You're dead.
You're better off than I am.
You're through.
They can't do any more to you now.
Oh, God, why did they do this to us?
We only wanted to live, you and I.
Why should they send us out to fight each other?
If we threw away these rifles and these uniforms... you could be my brother just like Kat and Albert.
You'll have to forgive me, comrade.
I'll do all I can.
I'll write to your parents.
I'll write to...
I'll write to your wife.
I'll write to her.
I promise she'll not want for anything.
I'll help her and your parents too.
Only forgive me.
Forgive me!
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Terrible thing happened yesterday.
I stabbed a man.
With my own hands, stabbed him.
I know how it is.
Your first time.
Never mind.
The stretcher-bearers will find him.
- He's dead.
I watched him die.
- You couldn't do anything about it.
We have to kill.
We can't help it.
That's what we are here for.
Look there, for instance.
That got him.
You should've seen how he leaped in the air.
That fellow had to shoot with us for today with three hits.
If he keeps it up, he'll have a decoration for his... buttonhole this evening.
Don't you lose any more sleep over this business.
Maybe it was because I was out there with him so long, huh?
Sure, that's it.
After all, war is war.
March!
Forward!
Forward, march!
Quick there!
Forward!
Company... halt!
Dismissed!
Uncommissioned officers, enlisted men... dismiss!
Come on!
Let's get outta here!
- Give me your best sausage.
- Two.
Give me a beer.
One, two, three!
Hey, come on.
A beer.
Hey, get out of here!
Come on.
Give me a beer.
A beer.
One b... here's hoping we get falling-down drunk tonight.
Here's how it started.
I'd forgotten there were girls like that.
There aren't.
Just look at those thin, little shoes.
She couldn't march many miles in those.
Paul!
Don't speak about marching.
You're boring the young lady.
A thousand pardons.
- How old you think she is?
- Oh, about 22.
No, that'd make her older than us.
She's... 17.
A girl like that.
That'd be good, Albert?
We wouldn't have much of a chance with him around.
We could take a bath wash our clothes...
All right.
And I might even go so far as to get deloused.
Wait a minute!
She's a long way from here now.
Look at the date.
May, 1917.
- Four months ago.
- That's true.
Well, here's to her anyway.
Here's to them all, everywhere.
Albert...
- We might as well wash up anyway.
- All right.
Personally, I like them bigger around.
This conversation was on a high moral plane up to now.
Now we do need a bath.
- A bath?
- For what?
You wouldn't understand.
This water is freezing.
This romantic business has gone too far.
Ahh, but think of her beautiful eyes!
Oh, and her hair.
- Here we are!
- We're not gonna miss a thing!
Go away!
- What are you doing here?
- Bathing!
They tell me there's some people in this world takes a bath every week!
Women!
Mademoiselle, you want to swim?
Mademoiselle!
Aw, baby!
Aw, no, girls!
Don't go away!
Aw, mama!
- Please don't go!
- Don't go away!
Food!
Food!
Halt!
You know you're forbidden to cross.
You fellows stay on this side or you'll get... yourselves in a lot of trouble.
What are they jabbering about?
They want us to swing over tonight.
They're expecting us.
- That's fine!
- We'll do it!
That blonde's crazy about me.
But there's four of us and only three of them.
I was the one that stopped them!
That blonde piece of work is mine.
You three fight for what's left.
Fight's the word.
All's fair in love and war.
What do you mean?
What're you gonna do?
You'll find out.
Au revoir!
Au revoir!
- C'est moi, blondie!
- Bon ami!
Bon ami!
Vos camarades!
Vos camarades!
She means the door.
Not only modest, but dashing!
A perfect fit.
It might've been made for me.
An officer's coat.
We're calling distinguished company.
Merci.
Have another little drink, comrade.
Is this your birthday or mine?
Why?
You've been buying me drink after drink for two hours.
What I'm trying to figure out is why.
Why?
Why?
Oh.
I it's just that the boys... told me to amuse you for a little while.
Oh, nice boys.
They...
They said you'd understand.
I've been betrayed!
Yeah, you certainly have.
Take that for a minute!
I'll give you more!
It's too loud.
Suzanne.
And I wouldn't even know you if I did.
And yet, I'll remember you always.
Toujours.
Oh, if you could only know how different this is... from the women we soldiers meet.
You.
That's what I'm talking about.
Vous.
It seems as though all war and terror and grossness... had fallen away from me... like a miracle.
Like something I never believed.
Pauvre gar‡on.
Pauvre gar‡on.
Frau Paul.
We're going, Paul.
Have a look.
Nice, new coffins.
Huh!
For us.
I must say, that's a very cheerful preparation for this offensive.
That's very considerate of them.
But I don't see any long... enough for our comrade Tjaden.
Mind you, I'm not speaking to you, you traitors.
- But no coffin's gonna get me.
- I should say not, heartbreaker.
You'll be thankful if they slip a waterproof sheet... around that Aunt Sally of a carcass of yours.
Oh...
Oh, my side!
My side.
Catholic hospital, Albert.
They say you always get good food and good treatment.
- We're lucky.
- After that rainy dressing station... and 24 hours on the train, we deserve to have some luck.
I'm Hamacher.
Yeah, that's my name.
I got a crack in the head and they gave me a certificate stating...
"Josef Hamacher is periodically... not responsible for his actions."
And ever since then, Hamacher has been having a grand time.
I hope you boys are not too badly wounded.
The others die off so quickly we don't have time to get acquainted.
You'll get to know us...
very well.
Thank you.
You too.
I'm sorry, my dear.
It's time to go now.
Yes, sister.
Watch.
If they take his clothes away, you've seen the last of him.
See?
They're taking him to the dying room.
Dying room?
When you're ready to kick the bucket, they get you out... of the way so they can use the bed.
In the corner of the building there's a little room... right next to the morgue!
It's so convenient.
It saves a lot of trouble.
But suppose he gets well?
I've seen a lot of them go in that dying room... but nobody ever comes back.
Sister.
Sister.
Sister.
- Is that you ringing, Paul?
- Yes.
- Is something going on?
- I think I have a haemorrhage.
The bandage is all wet.
I've been ringing forever and nobody comes.
I think I'm bleeding.
Sister, get me a sterile dressing and an ice pack.
- Why didn't someone call me?
- He's been ringing.
Nobody can walk, Sister.
- Sister, is it bad?
- No.
No, we'll be all right.
We've got it in time.
What's the matter?
What are you doing?
We must rearrange your bandages.
Where are you taking me?
To the bandaging ward.
No, no!
I'm not going!
I'm staying here!
Paul!
Paul!
- Now, now!
- I'm not going to the dying room!
- We're going to the bandaging ward.
- Why are you taking my clothes?
You're lying to me!
But I'll come back.
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'm not going to die!
I'll come back!
Sister Libertine, how is he?
Poor boy.
They had to amputate his leg.
Paul.
Paul.
Paul.
Oh, he is... gone.
Gone.
Hello.
Welcome home, Albert!
- How do you fell, kid?
- All right.
But I've got such an awful pain.
My foot hur...
Hamacher.
Did they cut my leg off?
Of course not!
How many did you have?
Two?
You still got them!
One, two!
Don't play the fool, Hamacher.
Tell me truthfully.
Of course not.
And you look fine.
Look.
See?
- I won't be a cripple.
- Now, now.
- I won't live like that!
- Be calm.
I'll kill myself the first chance I get!
Albert!
- I won't live!
I won't live!
- Yes, you will.
Albert!
Albert!
Albert, I've come back!
I told you I'd come back.
Look, everybody!
I've come back!
Paul.
Paul.
That's not where I'm going.
I live over there.
Paul, I'm so happy.
Hamacher, I've come back from the dead!
It's most irregular.
Never happened before.
Albert, get well quickly... so we can go home soon.
- Everything will be all right now.
- Yes, Paul.
Everything will be all right...
now.
Oh!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul.
- What's the matter, Paul?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
Paul.
Give me your hanky chief.
- Mother?
- Here I am, Paul.
Here I am.
Mother's ill.
- Are you wounded?
- No, Mother.
I got leave.
Here I am crying instead of being glad.
Anna, get down the jar of blackberries.
You still like them, don't you?
Yes, Mother.
I haven't had any for a long time.
We might almost have known you were coming.
- I'm making potato cakes.
- Don't let them burn.
Paul... sit down... beside me.
My Paul.
My baby.
I almost forgot, Mother.
I've got some little presents for you.
Look, Mother.
Bread, sausage and rice.
Paul, you've been starving yourself.
Hadn't I better go and tell father Paul's home?
Paul could watch the things on the stove.
No, I'm getting up.
Oh, Paul, you're a soldier now, aren't you?
But somehow, I don't seem to know you.
I'll take these off, mother.
I'll get your suit.
It's in the wardrobe, just where you left it.
Are you really here, Paul?
You won't...
You won't disappear, will you?
No.
I'm here.
Your things are ready for you, Paul.
I remember when you caught that one.
Yes.
And you took it away from me, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
We're behind the lines, but we know how to honour the soldier... who goes on in spite of blood and death.
Gentlemen, my son.
- Prosit.
- Prosit.
Cheers.
I'm glad to know you, young man, I am glad to know you.
How are things out there?
Terrible, eh?
Terrible.
But we must carry on.
After all, you do at least get decent food out there.
Naturally, it's worse here.
Naturally.
But the best for our soldiers all the time.
That's our motto.
The best for our soldiers.
But... you must give the Frenchies a good licking!
And, if you boys want to come home... let me show you what you must do before you can come home.
Give us a hand there, men.
Now, then, there's the line.
Runs so, in a "V".
Here is St. Quentin.
You can see for yourself.
You're almost through now.
All right?
Shove ahead out there and don't stick to that... everlasting French warfare!
Smash through the johnnies!
And then you will have peace.
When you get in it... the war isn't the way it looks back here.
Oh!
You don't know anything about it.
Of course, you know about the details... but this relates to the whole!
You can't judge that.
Of course, you do your duty and you risk your life.
But for that, you receive the highest honour.
I said that every man in the war ought to have the Iron cross.
First, the enemy lines must be broken through in Flanders.
- On to Paris!
Push on to Paris!
- Right.
No, not in Flanders.
I'll tell you just where the... break should come.
Here.
The enemy has too many reserves there.
- I insist upon Flanders!
- Why should they do that... when they're halfway through St. Quentin already?
Because Flanders is a flat country!
- No mountains, no obstructions!
- There's too many rivers there!
From the farms they have gone;... from the schools, from the factories.
They have gone bravely, nobly, ever forward... realizing there is no other duty now but to save the fatherland.
Paul!
How are you, Paul?
Glad to see you, Professor.
You've come at the right moment, Baumer!
Just at the right moment.
And as if to prove all have said, here is one of the first to go.
A lad who sat before me on these very benches... who gave up all to serve in the first year of the war... one of the iron youth who have made Germany invincible in the field.
Look at him... sturdy and bronze and clear-eyed.
The kind of soldier every one of you should envy.
Oh, lad, you must speak to them.
You must tell them what it means to serve your fatherland.
- No, I can't tell them anything.
- You must, Paul.
Just a word...
Just tell them how much they're needed out there.
Tell them why you went and what it meant to you.
I can't say anything.
You can remember some deed of heroism, some touch of nobility.
Tell about it.
I can't tell you anything you don't know.
We live in the trenches out there.
We fight.
We try not to be killed, sometimes we are.
That's all.
No.
No, Paul.
I've been there!
I know what it's like.
That's not what one dwells on, Paul.
I heard you in here reciting that same old stuff... making more iron men, more young heroes.
You still think it's beautiful and sweet to die... for your country, don't you?
We used to think you knew.
The first bombardment taught us better.
It's dirty and painful to die for your country.
When it comes to dying for your country... it's better not to die at all!
There are millions out there dying for their countries... and what good is it?
Paul!
You asked me to tell them how much they're needed out there.
He tells you, "Go out and die."
Oh, but if you'll pardon me, it's easier to say "Go out and die"
than it is to do it.
Coward!
And it's easier to say it than to watch it happen.
No!
No!
Boys, boys!
- I'm sorry, Baumer, but I must say...
- It's no use talking like this.
You won't know what I mean.
Only, it's been a long while since we enlisted out of this classroom.
So long I thought maybe the whole world had learned by this time.
Only now they're sending babies, and they won't last a week!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
Up at the front you're alive or you're dead, and that's all!
You can't fool anybody about that very long.
Up there we know we're lost and done for whether we're dead or alive.
Three years we've had of it... four years.
Every day a year and every night a century.
Our bodies are earth and our thoughts are clay... and we sleep and eat with death.
We're done for because you can't live that way... and keep anything inside you!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
I'll go back tomorrow.
I've got four days more, but I can't stand it here!
I'll go back tomorrow!
Sorry.
Mother, you'll catch clod here.
You must go to sleep.
There'll be plenty of time to sleep... when you're gone.
Must you go tomorrow, Paul?
Must you?
Yes, Mother.
Orders were changed.
Are you very much afraid, Paul?
No, Mother.
There's something I want to say to you, Paul.
It's...
Just be on your guard against the women out there.
They're no good.
Where we are, there aren't any women, Mother.
Be very careful at the front, Paul.
Yes, Mother, I will.
I'll pray for you every day.
And if you could, get a job that's not quite so dangerous.
Yes, Mother.
I'll try and get in the cookhouse.
- That can easily be done.
- You do it then, and if...
- The others say anything...
- That won't worry me, Mother.
Now, you must go to bed and you must get well... quickly before I come back.
I put two sets of underwear...
new ones... in your pack.
They'll keep you nice and warm.
They're all wool.
That's sweet of you.
Good night...
my son.
Good night, Mother.
Oh, Mother, Mother.
You still think I'm a child.
Why can't I put my head in your lap and cry?
- Is this the 2nd Company?
- Yes, sir.
- Is this all of it?
- Yes, sir.
We had 150 men, but this is all that came back yesterday.
But now they're going to give us enough to make 150 again.
How old are you?
Sixteen.
No use.
I couldn't find anything.
We'll have to eat the sawdust.
Not me!
I'll go hungry first.
It makes me sick.
Now it's gonna be a real war again.
Paul!
How's old Paul?
Here I am.
You know, the 2nd Company's getting hard to find.
Nobody seemed to know where you were.
I'm glad you found it.
I guess I don't get much of this.
There used to be some food in the sawdust.
Now it's all sawdust.
No joke, either.
Eats ya up inside.
This doesn't look much like the old 2nd Company.
The replacements are all like that.
Not even old enough to carry a pack.
All they know how to do is die.
I guess... some of the old-timers are here yet.
Paul, they're trying to invent something to kill me right now.
Where's Westhus?
Messenger dog was wounded.
He went out to get it.
- Is it true about the armistice?
- Doesn't look that way back there.
You mean they want us to go on fighting?
That's what they say.
They're crazy!
Germany'll be empty pretty soon.
Where is...
Where is Detering?
He got homesick.
You remember about the cherry blossoms?
I guess he never got over that.
He started out one night to go home and help his wife with the farm.
They got him behind the lines, and we never heard of him since.
He was just homesick, but probably they couldn't see it that way.
Where's Kat?
Is he...
Not Kat!
If he were out, the war would be over.
You remember what he always says:
They're saving him for the last.
- Where is he?
- He's out looking for food... something to make soup with.
- Which way?
- Down the road about... two miles that way.
I'll see you later.
Kat!
Paul!
Hello, Paul.
- How's the side?
- Oh, it's all right now.
It's fine.
- Have any luck?
- No, the general's staff's been... over this country with a rake.
Let's sit down there.
Tell me, Paul... how was it at home?
Have a good leave?
- In spots.
- What's the matter?
I'm no good for back there anymore, Kat.
None of us are.
We've been in this too long.
The young men thought I was a coward because I told them that... we learn that death is stronger than duty to one's country.
The old men said "Go on.
Push on to Paris."
My father even wanted me to wear my uniform around him.
It's not home back there anymore.
All I could think of was, "I'd like to get back and see Kat again."
You're all I've got left, Kat.
I'm not much to have left.
I missed you, Paul.
At least we know what it's all about out here.
There're no lies here.
Push on to Paris?
You ought to see what they've got on the other side.
They eat white bread over there.
They've got dozens of airplanes to our one... and tanks that'll go over anything.
What've we got left?
Guns so worn they drop shells on our own men.
No food, no ammunition, no officers.
Push on to Paris!
So that's the way they talk back there.
I guess we'd better be going.
How I lied to my poor mother.
I told her it wasn't so bad out here because there was... always a lot of us together.
Now that I'm with you, I'm beginning to believe that I told her the truth.
Down!
That's another one that missed us.
Come on.
Let's go.
Wait a minute.
Looks like the old bread wagon's broke down.
I guess I don't walk the rest of the way.
Did that get ya, Kat?
Aah, I think it broke my shin.
That's not so bad.
Hold it together.
- Just my luck?
- Good luck.
That means the war is over.
Oh, no, sir!
This war don't end till they really get me.
Now this one...
Easy, now.
- Hey!
- Easy!
Easy!
Come on.
I'll take you in.
Give me your hand.
Easy.
All right.
Well, kid... now we're gonna be separated.
Maybe we can do something together later on when the war is over.
Yes, kid.
You give me your address, I'll give you mine.
You can't get both of us in one day.
Ah, we'll surely see each other again, Kat.
Remember that day when you brought the whole pig into the factory?
And that day in the woods when you taught us how to dodge shells?
And my first bombardment.
How I cried.
I was a young recruit then.
Here we are.
Here we are.
All right now, Kat.
You could've spared yourself the trouble.
He's dead.
Oh, no.
He's just fainted.
He was hit in the shin.
He's dead.
Would you like to take his pay book?
- You're not related, are you?
- No, we're not related.
Your deal.
Get his name and number?
Yeah, Corporal Stanislaus Katczinsky, 306.
THE END
Thirty thousand.
From the Russians?
No, from the French.
From the Russians, we capture more than that every day.
Mr. Postman.
War is war and schnapps is schnapps, but business must go on.
You didn't leave the mail yet this morning.
Ah, I'm sorry, Mr. Meyer.
Hello, Himmelstoss.
Anything for us today?
No, no, Master Peter.
C'mon, there must be something.
Here, here you go, young rascal.
(LAUGHING)
There.
This is the last mail I deliver, anyhow.
What?
Tomorrow I change uniform.
You're going in the army?
Yes, I was called.
I'm a sergeant in the reserves, you know.
I'll be called myself, if it doesn't end in a few months.
It will, though.
I'm sure you're right, Mr. Meyer.
(MARCHING BAND APPROACHING)
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
...and join the mighty army that is defending our country, our fatherland.
Now, my beloved class, this is what we must do.
Strike with all our power.
Give every ounce of strength to win victory before the end of the year.
It is with reluctance that I bring this subject up again.
You are the life of the fatherland, you boys.
You are the iron men of Germany.
You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy when you are called upon to do so.
It is not for me to suggest that any of you should stand up and offer to defend his country.
But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads.
I know that in one of the schools the boys have risen up in the classroom and enlisted in a mass.
But, of course, if such a thing should happen here you would not blame me for a feeling of pride.
Perhaps some will say that you should not be allowed to go yet, that you are too young, that you have homes, mothers, fathers, that you should not be torn away.
Are your fathers so forgetful of their fatherland that they would let it perish rather than you?
Are your mothers so weak that they cannot send a son to defend the land which gave them birth?
And after all, is a little experience such a bad thing for a boy?
Is the honor of wearing a uniform something from which we should run?
And if our young ladies glory in those who wear it, is that anything to be ashamed of?
I know you have never desired the adulation of heroes.
That has not been part of my teaching.
We have sought to make ourselves worthy and let acclaim come when it would.
But to be foremost in battle is a virtue not to be despised.
I believe it will be a quick war, that there will be few losses.
But if losses there must be, then let us remember the Latin phrase which must have come to the lips of many a Roman when he stood embattled in a foreign land,
"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."
"Sweet and fitting it is to die for the fatherland."
Some of you may have ambitions.
I know of one young man who has great promise as a writer and he has written the first act of a tragedy which would be a credit to one of the masters.
And he is dreaming, I suppose, of following in the footsteps of Goethe and Schiller, and I hope he will.
But now our country calls.
The fatherland needs leaders.
Personal ambition must be thrown aside in the one great sacrifice for our country.
Here is a glorious beginning for your lives.
The field of honor calls you.
Why are we here?
You, Kropp, what has kept you back?
You, Mueller, you know how much you are needed?
Ah, I see you look at your leader.
And I, too, look to you, Paul Bäumer, and I wonder what you are going to do.
I'll go.
I want to go.
Count on me.
Me, too.
I'm ready.
I'm not gonna stay home.
(ALL CHANTING)
Follow me!
Enlist now!
No more classes!
Don't be a quitter.
Come on, Behn!
Stick together.
That's what we've got to do.
Let's all stick together.
Come on, Behn.
All right.
All right.
I'll go.
That's the way!
Let's go!
Sing!
Let's sing!
Come on!
(ALL SINGING IN GERMAN)
Keep in line, there, soldiers.
(LAUGHING) Anything you say, General.
Detail, halt!
Left face!
Get into uniform, ready to report.
Fall out.
(ALL EXCLAIMING EXClTEDLY)
I bet you a place like this gets you in good condition.
You have to be for the long marches.
I'm gonna get in the cavalry and ride.
No cavalry for me.
Infantry's where you see the fighting.
Where are all the guns?
That's what I want to know.
Oh, you don't get a gun for a long while yet.
Well, if I'm gonna bump off the enemy, I gotta have some practice.
Ow!
Bayonet drill.
That's what I want.
(EXCLAIMS)
You won a medal that time, Mueller.
You wait.
In about a month, I'll be covered with them.
Say, keep your boots out of my face.
Why, it's an honor to have those boots in your face.
They're the best pair in the army.
My uncle gave them to me.
Just look at that special imported leather.
Put them anyplace you like, except in my face.
Not even a kitchen maid'll look at me in this.
Attention!
Well, for the love of...
It's Himmelstoss!
So it is.
And all dressed up.
Hello, Himmie.
You didn't think you'd see me again so soon, did you?
You see my rank?
Sure.
Fall back, then!
Himmelstoss, we certainly are glad to see you.
What did you say?
I was going to say...
Never mind!
What's the matter with you, Himmelstoss?
When you address your superior officer, say "sir."
Where'd he get such a nice uniform?
Will there be any mail for us, Himmie?
Quiet!
My dear fellow, you're shouting.
Come on, Himmelstoss.
We know you.
Take off the false whiskers.
I believe you mean it.
You'll find out that I mean it.
But only three days ago you were our postman.
Silence!
Come back here!
Line up!
Line up!
Get in some kind of a line!
Don't even think about it.
All of you!
Line up, I say!
(LAUGHING)
Hmm.
What a pretty sight that is.
Have you never heard of standing in line?
You make a fine mess of it.
Well, I'll have to teach you.
We'll spend the whole day on it, huh?
You may be stupid, but I'm used to that.
And then there'll be plenty of other things, too.
Oh, I'll not neglect you.
Hmm.
You're not much to begin with, but I'll do my best.
I see that we have come here with a slight misunderstanding, and we'll correct that, too, won't we, huh?
And the first thing to do is to forget everything you ever knew.
Everything you ever learned, forget!
See?
Forget what you've been and what you think you're going to be.
You're going to be soldiers, and that's all!
I'll take the mother's milk out of you.
I'll make you hard-boiled.
I'll make soldiers out of you or kill you!
Now, salute!
Attention!
Detachment, lie down!
Down!
Head down!
Keep your head down, Bäumer!
Detachment, get up!
Advance!
(G iving MARCHING ORDERS)
Now, sing!
(ALL SINGING DISl NTERESTEDLY)
Do you call that singing?
Detachment, halt!
So, we have no spirit, huh?
We are in no mood for recreation.
Work is what we want.
Good!
Then we'll go back to work.
Detachment, lie down!
Keep your head down.
Now, sing!
(ALL SINGING LOU DLY IN GERMAN)
Men, halt!
Order, arms!
Inspection at 3: 00.
Dismissed!
(INDISTINCT)
Oh, that swine!
That means we get no time off.
It will take four hours to get ready for inspection.
I'd like to know what's in his mind.
He hasn't got any!
I'm gonna cut him open sometime and find out.
He's too thick-skinned.
He won't cut.
This is the fourth time he's made me disappoint that poor girl.
Arms!
Order, arms!
Left shoulder, arms!
Squad, right.
To the right, march!
Left, left, left, left.
Column, left, march!
Left, hut...
Squad, left march!
Forward, march!

Detachment, halt!
Present arms!
Himmelstoss.
Excellent work.
They're going up front tomorrow.
I recommend leave till midnight.
HIMMELSTOSS:
Very good, sir.
Left shoulders, arms!
Forward march.
Left, left, straight ahead!
Now, left.
We're clear.
(LAUGHING)
HIMMELSTOSS:
Left, left, left.
Detachment, lie down!
Crawl forward!
He spoiled our leave.
I'll never forgive him for that.
The rat!
Leave till midnight.
(SCOFFS)
It'll take till midnight to dry our clothes.
There goes the filthy ape now.
While we slave over this mud, he goes off to have a few drinks.
Someday I'm going to take one smack at him, just one.
Me, too.
That's gonna be my life's work from now on.
Why only one?
I'm gonna take several.
I might even kick him when he's down.
I feel mean.
What are you doing?
You're not going to desert, are you?
What?
Listen.
I've got an idea.
(INDISTINCT)
(MUMBLING INDISTINCTLY)

You all right?
Behn!

Come on!
Behn, come on.
You fool, Behn.
Get up!
Come on.
Sounds like more replacements coming in.
Yeah.
Tjaden must have gone home for that wood.
Here's some more, fresh from the turnip patch.
I suppose this is where we bunk.
That's me, "I. Westhus,"
and this is where he lives.
I didn't know.
Well, you know now.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
It's all right.
Here's a bunk, Paul.
When did we eat last?
Don't remind me.
I was fine until you spoke.
Where are we, anyway?
I don't know.
The name on the railroad station's been shot off.
Well, there must be something to eat somewhere.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll ask those fellows.
Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Westhus.
Oh, meet Detering.
A better farmer never lived.
And Mr. Tjaden.
Sit down.
You see, we haven't eaten since breakfast.
We thought maybe you could tell us what we ought to do about it.
Eat without further delay.
(LAUGHING)
Well, what's funny about that?
This is a bad town to bring an appetite to, soldier.
We've been here since yesterday morning and we've been living on baled hay and razor blades.
We're willing to buy our food.
Where's the canteen?
(LAUGHING)
The only canteen in these regions is out looking for supplies.
Ever hear of Katczinsky?
Who?
Katczinsky.
He's uncanny.
If there's any food within 25 miles, he'll be the one to get it.
Hey!
(GRUNTS)
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Attention!
(LAUGHING)
What is this?
Volunteers for the future general staff.
Sometime I'm gonna take one of you volunteers apart and find out what makes you leave school and join the Army.
At ease.
This is no parade ground.
Hungry?
ALL:
Yes.
Wait!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
That's no invitation.
Can you pay?
Yeah, sure.
I have some money.
No, not money.
That's just pieces of paper.
Have you got any cigarettes, cigars, or soap, cognac...
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Chewing tobacco?
Yeah, yeah.
TJADEN:
Hey, Kat!
Yeah?
Are you crazy?
There ain't enough here for us.
I wish you three would get bumped off.
I'm tired of feeding you for nothing.
Bring everything you've got.
SOLDIER 1:
I'm so hungry...
SOLDIER 2:
I'd be glad to give you...
Come on!
Is this enough, sir?
(ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
Kat!
Hmm?
You've got the wiring detail tonight.
Where?
Past the graveyard.
With this bunch?
It's quiet tonight.
You can teach them a couple of things.
Thanks.
I'd rather do it alone.
These babes get killed off too fast.
Well, the lorry's waiting.
Last night I was too hungry to sleep and tonight, when I get the wrinkles out of my gut, they think up wiring duty.
Well, here's your chance, heroes.
For the fatherland!
Come on, get your stuff and let's get out of here.
Is that any way to drive?
Let him drive any way he wants.
Suppose he breaks your arm.
You get sent home, don't you?
A lot better than having a hole in your guts.
If there's any of you left, I'll pick you up in the morning.
Well, if that ride you gave us didn't kill us, nothing will.
And be on time.
I don't want to miss my breakfast.
Yeah?
You better wait for your army, Papa.
(LAUGHS)
Here, here.
Don't be so backward.
Listen, children.
All we got to do is to string a little wire.
We pick it up at the dump and carry it to where we need it.
Now, you're gonna see some shellfire, and you're gonna be scared, see?
(BOMB WHISTLING)
(EXPLOSION IN DISTANCE)
It's all right, boy.
Get up.
Here.
Never mind.
It's happened to better men than you, and it's happened to me.
When we come back, I'll get you all some nice clean underwear.
That kind of shell you don't have to pay much attention to.
Those big fellows just make a lot of noise and land about five miles behind the line.
The things we've got to watch out for are the light ones.
They don't give you much warning.
They go "waah zing."
And when you hear that, down!
Mother Earth.
Press yourselves down upon her.
Bury yourselves deep into her.

But it's Behn.

You heard him.

And this one is gonna last a long time.

Here we go.

Don't be so snooty.
You may wish you had this back.
About two more days of this and this rat-bitten end of a piece of bread's gonna taste just like a hunk of fruitcake.
It wouldn't...
It wouldn't last two more days, would it?
Didn't I tell you this was gonna be a bad one?
I don't mind the days so much.
It's keeping up all night that's...
Two more days makes a week, kid.
Then you can say you've been under fire.
You're not scared, are you?
No.
I was just asking, that's all.
Want to play some more?
Do you?
Sure.

You better get your boot back before Oscar eats that.

He's dreaming.
Behn.

Oh, God.
Can't you see it's Behn?
He didn't want to come to war.
No, no.
It isn't Behn.
It isn't Behn!
It's Kemmerick!
It's me!
Shut up, will you?
It's bad enough in here as it is.

Everything's all right, Franz.
You're dreaming.
I see something.
You're just dreaming, I guess.

The barrage is getting worse.
Men in two more dugouts, gone.
However, we'll do our best to get some food up here by evening.
(WHIMPERING)
(SCREAMING)
(SCREAMS) Stop!
(ALL CLAMORING)
Let me out.
What did you do that for?
Shut up!
Grab him.
No.
Now hold him.
(SOLDIERS WHIMPERING)
You all right now?
I think so.
I couldn't hold out much longer.
(SCREAMING)
Let me out!
It's going to kill me!
PAUL:
Very good.
Oh, my God, it's Franz!
This is terrible!
No, don't.
He's been hit in the stomach.
He can't have anything to drink.
Get a stretcher.
Where'd they get you, Kemmerick?
Here it is, sir.
Take his head.
All right.
Take him out.
Is it serious, sir?
I'm not sure.
Tell the others he's all right.
Yes, sir.
(EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE)
If we're going to fight, why don't we fight?
Why don't we go over?
You could go crazy staying here.
Let's do something!
Let's go after them!
Sit down!
If that cook of ours had any guts, he'd try to bring something through.
He's so far behind the lines he can't hear the shooting!
Here's Kat.
Get anything?
Any luck?
We'll have to split this up among us.
Something to eat!
(ALL CLAMORING)
We need butter, too.
Yes.
And dessert.
And a feather bed to sleep on.
SOLDIER 1:
Rats!
SOLDIER 2:

(EXPLOSIONS STOP)
What's that?
(WHISTLE BLOWING)
Come on!
Come on!

We've got a lift from cavalry.
Now, then.
(EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE)
(CONTINUOUS GUNFIRE)
(MEN SINGING IN GERMAN)
Fill it up.
And hurry up.
I've got other things to do.
I've been waiting for this for three weeks.
When they all get here.
What do you want?
Beans, you homely-looking son of a frog's leg.
What do you think I want?
MEN:
We're hungry.
(MEN CLAMORING)
Shut up!
I'll feed you when you're all here.
We're all here now.
Only half the company's here.
Get the rest.
Wake 'em up.
(LAUGHS) Yeah.
I wish I could wake 'em up.
There's 80 of us left.
The rest is in dressing stations or pushing up daisies.
Eighty?
And I cooked for 150!
All right.
We'll have enough for once.
Come on, dish out!
You mean, you've cooked beans for 150, and you've got bread for 150, and sausage for 150, and tobacco for 150?
Everything!
It's all wrong.
I should have been notified.
What a feast!
Everyone gets two issues.
Hey, get back in line!
Get back in line!
Oh, no!
That won't do.
I can't give 80 men what's meant for 150.
Listen.
You drew rations for the 2nd Company, didn't you?
Yeah.
All right.
We're the 2nd Company.
I've got my orders.
Kat's right.
We're the 2nd Company.
And if only half of us get back, that's our good luck.
Come on.
Dish it out.
Come on!
No!
Hey!
You're the yellowest baboon that ever drew a cook wagon and you're scared it shows.
All we want to hear out of you is one more little yip and we'll cut you up and eat you raw.
Why, you keep your kitchen so far back of the lines we never get anything to eat until it's cold and we're asleep!
Now, you low-down rat, get out or we wreck the joint, so help us.
(ALL SHOUTING) Come on!
Give us our food.
SOLDIER:
Attention!
At ease.
What's going on here?
He's cooked for 150, sir, and he only wants to give us half.
Looks pretty good.
Yes, sir.
Serve the whole issue!
The men can use it.
Yes, sir.
And bring me a plate, too.
Yes, sir.
All right.
Take it all.
Take everything.
Give 'em honey.
Give 'em what they want.
Fill it up!
Fill it up!
Fill it up!
Anybody else?
All I want is to get going.
Don't mind me.
Oh, that's all right.
Don't mention it.
You know,
I could do with some more beans.
Go help yourself.
There's more over there.
(GROANS)
It's too far.
(KAT LAUGHING)
I wonder, when are we going back to the front?
Tomorrow.
It's enough to take away a man's appetite.
You know, if they're gonna march us in again tomorrow, we ought to go see how Kemmerick is.
That's a good idea.
Let's do that.
How far is the dressing station?
About two miles.
We could take his things to him.
Good.
It seemed rotten to think of a thing like that happening to him, a nice fellow like Kemmerick.
The French certainly deserve to be punished for starting this war.
Everybody says it's somebody else.
Well, how do they start a war?
Well, one country offends another.
How could one country offend another?
You mean, there's a mountain over in Germany gets mad at a field over in France?
(ALL CHUCKLE)
Well, stupid, one people offends another.
Oh, if that's it, I shouldn't be here at all.
I don't feel offended.
It don't apply to tramps like you.
Good.
Then I can be going home right away.
You just try it.
KAT:
Yeah.
You want to get shot?
The Kaiser and me... (ALL EXCLAIMING)
Me and the Kaiser felt just alike about this war.
We didn't either of us want any war, so I'm going home.
He's there already.
Somebody must have wanted it.
Maybe it was the English.
No, I don't want to shoot any Englishmen.
I never saw one till I came up here.
And I suppose most of them never saw a German till they came up here.
No, I'm sure they weren't asked about it.
No.
Well, it must be doing somebody some good.
Not me and the Kaiser.
I think maybe the Kaiser wanted a war.
You leave us out of this.
I don't see that.
The Kaiser's got everything he needs.
Well, he never had a war before.
Every full-grown emperor needs one war to make him famous.
Why, that's history.
Yeah, generals, too.
They need war.
And manufacturers.
They get rich.
Hmm.
I think it's more a kind of fever.
Nobody wants it in particular and then, all at once, here it is.
We didn't want it.
The English didn't want it.
And here we are fighting.
I'll tell you how it should all be done.
Whenever there's a big war coming on, you should rope off a big field...
And sell tickets.
Yeah.
And...
And on the big day you should take all the kings and their cabinets and their generals, put them in the center dressed in their underpants and let them fight it out with clubs.
The best country wins.
(ALL AGREEING)
Well, now that Kat's settled everything, let's go see Kemmerick.
Might cheer him up.
Something interesting might happen on the way.
Boys, me and the Kaiser want you back in time to march tomorrow.
Don't forget.
We'll be back.
Give the boy my regards.
Whoa.
Oh, there he is.
Hello, Kemmerick.
How are you?
How's it going?
How are things going?
Are they looking after you all right?
How are they treating you?
Franz?
I'm all right.
They're robbers here.
Robbers.
They stole my watch.
I always told you nobody should carry as good a watch as that.
And they took it while I was under ether.
Franz.
Franz.
You'll get it back.
Do you feel all right?
Just look at my hand, though.
That's because you lost so much blood.
Just eat decently and you'll get well again.
Oh, no.
Franz, you must eat.
That's the main thing.
It looks good, too.
I have such a terrible pain in my foot.
Every toe on my right foot hurts.
Well, how can your foot hurt when your leg's been...
Oh, I know what you mean!
I know!
I know now!
They've cut my leg off.
Why didn't they tell me?
Franz!
Franz!
...they tell me.
Now I can't walk anymore!
Franz, you must be thankful that you've come off with only that.
I wanted to be a forester once.
You can yet.
They make artificial legs that are wonderful.
And you're through, too.
You can go home.
Think of that.
We brought your things for you.
See?
Put them under the bed.
That's a marvelous pair of boots.
Look at that leather.
What comfort.
I was just thinking.
If you're not going to be using these, Franz, why don't you leave them with us?
What good are they to you?
I can use 'em.
My boots give me blister after blister.
Well, we'll be going, Franz.
Oh, don't go.
Stay just a little while longer.
I'll come right back.
We'll be coming soon again, Franz.
I know you'll be feeling better, Franz.
Bye.
Bye.
Goodbye, Franz.
You think he'll last till after mess?
You don't think...
Done for.
PAUL:
Boys, you go along.
I'll see you later.
SOLDIER 1:
Goodbye.
All right, Paul.
SOLDIER 2:
Goodbye, Paul.
I'm sorry, Paul.
I wouldn't touch a thing of his if he could use it.
I'd go barefoot over barbed wire for him if it'd do him any good.
Only why should some orderly get those boots?
I understand, Mueller.
We're all alike out here.
And good boots are scarce.
Tell the doctor to come, please.
Doctor, the man in the next bed would like to see you, sir.
I've done everything I can for him.
There's no helping him.
Poor little fellow.
He says next time, Franz.
Do you think I'll ever get well?
Why, of course.
Do you really think so?
Sure, once you get over the operation.
I don't think so.
Franz.
Don't talk nonsense.
Why, you'll be as good as new.
They fix up worse things than that.
Perhaps you'll go to the convalescent home in Klosterberg among the villagers.
Then you can look out of the windows, across the field to the two trees on the horizon.
The loveliest time of the year, now, when the corn ripens.
And you can go out without asking anyone.
You can even play piano if you want to.
Oh...
Oh, but, Franz, you must try to sleep now.
(SOBBING)
Oh, God, this is Franz Kemmerick, only 19 years old.
He doesn't want to die.
Please, don't let him die.
Paul. (GASPING)
Paul.
Yes, Franz.
Take my boots home for Mueller.
Oh, no, Franz, no.
And if... (MUTTERING)
Paul, you can find my watch, send it home.
Franz!
Doctor.
Doctor!
Doctor!
Doctor!
Where's the doctor?
Why isn't there a doctor here?
Doctor, come quick.
Franz Kemmerick is dying!
Which one is that?
Amputated leg.
I've amputated a dozen legs today.
Bed 26, sir.
You see to it.
I'm due in the operating room.
One operation after another since 5: 00 this morning.
Sixteen dead today, yours is the 17th.
There'll probably be 20 by tomorrow.
(SOLDIERS TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
SOLDIER:
You're looking good, very good today.
What's your hurry?
Hey!
I'll bet he stole those boots!
Why didn't you stop him?
(SOLDIERS LAUGHING)
I got it, Kat.
Huh?
Listen, "The sum of an arithmetic series
"is S = A + L x N over 2." Interesting, isn't it?
What do you want to learn that stuff for?
One day you'll stop a bullet and it'll all be wasted.
I get a lot of fun out of it.
My boots!
Mueller.
I saw him die.
I didn't know what it was like to die before.
And then...
Then I came outside and it felt...
It felt so good to be alive that I started in to walk fast.
I began to think of the strangest things, like being out in the fields.
Things like that.
You know, girls.
And it felt as if there were something electric running from the ground up through me.
And I started.
And I began to run hard.
And I passed soldiers and I heard voices calling, but...
And I ran and I ran.
And I felt as if I couldn't breathe enough air into me.
And...
And now I'm hungry.
MUELLER:
I don't mind the war now.
Be a pleasure to go to the front in boots like these.

TJADEN:
It's a good invention, just the same.
If you crack each separate louse, think of all the energy you use up.
Watch.
Burned to death.
How was patrol?
Bad?
Must've been terrible if they had time to gather in the harvest.
We passed a cherry tree and when he saw it, he sort of went crazy.
I could hardly drag him away.
It was beautiful.
I have a big orchard with cherry trees at home.
And when they're in full blossom, from the hayloft it looks like one single sheet.
So white.
Perhaps you can get leave soon.
You may even be sent back as a farmer.
A woman can't run a farm alone.
That's no good, you know?
No matter how hard she works.
Harvest coming on again.
What's the matter with him?
Got a letter yesterday from his wife.
He wants to get back to his farm.
We'd all like to get back home, it comes to that.
I wonder what we'd do if it were suddenly peacetime again?
Get drunk and look for women!
I'd go looking for a Cinderella that could wear this for a garter.
And when I'd found her, nobody would see me for two weeks.
I'll go back to the peat fields and those pleasant hours in the beer gardens.
And there's worse things than cobbling, too.
Look.
My family.
I ought to give you a kick in the backside for starting all this.
It's all right for all you to talk.
You've got something to go back to.
Wives, children, jobs...
But what about us?
What have we got to go back to?
School?
Why not?
You know everything already?
A man can't take all that rubbish they teach you seriously after three years of shells and bombs.
You can't peel that off as easily as a sock.
They never taught us anything really useful, like how to light a cigarette in the wind, or make a fire out of wet wood, or bayonet a man in the belly instead of the ribs where it gets jammed.
What can happen to us afterwards?
I'll tell you.
Take our class.
Out of 20, three are officers, nine dead,
Mueller and three others wounded, and one in the madhouse.
We'll all be dead someday, so let's forget it.
HIMMELSTOSS:
Hurry up!
Get in there!

It's Himmelstoss!

There is justice in the army!
Well, well.
So, we are all here, huh?
A bit longer than you, Himmie.
And since when have we become so familiar?
Stand up there and click your heels together!
All of you!

(LAUGHING)
Who's your friend?
Would somebody get General Ludendorff a nice, comfortable chair?
(ALL LAUGHING)

Do you want to be court-martialed for this?
I do!
There's going to be a big attack tonight and I'd just love to get out of it.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Will you obey my orders?
Kiss my foot.
It isn't customary to ask for salutes here.
But I'll tell you what we'll do.
We're going to attack a town that we tried to take once before.
Many killed and many wounded.
It was great fun.
This time you're going with us.
If any of us stops a bullet, before we die, we're going to come to you, click our heels together and ask stiffly,
"Please, Sergeant Himmelstoss, may we go?"
You'll...
You'll pay for this, you... (ALL LAUGHING)

You won't die.

They're only little wounds.
You'll get home.
You'll be all right.
You'll get home long before I will.
(FIRING CONTINUES)
You know I can't run away.
That's why you accuse me.
I tell you, I didn't want to kill you.
I tried to keep you alive.
If you jumped in here again, I wouldn't do it.
You see when you jumped in here you were my enemy, and I was afraid of you.
But you're just a man like me, and I killed you.
Forgive me, comrade.
Say that for me.
Say you forgive me.
Oh, no.
You're dead.
Only, you're better off than I am.
You're through.
They can't do anymore to you now.
Oh, God, why did they do this to us?
We only wanted to live, you and I.
Why should they send us out to fight each other?
If we threw away these rifles and these uniforms you could be my brother, just like Kat and Albert.
You'll have to forgive me, comrade.
I'll do all I can.
I'll write to your parents.
I'll write to...
I'll write to your wife.
I'll write to her.
I promise she'll not want for anything.
And I'll help her and your parents, too.
Only, forgive me.
Forgive me!
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
(SOBBING) Forgive me.

Terrible thing happened yesterday.
I stabbed a man.
With my own hands, stabbed him.
I know how it is.
Your first time.
Never mind.
The stretcher-bearers will find him.
No, no.
He's dead, Kat.
I watched him die.
You couldn't do anything about it.
We have to kill.
We can't help it.
That's what we are here for.
Look there, for instance.
(GUNSHOT)
That got him.
You should've seen how he leaped in the air.
That fellow headed the shoot with us for today with three hits.
If he keeps it up, he'll have a decoration for his buttonhole this evening.
Now, don't you lose anymore sleep over this business.
Maybe it was 'cause I was out there with him so long, huh?
Sure, that's it.
After all, war is war.

Just look at those thin, little shoes.
She couldn't march many miles in those.
Paul.
Don't speak about marching.
You're boring the young lady.
A thousand pardons.
How old do you think she is?
Oh, about 22.
No, you know, that'd make her older than us.
She's 17.
A girl like that.
That'd be good, eh, Albert?
We wouldn't have much of a chance with him around.
We could take a bath, wash our clothes...
All right.
I might even go so far as to get deloused.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
She's a long way from here now.
Look at the date.
May 1917.
Four months ago.
That's true.
Well, here's to her anyway.
Here's to 'em all, everywhere.
Albert, we might as well wash up anyway.
All right.
(WHISPERING)
Personally, I like them bigger around.
This conversation was on a high moral plane up to now.
Now we do need a bath.
A bath?
For what?
You wouldn't understand.
This water's freezing.
This romantic business has gone too far.
But think of her beautiful eyes!
Oh, and her hair.
Here we are!
We're not gonna miss a thing!

And yet, I'll remember you always.
If you could only know how different this is from the women that we soldiers meet.

No, no, no.
Not the war.
You.

We're going, Paul.
Have a look.

For us.
I must say, that's a very cheerful preparation for this offensive.
That's very considerate of them.
But I don't see any long enough for our comrade, Tjaden.
Mind you, I'm not speaking to you, you traitors.

I got a crack in the head and they gave me a certificate stating that Joseph Hammacher is periodically not responsible for his actions.
And ever since then, Hammacher has been having a grand time.
I hope you boys are not too badly wounded.

You'll get to know us very well.

If they take his clothes away, you've seen the last of him.
See?
They're taking him to the dying room.
Dying room?
When you're ready to kick the bucket, they get you out of the way so they can use the bed.
In the corner of the building there's a little room right next to the morgue!
It's so convenient.

I've been ringing forever and nobody comes.
I think I'm bleeding.
Sister, get me a sterile dressing and an ice pack.
Why didn't someone call me?
ALBERT:
He's been ringing.
Nobody can walk, Sister.
Sister, is it bad?
No.
No, we'll be all right.
We've got it in time.
What's the matter?
What are you doing?
We must rearrange your bandages.
Where are you taking me?
N U N:
To the bandaging ward.
No, no!
I'm not going!
I'm staying here!
ALBERT:
Paul!
Paul!
Now, now!
I'm not going to the dying room!
But we're going to the bandaging ward.
Then why are you taking my clothes?
You're lying to me!
But I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'm not going to die!
I'll come back!
HAMMACHER:
Sister Libertine, how is he?
Poor boy.
They had to amputate his leg.
Paul.
Paul.
Paul.
Oh, he is gone.
Gone.
Hello.
Welcome home, Albert!
How do you feel, kid?
All right.
But I've got such an awful pain.
My foot...
Hammacher.
Did they cut my leg off?
Of course not!
How many did you have?
Two?
You still got 'em!
One, two!
Don't play the fool, Hammacher.
Tell me truthfully.
Of course not.
And you look fine.
Look.
See?
I won't be a cripple.
Now, now.
I won't live like that!
Be calm.
I'll kill myself the first chance I get!
Albert!
I won't live!
I won't live!
Yes, you will.
PAUL:
Albert!
Albert!
Albert, I've come back!
I told you I'd come back.
Look, everybody!
I've come back!
ALBERT:
Paul!
Paul!
That's not where I'm going.
I live over there.
ALBERT:
Paul, I'm so happy.
Hammacher, I've come back from the dead!
It's most irregular.
Never happened before.
Albert, we must get well quickly so we can go home soon.
Albert, everything will be all right now.
Yes, Paul.
Everything will be all right now.
Paul!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul.
What's the matter, Paul?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Paul.
Give me your handkerchief.
Mother?
MOTHER:
Here I am, Paul.
Here I am.
Mother's ill.
Are you wounded?
No, Mother.
I got leave.
(CRYING)
Here I lie and cry instead of being glad.
Anna, get down the jar of blackberries.
You still like them, don't you?
Yes, Mother.
I haven't had any for a long time.
We might almost have known you were coming.
I'm making potato cakes.
MOTHER:
Don't let them burn.
Paul, sit down beside me.
My Paul.
My baby.
I almost forgot, Mother.
I've got some little presents for you.
Look, Mother.
Bread, sausage and rice.
Paul, you've been starving yourself.
Hadn't I better go and tell Father Paul's home?
Paul could watch the things on the stove.
No, no, child, I'm getting up.
Oh, Paul, you're a soldier now, aren't you?
But somehow, I don't seem to know you.
I'll take these off, Mother.
I'll get your suit, Paul.
It's in the wardrobe, just where you left it.
Are you really here, Paul?
You won't...
You won't disappear, will you?
No.
I'm here.
Your things are ready for you, Paul.
I remember when you caught that one.
Yes.
And you took it away from me, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
We're behind the lines, but we know how to honor the soldier who goes on in spite of blood and death.
Gentlemen, my son.
Prosit.
MEN:
Prosit.
I'm glad to know you, young man, I am glad to know you.
And how are things out there?
Terrible, eh?
Terrible.
But we must carry on.
After all, you do at least get decent food out there.
Naturally, it's worse here.
Naturally.
But the best for our soldiers all the time.
That's our motto.
The best for our soldiers.
The best for our soldiers.
But you must give the Frenchies a good licking!
(ALL LAUGHING)
And if you boys want to come home, let me show you what you must do before you can come home.
Give us a hand there, men.
Now, then, there's the line.
Runs so, in a "V."
Here is St. Quentin.
You can see for yourself.
You're almost through now.
All right?
Shove ahead out there and don't stick to that everlasting trench warfare.
Smash through the Johnnies!
And then you will have peace.
When you get in it, the war isn't the way it looks back here.
(SCOFFS) You don't know anything about it.
Of course, you know about the details, but this relates to the whole.
You can't judge that.
Of course, you do your duty and you risk your life.
But for that, you receive the highest honor.
I said that every man in the war ought to have the lron Cross.
First, the enemy lines must be broken through in Flanders.
On to Paris!
Push on to Paris!
Right.
No, not in Flanders.
Now I'll tell you just where the break should come.
Here.
The enemy has too many reserves there.
I insist upon Flanders!
I know, but, my dear man, why should they do that when they're halfway through St. Quentin already?
Why go the other way?
Because Flanders is a flat country.
There are no mountains, no obstructions.
But there's many rivers there.
PROFESSOR:
From the farms they have gone, from the schools, from the factories.
They have gone bravely, nobly, ever forward, realizing that there is no other duty now but to save the fatherland.
Paul!
How are you, Paul?
Glad to see you, Professor.
You've come at the right moment, Bäumer.
Just at the right moment.
And as if to prove all I have said, here is one of the first to go.
A lad who sat before me on these very benches, who gave up all to serve in the first year of the war.
One of the iron youth who have made Germany invincible in the field.
Look at him, sturdy and bronze and clear-eyed.
The kind of soldier every one of you should envy.
Paul, lad, you must speak to them.
You must tell them what it means to serve your fatherland.
No, no, I can't tell them anything.
You must, Paul.
Just a word.
Just tell them how much they're needed out there.
Tell them why you went and what it meant to you.
I can't say anything.
Can't you remember some deed of heroism, some touch of nobility?
Tell about it.
(STU DENTS U RGING)
I can't tell you anything you don't know.
We live in the trenches out there.
We fight.
We try not to be killed, sometimes we are.
That's all.
PROFESSOR:
No.
No, Paul.
I've been there!
I know what it's like.
That's not what one dwells on, Paul.
I've heard you in here reciting that same old stuff, making more iron men, more young heroes.
You still think it's beautiful and sweet to die for your country, don't you?
We used to think you knew.
The first bombardment taught us better.
It's dirty and painful to die for your country.
When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all!
There are millions out there dying for their countries, and what good is it?
(STU DENTS MU RMU RING)
PROFESSOR:
Paul.
You asked me to tell them how much they're needed out there.
He tells you, "Go out and die."
Oh, but if you'll pardon me, it's easier to say, "Go out and die" than it is to do it.
STU DENT:
Coward!
And it's easier to say it than to watch it happen.
Coward!
Get out!
PROFESSOR:
No!
Boys, boys!
I'm sorry, Bäumer, but I must say...
It's no use talking like this.
You won't know what I mean.
Only, it's been a long while since we enlisted out of this classroom.
So long I thought maybe the whole world had learned by this time.
Only now they're sending babies, and they won't last a week.
I shouldn't have come on leave.
U p at the front you're alive or you're dead, and that's all.
You can't fool anybody about that very long.
And up there we know we're lost and done for, whether we're dead or alive.
Three years we've had of it...
Four years.
And every day a year, and every night a century.
And our bodies are earth, and our thoughts are clay, and we sleep and eat with death.
We're done for because you can't live that way and keep anything inside you!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
I'll go back tomorrow.
I've got four days more, but I can't stand it here.
I'll go back tomorrow!
I'm sorry.
Mother, you'll catch cold here.
You must go to sleep.
There'll be plenty of time to sleep when you're gone.
Must you go tomorrow, Paul?
Must you?
Yes, Mother.
Orders were changed.
Are you very much afraid, Paul?
No, Mother.
There's something I want to say to you, Paul.
It's...
Just be on your guard against the women out there.
They're no good.
Where we are there aren't any women, Mother.
Be very careful at the front, Paul.
Yes, Mother, I will.
I'll pray for you every day.
And if you could get a job that's not quite so dangerous...
Yes, Mother.
I'll try and get in the cookhouse.
That can easily be done.
You do it then, and if the others say anything...
That won't worry me, Mother.
Now you must go to bed and you must get well quickly before I come back.
I put two sets of underwear, new ones, in your pack.
They'll keep you nice and warm.
They're all wool.
That's sweet of you.
Good night, my son.
Good night, Mother.
Oh, Mother, Mother.
You still think I'm a child.
Why can't I put my head in your lap and cry?
Is this the 2nd Company?
Yes, sir.
Is this all of it?
Yes, sir.
We had 150 men, but this is all that came back yesterday.
But now they're going to give us enough to make 150 again.
How old are you?
Sixteen.
No use.
I couldn't find anything.
We'll have to eat the sawdust.
Not me!
I'll go hungry first.
This makes me sick.
Now it's gonna be a real war again.
Paul!
How's old Paul?
Here I am.
You know, the 2nd Company's getting hard to find.
Nobody seemed to know where you were.
I'm glad you found it.
I guess I don't get much of this.
There used to be some food in the sawdust.
Now it's all sawdust.
No joke, either.
Eats you up inside.
This doesn't look much like the old 2nd Company.
The replacements are all like that.
Not even old enough to carry a pack.
All they know how to do is die.
I guess some of the old-timers are here yet.
Paul, they're trying to invent something to kill me right now.
Where's Westhus?
Messenger dog was wounded.
He went out to get it.
(clicks TONG U E)
Is it true about the armistice, Paul?
Doesn't look that way back there.
You mean they want us to go on fighting?
That's what they say.
They're crazy!
Germany'll be empty pretty soon.
Where's Detering?
He got homesick.
You remember about the cherry blossoms?
I guess he never got over that.
He started out one night to go home and help his wife with the farm.
They got him behind the lines, and we never heard of him since.
He was just homesick, but probably they couldn't see it that way.
Where's Kat?
Is he... (LAUGHS) Not Kat!
If he were out, the war would be over.
You remember what he always says, they're saving him for the last.
Where is he?
He's out looking for food, trying to collect something to make soup with.
Which way?
Down the road about two miles that way.
I'll see you later.
Kat!
Paul!
(EXPLOSION)
Hello, Paul.
How's the side?
Oh, it's all right now.
It's fine.
Have any luck?
No, the general's staff's been over this country with a rake.
Let's sit down a minute.
Tell me, Paul, how was it at home?
Have a good leave?
In spots.
What's the matter?
Oh, I'm no good for back there anymore, Kat.
None of us are.
We've been in this too long.
The young men thought I was a coward because I told them that we learn that death is stronger than duty to one's country.
The old men said, "Go on.
Push on to Paris."
My father even wanted me to wear my uniform around.
(LAUGHS)
It's not home back there anymore.
All I could think of was, "l'd like to get back and see Kat again."
You're all I've got left, Kat.
I'm not much to have left.
I missed you, Paul.
At least we know what it's all about out here.
There're no lies here.
Push on to Paris?
You ought to see what they've got on the other side.
They eat white bread over there.
They've got dozens of airplanes to our one and tanks that'll go over anything.
What've we got left?
Guns so worn they drop shells on our own men.
No food, no ammunition, no officers.
(CHUCKLING) Push on to Paris!
So that's the way they talk back there.
I guess we'd better be going.
How I lied to my poor mother.
I told her it wasn't so bad out here because there was always a lot of us together.
Now that I'm with you,
I'm beginning to believe that I told her the truth.
Down!
That's another one that missed us.
Come on.
Let's go.
Wait a minute.
Looks like the old bread wagon's broke down.
I guess I don't walk the rest of the way.
Did that get you, Kat?
I think it broke my shin.
That's not so bad.
Hold it together.
Just my luck, huh?
Good luck.
That means the war is over.
Oh, no, sir.
This war don't end till they really get me.
Now this one.
Easy, now.
Hey!
Easy!
Come on.
I'll take you in.
Give me your hand.
Easy.
All right.
Well, kid, now we're gonna be separated.
Maybe we can do something together later on when the war is over.
Yes, kid.
You give me your address and I'll give you mine.
(EXPLOSION)
You can't get both of us in one day!
We'll surely see each other again, Kat.
Remember that day when you brought the whole pig into the factory?
And that day in the woods when you taught us how to dodge shells?
And my first bombardment.
How I cried.
I was a young recruit then.
Here we are.
Here we are.
(GRUNTS)
All right now, Kat.
You could've spared yourself the trouble.
He's dead.
Oh, no.
He's just fainted.
He was hit in the shin.
He's dead.
Would you like to take his paybook?
You're not related, are you?
No, we're not related.
Your deal.
Did you get his name and number?
Yeah, Corporal Stanislas Katczinsky, 306.
I don't get it.
(INDISTINCT)
(GUNSHOT)
"ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT"
This story is neither an... accusation nor a confession... and least of all an adventure... for death is not an adventure... to those who stand face to face... with it.
It will try simply to... tell of a generation of men who.
even though they may have... escaped its shells, were destroyed... by the war...
- Thirty thousand.
- From the Russians?
No, from the French.
From the Russians we capture more than that every day.
Mr. Postman.
War is war and schnapps is schnapps, and business must go on.
You didn't leave the mail yet this morning.
Ah, I'm sorry, Mr. Meyer.
Hello, Himmelstoss.
Anything for us today?
- No, no, Master Peter.
- Oh, there must be something.
Here, here you go, young lad.
There.
This is the last mail deliver anyhow.
- What?
- Tomorrow I change uniforms.
- You're going in the army?
- Yes, I was called.
I'm a sergeant in the reserves, you know.
I'll be called my self, if it doesn't end in a few months.
- It will, though.
- I'm sure you're right, Mr. Meyer.
...defending our country, our father land.
Now, my beloved class, this is what we must do.
Strike with all our power.
Give every ounce of strength... to win victory before the end of the year.
It is with reluctance that I bring this subject up again.
You are the life of the fatherland, you boys.
You are the iron men of Germany.
You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy... when you are called upon to do so.
It is not for me to suggest that any of you... should stand up and offer to defend his country.
But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads.
I know that in one of the schools... the boys have risen up in the classroom... and enlisted in a mass.
But, of course, if such a thing should happen here... you would not blame me for a feeling of pride.
Perhaps some will say... that you should not be allowed to go yet... that you are too young, that you have homes, mothers.
Fathers... that you should not be torn away.
Are your fathers so forgetful of their fatherland... that they would let it perish father than you?
Are your mothers so weak that they cannot send a son... to defend the land which gave them birth?
And after all, is a little experience... such a had thing for a boy?
Is the honour of wearing a uniform... something from which we should run?
And if our young ladies glory in those who wear it... is that anything to be ashamed of?
I know you have never desired the adulation of heroes.
That has not been part of my teaching.
We have sought to make ourselves worthy... and let a claim come when it would.
But to he foremost in battle... is a virtue not to be despised.
I believe it will he a quick war... that there will he few losses.
But if losses there must be... then let us remember the Latin phrase... which must have come to the lips of many a Roman... when he stood embattled in a foreign land:
"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."
"Sweet and fitting it is to die for the fatherland."
Some of you may have ambitions.
I know of one young man who has great promise as a writer... and he has written the first act of a tragedy... which would be a credit to one of the masters.
And he is dreaming, I suppose... of following in the footsteps of Goethe and Schiller... and I hope he will.
But now our country calls.
The fatherland needs leaders.
Personal ambition must be thrown aside... in the one great sacrifice for our country.
Here is a glorious beginning to your fives.
The field of honour calls you.
Why are we here?
You, Kropp, what has kept you back?
You, Mueller, you know how much you are needed?
Ah, I see you look at your leader.
And I, too, look to you, Paul Baumer... and I wonder what you are going to do.
- I'll go.
- I want to go.
Count on me.
- Me too.
- I'm ready.
I'm not gonna stay home!
Follow me!
Enlist now!
- No more classes!
- No more classes!
- Don't be a quitter!
- Come on, Behn!
Stick together.
That's what we've got to do.
- Let's all stick together.
- Come on, Behn.
All right.
All right.
- I'll go.
- That's the way!
Let's go!
Hey!
Let's sing!
Come on!
Keep in line there, soldiers.
Anything you say, General.
Detail, halt!
Left face!
Get into uniform, ready to report.
Fall out!
I betcha a place like this gets you in good condition.
You have to be for the long marches.
I'm gonna get in the cavalry and ride.
No cavalry for me.
Infantry's where you see the fighting.
Where are all the guns?
That's what I want to know.
Oh, you don't get a gun for a long while yet.
If I'm gonna bump off the enemy, I gotta have some practice.
Bayonet drill.
That's what I want.
You won a medal that times, Mueller.
You wait.
In about a month I'll be covered with them.
Say, keep your boots out of my face!
Why, it's an Honor to have those boots in your face.
They're the best pair in the army!
My uncle gave them to me.
Just look at that special imported leather.
Put them anyplace you like, except in my face.
Not even a kitchen maid'll look at me in this!
Attention!
Well, for the love of...
It's Himmelstoss!
- So it is.
- And all dressed up.
Hello, Himmie.
You didn't think you'd see me again so soon, did you?
- You see my rank?
- Sure.
Fall back, then!
Himmelstoss, we certainly are glad to see you.
What did you say?
- I was going to say...
- Never mind!
What's the matter with you?
When you address your superior officer, say "sir"!
- Where'd he get such a nice uniform?
- Any mail for us, Himmie?
- Quiet!
- My dear fellow, you're shouting.
Ah, come on, Himmelstoss.
We know ya.
Take off the false whiskers.
- I believe you mean it!
- You'll find out that I mean it.
But only three days ago you were our postman.
Silence!
Come back here!
Line up!
Line up!
Get in some kind of a line!
All of you!
Line up, I say!
What a pretty sight that is!
Have you never heard of standing in line?
You make a fine mess of it.
Well, I'll have to teach you.
We'll append the whole day on it, huh?
You may be stupid but I'm used to that.
And then there'll be plenty of other things too.
Oh, I'll not neglect you.
You're not much to begin with... but I'll do my best.
I see that we have come here with a slight misunderstanding... and we'll correct that, too, won't we, huh?
And the first thing to do is to forget everything you ever knew.
Everything you ever learned, forget!
See?
Forget what you've been and what you think you're going to be.
You're going to be soldiers, and that's all!
I'll take the mother's milk out of you!
I'll make you hard-boiled!
I'll make soldiers out of you or kill you!
Now... salute!
Detachment...
lie down!
Head down!
Keep your head down, Baumer!
Detachment... get up!
Now sing!
Do you call that singing?
Detachment, halt!
So... we have no spirit, huh?
We are in no mood for recreation.
Work is what we want.
Good!
Then we'll go back to work!
Detachment...
lie down!
Keep your head down!
Now sing!
Men... halt!
Order, arms!
Inspection at 3:00.
Dismissed!
Oh, that swine!
That means we get no time off.
It will take four hours to get ready for inspection.
- I'd like to know what's in his mind.
- He hasn't got any!
I'm gonna cut him open sometime and find out!
He's too thick-skinned.
He won't cut.
This is the fourth time he's made me disappoint that poor girl.
Arms!
Order, arms!
Left shoulder, arms!
Squad right.
To the right, march!
Left, left, left, left.
Follow right, march!
Squad, left march!
Forward... march!
Detachment... halt!
Present arms!
Himmelstoss.
Excellent work.
They're going up front tomorrow.
- I recommend leave till midnight.
- Very good, sir.
Left, left, left.
Detachment...
lie down!
Crawl forward!
He spoiled our leave.
I'll never forgive him for that.
- The rat!
- Leave till midnight.
It'll take till midnight to dry our clothes.
There goes the filthy ape now.
While we slave over this mud, he goes off to have a few drinks!
Someday I'm going to take one smack at him... just one.
Me too.
That's gonna be my life's work from now on.
Why only one?
I'm gonna take several.
I might even kick him while he's down I feel mean.
What are you doing?
You're not going to desert, are you?
What?
Listen.
I've got an idea.
Crawl forward!
Lie down!
Lie down!
Crawl forward!
Oh!
What?
Cover!
Paul, you all right?
Behn!
Behn!
Behn!
Come on!
Behn, come on!
You fool!
Behn!
Get up!
Come on.
Sounds like more replacements coming in.
Yeah.
Tjaden must have gone home, for that wood.
There's some more, fresh from the turnip patch.
I suppose this is where we bunk.
That's me, "I. Westhus..."
and this is where I live.
- I didn't know!
- Well, you know now!
Yes.
Yes, of course.
- It's all right.
- Here's a bunk, Paul.
- When did we eat last?
- Don't remind me.
- I was fine until you spoke.
- Where are we anyway?
I don't know.
The name on the railroad station's been shot off.
There must be something to eat somewhere.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll ask those fellas.
Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Westhus.
Oh.
Meet Detering.
A better farmer never lived.
- And Mr. Tjaden.
- Sit down.
You see, we haven't eaten since breakfast.
We thought maybe you could tell us what we ought to do about it.
Eat without further delay.
Well, what's funny about that?
This is a bad town to bring an appetite to, soldier.
We've been here since yesterday morning living on baled hay and razor blades.
We're willing to buy our food.
Where's the canteen?
The only canteen in these regions is out looking for supplies.
- Ever hear of Katczinsky?
- Who?
Katczinsky.
He's uncanny.
If there's any food within 25 miles, he'll be the one to get it.
Attention!
What's this?
Volunteers for the future general's staff.
Sometime I'm gonna take one of you volunteers apart... and find out what makes you leave school and join the army.
At ease.
This is no parade ground.
- Hungry?
- Yes.
Wait!
Wait a minute!
That's no invitation.
- Can you pay?
- Yeah, sure.
I have some money.
No, not money.
That's just pieces of paper.
Have you got any cigarettes, cigars...
- Or soap, cognac...
- Yeah.
- Chewing tobacco?
- Yeah, yeah.
Kat!
Are you crazy?
There ain't enough here for us.
I wish you three would get bumped off.
I'm tired of feeding ya for nothing.
Bring everything you got.
- I'm so hungry...
- I'd be glad to give you...
- Come on!
- Is this enough, sir?
Kat!
- You've got the wiring detail tonight.
- Where?
- Past the graveyard.
- With this bunch?
It's quiet tonight.
You can teach them a couple of things.
Thanks.
I'd rather do it alone.
- These babes get killed off too fast.
- Well, the lorry's waiting.
Last night I was too hungry to sleep... and tonight, when I get the wrinkles out of my gut, they think up wiring duty.
Well, here's your chances, heroes.
For the fatherland!
Come on, get your stuff and let's get out of here.
- Is that any way to drive?
- Let him drive any way he wants.
Suppose he breaks your arm.
You get sent home, don't you?
A lot better than having a hole in your guts.
If there's any of you left, I'll pick you up in the morning.
Well, if that ride you gave us didn't kill us, nothing will.
And be on time.
I don't want to miss my breakfast.
You better wait for your army, Papa.
Here, here.
Don't be so backward.
Listen, children.
All we got to do is to string a little wire.
We pick it up at the dump and carry it to where we need it.
Now, you're gonna see some shell fire, and you're gonna be scared, see?
It's all right, boy.
Get up.
Here.
Never mind.
It's happened to better men than you, and it's happened to me.
When we come back, I'll get you all some nice clean underwear.
That kind of shell you don't have to pay much attention to.
Those big fellas just make a lot of noise and land about... five miles behind the line.
The things we've got to watch out for are the light ones.
They don't give you much warning.
They go "waa-aa-aah zing."
And when you hear that, down!
Mother Earth.
Press yourselves down upon her.
Bury yourselves deep into her.
Just keep your eyes on me.
When you see me flop, you flop... only try to beat me to it.
Now listen.
I'll show you how it's done.
Give me a couple of those.
That's to kill the noise.
Tjaden.
See that?
- What's that mean?
- Bombardment.
My eyes!
I'm blind!
I can't see!
God!
My eyes!
I can't see!
- I can't see!
- It's Behn!
It's Behn!
- I'll go get him...
- You'll get killed!
- Let me...
- Lay down and stay there!
He's dead.
- He's dead!
- Why did you risk your life... bringing him in?
But it's Behn!
- My friend.
- He's a corpse, no matter who it is.
Now, don't any of you ever do that again.
Put him over there.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
All right, come on.
All right, come on.
Get your packs and fall in.
Hurry up!
Come on.
Hurry up.
Make it snappy.
Get your packs and fall in.
Kat, what are we doing?
What's happening?
You heard him.
Orders to march.
- But where to, for the love of...
- Another party.
And this one is gonna last a long time.
Come on.
Here we go.
Company, attention!
Shoulder arms!
March right, march!
Take your hands off that!
- Queen takes it!
- Well, if you think... that's a queen, look again.
Ah, it's a jack.
- Yeah.
- Honest, these cards all look alike.
It's too noisy!
I can't play.
I suppose your delicate nerves...
- Can't stand it.
- Get up!
That's Oscar.
The son of a...
Look at that!
Don't be so snooty.
You may wish you had this back.
About two more days of this... and this rat-bitten and of a piece of bread's gonna taste... like a hunk of fruitcake.
It wouldn't...
It wouldn't last two more days, would it?
Didn't I tell you this was gonna be a bad one?
I don't mind the days so much.
It's keeping up all night...
Ah, two more days makes a week, kid.
Then you can say you've been under fire!
You're not scared, are you?
No.
I was just asking.
That's all.
- Wanna play some more?
- Do you?
- Sure.
- All right.
My deal.
You better get your boot back before Oscar eats that!
The kid's all right.
Yeah, yeah.
Let him sleep.
He's dreaming.
Oh, God.
Can't you see it's Behn?
He didn't want to come to war!
No, no.
It isn't Behn.
It isn't Behn!
It's Kemmerick!
It's me!
Shut up, will you?
It's bad enough in here as it is.
Every...
Everything's all right, Franz.
You're dreaming.
You're just dreaming, I guess.
- Attention!
- At ease.
The barrage is getting worse.
The men in two more dugouts gone.
However, we'll do our best to get some food up here by evening.
Stop!
Stop!
Let me out!
- What did you do that for?
- Shut up!
Grab him.
- No.
- Now hold him.
You all right now?
I think so.
I couldn't hold out much longer.
- Oh, god, it's Franz!
- Get him over there!
No, he's been hit in the stomach.
He can't have anything to drink.
Get a stretcher.
Where'd they get you, Kemmerick?
- Here it is, sir.
- Take his head.
All right.
Take him out.
- Is it serious, sir?
- I'm not sure.
- Tell the others he's all right.
- Yes, sir.
If we're going to fight, why don't we fight?
Why don't we go over?
You could go crazy staying here.
Let's do something!
- Let's go after them!
- Sit down!
If that cook of ours had any guts, he'd try to bring something through.
He's so far behind the lines he can't hear the shooting!
- Here's Kat.
Get anything?
- Any luck?
- We'll have to split this up among us.
- Something to eat!
We need butter too.
Yes.
And dessert.
And a feather bed to sleep on.
- Rats!
Rats!
- Rats!
Get out of the way!
What's that?
Come on!
Grab your rifles!
Come on!
- Here they come.
- Get your grenades here.
Hurry up.
Come on, hurry up.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Back to your own lines!
- Fill it up.
- And hurry up.
I've got other things to do.
I've been waiting for this for three weeks.
When they all get here.
What do you want?
Beans, you homely - looking son of a frog's leg.
- What do you think I want?
- We're hungry.
Shut up!
I'll feed you when you're all here.
- We're all here now.
- Only half the company's here.
Get the rest.
Wake them up.
I wish I could wake them up.
There's 80 of us left.
The rest is in dressing stations or pushing up daisies.
Eighty?
And I cooked for 150!
All right.
We'll have enough for once.
Come on.
Dish out!
You mean you've cooked beans for 150... and you've got bread for 150... and sausage for 150, and tobacco for 150?
Everything!
It's all wrong.
I should have been notified.
What a feast!
Everyone gets two issues.
- Get back in line!
Get back in line!
- Oh, no!
That won't do.
I can't give 80 men what's meant for 150.
Listen.
You drew rations for the 2nd Company, didn't ya?
Yeah.
All right.
We're the 2nd Company.
I've got my orders.
- Kat's right.
- We're the 2nd Company?
And if only half of us get back, that's our good luck.
- Come on.
Dish it out.
- Come on!
- No!
- Hey!
You're the yellowest baboon that ever drew a cook wagon... and you're scared...
it shows.
All we want to hear out of you is one more little yip... and we'll cut ya up and eat ya raw.
Why, you keep your kitchen so far back of the lines... we never get anything to eat until it's cold and we're asleep!
Now, you low-down rat, get out... or we wreck the joint!
- Come on!
Give us...
- Attention!
At ease.
What's going on here?
He's cooked for 150, sir, and he only wants to give us half.
- Looks pretty good.
- Yes, sir.
Serve the whole issue.
- The men can use it.
- Yes, sir.
- And bring me a plate too.
- Yes, sir.
All right.
Take it all.
Take everything.
Give them honey.
Give them what they want.
- Fill it up!
- Fill it up!
- Don't mind me.
- Oh, that's all right.
Don't mention it.
You know...
I could do with some more beans.
Go help yourself.
There's more ever there.
It's too far.
I wonder, when are we going back to the front?
Tomorrow.
It's enough to take away a man's appetite.
You know, if they're gonna march us in again tomorrow... we ought to go see how Kemmerick is.
- That's a good idea.
- Let's do that.
- How far is the dressing station?
- About two miles.
- We could take his things to him.
- Good!
It seemed rotten to think of a thing like that happening to him... a nice fellow like Kemmerick.
Ah, the French certainly deserve to be punished for starting this war.
Everybody says it's somebody else.
Well, how do they start a war?
Well, one country offends another.
How could one country offend another?
You mean there's a mountain over in Germany gets mad... at a field over in France?
Well, stupid, one people offends another.
Oh, if that's it, I shouldn't be here at all.
I don't feel offended.
It don't apply to tramps like you.
Good.
Then I can be going home right away.
- Ah, you just try it.
- Yeah.
You wanna get shot?
The Kaiser and me...
Me and the Kaiser felt just alike about this war.
We didn't either of us want any war, so I'm going home.
- He's there already.
- Somebody must have wanted it.
Maybe it was the English.
No, I don't want to shoot any Englishmen.
I never saw one till I came up here.
And I suppose most of them never saw a German till they came up here.
No, I'm sure they weren't asked about it.
No.
Well... it must be doing somebody some good.
- Not me and the Kaiser.
- I think maybe the Kaiser... wanted a war.
You leave us out of this.
I don't see that.
The Kaiser's got everything he needs.
Well, he never had a war before.
Every full-grown emperor needs one war to make him famous.
- Why, that's history.
- Yeah, generals too.
They need war.
And manufacturers.
They get rich.
I think it's more a kind of fever.
Nobody wants it in particular... and then all at once, there it is.
We didn't want it.
The English didn't want it.
And here we are fighting.
I'll tell you how it should all be done.
Whenever there's a big war coming on...
- You should rope off a big field...
- And sell tickets.
Yeah.
And...
And on the big day... you should take all the kings and their cabinets and their generals... put them in the center dressed in their underpants... and let them fight it out with clubs.
The best country wins.
Well, now that Kat's settled everything, let's go see Kemmerick.
Something interesting might happen on the way.
Might cheer him up.
Boys, me and the Kaiser want you back in time to march tomorrow.
Don't forget.
- We'll be back.
- Give the boy my regards.
There he is.
- Hello, Kemmerick.
- How are you?
How's it going?
How are things going?
Are they looking after you all right?
How are they treating you?
Franz?
They're robbers here.
Robbers.
They stole my watch!
I always told you, nobody should carry as good a watch as that.
- They took it while I was under ether!
- Franz, you'll get it back.
Do you feel all right?
- Just look at my hand.
- That's because you lost... so much blood.
Just eat decently and you'll get well again.
You must eat.
What's the main thing.
It looks good too.
I have such a terrible pain in my foot.
Every toe on my right foot hurts.
Well, how can your foot hurt when your leg's been...
I know what you mean!
I know!
I know now!
They cut my leg off.
Why didn't they tell me?
Why...
Why didn't they tell me?
- Franz!
Franz!
- Now I can't walk anymore!
You must be thankful that you've come off with only that.
I wanted to be a forester once.
You can yet.
They make artificial legs that are wonderful.
And you're through too.
You can go home.
Think of that.
We brought your things for you.
See?
Put them under the bed.
That's a marvellous pair of boots.
Look at that leather!
What comfort.
I was just thinking.
If you're not going to be using these, Franz... why din't you leave them with us?
What good are they to you?
I can use them.
My boots give me blister after blister...
Well, we'll be going, Franz.
Oh, don't go.
Stay just a little while longer.
- I'll come right back.
We'll be coming soon again, Franz.
- I know you'll be feeling better.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Good-bye, Franz.
You think he'll last till after mess?
- I don't think...
- Done for.
Boys, you go along.
I'll see you later.
Good-bye.
All right, Paul.
I'm sorry, Paul.
I wouldn't touch a thing of his if he could use it.
I'd go barefoot over barbed wire for him if it'd do him any good.
Only...
Only why should some orderly get those boots?
I understand, Mueller.
We're all alike out here.
And good boots are scarce.
Tell the doctor to come, please.
Doctor, the man in the next bed would like to see you, sir.
I've done everything I can for him.
There's no helping him.
Poor little fella.
He says next time, Franz.
Do you think I'll ever get well?
Why, of course.
- Do you really think so?
- Sure, once you get... over the operation.
I don't think so.
Franz!
Don't talk nonsense.
Why, you'll be as good as new.
They fix up worse things than that.
Perhaps you'll go to the convalescent home... in Klosterberg among the villagers.
Then you can look out of the windows, across the fields... to the two trees on the horizon.
The loveliest time of the year now when the corn ripens.
You can go out without asking anyone.
You can even play piano if you want to.
Oh...
Oh, but, Franz, you must try to sleep now.
O God... this is Franz Kemmerick... only 19 years old.
He doesn't want to die.
Please don't let him die.
Paul.
- Paul.
- Franz.
Take my boots home for Mueller.
Oh, no, Franz, no.
And if...
Paul... you find my watch, send it home.
Franz!
Doctor!
Doctor!
Doctor!
Doctor!
Where's the doctor?
Why isn't there a doctor here?
Doctor, come quick!
- Franz Kemmerick is dying!
- Which one is that?
- Amputated leg.
- I've amputated a dozen legs today.
- Bed 26, sir.
- You see to it.
I'm due in the operating room.
One operating after another since 5:00 this morning.
Sixteen dead today, and yours is the 17th.
There'll probably be 20 by the morning.
You're looking good.
Very good today.
What's your hurry?
Hey!
I'll bet he stole those boots!
I got it, Kat.
Listen: "The sum of an arithmetic series... is S = A + L x N over 2."
Interesting, isn't it?
What do you wanna learn that stuff for?
One day you'll stop a bullet and it'll all be worthless.
I get a lot of fun out of it.
My boots!
Mueller.
I saw him die.
I didn't know what it was like to die before.
And then... then I came outside... and it felt... it felt so good to be alive that I started in to walk fast.
I began to think of the strangest things... like being out in the fields.
Things like that.
You know... girls.
And it felt as if there were... something electric running from the ground up through me.
And I started.
I began to run hard.
I passed soldiers and I heard voices calling to me.
I ran and I ran.
I felt as if I couldn't breathe enough air into me.
And...
And now I'm hungry.
I don't mind the war now.
Be a pleasure to go to the front in boots like these.
It's a good invention just the same.
If you crack each separate louse, think of all the energy you use up.
Watch.
Burned to death.
How was patrol?
Bad?
Must've been terrible if they had time to gather the harvest.
We passed a cherry tree and when he saw it, he went crazy.
I could hardly drag him away.
It was... beautiful.
I have a big orchard with cherry trees at home.
When they're in full blossom... from the hayloft it looks like one single sheet.
So white.
- Perhaps you can get leave soon.
- You may even be sent... back as a farmer.
A woman can't run a farm alone.
That's no good, you know?
No matter how hard she works.
Harvest coming on again.
What's the matter with him?
Got a letter yesterday from his wife.
He wants to get back to his farm.
We'd all like to get back home.
I wonder what we'd do if it were suddenly peacetime again?
Get drunk and look for women!
I'd go looking for a Cinderella... that could wear this for a garter.
And when I'd found her, nobody'd see me for two weeks.
I'll go back to the peat fields... and those pleasant hours in the beer gardens.
And there's worse things than cobbling too.
Look.
My family.
I oughta give you a kick in the backside for starting all this.
It's all right for all you to talk.
You've got something to go back to.
Wives, children, jobs.
But what about us?
What have we got to go back to?
- School?
- Why not?
You know everything already.
A man can't take all that rubbish they teach you seriously... after three years of shells and bombs.
You can't peel that off easily.
They never taught us anything really useful... like how to light a cigarette in the wind or make a fire out of wet wood... or bayonet a man in the belly instead of the ribs where it gets jammed.
What can happen to us afterwards?
I'll tell you.
Take our class.
Out of 20, three are officers... nine dead...
Mueller and three others wounded... and one in the madhouse.
We'll all be dead someday, so let's forget it.
Hurry up!
Get in there!
Hurry up!
Himmelstoss!
What's up?
- What are you, crazy?
- It's Himmelstoss!
Himmelstoss?
There is justice in the army!
Well, well.
So, we are all here, huh?
A bit longer than you, Himmie.
Since when have we become so familiar?
Stand up and click your heels together!
All of you!
- Take a running jump at yourself!
- Who's your friend?
Would somebody get General Ludendorff a nice, comfortable chair?
I command you as your superior officer!
- Do you want to be court-martialed?
- I do!
There's going to be a big attack tonight... and I'd just love to get out of it.
Kiss my butt!
It isn't customary to ask for salutes here.
But I'll tell you what we'll do.
We're going to attack a town that we tried to take once before.
Many killed and many wounded.
It was great fun.
This time you're going with us.
If any of us stops a bullet, before we die... we're going to come to you, click our heels together and ask stiffly...
"Please, Sergeant Himmelstoss, may we go?"
You'll...
You'll pay for this, you...
There it is.
Right on time.
Better get ready, boys.
I'm wounded!
I'm wounded!
It's just a scratch, you yellow rat!
Up!
Get out with the others!
- Up!
- No!
No!
No!
You yellow rat!
Stinking yellow rat!
Let the others do it, eh?
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!
Forward!
- Get out here.
- Command... was forward.
Command was forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Counterattack.
I want to help you.
I want to help you.
Stop that!
Stop it, stop it.
I can bear the rest of it.
I can't listen to that!
Why do you take so long dying?
You're going to die anyway!
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
You won't die.
Oh, no.
You won't die.
They're only little wounds.
You'll get home.
You'll be all right.
You'll get home long before I will.
You know I can't run away.
That's why you accuse me.
I tell you, I didn't want to kill you.
I tried to keep you alive.
If you jumped in here again, I wouldn't do it.
When you jumped in here you were my enemy, and I was afraid of you.
But you're just a man like me, and I killed you.
Forgive me, comrade.
Say that for me.
Say you forgive me.
Oh, no.
You're dead.
You're better off than I am.
You're through.
They can't do any more to you now.
Oh, God, why did they do this to us?
We only wanted to live, you and I.
Why should they send us out to fight each other?
If we threw away these rifles and these uniforms... you could be my brother just like Kat and Albert.
You'll have to forgive me, comrade.
I'll do all I can.
I'll write to your parents.
I'll write to...
I'll write to your wife.
I'll write to her.
I promise she'll not want for anything.
I'll help her and your parents too.
Only forgive me.
Forgive me!
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Terrible thing happened yesterday.
I stabbed a man.
With my own hands, stabbed him.
I know how it is.
Your first time.
Never mind.
The stretcher-bearers will find him.
- He's dead.
I watched him die.
- You couldn't do anything about it.
We have to kill.
We can't help it.
That's what we are here for.
Look there, for instance.
That got him.
You should've seen how he leaped in the air.
That fellow had to shoot with us for today with three hits.
If he keeps it up, he'll have a decoration for his... buttonhole this evening.
Don't you lose any more sleep over this business.
Maybe it was because I was out there with him so long, huh?
Sure, that's it.
After all, war is war.
March!
Forward!
Forward, march!
Quick there!
Forward!
Company... halt!
Dismissed!
Uncommissioned officers, enlisted men... dismiss!
Come on!
Let's get outta here!
- Give me your best sausage.
- Two.
Give me a beer.
One, two, three!
Hey, come on.
A beer.
Hey, get out of here!
Come on.
Give me a beer.
A beer.
One b... here's hoping we get falling-down drunk tonight.
Here's how it started.
I'd forgotten there were girls like that.
There aren't.
Just look at those thin, little shoes.
She couldn't march many miles in those.
Paul!
Don't speak about marching.
You're boring the young lady.
A thousand pardons.
- How old you think she is?
- Oh, about 22.
No, that'd make her older than us.
She's... 17.
A girl like that.
That'd be good, Albert?
We wouldn't have much of a chance with him around.
We could take a bath wash our clothes...
All right.
And I might even go so far as to get deloused.
Wait a minute!
She's a long way from here now.
Look at the date.
May, 1917.
- Four months ago.
- That's true.
Well, here's to her anyway.
Here's to them all, everywhere.
Albert...
- We might as well wash up anyway.
- All right.
Personally, I like them bigger around.
This conversation was on a high moral plane up to now.
Now we do need a bath.
- A bath?
- For what?
You wouldn't understand.
This water is freezing.
This romantic business has gone too far.
Ahh, but think of her beautiful eyes!
Oh, and her hair.
- Here we are!
- We're not gonna miss a thing!
Go away!
- What are you doing here?
- Bathing!
They tell me there's some people in this world takes a bath every week!
Women!
Mademoiselle, you want to swim?
Mademoiselle!
Aw, baby!
Aw, no, girls!
Don't go away!
Aw, mama!
- Please don't go!
- Don't go away!
Food!
Food!
Halt!
You know you're forbidden to cross.
You fellows stay on this side or you'll get... yourselves in a lot of trouble.
What are they jabbering about?
They want us to swing over tonight.
They're expecting us.
- That's fine!
- We'll do it!
That blonde's crazy about me.
But there's four of us and only three of them.
I was the one that stopped them!
That blonde piece of work is mine.
You three fight for what's left.
Fight's the word.
All's fair in love and war.
What do you mean?
What're you gonna do?
You'll find out.
Au revoir!
Au revoir!
- C'est moi, blondie!
- Bon ami!
Bon ami!
Vos camarades!
Vos camarades!
She means the door.
Not only modest, but dashing!
A perfect fit.
It might've been made for me.
An officer's coat.
We're calling distinguished company.
Merci.
Have another little drink, comrade.
Is this your birthday or mine?
Why?
You've been buying me drink after drink for two hours.
What I'm trying to figure out is why.
Why?
Why?
Oh.
I it's just that the boys... told me to amuse you for a little while.
Oh, nice boys.
They...
They said you'd understand.
I've been betrayed!
Yeah, you certainly have.
Take that for a minute!
I'll give you more!
It's too loud.
Suzanne.
And I wouldn't even know you if I did.
And yet, I'll remember you always.
Toujours.
Oh, if you could only know how different this is... from the women we soldiers meet.
You.
That's what I'm talking about.
Vous.
It seems as though all war and terror and grossness... had fallen away from me... like a miracle.
Like something I never believed.
Pauvre gar‡on.
Pauvre gar‡on.
Frau Paul.
We're going, Paul.
Have a look.
Nice, new coffins.
Huh!
For us.
I must say, that's a very cheerful preparation for this offensive.
That's very considerate of them.
But I don't see any long... enough for our comrade Tjaden.
Mind you, I'm not speaking to you, you traitors.
- But no coffin's gonna get me.
- I should say not, heartbreaker.
You'll be thankful if they slip a waterproof sheet... around that Aunt Sally of a carcass of yours.
Oh...
Oh, my side!
My side.
Catholic hospital, Albert.
They say you always get good food and good treatment.
- We're lucky.
- After that rainy dressing station... and 24 hours on the train, we deserve to have some luck.
I'm Hamacher.
Yeah, that's my name.
I got a crack in the head and they gave me a certificate stating...
"Josef Hamacher is periodically... not responsible for his actions."
And ever since then, Hamacher has been having a grand time.
I hope you boys are not too badly wounded.
The others die off so quickly we don't have time to get acquainted.
You'll get to know us...
very well.
Thank you.
You too.
I'm sorry, my dear.
It's time to go now.
Yes, sister.
Watch.
If they take his clothes away, you've seen the last of him.
See?
They're taking him to the dying room.
Dying room?
When you're ready to kick the bucket, they get you out... of the way so they can use the bed.
In the corner of the building there's a little room... right next to the morgue!
It's so convenient.
It saves a lot of trouble.
But suppose he gets well?
I've seen a lot of them go in that dying room... but nobody ever comes back.
Sister.
Sister.
Sister.
- Is that you ringing, Paul?
- Yes.
- Is something going on?
- I think I have a haemorrhage.
The bandage is all wet.
I've been ringing forever and nobody comes.
I think I'm bleeding.
Sister, get me a sterile dressing and an ice pack.
- Why didn't someone call me?
- He's been ringing.
Nobody can walk, Sister.
- Sister, is it bad?
- No.
No, we'll be all right.
We've got it in time.
What's the matter?
What are you doing?
We must rearrange your bandages.
Where are you taking me?
To the bandaging ward.
No, no!
I'm not going!
I'm staying here!
Paul!
Paul!
- Now, now!
- I'm not going to the dying room!
- We're going to the bandaging ward.
- Why are you taking my clothes?
You're lying to me!
But I'll come back.
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'm not going to die!
I'll come back!
Sister Libertine, how is he?
Poor boy.
They had to amputate his leg.
Paul.
Paul.
Paul.
Oh, he is... gone.
Gone.
Hello.
Welcome home, Albert!
- How do you fell, kid?
- All right.
But I've got such an awful pain.
My foot hur...
Hamacher.
Did they cut my leg off?
Of course not!
How many did you have?
Two?
You still got them!
One, two!
Don't play the fool, Hamacher.
Tell me truthfully.
Of course not.
And you look fine.
Look.
See?
- I won't be a cripple.
- Now, now.
- I won't live like that!
- Be calm.
I'll kill myself the first chance I get!
Albert!
- I won't live!
I won't live!
- Yes, you will.
Albert!
Albert!
Albert, I've come back!
I told you I'd come back.
Look, everybody!
I've come back!
Paul.
Paul.
That's not where I'm going.
I live over there.
Paul, I'm so happy.
Hamacher, I've come back from the dead!
It's most irregular.
Never happened before.
Albert, get well quickly... so we can go home soon.
- Everything will be all right now.
- Yes, Paul.
Everything will be all right...
now.
Oh!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul.
- What's the matter, Paul?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
Paul.
Give me your hanky chief.
- Mother?
- Here I am, Paul.
Here I am.
Mother's ill.
- Are you wounded?
- No, Mother.
I got leave.
Here I am crying instead of being glad.
Anna, get down the jar of blackberries.
You still like them, don't you?
Yes, Mother.
I haven't had any for a long time.
We might almost have known you were coming.
- I'm making potato cakes.
- Don't let them burn.
Paul... sit down... beside me.
My Paul.
My baby.
I almost forgot, Mother.
I've got some little presents for you.
Look, Mother.
Bread, sausage and rice.
Paul, you've been starving yourself.
Hadn't I better go and tell father Paul's home?
Paul could watch the things on the stove.
No, I'm getting up.
Oh, Paul, you're a soldier now, aren't you?
But somehow, I don't seem to know you.
I'll take these off, mother.
I'll get your suit.
It's in the wardrobe, just where you left it.
Are you really here, Paul?
You won't...
You won't disappear, will you?
No.
I'm here.
Your things are ready for you, Paul.
I remember when you caught that one.
Yes.
And you took it away from me, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
We're behind the lines, but we know how to honour the soldier... who goes on in spite of blood and death.
Gentlemen, my son.
- Prosit.
- Prosit.
Cheers.
I'm glad to know you, young man, I am glad to know you.
How are things out there?
Terrible, eh?
Terrible.
But we must carry on.
After all, you do at least get decent food out there.
Naturally, it's worse here.
Naturally.
But the best for our soldiers all the time.
That's our motto.
The best for our soldiers.
But... you must give the Frenchies a good licking!
And, if you boys want to come home... let me show you what you must do before you can come home.
Give us a hand there, men.
Now, then, there's the line.
Runs so, in a "V".
Here is St. Quentin.
You can see for yourself.
You're almost through now.
All right?
Shove ahead out there and don't stick to that... everlasting French warfare!
Smash through the johnnies!
And then you will have peace.
When you get in it... the war isn't the way it looks back here.
Oh!
You don't know anything about it.
Of course, you know about the details... but this relates to the whole!
You can't judge that.
Of course, you do your duty and you risk your life.
But for that, you receive the highest honour.
I said that every man in the war ought to have the Iron cross.
First, the enemy lines must be broken through in Flanders.
- On to Paris!
Push on to Paris!
- Right.
No, not in Flanders.
I'll tell you just where the... break should come.
Here.
The enemy has too many reserves there.
- I insist upon Flanders!
- Why should they do that... when they're halfway through St. Quentin already?
Because Flanders is a flat country!
- No mountains, no obstructions!
- There's too many rivers there!
From the farms they have gone;... from the schools, from the factories.
They have gone bravely, nobly, ever forward... realizing there is no other duty now but to save the fatherland.
Paul!
How are you, Paul?
Glad to see you, Professor.
You've come at the right moment, Baumer!
Just at the right moment.
And as if to prove all have said, here is one of the first to go.
A lad who sat before me on these very benches... who gave up all to serve in the first year of the war... one of the iron youth who have made Germany invincible in the field.
Look at him... sturdy and bronze and clear-eyed.
The kind of soldier every one of you should envy.
Oh, lad, you must speak to them.
You must tell them what it means to serve your fatherland.
- No, I can't tell them anything.
- You must, Paul.
Just a word...
Just tell them how much they're needed out there.
Tell them why you went and what it meant to you.
I can't say anything.
You can remember some deed of heroism, some touch of nobility.
Tell about it.
I can't tell you anything you don't know.
We live in the trenches out there.
We fight.
We try not to be killed, sometimes we are.
That's all.
No.
No, Paul.
I've been there!
I know what it's like.
That's not what one dwells on, Paul.
I heard you in here reciting that same old stuff... making more iron men, more young heroes.
You still think it's beautiful and sweet to die... for your country, don't you?
We used to think you knew.
The first bombardment taught us better.
It's dirty and painful to die for your country.
When it comes to dying for your country... it's better not to die at all!
There are millions out there dying for their countries... and what good is it?
Paul!
You asked me to tell them how much they're needed out there.
He tells you, "Go out and die."
Oh, but if you'll pardon me, it's easier to say "Go out and die"
than it is to do it.
Coward!
And it's easier to say it than to watch it happen.
No!
No!
Boys, boys!
- I'm sorry, Baumer, but I must say...
- It's no use talking like this.
You won't know what I mean.
Only, it's been a long while since we enlisted out of this classroom.
So long I thought maybe the whole world had learned by this time.
Only now they're sending babies, and they won't last a week!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
Up at the front you're alive or you're dead, and that's all!
You can't fool anybody about that very long.
Up there we know we're lost and done for whether we're dead or alive.
Three years we've had of it... four years.
Every day a year and every night a century.
Our bodies are earth and our thoughts are clay... and we sleep and eat with death.
We're done for because you can't live that way... and keep anything inside you!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
I'll go back tomorrow.
I've got four days more, but I can't stand it here!
I'll go back tomorrow!
Sorry.
Mother, you'll catch clod here.
You must go to sleep.
There'll be plenty of time to sleep... when you're gone.
Must you go tomorrow, Paul?
Must you?
Yes, Mother.
Orders were changed.
Are you very much afraid, Paul?
No, Mother.
There's something I want to say to you, Paul.
It's...
Just be on your guard against the women out there.
They're no good.
Where we are, there aren't any women, Mother.
Be very careful at the front, Paul.
Yes, Mother, I will.
I'll pray for you every day.
And if you could, get a job that's not quite so dangerous.
Yes, Mother.
I'll try and get in the cookhouse.
- That can easily be done.
- You do it then, and if...
- The others say anything...
- That won't worry me, Mother.
Now, you must go to bed and you must get well... quickly before I come back.
I put two sets of underwear...
new ones... in your pack.
They'll keep you nice and warm.
They're all wool.
That's sweet of you.
Good night...
my son.
Good night, Mother.
Oh, Mother, Mother.
You still think I'm a child.
Why can't I put my head in your lap and cry?
- Is this the 2nd Company?
- Yes, sir.
- Is this all of it?
- Yes, sir.
We had 150 men, but this is all that came back yesterday.
But now they're going to give us enough to make 150 again.
How old are you?
Sixteen.
No use.
I couldn't find anything.
We'll have to eat the sawdust.
Not me!
I'll go hungry first.
It makes me sick.
Now it's gonna be a real war again.
Paul!
How's old Paul?
Here I am.
You know, the 2nd Company's getting hard to find.
Nobody seemed to know where you were.
I'm glad you found it.
I guess I don't get much of this.
There used to be some food in the sawdust.
Now it's all sawdust.
No joke, either.
Eats ya up inside.
This doesn't look much like the old 2nd Company.
The replacements are all like that.
Not even old enough to carry a pack.
All they know how to do is die.
I guess... some of the old-timers are here yet.
Paul, they're trying to invent something to kill me right now.
Where's Westhus?
Messenger dog was wounded.
He went out to get it.
- Is it true about the armistice?
- Doesn't look that way back there.
You mean they want us to go on fighting?
That's what they say.
They're crazy!
Germany'll be empty pretty soon.
Where is...
Where is Detering?
He got homesick.
You remember about the cherry blossoms?
I guess he never got over that.
He started out one night to go home and help his wife with the farm.
They got him behind the lines, and we never heard of him since.
He was just homesick, but probably they couldn't see it that way.
Where's Kat?
Is he...
Not Kat!
If he were out, the war would be over.
You remember what he always says:
They're saving him for the last.
- Where is he?
- He's out looking for food... something to make soup with.
- Which way?
- Down the road about... two miles that way.
I'll see you later.
Kat!
Paul!
Hello, Paul.
- How's the side?
- Oh, it's all right now.
It's fine.
- Have any luck?
- No, the general's staff's been... over this country with a rake.
Let's sit down there.
Tell me, Paul... how was it at home?
Have a good leave?
- In spots.
- What's the matter?
I'm no good for back there anymore, Kat.
None of us are.
We've been in this too long.
The young men thought I was a coward because I told them that... we learn that death is stronger than duty to one's country.
The old men said "Go on.
Push on to Paris."
My father even wanted me to wear my uniform around him.
It's not home back there anymore.
All I could think of was, "I'd like to get back and see Kat again."
You're all I've got left, Kat.
I'm not much to have left.
I missed you, Paul.
At least we know what it's all about out here.
There're no lies here.
Push on to Paris?
You ought to see what they've got on the other side.
They eat white bread over there.
They've got dozens of airplanes to our one... and tanks that'll go over anything.
What've we got left?
Guns so worn they drop shells on our own men.
No food, no ammunition, no officers.
Push on to Paris!
So that's the way they talk back there.
I guess we'd better be going.
How I lied to my poor mother.
I told her it wasn't so bad out here because there was... always a lot of us together.
Now that I'm with you, I'm beginning to believe that I told her the truth.
Down!
That's another one that missed us.
Come on.
Let's go.
Wait a minute.
Looks like the old bread wagon's broke down.
I guess I don't walk the rest of the way.
Did that get ya, Kat?
Aah, I think it broke my shin.
That's not so bad.
Hold it together.
- Just my luck?
- Good luck.
That means the war is over.
Oh, no, sir!
This war don't end till they really get me.
Now this one...
Easy, now.
- Hey!
- Easy!
Easy!
Come on.
I'll take you in.
Give me your hand.
Easy.
All right.
Well, kid... now we're gonna be separated.
Maybe we can do something together later on when the war is over.
Yes, kid.
You give me your address, I'll give you mine.
You can't get both of us in one day.
Ah, we'll surely see each other again, Kat.
Remember that day when you brought the whole pig into the factory?
And that day in the woods when you taught us how to dodge shells?
And my first bombardment.
How I cried.
I was a young recruit then.
Here we are.
Here we are.
All right now, Kat.
You could've spared yourself the trouble.
He's dead.
Oh, no.
He's just fainted.
He was hit in the shin.
He's dead.
Would you like to take his pay book?
- You're not related, are you?
- No, we're not related.
Your deal.
Get his name and number?
Yeah, Corporal Stanislaus Katczinsky, 306.
THE END
- Thirty thousand.
- From the Russians?
No, from the French.
From the Russians we capture more than that every day.
Mr Postman.
War is war and schnapps is schnapps, and business must go on.
You didn't leave the mail yet this morning.
Ah, I'm sorry, Mr Meyer.
Hello, Himmelstoss.
Anything for us today?
- No, no, Master Peter.
- Oh, there must be something.
Here, here you go, young rascal.
There.
This is the last mail I deliver anyhow.
- What?
- Tomorrow I change uniforms.
- You're going in the army?
- Yes, I was called.
I'm a sergeant in the reserves, you know.
I'll be called myself, if it doesn't end in a few months.
- It will, though.
- I'm sure you're right, Mr Meyer.
...defending our country, our fatherland.
Now, my beloved class, this is what we must do:
Strike with all our power.
Give every ounce of strength... to win victory before the end of the year.
It is with reluctance that I bring this subject up again.
You are the life of the fatherland, you boys.
You are the iron men of Germany.
You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy... when you are called upon to do so.
It is not for me to suggest that any of you... should stand up and offer to defend his country.
But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads.
I know that in one of the schools... the boys have risen up in the classroom... and enlisted in a mass.
But, of course, if such a thing should happen here... you would not blame me for a feeling of pride.
Perhaps some will say... that you should not be allowed to go yet... that you are too young, that you have homes, mothers, fathers... that you should not be torn away.
Are your fathers so forgetful of their fatherland... that they would let it perish rather than you?
Are your mothers so weak that they cannot send a son... to defend the land which gave them birth?
And after all, is a little experience... such a bad thing for a boy?
Is the honour of wearing a uniform... something from which we should run?
And if our young ladies glory in those who wear it... is that anything to be ashamed of?
I know you have never desired the adulation of heroes.
That has not been part of my teaching.
We have sought to make ourselves worthy... and let acclaim come when it would.
But to be foremost in battle... is a virtue not to be despised.
I believe it will be a quick war... that there will be few losses.
But if losses there must be... then let us remember the Latin phrase... which must have come to the lips of many a Roman... when he stood embattled in a foreign land:
"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."
"Sweet and fitting it is to die for the fatherland. "
Some of you may have ambitions.
I know of one young man who has great promise as a writer... and he has written the first act of a tragedy... which would be a credit to one of the masters.
And he is dreaming, I suppose... of following in the footsteps of Goethe and Schiller... and I hope he will.
But now our country calls.
The fatherland needs leaders.
Personal ambition must be thrown aside... in the one great sacrifice for our country.
Here is a glorious beginning to your lives.
The field of honour calls you.
Why are we here?
You, Kropp, what has kept you back?
You, Mueller, you know how much you are needed?
Ah, I see you look at your leader.
And I, too, look to you, Paul Baumer... and I wonder what you are going to do.
- I'll go.
- I want to go.
- Count on me.
- Me too.
- I'm ready.
I'm not gonna stay home!
Follow me!
Enlist now!
- No more classes!
- No more classes!
- Don't be a quitter!
- Come on, Behn!
Stick together.
That's what we've got to do.
- Let's all stick together.
- Come on, Behn.
All right.
All right.
- I'll go.
- That's the way!
Let's go!
Hey!
Let's sing!
Come on!
Keep in line there, soldiers.
Anything you say, General.
Detail, halt!
Left face!
Get into uniform, ready to report.
Fall out!
I bet you a place like this gets you in good condition.
You have to be for the long marches.
I'm gonna get in the cavalry and ride.
No cavalry for me.
Infantry's where you see the fighting.
Where are all the guns?
That's what I want to know.
Oh, you don't get a gun for a long while yet.
If I'm gonna bump off the enemy, I gotta have some practise.
Ow!
Bayonet drill.
That's what I want.
Ah!
You won a medal that time, Mueller.
You wait.
In about a month I'll be covered with 'em.
Say, keep your boots out of my face!
Why, it's an honour to have those boots in your face.
They're the best pair in the army!
My uncle gave 'em to me.
Just look at that special imported leather.
Put 'em anyplace you like, except in my face.
Not even a kitchen maid'll look at me in this!
Attention!
Well, for the love of-- It's Himmelstoss!
- So it is.
- And all dressed up.
Hello, Himmie.
You didn't think you'd see me again so soon, did you?
- You see my rank?
- Sure.
Fall back, then!
- Himmelstoss, we certainly are glad to see you.
- What did you say?
- I was going to say--
- Never mind!
- What's the matter with you?
- When you address your superior officer, say "sir"!
- Where'd he get such a nice uniform?
- Any mail for us, Himmie?
- Quiet!
- My dear fellow, you're shouting.
Ah, come on, Himmelstoss.
We know ya.
Take off the false whiskers.
- I believe you mean it!
- You'll find out that I mean it.
- But only three days ago you were our postman.
- Silence!
Come back here!
Line up!
Line up!
Get in some kind of a line!
All of you!
Line up, I say!
Hmm.
What a pretty sight that is!
Have you never heard of standing in line?
You make a fine mess of it.
Well, I'll have to teach you.
We'll spend the whole day on it, huh?
You may be stupid, but I'm used to that.
And then there'll be plenty of other things too.
Oh, I'll not neglect you.
Hmm.
You're not much to begin with... but I'll do my best.
I see that we have come here with a slight misunderstanding... and we'll correct that, too, won't we, huh?
And the first thing to do is to forget everything you ever knew.
Everything you ever learned, forget!
See?
Forget what you've been and what you think you're going to be.
You're going to be soldiers, and that's all!
I'll take the mother's milk out of you!
I'll make you hard-boiled!
I'll make soldiers out of you or kill you!
Now... salute!
A-ten-hut!
Detachment...
lie down!
Down!
Head down!
Keep your head down, Baumer!
Detachment... get up!
Now sing!
Do you call that singing?
Detachment, halt!
So... we have no spirit, huh?
We are in no mood for recreation.
Work is what we want.
Good!
Then we'll go back to work!
Detachment, lie down!
Keep your head down!
Now sing!
Men... halt!
Order, arms!
Inspection at 3:00.
Dismissed!
Oh, that swine!
That means we get no time off.
It will take four hours to get ready for inspection.
- I'd like to know what's in his mind.
- He hasn't got any!
I'm gonna cut him open sometime and find out!
He's too thick-skinned.
He won't cut.
This is the fourth time he's made me disappoint that poor girl.
Arms!
Order, arms!
Left shoulder, arms!
Squad right.
To the right, march!
Left, left, left, left.
Column left, march!
Squad, left march!
Forward... march!
Detachment... halt!
Present arms!
Himmelstoss.
Excellent work.
They're going up front tomorrow.
- I recommend leave till midnight.
- Very good, sir.
Left, left, left.
Detachment...
lie down!
Crawl forward!
He spoilt our leave.
I'll never forgive him for that.
- The rat!
- Leave till midnight.
Hmm!
It'll take till midnight to dry our clothes.
There goes the filthy ape now.
While we slave over this mud, he goes off to have a few drinks!
Someday I'm going to take one smack at him--just one.
Me too.
That's gonna be my life's work from now on.
Why only one?
I'm gonna take several.
I might even kick him while he's down.
I feel mean.
What are you doing?
You're not going to desert, are you?
What?
Listen.
I've got an idea.
Lie down!
Crawl forward!
Lie down!
Crawl forward!
Oh!
What?
Ow!
Ow!
Cover!
Paul, you all right?
Behn!
Behn!
Behn!
Come on!
Behn, come on!
You fool!
Behn!
Get up!
Come on.
-Sounds like more replacements coming in.
Yeah.
Tjaden must have gone home for that wood.
There's some more, fresh from the turnip patch.
I suppose this is where we bunk.
That's me, "I. Westhus,"
and this is where I live.
- I didn't know!
- Well, you know now!
Yes.
Yes, of course.
- It's all right.
- Here's a bunk, Paul.
- When did we eat last?
- Don't remind me.
- I was fine until you spoke.
- Where are we anyway?
I don't know.
The name on the railroad station's been shot off.
There must be something to eat somewhere.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll ask those fellas.
Sorry to disturb you, Mr Westhus.
Oh.
Meet Detering.
A better farmer never lived.
- And Mr Tjaden.
- Sit down.
You see, we haven't eaten since breakfast.
We thought maybe you could tell us what we ought to do about it.
Eat without further delay.
Well, what's funny about that?
This is a bad town to bring an appetite to, soldier.
We've been here since yesterday morning, living on baled hay and razor blades.
We're willing to buy our food.
Where's the canteen?
The only canteen in these regions is out looking for supplies.
- Ever hear of Katczinsky?
- Who?
Katczinsky.
He's uncanny.
If there's any food within 25 miles, he'll be the one to get it.
Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hup!
- Hup!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Attention!
- What is this?
- Volunteers for the future generals' staff.
Sometime I'm gonna take one of you volunteers apart... and find out what makes you leave school and join the army.
At ease.
This is no parade ground.
- Hungry?
- Yes.
Wait!
Wait a minute!
That's no invitation.
- Can you pay?
- Yeah, sure.
- I have some money.
No, not money.
That's just pieces of paper.
Have you got any cigarettes, cigars...
- or soap, cognac--
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Chewing tobacco?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Kat!
Are you crazy?
There ain't enough here for us.
I wish you three would get bumped off.
I'm tired of feeding ya for nothing.
Bring everything you got.
- I'm so hungry--
- I'd be glad to give you--
- Come on!
- Is this enough, sir?
- Kat!
- Hmm?
- You've got the wiring detail tonight.
- Where?
- Past the graveyard.
- With this bunch?
It's quiet tonight.
You can teach 'em a couple of things.
Thanks.
I'd rather do it alone.
- These babes get killed off too fast.
- Well, the lorry's waiting.
Last night I was too hungry to sleep... and tonight, when I get the wrinkles out of my gut, they think up wiring duty.
Well, here's your chance, heroes.
Come on, get your stuff and let's get out of here.
- Is that any way to drive?
- Let him drive any way he wants.
Suppose he breaks your arm.
You get sent home, don't you?
A lot better than havin' a hole in your guts.
If there's any of you left, I'll pick you up in the morning.
Well, if that ride you gave us didn't kill us, nothing will.
- And be on time.
I don't want to miss my breakfast.
- Huh?
- You better wait for your army, Papa.
Here, here.
Don't be so backward.
Listen, children.
All we got to do is to string a little wire.
We pick it up at the dump and carry it to where we need it.
Now, you're gonna see some shell fire, and you're gonna be scared, see?
It's all right, boy.
Get up.
Here.
Never mind.
It's happened to better men than you, and it's happened to me.
When we come back, I'll get you all some nice clean underwear.
That kind of shell you don't have to pay much attention to.
Those big fellas just make a lot of noise and land about five miles behind the line.
The things we've got to watch out for are the light ones.
They don't give you much warning.
They go "waa-aa-aah zing."
And when you hear that, down!
Mother Earth.
Press yourselves down upon her.
Bury yourselves deep into her.
Just keep your eyes on me.
When you see me flop, you flop... only try to beat me to it.
Shh-shh.
Now listen.
I'll show you how it's done.
Give me a couple of those.
That's to kill the noise.
Tjaden.
See that?
- What's that mean?
- Bombardment.
My eyes!
I'm blind!
I can't see!
God!
My eyes!
I can't see!
- I can't see!
- It's Behn!
It's Behn!
- I'll go get him--
- You'll get killed!
- Let me--
- Lay down and stay there!
He's dead.
- He's dead!
- Why did you risk your life bringing' him in?
But it's Behn!
- My friend.
- He's a corpse, no matter who it is.
Now, don't any of you ever do that again.
Put him over there.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
- Mind the wire.
All right, come on.
All right, come on.
Get your packs and fall in.
Hurry up!
Come on.
Hurry up.
Make it snappy.
Get your packs and fall in.
Kat, what are we doing?
What's happening?
You heard him.
Orders to march.
- But where to, for the love of--
- Another party.
And this one is gonna last a long time.
Come on.
Here we go.
Company, attention!
Shoulder arms!
March right, march!
Take your hands off that!
- Queen takes it!
- Well, if you think that's a queen, look again.
Ah, it's a jack.
- Yeah.
- Honest, these cards all look alike.
It's too noisy!
I can't play.
- I suppose your delicate nerves can't stand it.
- Get up!
That's Oscar.
The son of a--
Look at that!
Don't be so snooty.
You may wish you had this back.
About two more days of this... and this rat-bitten end of a piece of bread's gonna taste like a hunk of fruit cake.
It wouldn't-
- It wouldn't last two more days, would it?
Didn't I tell you this was gonna be a bad one?
I don't mind the days so much.
It's keeping up all night--
Ah, two more days makes a week, kid.
Then you can say you've been under fire!
You're not scared, are you?
No.
I was just asking.
That's all.
- Wanna play some more?
- Do you?
- Sure.
- All right.
My deal.
You better get your boot back before Oscar eats that!
The kid's all right.
Behn!
Behn.
Yeah, yeah.
Let him sleep.
He's dreamin'.
Oh, God.
Can't you see it's Behn?
He didn't want to come to war!
No, no.
It isn't Behn.
It isn't Behn!
It's Kemmerick!
It's me!
Shut up, will you?
It's bad enough in here as it is.
Every--
Everything's all right, Franz.
You're dreaming.
You're just dreaming, I guess.
- Attention!
- At ease.
The barrage is gettin' worse.
The men in two more dugouts gone.
However, we'll do our best to get some food up here by evening.
Stop!
Stop!
Let me out!
- What did you do that for?
- Shut up!
Grab him.
- No.
- Now hold him.
You all right now?
I think so.
I couldn't hold out much longer.
- Oh, God, it's Franz!
- Get him over there!
No, don't.
He's been hit in the stomach.
He can't have anything to drink.
Get a stretcher.
Where'd they get you, Kemmerick?
- Here it is, sir.
- Take his head.
All right.
Take him out.
- Is it serious, sir?
- I'm not sure.
- Tell the others he's all right.
- Yes, sir.
If we're going to fight, why don't we fight?
Why don't we go over?
You could go crazy staying here.
Let's do something!
- Let's go after 'em!
- Sit down!
If that cook of ours had any guts, he'd try to bring something through.
He's so far behind the lines he can't hear the shooting!
- Here's Kat.
Get anything?
- Any luck?
- We'll have to split this up among us.
- Something to eat!
We need butter too.
Yes.
And dessert.
And a feather bed to sleep on.
- Rats!
- Rats!
- Rats!
Get out of the way!
- That's enough.
- That's enough, boys.
What's that?
Come on!
Grab your rifles!
Come on!
- Here they come.
- Get your grenades here.
Hurry up.
Come on, hurry up.
Let's go!
Let's go!
We can't hold this position.
Back to your own lines!
- Fill it up.
- And hurry up.
I've got other things to do.
I've been waiting for this for three weeks.
When they all get here.
What do you want?
Beans, you homely-lookin' son of a frog's leg.
- What do you think I want?
- We're hungry.
Shut up!
I'll feed you when you're all here.
- We're all here now.
- Only half the company's here.
Get the rest.
Wake 'em up.
I wish I could wake 'em up.
There's 80 of us left.
The rest is in dressing stations or pushing' up daisies.
Eighty?
And I cooked for 150!
All right.
We'll have enough for once.
Come on.
Dish out!
You mean you've cooked beans for 150... and you've got bread for 150... and sausage for 150, and tobacco for 150?
Everything!
It's all wrong.
I should have been notified.
What a feast!
Everyone gets two issues.
- Get back in line!
Get back in line!
- Oh, no!
That won't do.
I can't give 80 men what's meant for 150.
Listen.
You drew rations for the 2nd Company, didn't ya?
Yeah.
All right.
We're the 2nd Company.
I've got my orders.
- Kat's right.
- We're the 2nd Company.
And if only half of us get back, that's our good luck.
- Come on.
Dish it out.
- Come on!
- No!
- Hey!
You're the yellowest baboon that ever drew a cook wagon... and you're scared-- it shows.
All we want to hear out of you is one more little yip... and we'll cut ya up and eat ya raw.
Why, you keep your kitchen so far back of the lines... we never get anything to eat until it's cold and we're asleep!
Now, you low-down rat, get out... or we wreck the joint!
- Come on!
Give us--
- Attention!
At ease.
What's goin' on here?
He's cooked for 150, sir, and he only wants to give us half.
- Looks pretty good.
- Yes, sir.
- Serve the whole issue.
The men can use it.
- Yes, sir.
- And bring me a plate too.
- Yes, sir.
All right.
Take it all.
Take everything.
Give 'em honey.
Give 'em what they want.
- Fill it up!
- Fill it up!
- Don't mind me.
- Oh, that's all right.
Don't mention it.
You know...
I could do with some more beans.
Go help yourself.
There's more over there.
It's too far.
- I wonder, when are we going back to the front?
- Tomorrow.
It's enough to take away a man's appetite.
You know, if they're gonna march us in again tomorrow... we ought to go see how Kemmerick is.
- That's a good idea.
- Let's do that.
- How far is the dressing station?
- About two miles.
- We could take his things to him.
- Good.
It seemed rotten to think of a thing like that happening to him... a nice fellow like Kemmerick.
Ah, the French certainly deserve to be punished for starting this war.
Everybody says it's somebody else.
Well, how do they start a war?
Well, one country offends another.
How could one country offend another?
You mean there's a mountain over in Germany gets mad at a field over in France?
Well, stupid, one people offends another.
Oh, if that's it, I shouldn't be here at all.
I don't feel offended.
It don't apply to tramps like you.
Good.
Then I can be going home right away.
- Ah, you just try it.
- Yeah.
You wanna get shot?
The kaiser and me--
Me and the kaiser felt just alike about this war.
We didn't either of us want any war, so I'm going home.
- He's there already.
- Somebody must have wanted it.
Maybe it was the English.
No, I don't want to shoot any Englishmen.
I never saw one till I came up here.
And I suppose most of them never saw a German till they came up here.
- No, I'm sure they weren't asked about it.
- No.
Well... it must be doing somebody some good.
- Not me and the kaiser.
- I think maybe the kaiser wanted a war.
You leave us out of this!
I don't see that.
The kaiser's got everything he needs.
Well, he never had a war before.
Every full-grown emperor needs one war to make him famous.
- Why, that's history.
- Yeah, generals too.
They need war.
And manufacturers.
They get rich.
I think it's more a kind of fever.
Nobody wants it in particular... and then all at once, there it is.
We didn't want it.
The English didn't want it.
And here we are fighting.
I'll tell you how it should all be done.
Whenever there's a big war comin' on...
- you should rope off a big field--
- And sell tickets.
Yeah.
And--
And on the big day... you should take all the kings and their cabinets and their generals... put them in the centre dressed in their underpants... and let 'em fight it out with clubs.
The best country wins.
Well, now that Kat's settled everything, let's go see Kemmerick.
- Something interesting might happen on the way.
- Might cheer him up.
Boys, me and the kaiser want you back in time to march tomorrow.
Don't forget.
- We'll be back.
- Give the boy my regards.
There he is.
- Hello, Kemmerick.
- How are ya?
- How's it going?
- How are things going?
- Are they looking after you all right?
How are they treating you?
Franz?
They're robbers here.
Robbers.
They stole my watch!
I always told you, nobody should carry as good a watch as that.
- They took it while I was under ether!
- Franz, you'll get it back.
Do you feel all right?
-Just look at my hand.
- That's because you lost so much blood.
-Just eat decently and you'll get well again.
- Oh, no.
You must eat.
That's the main thing.
It looks good too.
I have such a terrible pain in my foot.
Every toe on my right foot hurts.
Well, how can your foot hurt when your leg's been--
I know what you mean!
I know!
I know now!
They cut my leg off.
Why didn't they tell me?
Why-
- Why didn't they tell me?
- Franz!
Franz!
- Now I can't walk any more!
You must be thankful that you've come off with only that.
I wanted to be a forester once.
You can yet.
They make artificial legs that are wonderful.
And you're through too.
You can go home.
Think of that.
We brought your things for you.
See?
Put 'em under the bed.
That's a marvellous pair of boots.
Look at that leather!
What comfort.
I was just thinking.
If you're not going to be using these, Franz, why don't you leave 'em with us?
What good are they to you?
I can use 'em.
My boots give me blister after blister--
Well, we'll be going, Franz.
Oh, don't go.
Stay just a little while longer.
- I'll come right back.
- We'll be coming soon again, Franz.
- I know you'll be feeling better.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Goodbye, Franz.
You think he'll last till after mess?
- I don't think--
- Done for.
Boys, you go along.
I'll see you later.
Goodbye.
All right, Paul.
I'm sorry, Paul.
I wouldn't touch a thing of his if he could use it.
I'd go barefoot over barbed wire for him if it'd do him any good.
Only-
- Only why should some orderly get those boots?
I understand, Mueller.
We're all alike out here.
And good boots are scarce.
Tell the doctor to come, please.
Doctor, the man in the next bed would like to see you, sir.
I've done everything I can for him.
There's no helping him.
Poor little fella.
He says next time, Franz.
Do you think I'll ever get well?
Why, of course.
- Do you really think so?
- Sure, once you get over the operation.
I don't think so.
Franz!
Don't talk nonsense.
Why, you'll be as good as new.
They fix up worse things than that.
Perhaps you'll go to the convalescent home... in Klosterberg among the villagers.
Then you can look out of the windows, across the fields... to the two trees on the horizon.
The loveliest time of the year now when the corn ripens.
You can go out without asking anyone.
You can even play piano if you want to.
Oh-
- Oh, but, Franz, you must try to sleep now.
O God... this is Franz Kemmerick... only 19 years old.
He doesn't want to die.
Please don't let him die.
Paul.
- Paul.
- Franz.
Take my boots home for Mueller.
Oh, no, Franz, no.
And if...
Paul... you find my watch, send it home.
Franz!
Doctor.
Doctor!
Doctor!
Doctor!
Where's the doctor?
Why isn't there a doctor here?
- Doctor, come quick.
Franz Kemmerick is dying!
- Which one is that?
- Amputated leg.
- I've amputated a dozen legs today.
- Bed 26, sir.
- You see to it.
I'm due in the operating room.
One operation after another since 5:00 this morning.
Sixteen dead today, and yours is the 17th.
There'll probably be 20 by the morning.
You're lookin' good.
Very good today.
What's your hurry?
Hey!
I'll bet he stole those boots!
- I got it, Kat.
- Hmm?
Listen: "The sum of an arithmetic series... is S = A + L x N over 2."
- Interesting, isn't it?
- What do you wanna learn that stuff for?
One day you'll stop a bullet and it'll all be worthless.
- I get a lot of fun out of it.
- Aah!
My boots!
Mueller.
I saw him die.
I didn't know what it was like to die before.
And then-- then I came outside... and it felt-- it felt so good to be alive that I started in to walk fast.
I began to think of the strangest things... like being out in the fields.
Things like that.
You know-- girls.
And it felt as if there were... something electric running from the ground up through me.
And I started.
I began to run hard.
I passed soldiers and I heard voices calling to me.
I ran and I ran.
I felt as if I couldn't breathe enough air into me.
And-- And now I'm hungry.
I don't mind the war now.
Be a pleasure to go to the front in boots like these.
It's a good invention just the same.
If you crack each separate louse, think of all the energy you use up.
Watch.
Burned to death.
- How was patrol?
Bad?
- Must've been terrible if they had time to gather the harvest.
We passed a cherry tree and when he saw it, he went crazy.
I could hardly drag him away.
It was... beautiful.
I have a big orchard with cherry trees at home.
When they're in full blossom... from the hayloft it looks like one single sheet.
So white.
- Perhaps you can get leave soon.
- You may even be sent back as a farmer.
A woman can't run a farm alone.
That's no good, you know?
No matter how hard she works.
Harvest coming on again.
What's the matter with him?
Got a letter yesterday from his wife.
He wants to get back to his farm.
We'd all like to get back home.
I wonder what we'd do if it were suddenly peacetime again?
Get drunk and look for women!
I'd go looking for a Cinderella... that could wear this for a garter.
And when I'd found her, nobody'd see me for two weeks.
I'll go back to the peat fields... and those pleasant hours in the beer gardens.
And there's worse things than cobbling too.
Look.
My family.
I oughta give you a kick in the backside for startin' all this.
It's all right for all you to talk.
You've got something to go back to:
wives, children, jobs.
But what about us?
What have we got to go back to?
- School?
- Why not?
You know everything already?
A man can't take all that rubbish they teach you seriously... after three years of shells and bombs.
- You can't peel that off easily.
- They never taught us anything really useful like how to light a cigarette in the wind or make a fire out of wet wood... or bayonet a man in the belly instead of the ribs where it gets jammed.
What can happen to us afterwards?
I'll tell ya.
Take our class.
Out of 20, three are officers... nine dead...
Mueller and three others wounded... and one in the madhouse.
We'll all be dead someday, so let's forget it.
Hurry up!
Get in there!
Hurry up!
Himmelstoss!
What's up?
- What are you, crazy?
- It's Himmelstoss!
Himmelstoss?
There is justice in the army!
Well, well.
So, we are all here, huh?
- A bit longer than you, Himmie.
- Since when have we become so familiar?
Stand up and click your heels together!
All of you!
- Take a running jump at yourself!
- Who's your friend?
Would somebody get General Ludendorff a nice, comfortable chair?
I command you as your superior officer!
- Do you want to be court-martialled?
- I do!
There's going to be a big attack tonight and I'd just love to get out of it.
Will you obey my orders?
Kiss my butt!
It isn't customary to ask for salutes here.
But I'll tell you what we'll do.
We're going to attack a town that we tried to take once before.
Many killed and many wounded.
It was great fun.
This time you're going with us.
If any of us stops a bullet, before we die... we're going to come to you, click our heels together and ask stiffly...
-"Please, Sergeant Himmelstoss, may we go?"
- You'll--
You'll pay for this, you--
There it is.
Right on time.
Better get ready, boys.
I'm wounded!
I'm wounded!
It's just a scratch, you yellow rat!
Up!
Get out with the others!
- Up!
- No!
No!
No!
You yellow rat!
Stinking yellow rat!
Let the others do it, eh?
Get up!
Get up!
- Aa-aah!
- Get up!
Forward!
- Get out here!
- Command... was forward.
Command was forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Counter-attack.
I want to help you.
I want to help you.
Stop that!
Stop it, stop it.
I can bear the rest of it.
I can't listen to that!
Why do you take so long dying?
You're going to die anyway!
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
You won't die.
Oh, no.
You won't die.
They're only little wounds.
You'll get home.
You'll be all right.
You'll get home long before I will.
You know I can't run away.
That's why you accuse me.
I tell you, I didn't want to kill you.
I tried to keep you alive.
If you jumped in here again, I wouldn't do it.
When you jumped in here you were my enemy, and I was afraid of you.
But you'rejust a man like me, and I killed you.
Forgive me, comrade.
Say that for me.
Say you forgive me.
Oh, no.
You're dead.
You're better off than I am.
You're through.
They can't do any more to you now.
Oh, God, why did they do this to us?
We only wanted to live, you and I.
Why should they send us out to fight each other?
If we threw away these rifles and these uniforms... you could be my brother just like Kat and Albert.
You'll have to forgive me, comrade.
I'll do all I can.
I'll write to your parents.
I'll write to--
I'll write to your wife.
I'll write to her.
I promise she'll not want for anything.
I'll help her and your parents too.
Only forgive me.
Forgive me!
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Terrible thing happened yesterday.
I stabbed a man.
With my own hands, stabbed him.
I know how it is.
Your first time.
Never mind.
The stretcher-bearers will find him.
- He's dead.
I watched him die.
- You couldn't do anything about it.
We have to kill.
We can't help it.
That's what we are here for.
Uh-
- Look there, for instance.
Hah!
That got him.
You should've seen how he leaped in the air.
That fellow had to shoot with us for today with three hits.
If he keeps it up, he'll have a decoration for his buttonhole this evening.
Don't you lose any more sleep over this business.
Maybe it was 'cause I was out there with him so long, huh?
Sure, that's it.
After all, war is war.
March!
Forward!
Forward, march!
Quick there!
Forward!
Company... halt!
Dismissed!
Uncommissioned officers, enlisted men... dismissed!
Hooray!
Come on!
Let's get outta here!
- Give me your best sausage.
- Two.
Give me a beer.
One, two, three!
Hey, come on.
A beer.
Hey, get out of here!
Come on.
Give me a beer.
Oh, ho ho!
A beer.
One b--
Here's hoping we get falling-down drunk tonight.
Here's how it started.
I'd forgotten there were girls like that.
There aren't.
Just look at those thin, little shoes.
She couldn't march many miles in those.
Paul!
Don't speak about marching.
You're boring the young lady.
A thousand pardons.
- How old do you think she is?
- Oh, about 22.
No, that'd make her older than us.
She's... 17.
A girl like that.
That'd be good, eh, Albert?
We wouldn't have much of a chance with him around.
- We could take a bath, wash our clothes--
- All right.
and I might even go so far as to get deloused.
Wait a minute!
She's a long way from here now.
Look at the date.
May, 1917.
- Four months ago.
- That's true.
Well, here's to her anyway.
Here's to 'em all, everywhere.
Albert...
- we might as well wash up anyway.
- All right.
Personally, I like 'em bigger around.
This conversation was on a high moral plane up to now.
Now we do need a bath.
- A bath?
- For what?
Hm.
You wouldn't understand.
This water is freezing.
This romantic business has gone too far.
- Ahh, but think of her beautiful eyes!
- Oh!
Oh, and her hair.
- Here we are!
- We're not gonna miss a thing!
- Go away!
- What are you doing here?
- Bathing!
They tell me there's some people in this world takes a bath every week!
- Women!
Mademoiselle, you want to swim?
Aw, baby!
Aw, no, girls!
Don't go away!
Aw, mama!
- Please don't go!
- Don't go away!
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!
Food!
Food!
Whoo-hoo!
Halt!
You know you're forbidden to cross.
You fellows stay on this side or you'll get yourselves in a lot of trouble.
- What are they jabbering' about?
- They want us to swing over tonight.
They're expecting us.
- That's fine!
- We'll do it!
- That blonde's crazy about me.
- But there's four of us and only three of them.
- I was the one that stopped 'em!
That blonde piece of work is mine.
You three fight for what's left.
Fight's the word.
All's fair in love and war.
Huh?
What do you mean?
What're you gonna do?
You'll find out.
Au revoir!
Au revoir!
- C'est moi, blondie!
- Bon ami!
Bon ami!
Vos camarades!
Vos camarades!
Ooh!
She means the door.
Not only modest, but dashing!
A perfect fit.
- It might've been made for me.
- An officer's coat.
We're calling distinguished company.
Merci.
Have another little drink, comrade.
Is this your birthday or mine?
Why?
You've been buying me drink after drink for two hours.
What I'm tryin' to figure out is why.
Why?
Why?
Oh!
Ha-ha!
Oh.
I-It's just that the boys... told me to amuse you for a little while.
Oh, nice boys.
Yeah!
They-They said you'd understand.
Ehh... heh.
Huh?
I've been betrayed!
Yeah, you certainly have.
Take that for a minute!
I'll give you more!
Ahh.
It's too loud.
Pauvre garçon.
Pauvre petit garçon.
- Darling.
- Quoi?
- What's your name?
-Je ne comprends pas.
Name.
How do you say name?
Georgette?
Camille?
Oh, mon nom.
Suzanne.
Suzanne.
Et toi?
Quel est ton nom?
- Paul.
- Paul.
C'est un joli nom.
Suzanne, I wish I could tell you something.
- I wish you could understand.
- Oh, non, non. I faut pas--
Darling, I'll never see you again.
I know that.
And I wouldn't even know you if I did.
And yet, I'll remember you always.
Toujours.
Oh, if you could only know how different this is from the women we soldiers meet.
Oh, non, non, I faut tout oublier.
C'est cette guerre, cette terrible guerre!
No, no, no.
Not the war.
You.
That's what I'm talking about.
Vous.
It seems as though all war and terror and grossness... had fallen away from me... like a miracle.
Like something I never believed.
Pauvre garçon.
Pauvre garçon.
Call Paul.
We're going, Paul.
Have a look.
Nice, new coffins.
Huh!
For us.
I must say, that's a very cheerful preparation for this offensive.
That's very considerate of them.
But I don't see any long enough for our comrade Tjaden.
Mind you, I'm not speaking to you, you traitors.
- But no coffin's gonna get me.
- I should say not, heartbreaker.
You'll be thankful if they slip a waterproof sheet...
- around that Aunt Sally of a carcass of yours.
Oh-Oh, my side!
My side.
Catholic hospital, Albert.
They say you always get good food and good treatment.
- We're lucky.
- After that rainy dressing station... and 24 hours on the train, we deserve to have some luck.
I'm Hamacher.
Yeah, that's my name.
I got a crack in the head and they gave me a certificate stating...
"Josef Hamacher is periodically... not responsible for his actions."
And ever since then, Hamacher has been having a grand time.
I hope you boys are not too badly wounded.
The others die off so quickly we don't have time to get acquainted.
You'll get to know us...
very well.
Thank you.
You too.
I'm sorry, my dear.
It's time to go now.
Yes, sister.
Watch.
If they take his clothes away, you've seen the last of him.
- See?
They're taking him to the dying room.
- Dying room?
When you're ready to kick the bucket, they get you out of the way so they can use the bed.
In the corner of the building there's a little room... right next to the morgue!
It's so convenient.
It saves a lot of trouble.
But suppose he gets well?
I've seen a lot of'em go in that dying room... but nobody ever comes back.
Sister.
Sister.
Sister.
- Is that you ringing, Paul?
- Yes.
- Is something going on?
- I think I have a haemorrhage.
The bandage is all wet.
I've been ringing forever and nobody comes.
- I think I'm bleeding.
- Sister, get me a sterile dressing and an ice pack.
- Why didn't someone call me?
- He's been ringing.
Nobody can walk, Sister.
- Sister, is it bad?
- No.
No, we'll be all right.
We've got it in time.
What's the matter?
What are you doing?
We must rearrange your bandages.
Wh-
- Where are you taking me?
To the bandaging ward.
- No, no!
I'm not going!
I'm staying here!
- Paul!
Paul!
- Now, now!
- I'm not going to the dying room!
- We're going to the bandaging ward.
- Why are you taking my clothes?
You're lying to me!
But I'll come back.
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
I'm not going to die!
I'll come back!
Sister Libertine, how is he?
Poor boy.
They had to amputate his leg.
Paul.
Paul.
Paul.
Oh, he is... gone.
Gone.
Hello.
Welcome home, Albert!
- How do you feel, kid?
- All right.
But I've got such an awful pain.
My foot hur--
Hamacher.
Did they cut my leg off?
Of course not!
How many did you have?
Two?
You still got 'em!
One, two!
Don't play the fool, Hamacher.
Tell me truthfully.
Of course not.
And you look fine.
Look.
See?
- I won't be a cripple.
- Now, now.
- I won't live like that!
- Be calm.
- I'll kill myself the first chance I get!
- Albert!
- I won't live!
I won't live!
- Yes, you will.
Albert!
Albert!
Albert, I've come back!
I told you I'd come back.
Look, everybody!
I've come back!
- Paul!
Paul!
- That's not where I'm going.
I live over there.
Paul, I'm so happy.
Hamacher, I've come back from the dead!
- It's most irregular.
Never happened before.
- Albert, get well quickly... so we can go home soon.
- Everything will be all right now.
- Yes, Paul.
Everything will be all right... now.
Oh!
Paul!
Paul!
Paul.
- What's the matter, Paul?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
Paul.
Give me your handkerchief.
- Mother?
- Here I am, Paul.
Here I am.
Mother's ill.
- Are you wounded?
- No, Mother.
I got leave.
Here I am cryin' instead of being glad.
Anna, get down the jar of blackberries.
You still like them, don't you?
Yes, Mother.
I haven't had any for a long time.
We might almost have known you were coming.
- I'm making potato cakes.
- Don't let them burn.
Paul... sit down... beside me.
My Paul.
My baby.
I almost forgot, Mother.
I've got some little presents for you.
Look, Mother.
Bread, sausage and rice.
- Paul, you've been starving yourself.
- Hmm-mm.
Hadn't I better go and tell Father paul's home?
- Paul could watch the things on the stove.
- No, I'm getting up.
Oh, Paul, you're a soldier now, aren't you?
But somehow, I don't seem to know you.
I'll take these off, Mother.
I'll get your suit.
It's in the wardrobe, just where you left it.
Are you really here, Paul?
You won't--
You won't disappear, will you?
No.
I'm here.
Your things are ready for you, Paul.
- I remember when you caught that one.
- Yes.
And you took it away from me, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
We're behind the lines, but we know how to honour the soldier... who goes on in spite of blood and death.
Gentlemen, my son.
- Prosit.
- Prosit.
I'm glad to know you, young man, I am glad to know you.
How are things out there?
Terrible, eh?
Terrible.
But we must carry on.
After all, you do at least get decent food out there.
Naturally, it's worse here.
Naturally.
But the best for our soldiers all the time.
That's our motto.
The best for our soldiers.
But...
- you must give the Frenchies a good licking!
And, if you boys want to come home, eh... let me show you what you must do before you can come home.
Give us a hand there, men.
Now, then, there's the line.
Runs so, in a "V".
Here is St Quentin.
You can see for yourself.
You're almost through now.
All right?
Shove ahead out there and don't stick to that everlasting trench warfare!
Smash through the johnnies!
And then you will have peace.
When you get in it... the war isn't the way it looks back here.
Oh!
You don't know anything about it.
Of course, you know about the details... but this relates to the whole!
You can't judge that.
Of course, you do your duty and you risk your life.
But for that, you receive the highest honour.
I said that every man in the war ought to have the lron Cross.
First, the enemy lines must be broken through in Flanders.
- On to Paris!
Push on to Paris!
- Right.
No, not in Flanders.
I'll tell you just where the break should come.
- Here.
- The enemy has too many reserves there.
- I insist upon Flanders!
- Why should they do that... when they're halfway through St Quentin already?
Because Flanders is a flat country!
- No mountains, no obstructions!
- There's too many rivers there!
From the farms they have gone;
from the schools, from the factories.
They have gone bravely, nobly, ever forward... realizing there is no other duty now but to save the fatherland.
Paul!
How are you, Paul?
Glad to see you, Professor.
You've come at the right moment, Baumer!
Just at the right moment.
And as if to prove all I have said, here is one of the first to go.
A lad who sat before me on these very benches... who gave up all to serve in the first year of the war;
one of the iron youth who have made Germany invincible in the field.
Look at him-- sturdy and bronze and clear-eyed.
The kind of soldier every one of you should envy.
Oh, lad, you must speak to them.
You must tell them what it means to serve your fatherland.
- No, I can't tell them anything.
- You must, Paul.
Just a word.
Just tell them how much they're needed out there.
Tell them why you went and what it meant to you.
I can't say anything.
You can remember some deed of heroism, some touch of nobility.
Tell about it.
I can't tell you anything you don't know.
We live in the trenches out there.
We fight.
We try not to be killed;
sometimes we are.
That's all.
No.
No, Paul.
I've been there!
I know what it's like.
That's not what one dwells on, Paul.
I heard you in here reciting that same old stuff... making more iron men, more young heroes.
You still think it's beautiful and sweet to die for your country, don't you?
We used to think you knew.
The first bombardment taught us better.
It's dirty and painful to die for your country.
When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all!
There are millions out there dying for their countries, and what good is it?
Paul!
You asked me to tell them how much they're needed out there.
He tells you, "Go out and die."
Oh, but if you'll pardon me, it's easier to say "Go out and die" than it is to do it.
- Coward!
-Andit 'seasiertosayitthanto watchit happen.
No!
No!
Boys,boys!
- I'm sorry, Baumer, but I must say--
- It's no use talking like this.
You won't know what I mean.
Only, it's been a long while since we enlisted out of this classroom.
So long I thought maybe the whole world had learned by this time.
Only now they're sending babies, and they won't last a week!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
Up at the front you're alive or you're dead, and that's all!
You can't fool anybody about that very long.
Up there we know we're lost and done for whether we're dead or alive.
Three years we've had of it-- four years.
Every day a year and every night a century.
Our bodies are earth and our thoughts are clay... and we sleep and eat with death.
We're done for because you can't live that way and keep anything inside you!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
I'll go back tomorrow.
I've got four days more, but I can't stand it here!
I'll go back tomorrow!
Sorry.
Mother, you'll catch cold here.
You must go to sleep.
There'll be plenty of time to sleep... when you're gone.
Must you go tomorrow, Paul?
Must you?
Yes, Mother.
Orders were changed.
Are you very much afraid, Paul?
No, Mother.
There's something I want to say to you, Paul.
It's--
Just be on your guard against the women out there.
They're no good.
Where we are, there aren't any women, Mother.
Be very careful at the front, Paul.
Yes, Mother, I will.
I'll pray for you every day.
And if you could, get a job that's not quite so dangerous.
Yes, Mother.
I'll try and get in the cookhouse.
- That can easily be done.
- You do it then, and if the others say anything--
That won't worry me, Mother.
Now, you must go to bed and you must get well quickly before I come back.
I put two sets of underwear-- new ones-- in your pack.
They'll keep you nice and warm.
They're all wool.
That's sweet of you.
Goodnight... my son.
Goodnight, Mother.
Oh, Mother, Mother.
You still think I'm a child.
Why can't I put my head in your lap and cry?
- Is this the 2nd Company?
- Yes, sir.
- Is this all of it?
- Yes, sir.
We had 150 men, but this is all that came back yesterday.
But now they're going to give us enough to make 150 again.
How old are you?
Sixteen.
No use.
I couldn't find anything.
We'll have to eat the sawdust.
Not me!
I'll go hungry first.
It makes me sick.
Now it's gonna be a real war again.
Paul!
How's old Paul?
Here I am.
You know, the 2nd Company's getting hard to find.
Nobody seemed to know where you were.
I'm glad you found it.
I guess I don't get much of this.
There used to be some food in the sawdust.
Now it's all sawdust.
No joke, either.
Eats ya up inside.
This doesn't look much like the old 2nd Company.
The replacements are all like that.
Not even old enough to carry a pack.
All they know how to do is die.
I guess... some of the old-timers are here yet.
Paul, they're tryin' to invent somethin' to kill me right now.
Where's Westhus?
- Messenger dog was wounded.
- He went out to get it.
- Is it true about the armistice?
- Doesn't look that way back there.
- You mean they want us to go on fighting?
- That's what they say.
They're crazy!
Germany'll be empty pretty soon.
Where is-- Where is Detering?
He got homesick.
You remember about the cherry blossoms?
I guess he never got over that.
He started out one night to go home and help his wife with the farm.
They got him behind the lines, and we never heard of him since.
He was just homesick, but probably they couldn't see it that way.
Where's Kat?
Is he--
Not Kat!
If he were out, the war would be over.
You remember what he always says:
They're savin' him for the last.
- Where is he?
- He's out lookin' for food, something to make soup with.
- Which way?
- Down the road about two miles that way.
I'll see you later.
Kat!
Paul!
Hello, Paul.
- How's the side?
- Oh, it's all right now.
It's fine.
- Have any luck?
- No, the general's staff's been over this country with a rake.
Let's sit down there.
Tell me, Paul...
how was it at home?
Have a good leave?
- In spots.
- What's the matter?
Ohh...
I'm no good for back there any more, Kat.
None of us are.
We've been in this too long.
The young men thought I was a coward because I told them that... we learn that death is stronger than duty to one's country.
The old men said, "Go on.
Push on to Paris."
My father even wanted me to wear my uniform around him.
It's not home back there any more.
All I could think of was, "I'd like to get back and see Kat again."
You're all I've got left, Kat.
I'm not much to have left.
I missed you, Paul.
At least we know what it's all about out here.
There're no lies here.
Push on to Paris?
You ought to see what they've got on the other side.
They eat white bread over there.
They've got dozens of aeroplanes to our one... and tanks that'll go over anything.
What've we got left?
Guns so worn they drop shells on our own men.
No food, no ammunition, no officers.
Push on to Paris!
So that's the way they talk back there.
I guess we'd better be going.
How I lied to my poor mother.
I told her it wasn't so bad out here because there was always a lot of us together.
Now that I'm with you, I'm beginning to believe that I told her the truth.
Down!
That's another one that missed us.
Come on.
Let's go.
Wait a minute.
Looks like the old bread wagon's broke down.
- I guess I don't walk the rest of the way.
- Did that get ya, Kat?
Aah, I think it broke my shin.
That's not so bad.
Hold it together.
-Just my luck, huh?
- Good luck.
That means the war is over.
Oh, no, sir!
This war don't end till they really get me.
Now this one--
- Aah.
- Easy, now.
- Hey!
- Easy!
Easy!
Come on.
I'll take you in.
Give me your hand.
Easy.
All right.
Well, kid...
now we're gonna be separated.
Maybe we can do something together later on when the war is over.
- Yes, kid.
- You give me your address, I'll give you mine.
You can't get both of us in one day.
Ah, we'll surely see each other again, Kat.
Remember that day when you brought the whole pig into the factory?
And that day in the woods when you taught us how to dodge shells?
And my first bombardment.
How I cried.
I was a young recruit then.
Here we are.
Here we are.
All right now, Kat.
You could've spared yourself the trouble.
He's dead.
Oh, no.
He's just fainted.
He was hit in the shin.
He's dead.
Would you like to take his pay book?
- You're not related, are you?
- No, we're not related.
Your deal.
Get his name and number?
Yeah, Corporal Stanislaus Katczinsky, 306.
Buy an extra paper!
Buy a paper!
Big advance...
But I've told you!
We have many many more women than we can possibly use!
I'd only be too glad to give you work
-You can't make me believe, sir, that in a big war like this, you can't possibly find something for me to do?
You've tried the hospitals I suppose?
-That I have, Mister.
Hospitals, nursing, bandaging, munitions everything!
They all say the same thing.
You're too old!
I'm not too old!
As a charwoman, I can outscrub any lady of my profession in London!
I'm not as old as you are, judging by appearances!
You're working for your country!
You could knit for a soldier?
-Everybody's knitting things!
I want to do something different!
Something more, more...
Why, I could scrub floors here, and then you could spare another man to go to France, and I'd be doing my bit!
It's a wonderful spirit you old ladies are showing!
If there were more like you, the war would be over much sooner!
You women, you mothers, do more than your share, when you give your sons to your country!
But... but I haven't got a son...
I haven't... anybody.
It'll be all over in three months, the spirit our boys are showing!
Well what about the women?
They're doing their bit, ain't they?
And what about the nurses?
-And the ambulance drivers too!
And what about us war mothers?
-What about us?
My son's at the front, what a fine boy he is!
My boy is out there too!
Any particular regiment you're looking for?
The Canadian Black Watch.
-I'll take it!
Give me this one, it has a better sparkle!
I'll take a flag too!
You're quite right, Mrs Twymley!
Our troops' progress is quite progressive!
It's more than that Mrs Mickelham, it's miraculous and astonishing!
Look, here's where we was last May, and now they've gone right up past 'Wypers'!
The French is 'Yee-pris'!
The Belgian is 'Wypers'!
But we won't argue!
My son Percy writes me, the fuss he's making is blooming lively for the Huns!
Yes, and my son Alfie informs me, that the Royal Horse Artillery ain't asleep, neither!
We ought to be in Berlin by Christmas!
-Oh, before Christmas, if my son's regiment, the Black Watch, has anything to do with it!
Black Watch!
There it goes again!
Before you moved into our neighbourhood, Mrs Dowey, we was hardly aware the kilties were fighting in this war!
But we'll take your word for it!
I used to be a lily on the Sunday!
Now I'm nothing but a little faded flower!
Tired!
-Me with...
Oh well, I'm thankful today's over!
I'd give something for a nice cup of tea!
-I'm sure I would too!
How about a dish with me, ladies?
-I've heard of worse ideas, Mrs Dowey!
What do you say, Mrs Twymley?
-Yes!
I always say, no more than my poor husband would too if he was alive, that there's nothing better about 5 o'clock, than a nice cup of tea!
Here all, here all, good wage in the East End!
Meat!
meat!
eggs!
meat!
Oh, here all!
-Black water, black fine water, 3/2!
Water, 3/2!
We can now get watercress I see!
Oh, it'd be lovely!
-Fine watercress!
The pinch, the punch, tuppence a bunch and all three pound then lady, how many?
Half a can's worth?
-Stop your chatting!
Are they fresh?
-Fresh lady, I got them this morning down Covent Garden market
There's that Haggerty woman!
Let's be a going before she smells the tea party!
She smells a mile off with that long nose of hers!
There'll be no getting rid of her then!
Hello, ladies!
-Hello.
-Hello!
Buying watercress I see
-Ain't she observant?
I've just had me fortune told by a weighing machine!
It says I'm going on a long, long, journey, it says.
You don't say so?
-That's the best of the news I've heard since the spring advancement!
-Come along, Mrs Dowey!
Watercresses, ladies?
-Eh, not today, thank you!
The idea!
You'd think she'd know her place!
Working in a fish shop!
-But she has a son at the front!
She may have a son at the front, just the same she always smells like a bloater!
I'd like to tell you what me son writes me from the war, ladies!
Won't that be nice?
-It would be better if you told us inside!
You know Mrs Dowey I ain't never set foot in your home, since you come to live in Friday street!
Oh what a horrible smell!
Oh it ain't me ladies, it's the apron!
The open air's the place for that!
-Oh well I'll hang it on the railings!
Make yourselves at home, ladies!
Shall I lay the table, Mrs Dowey?
-Yes, do!
You'll find the things over there!
-I'll fix the watercress!
Thank you.
You'll find a pot of raspberry jam there too!
Oh I love raspberry jam, and a thick slice of bread!
Sugar?
One's my ration.
Quite enough for anybody, these days!
My son writes me, they have more sugar in the army than they could eat!
My son Percy writes me quite a different story, and he's never told me a lie ever since I knowed him!
What does your son Kenneth write to you on the subject, Mrs Dowey?
Oh, my Kenneth... he doesn't concern himself with small things like that.
The Black Watch have their problems above sugar!
I say it is so, what my son Percy writes!
I say it may be so.
I suppose I ought to know.
Neither has a son a prisoner in Germany!
Being the only lady present that has that proud misfortune...
My son is fighting in France!
Mine wounded in two places!
Mine's in 'Saloneiki'!
Oh, you'll excuse me Mrs Haggerty, but the correct pronunciation of that, is Saloniki!
-I don't think so!
And I speak as one who has War Savings Certificates.
We all have 'em!
-It's a terrible war!
It is!
What I say is, the men is splendid, but I'm none so easy about the staff...
That's your weak point, Mrs Mickelham.
You may take it from me the staff's alright!
Very relieved I am to hear you say it!
I say that word is 'Salo-ne-iki'!
Let's change the subject.
Have you seen this week's fashions yet?
-No!
The gabardine with the accordion pleat is quite worn out!
Mercy!
I dare say so!
Lady Dolly Cannister was seen conversing across the railings in a dainty blue
She married Colonel The Honourable Chingford.
Suds, they called him at Eton.
Very likely, he will be sent to Salo-ne-iki too!
Wherever he's sent to, she'll have the same tremors as us!
She'll be just as keen to get them letters wrote with pencil, as you or me.
-Them pencil letters!
And as women in enemy land, get their pencil letters too...
And then... stop getting them, the same as ourselves...
Let's occasionally think of that!
-I ask you!
That's awful language Mrs Dowey!
-Oh, kindly excuse...
I swear to death, I'm not one of your pacifists!
Freely granted.
I've heard of females that having no menfolk in the war, it makes them say such things, I've heard of them!
But I don't mix with them.
-What should we have to say to the likes of them?
It's not their war!
They're to be pitied!
-The place for them, Mrs Dowey, is within doors with the blinds down!
That's the place for them!
I had a letter from my son Percy yesterday...
Alfie sent me his photo!
Letters from Salo-ne-iki is that common!
Kenneth writes to me every week!
Look at these!
All him.
Alfie has little time for writing, being a bombardier!
Do your letters begin, "Dear Mother"?
Generally
-Invariable
Every time!
Kenneth's begin "Dearest mother"!
A short man I should say, judging by yourself.
He's six foot two and a half!
A kiltie, did you tell me?
-Lord, ain't you heard that afore?
I thought all London knew that
-Most certainly.
He's in the famous black watch!
We can't all be kilties!
-That's very true!
Has your Kenneth got great hairy legs?
Tremendous!
Won't you read us some of his letters, Mrs Dowey?
They're very private to me, Mrs Haggerty I'd rather not.
I tell you sir some of these replacements are a disgrace to the regiment!
It's almost certain that Dowey's wound was self-inflicted!
That's a very serious charge to bring against any soldier!
-You know it's true
His record in the army hasn't been good, and from all I can learn it was worse in civilian life!
And he's too cagey to let us find him out!
Still there must be something within the man!
I've made up my mind that there's only one thing to try with him.
Orderly!
Send in Private Dowey!
-Yes sir!
Private Dowey!
Here, hold it.
Say you already think you're going to get that leave, do you?
Watch me!
Can you imagine the nerve of that fellow Dowey asking for seven days leave?
After what he's done?
He'll be lucky if he doesn't get seven years in jail!
That won't bother him, he's been there a couple of times before
I know a fellow in Canada told me all about him.
So how's the wound?
-Private Dowey!
As a wounded soldier you have applied for leave in London!
-Yes, sir.
You know of course that there has been some reason to believe your wound was self-inflicted!
And you know that if this could be proven, you not only would get no leave, but you'd be severely disciplined!
Well, in spite of this fact, and in spite of your record,
I am going to have faith in you and grant you this leave.
I know that in return you will prove yourself worthy of the regiment.
Thank you sir.
Lot of impression that'll have on him!
I'll bet you a fiver he doesn't even come back!
Seven days in Blighty!
You lucky swine!
Say, you might bring us a couple of blondes when you come back!
Yes, I might.
Don't hold your breath waiting for me to come back!
Hey!
Well, that goes right out...
You don't understand properly trench warfare.
Now, if I had a map...
That's the river 'Somm-ay'!
-If we had barrages here,
Pretty soon you'll be invalided.
Where's your supports, my lady?
What none of you seems to grasp is, this is artillery war!
And over there in Salo-ne-iki!
I thought we'd closed that subject days ago!
Oh Mrs Dowey!
You have a visitor!
-I wonder who it could be!
It's the Reverend
Mr Willings?
Oh!
-I'd say he's had his boots cleaned!
Won't you have some tea?
-No, I thank you friend.
I have news!
News?
-From the front?
My Alfie, sir?
-I'll tell you at once, that all is well.
My news is for Mrs Dowey.
News?
For me?
Your son, Mrs Dowey, is on leave, in London!
-Who?
Son!
You're... sure?
-Quite sure.
He has arrived!
He's... in London?
I have spoken to him!
It... it was quite a romance, ladies.
I was in the... church army choir, when suddenly my eyes, I'd had a cold, but suddenly, my eyes alighted upon... a Highlander!
A big man?
-Oh, a great brawny fellow
Name?
Dowey!
Then, I placed my hand on his shoulder as it might be, there.
No, it was the other shoulder.
Kenneth Dowey, I said, I know your mother!
What... did he say to that?
-Oh, he seemed incredulous!
In fact he seemed to think that I was... barmy!
Then I offered to bring him here!
Bring him... here?
I'd wonder he needed to be brought!
Oh, he had only just arrived and he was bewildered by the great city!
Is he coming?
Oh, he has come.
He is up there!
I told him that I thought I had better come and break the joyful news!
Kindly get them to go away!
Ladies, I think this happy occasion scarcely requires you!
I also am going instantly.
I'd thank none for their company if my Alfie was at the door!
A good son, Mrs Dowey, to have written to you so often!
There she is, Dowey my friend, waiting for you, with your letters in her hand!
Don't you recognise your loving son, Mrs?
I'm pleased I wrote so often.
Let's see those!
Nothing but blank paper!
Is this your writing in pencil on the envelope?
Where'd you get em?
I'm a charwoman.
I picked the envelopes out a wastepaper basket, and changed the addresses.
Don't you burn them letters, Mister!
-They're not real letters!
They're all I have
I thought you had a son!
I never had a son, nor a husband... nor anything.
I just call myself Mrs, to give me a standing.
Well!
You're past my seeing-through!
What made you do it?
It was everybody's war, except mine.
I wanted it to be my war, too.
You'll need to be plainer.
Yet I'm blamed if I care to listen to you, you lying old trickster!
-You're not going, already!
Yes.
I just came to give you an ugly piece of my mind!
But you haven't given it to me yet!
-You have a cheek!
You wouldn't drink some tea?
-Me?
I tell you I came here for the one purpose of blazing away at you!
You could drink some tea while you were blazing away!
Now then out with it!
Sit down!
Go on, you old sinner!
It's true that my name is Dowey!
-Enough to make me change mine!
I've been charring and charring as far back as I can mind!
I've been in London these 20 years!
Well, skip your early days!
-And then...
When I was old, the war broke out.
How could that affect you?
-That's it mister!
It didn't affect me!
It affected everybody but me!
The neighbours looked down on me.
Even the poster on the wall, of the mother saying, "Go, my boy!", leered at me...
Sometimes I cried to myself in the dark!
You wouldn't have a cup of tea?
-No!
Sudden-like, the idea came to me, to pretend I had a son!
Why you old criminal!
What in the name of Old Nick, made you choose me out of the whole British Army?
Maybe... it was because I liked you the best!
Now, now, woman!
One day, I read in the newspaper, look what it says here!
In which he was assisted, by Private K. Dowey, 42nd Highlanders, Black Watch.
Well...
I expect that's the only time I was ever in the papers!
I didn't choose you for that alone.
I read a history of the Black Watch first, to make sure it was the best regiment in the world.
Anybody could have told you that!
I like the Scotch voice on you, woman!
Frozen water runs by where I was born.
Maybe you'd teach me to speak, Mister?
How did you guess the K in my name stood for Kenneth?
-Does it?
An angel must have whispered it to me, in my sleep!
Well, that's the only angel in this whole black business!
You didn't thought I would turn up!
Well did you?
I was beginning to weary for a sight of ye...
Kenneth...
What word was that?
I hope you're pleased with me now you see me!
-I'm very pleased!
Do your folk live in England?
-Canada.
Both living?
-Aye.
Is your mother terrible proud of ye?
-Naturally.
Where did you come to stay in London?
I don't see that that's any affair of yours!
So... she's in London!
Who?
-Your young lady!
Are you jealous?
-No
You needn't be.
She's a young thing.
Wouldn't surprise me.
A beauty no doubt.
You may be sure.
She's a titled person.
She's equally popular as maid, wife, and munition worker
Tell me more about her, man.
She sends me a lot of things, especially cake!
And a 'Worcester's Waisted' with a loving message on the... enclosed card!
You'll try one of my cakes!
Not for me.
They're all my own making!
-No, I thank you.
That's exactly the kind of cakes Her Ladyship sends me!
Was the waistcoat right?
I hope the Black Watch colours pleased you...
What?
Was it you
I daren't give you my own name, you see, and I was always reading hers in the papers
Woman... is there no getting rid of you?
Are you angry?
Give me some tea!
What?
Don't be thinking Mrs for one minute that you have got me!
No, no!
I have an appointment.
Tonight.
How long is your leave, Kenneth?
Oh, couple of weeks.
Kenneth, this is a queer first meeting!
It is woman.
Oh, it is!
And it's also a last meeting!
Yes.
Yes
What was your trade?
-Me?
I was a farmer.
A farmer?
Planting and growing things...
You're a proper man to look at!
-I'm generally admired.
She's an enviable woman...
Who?
-Your mother!
Well, that was just protecting myself from you.
I have neither father, nor mother, nor wife, nor grandmother.
Is that true?
-Gospel!
Heaven be praised!
-See that?
None of that!
I was a fool to tell you but don't think you can take advantage of it!
Pass the cake.
Kenneth?
I dare say, it's true we'll never meet again, but, if we do, well, I wonder where it'll be?
God, if I ever get to Berlin I believe I'll find you there waiting for me!
With a cup of tea for you, in my hand!
Aye, and very good tea too!
We could come back by Paris
All the ladies like to go to Paris!
Oh Kenneth, I wish just once before I die,
I could be fitted for a Paris gown, with a dreamy corsage!
You're all alike, old woman.
We have a song about it!
Mrs Gill is very ill and nothing can improve her, but to see the Tuileries and waddle through the Louvre!
Oh Kenneth you must learn me that!
Mrs Dowey's very ill, nothing can improve her...
-Stop!
But dressed up in a Paris gown and waddle through the Louvre!
Hairy legs!
Mind your manners!
Well...
I must be gone.
Thank you for the tea!
Where are you living?
No place just this minute, but I have an idea!
I'll tell you this.
London's no place to be in without a friend, or... a connection!
That's my quandary too Kenneth!
I feel sorry for you, you poor old lady.
But I see no way out for either of us!
Do you mean that?
Are you at it again?
Kenneth, I've heard, that the one thing a man on leave longs for, more than anything else, is a bed with sheets, and a bath!
You never heard anything truer!
Go into that pantry Kenneth Dowey, and lift the dresser top, and tell me what you see!
It's a kind of a bath!
-You could do yourself there pretty!
Me?
How?
-Half at a time!
There's a woman through the wall, who'd very gladly give me a shakedown until your leave is up!
Oh, is there?
Kenneth, look!
My word!
That's the dodge we need in the trenches!
That's your bed now!
-Mine?
Let's see how it works!
You queer old duck!
Would you think it routine to want to be burdened, burdened by a lump like me!
I've been a kickabout all my life, and I'm no great shakes at the war either!
How can you say that, and you with a wound, child?
Suppose that makes me a hero?
-Yes, it does!
How many have you killed?
Just two for certain.
There was no glory in it.
It was just cause they wanted my shirt.
Oh Kenneth.
You're just a wonderful soldier.
You're easily pleased.
Listen old lady, if you really want me I'll stay.
Mind you, I don't accept you as a relation.
For your own personal glory you can go on pretending to the neighbours!
The best I can say for you is you're on probation!
I'm a cautious character, I'm waiting to see how you turn out!
-Yes, Kenneth
Now, I think that's that.
I have an appointment later.
You'll be sure and come back?
Yes.
Here's my gift and pledge
-Oh, Kenneth... don't liquor up too freely!
You're the first to care whether I do or not!
I promise.
I'm damned looking forward to being waked up in the morning by you saying "Get up, you lazy swine!"
I kind of... envied men that had womenfolk with the right to say that!
What is it Kenneth?
The theatre!
It would be showier if I took a lady!
Tell me this instant, what do you mean?
Nope.
Couldn't be done.
Don't keep me on the jump!
Was it... me you were thinking of?
For the moment, but you had no style.
-Not in this!
But you should see me in my merino
It laces up the back and it's the very latest...
That's none so bad!
be a bit of chiffon for the neck,
It's not bombs, nor Kaisers, nor Tipperary that men in the trenches think about!
Chiffon!
I swear I have, and I have a bangle!
and a muff, and gloves!
A'ight, A'ight.
You think you could give your face less of a homey look?
I'm sure I could!
Alright, then you can have a try!
But mind you!
I promise nothing, it all will depend upon the effects.
Oh Mrs Dowey's very ill, and nothing can improve her,
But to see the Tuileries and waddle through the Louvre!
Oh Mrs Dowey's very ill and nothing can improve her!
But dressed up in a Paris gown...
-And waddle through the Louvre!
Hey!
Let's see em!
Name?
-Lilac!
C'mon!
Who's that?
She out with the bag lady?
Alright!
This way, Kenneth!
Good day to you, Mrs Dowey!
-Good day to you, Mrs Upson!
Amelia!
Amelia!
Ain't he a whopper!
He'd fix the door alright!
Gorgeous!
What do we do between now and the theatre?
Well, we could go to the zoo!
Perhaps that's too far.
We could go to Lyons' restaurant first, and eat!
Or we could go to the waxworks!
But perhaps it would be better, to go first to Sam Isaacs' Fish and Chip Emporium, and eat...
Or we could go to the skating rink, and if you don't like that, we could go somewhere and... eat.
Alright!
The 'eats' have it!
And then after the theatre, if you like we could go on to...
Whoops, hold your horses old lady!
The YMCA told me to beware of conniving females!
You're on probation!
Very well, Kenneth, just as you say.
I. M. Shelley and his Union Jack monsters, songsters!
Every soldier over there, every airship in the air, shows a lonely, some boy there...
Where are your bags?
One song...
Kenneth, this is the shilling side!
The gallery only costs sixpence!
Let's forget that you're Scotch.
We're going in the fifth!
Violets!
Sweet violets!
Here you are ladies, sweet-scented violets!
Only threepence a bunch!
Oh, don't they smell lovely?
I love violets!
Don't you Kenneth?
-I hope we haven't missed the acrobats!
Smell them lady.
Ain't they gorgeous?
And only threepence a bunch!
They'd go well with my marino, don't you think?
And only threepence a bunch!
Oh, in your dear, braw, bunnet...
There you are, they're all hot!
All hot and meaty!
Who says a hot potato?
Only a penny!
-Darn!
Why do I have to make it...
You know, I think I had mine last time I saw them...
It was a good show
-The acrobats!
Who's with that tall man in his...
Mother, you are the greatest of all mothers...
Everything is over now...
Finished!
A wonderful work of art, sir!
So, Lady.
We haven't done half the things you wanted to do yet!
Oh, but Kenneth, it's getting so late!
Well, none of that now!
-We can go to some more tomorrow!
Huh?
Not on your life?
We're going to the skating rink!
Oh, Kenneth, really, I have forgotten how to skate!
-You suggested it!
I guess you're getting tired already!
-Indeed I'm not, Kenneth Dowey
Well, alright, you really don't want to skate!
I'd say we've got all evening, if...
Hey!
Where you going?
-To see that you get safe in bed, Kenneth!
Oh no you don't.
I...
-Oh, don't talk nonsense!
I've waited too long to tuck my boy in bed, you needn't think I'm going to give up the chance now!
Get in there and undress yourself!
Hurry up, now!
Getting your bed ready!
Throw out your things, as you take them off...
I'll hang them up!
This reminds me of old times...
What old times?
The times... when I used to pretend
I was putting my son Kenneth to bed.
Old lady, you're daft!
-Daft?
Many's the time I spanked him for saying less than that!
Shut your eyes!
Turn around!
Now I'm in bed!
Oh!
What bonny big feet you have, Kenneth!
Sleep well!
-I will!
Hey!
Where are you going with my boots!
I'm going to clean them!
-Oh no you don't!
You bring them right back here!
Kenneth Dowey, I have a perfect right to clean my son's boots!
You come right back here I tell you!
-Good night dear Kenneth!
Here's luck, old gal!
Between you and me Amelia, the spoiling of her!
Have you seen her new Astrakhan jacket?
He bought it for her!
-No!
-Yes!
It has Venus sleeves, and a muff to match!
Look, here comes that submarine!
Hello Ladies!
-Hello!
Oh, ello
-I suppose you ladies, working like you do inside offices, ain't got the same opportunity of observing things like I have!
What things?
-Things that happen on Friday St and inside places of purchase!
Meaning just what, Mrs Haggerty?
If it concerns us personal...
-As mothers, who have sons in the service, it touches us all!
Then we have a right to know, Mrs Haggerty!
I haven't quite made up my mind!
Mrs Haggerty, you've been a-drinking!
-No I ain't, I swear!
Not that I ain't thirsty!
Here they come!
Look at her!
She struts about with him as though the two of them made a procession
Oh look Kenneth!
We have friends here!
Well you told us to meet here, didn't you?
To see the new coat he bought you!
And have a drink or two?
Alright!
What will you have to drink, ladies?
-Mine's gin!
Mine's beer, half and half!
-I'll have a small pot!
What are you going to have, Kenneth?
-Scotch!
I'll take the same.
The best you have!
And where away tonight, Mrs Dowey?
-Well I really don't know...
We've been most every place!
I suppose you'll be telling us next you're going to dine at the Imperial!
Only swells eat at the Imperial!
Kenneth wants to take me there!
But I've done my best to discourage the idea...
Then we're going to Buckingham Palace, and dine with the King and Queen!
Here's to you ladies!
Your health!
-Looking at you!
It must be time you were thinking of going back to the trenches, eh Mr...
What an indelicate question!
-Kenneth has several more days leave yet!
I was just sort of wondering if he was going back!
-Well I never!
Mrs Haggerty, I have to ask you to explain that last remark!
We all ask you!
-Yes, that's what I asked myself, when I saw him in a shop looking at civilian clothes!
Well!
Your eyesight must be getting bad!
-Mrs Haggerty!
You'll apologise for them traitor's words!
-Hold on, old lady!
Did you hear what she said, Kenneth?
-Yes, I heard what she said.
But she was mistaken!
Weren't you, Mrs Haggerty?
-I ain't one to admit...
You'll admit you was wrong!
-Come, come, ladies, stop it!
Or I'll have to kiss the whole lot of you!
-Ha ha, vain sod, you!
You kilties is the word!
-Well, here's health!
Finish your drink and I'll get you something special!
I tell you they do!
No.
No sir!
A Scotchman don't wear pants under his kilt!
Oh, what do they do on a windy day?
-I don't know what they do!
I know its army regulations!
I'll bet you a bob he don't!
-I'll bet you a bob he does!
I'll prove it.
Come along!
-Righto!
You're right!
Now, now matey don't get excited.
No offense meant!
What's the big idea?
-Wait a minute now...
-You want to give us a go?
It's your Kenneth!
There, there!
Kenneth?
I don't see him!
Kick him Kenneth!
Kick him!
Go on!
Bash him!
Give him a punch in the gob!
Where do you think you're going?
That's my business!
Cause he started it!
-Oh you did, did you?
Well I've a good mind to shove you in the lockup!
-Better than being in the army
What's that?
You're a disgrace to this uniform!
Uniform?
You can have the uniform!
-What?
You heard me, I'm sick of it!
You can take it back any time you want!
You better come along with me!
Hey what's the idea?
It's a terrible war!
Oh wait a minute Kenneth, you need to cool yourself off a bit!
You're not hurt are you?
-No, but I wish I'd broken his neck!
Kenneth!
You're not...
You're not angry with me, are you?
No, not with you, with those MPs!
-I know!
You didn't mean those other things you said, did you?
What other things?
-Why about...
About the... the bonny uniform...
Didn't I?
You bet I did!
I'm sick of the uniform, and the mud in the trenches, and the fighting!
And everything about it!
-No, you don't mean it Kenny!
Don't I?
You bet I mean it!
I'm fed up with it!
I have had enough of the whole rotten business!
Kenny!
What's the matter?
To hear you talk like that...
-What?
What's this old lady?
-You're a kiltie, Kenny!
I was so proud of you.
So proud of my boy!
Oh, so that's it is it?
I told you I was no great shakes at the war, didn't I?
My boy... in his uniform...
I was so proud of him.
Come come, it can't mean that much to you!
Oh, it means everything to me Kenny!
Didn't I pick you out to be my boy, because I read how fine, brave you were!
Here, here I was only fooling!
I didn't mean it!
Did you hear what I said?
I didn't mean it!
I'm thinking, maybe Mrs Haggerty was right, about you buying the civilian clothes!
Here, you don't believe that!
Why, what would I be wanting with civilian clothes anyway?
Run away with?
-Oh, Kenny!
Here, here.
If that's all that's worrying you forget it.
You got to act better than this, you know!
You're still on probation!
You're a fine one, spoiling our whole evening!
Just when we're going out to have a lot of fun!
Just when we're going out to the Imperial, too!
Don't you want to go to the Imperial?
Oh come on.
We'll... we'll have...
we'll have champagne!
You like that!
Won't you?
And after that we'll... we'll keep our appointment with the King and Queen!
Oh, now, let's sing!
Mrs Dowey's very ill, and nothing can improve her... c'mon, sing!
But dressed up in a Paris gown, to waddle through the Louvre!
C'mon!
It's all in French!
Eh...
Garcon, dis donc...
Par... parlez-vous Francais, oui?
-Yes, sir!
OK
Ehh, avez-vous pour le...
Madame and eh... me, ehh, n'est-ce pas?
la?
Soup?
-Soup.
Soup.
-You couldn't have said a thing like that unless you meant it!
Two soups.
And, ehh, champagne!
-Champagne with soup, sir?
Yes!
-What kind?
The best
-Very good, sir.
How does that suit Your Ladyship?
Kenneth, I heard you saying...
-Eh?
No, no, no
You're going to have more than that to eat.
There's, um...
Poulet.
That's the French for chicken.
Poulet.
Chicken.
Funny, isn't it?
Where's the champagne?
-Uh, coming, sir.
Listen to the music
Doesn't that make you want to sing?
I'm sure it's very nice.
Very nice?
Well, I should hope so.
This is the Imperial.
Better pop!
Well, old lady... here's to you!
You could give me one smile!
Drink the champagne!
Here.
Take a sip of mine.
We'll make a loving couple.
Kenneth, how could you say...?
-Take it!
But my Kenneth...
-All of it!
Talk like that?
-All of it!
All of it!
I told you I wouldn't want to... hurt you.
But when you talk like that about a soldier, you hurt me terrible, Kenneth.
The uniform.
Oh, I love you in it.
It means so much to me, and people like me.
It means that men like you are going to war, to keep the war from coming to us!
If it means that much to you, I'm sure I didn't mean it!
I do believe you are fooling me all the time!
Put here.
Do you like the smell of that?
Don't it make your mouth water?
That's not beer you're drinking.
I'll bet you wish you were having your fish and chips.
Oh Kenneth, look how it bubbles!
It sparkles like diamonds!
You uh... care to waltz, with a soldier?
I could die waltzing with a soldier!
Let me escort you, Mrs Dowey!
Oh Kenny!
I'm flying!
I'm flying!
- haha, no...
Don't forget to wake me up, Kenneth
So that I can tuck you in bed.
How are you, Mrs Haggerty?
Horrible.
Me head's opening and shutting
I haven't had so much in since the Coronation!
Hello, Mrs Dowey!
-Good morning, ladies!
Did your Kenneth get hurt last night?
-Hurt?
Him?
No, he knocked them all over!
And then we got hungry, so we went to the Imperial.
The imperial?
-And we had a sit-down supper!
I swear we had Champagney wine!
Champagney wine!
And to anyone who doubts my word, there's the cork!
I suppose you'll be telling us that you're going for another taxi ride this morning!
I don't think that's for us!
Whom might you be waiting for, sir?
I'm waiting for an idle soldier who's going back to the front!
He told me to whistle for him a half hour!
Time's almost up now!
Kenneth!
Where are you going?
Back.
But I thought you had more leave.
You told me...
-I just made all that up.
I didn't want you to be thinking about it.
Is it time?
No, no.
The taxi driver's going to whistle for me.
All is ended.
Now then.
The last time we talked together, you promised to be gay.
We were going to help one another!
Yes, Kenneth
It's bad for me
But it's worse for you.
The men have medals to win, you see
-The women have their medals, too.
Come here.
No!
I'll come to you.
Have you noticed you've never called me son?
-Have I noticed it?
You see, I was feared, Kenneth
You said I was on probation.
So you were.
Well...
Probation's ended.
I'm not much to have, but if you really want me you can have me.
Oh Kenneth, will I do?
Woman, don't be so forward!
You must wait till I have proposed!
-Proposed?
For a mother?
-And why not?
Mrs Dowey, you sweet thing!
Have I your permission to ask the most important question... that a neglected orphan could ask of an old lady?
None of your sauce, Kenneth!
For a long time Mrs Dowey, you cannot have been unaware of my sonnish feelings for you!
Wait till I get my mop to you!
And if you're not willing to be my mother, I swear I shall ask no other!
Was I a well-behaved infant, mother?
-Not you, sonny!
You were a rampaging rogue!
Was I slow in learning to walk?
The quickest in our street!
Is that... the whistle?
No.
See here!
You've taken me over, you have in a manner of speaking joined the kilties!
I like to think that, Kenneth.
Then you must be brave so that the ghost piper will be proud of you!
Attention!
That's the style!
Now listen!
I've turned in your name as being my next of kin.
And your allowance will be coming to you weekly in the usual way.
But... isn't that... wicked, Kenneth?
No, no, old lady.
You're as much responsible as any mother ever was for sending a man to war!
and maybe more so than you know!
And besides you have a right to be safeguarded, in case anything happens!
Kenneth!
-Attention!
I'll be coming back, all covered in mud and medals!
And be sure you have that cup of tea waiting for me!
Won't it be a lot of fun writing to one another?
Real letters this time!
-Yes Kenny!
I think it'd be a good plan if you began the first letter as soon as I'd gone!
I will.
I hope Lady Dolly goes on sending me cake!
You may be sure.
I've got something for you.
I'll bet you were a pretty thing when you were young!
-Away with ye!
The scarf sets you off well!
Blue was always my colour!
Old lady.
Hey, the mail!
-Oh, the mail!
Is there anything for me?
Your mail, George
-Nothing for you, Scotty.
Parcel for Dowie.
Is it one of Her Ladyship's cakes?
Must be something for me
-Two for you...
One for you
Nothing for me?
-Come on boys
Say, how would a guy like me go about to learn to be a farmer?
What's the matter?
You're not thinking of turning honest, are you?
What were you thinking of?
Oh nothing
It wouldn't be any use anyhow
I know what he's thinking about.
He's thinking of her!
Was it nice to see her on leave?
Yes
-Is she pretty?
To me, yes
-Do you love her?
Who wouldn't love a woman, what makes a cake like that?
Well, what about it?
Well, what about cutting the cake?
Sorry to break up the party, boys
-Why, what's up?
Jerry's got a couple of new machine guns, here below this place.
Take Dowie, he's good at it!
-How about it, Dowie?
Alright with me.
-Alright, you, you, you and you.
C'mon!
I'll mind the cake for you Dowie!
I'm going to put it where the rats won't get it!
No rats are going to eat that cake!
No, and listen you little worm, if you touch that cake before i get back I'll split you on this bayonet!
But if you don't come back, can I have it?
I love violets.
Don't you, Kenneth?
Blue was always my colour!
Oh Kenny, I'm flying!
I'm...
Good morning, ladies.
So long, ladies!
Oh, so long
-So long!
This is not an animated cartoon.
This is a revolution in the history of cinema.
Ten years of work went into its making.
The film you are about to see was adapted by Roger Richebé
from a scenario by lréne Starevitch
Directed and animated by Ladislas and lréne Starevitch dialogue by Jean Nohain and Antoinette Nordmann
Music composed by Vincent Scotto.
The voices
Men, women, children, old folks, the tale I will have the honour and pleasure to tell you is the oldest and most beautiful story known to us animals.
On the evening, cows tell it to their little calves in the byres, rabbits tell it in their clearings, squirrels in their trees... wild beasts in their wilderness.
The tale of the fox.
I will pleased to leaf through it for you.
Here we got some of the heroes of our story.
Master Raven, which Monsieur de la Fontaine brought to our attention.
The lordlings of the poultry yard,
Sir Cock and his worthy wife, Lady Hen.
Poor fearful little hare, always hunted, heart and ears twitching.
Renault and Cerberus, the two farmyard's sergeant majors.
The wolf, his wife and their kid.
We wouldn't want to meet them in the woods at night.
Maitre Badger, best barrister at the beastly bar, he'll plead for our true hero.
Look, that's him, Reynard the Fox, ever crafty, ever on the make proliferating daily, his wiles were the despair of all his fellow animals.
Say fox, and all you see is a flash of tail.
That morning, as every morning, actually
Sir Reynard was strolling in the country, looking for the victim of the day.
Sentimental?
This doesn't seem likely.
Are the animals becoming distrustful?
Better check on that right away.
Not far away was a beautiful black bird.
And the fox, nicer and nicer...
Good morning, Master Raven, how cute, and you seem to me
so elegant, so chic and black suits you so well, so well...
Trust me, if your song matches your plumage... you are the phoenix of these woods.
Ashamed, the raven belatedly swore never to be taken in again.
But Reynard's jokes were sometimes not so harmless.
One new year's eve, as the wolf was warming up by the fire...
Lazybones!
that's a shame.
You sure could get some fish for supper.
Go out in this cold?
No fear!
I'll warm you up if you're cold.
Don't hit me!
I want some fish, understand?
Ok, ok.
So unwillingly tearing himself away from the fire,
He went out into the snow.
Led by a delicious smell, he soon met the fox who was engaged in some mysterious task.
The fox was in fact busy grilling fish.
The wolf came closer and watched enviously.
Not only was the fox grilling fish but he was eating them.
The wolf's mouth watered but he dared not beg the fox for charity.
However, one might not be missed.
Never mind that.
I've found a miraculous way, you'll get as many fish as you want.
I'll tell you alone, keep it secret.
It's called moonfishing.
It's simple.
You make a hole in the ice like that.
Then you stick your tail in it, like this.
Like that, without a hook?
Then you just wait until the fish will bite...
That's the way.
Good-bye now.
Wolf!
Wolf!
In this one-sided battle, the poor wolf lost his tail.
Coming back home after this memorable hiding, he still found that the fox had other surprises for him.
To this great fortress... came all the fox's victims to lodge their complaints.
I'm here to reclaim my cheese, with accrued interest.
And you?
So am I, but don't tell it.
All were here to seek justice from the king of the beasts...
His Majesty the Lion.
The queen, charming, coquettish and greedy was only interested in the Ortolan brochettes.
Speak fearlessly, Sir Wolf.
Here is my complaint, Sire.
The fox again?
Read it clerk.
Read it.
"Sire, I demand compensation
"for a cold,
"nervous breakdown and stolen hams."
The fox is up to his tricks again.
Silence in court!
I know the truth about the fox.
This wolf is an abominable liar.
Believe me, Sire, Reynard is not what they claim.
Reynard lives quietly on the outskirts of town in a delightful old castle.
He lives with his wife, three children and a new born cub only weeks old.
This baby is a sunshine in the house and when he shows off, the whole family is overwhelmed with joy.
So touching a picture cannot leave you unmoved, Sir.
My cousin's heart is as pure as the mother's milk.
The true story is as follow, Sir.
On a cold winter night, my cousin Reynard saw a peasant who'd been fishing, dragging his heavy catch.
Then, Reynard had a brilliant idea.
And there, in the moonlight, he played dead.
What's this, a dead fox?
I'll make a bedspread for grandma, or pants for grandpa.
So the trip began, the barrow was full of fish in front of this treasure, Reynard remembered his kids... his beloved kids, so fond of trout, salmon, gudgeon.
So, as in an old tale...
He strewed fish on the road.
what a feast for the family!
But the wolf was prowling, the fierce, famished, lazy wolf... who swallowed until he was almost bursting.
This is the truth, Sire, and you will give punishment to all those... who complain unfairly.
He's witty, Sire.
But what will he say about Reynard's assault on the hare, witnessed by myself?
In the royal chapel, choir bunnies innocently sing their praises then, craftily disguised as a monk...
But for me, the hare would have become a meal.
You persist in your charges?
Yes he grabbed me here, Sire.
Yes here, I still bear the wound.
A base lie, Sire.
My cousin Reynard had come to atone for a few venial sins... when he saw that ungodly, sacrilegious hare crawling about on the altar.
My cousin to blame?
what a farce.
The hare was drunk on communion wine.
Heavens do you know what you have done?
Stop, I say!
Stop this shameful behaviour.
That's too much.
The hare stuck out his tongue, and that was just too much.
Hateful hare or righteous Reynard, tell me, which is the sinner?
What do you have to say?
Enough, I say of these disputes.
The decision I have come to shall be irrevocable!
Take note clerk.
"We, Lion, king of the beasts, decree: so that peace may reign,
"our subjects are forbidden to eat each other.
"Only vegetables, dairy produce
"and fruit...
"Are permissible.
"From this day,
"the greatest love must reign in the earth."
Love...
love.
You know how much I love you, miaow, miaow I won't go away, miaow, miaow
As you known you own my heart
Give me yours
Tonight ln the moonlight, with ecstasy
Miaow, miaow I want to say
You're my only love
Honey I'm coming to your house
Don't leave me alone
Open your arms
At this time of night
Everyone is home, sleeping
And, ln the moonlight, not a cat stirs
You know how much I love you miaow, miaow I won't go away, miaow, miaow
As you known
You own my heart Give me yours
Tonight, in the moonlight
With ecstasy, miaow, miaow I want to say
You're my only love
So that peace may reign
Our subjects are forbidden to eat each other
Only vegetables, dairy produce and fruit are permissible
Love must reign in the land
Offenders will be hanged
Only the king shall be entitled
To a little fresh meat on Thursdays and Sundays
Thanks to His Majesty, daddy and mummy and me won't be eaten anymore.
No more meat?
Me, a vegetarian?
Well, I'll try.
Oh, Wolf, I am no longer of this world.
That's over. I am in heaven.
Friend, why should we have to remember our old fights?
It's so beautiful, here.
What a pity you couldn't come with me.
On fleecy clouds in starry skies I see my ancestors float by.
Angel rabbits fly like birds
Joy reigns alone
All is feasting and festivity
Festoons of sausage Matchless delicacies
Here, death is not sad
Transformation comes to everything
You may drink your fill Do you want wine, or milk?
Here are the little cups
And the winged casks
Just let the nectar flow into your mouth
On earth you pay
You suffer and have to work hard
Come here take your share Of heavenly bliss
Look my friend, here's what awaits you
So beautiful. lf only I dared...
So, come here, quickly.
Wait!
I'll come down too.
In the bucket?
Reynard, I'm so grateful to you.
Reynard, will I see my ancestors?
Sure!
By the way, whenever you see mine, give them my regards.
What?
So long, stupid.
You, rascal!
- The devil!
- No a fox!
Help, help!
Up here, I'm in the well!
Come on, Mathieu, the wolf is in the well.
You rascal!
Revenge...
Why?
Sire... the fox, the fox...
Look!
The court is shocked by this sight.
Come here and explain.
Since your royal decree, I have lived happily with my good wife and chickens.
But one day... beware!
Who goes there?
So that peace may reign, our subjects are forbidden to eat each other...
Ware fox, ware fox!
This decree is so stirring, isn't it?
Love... it's true enough.
Damned lion!
You're a very cute hen.
I'm not what you think.
No, we are not what you think.
Come and join the dance.
Oh, dear Reynard...
Stop thief!
Now I am widowed...
She loved to dance.
It has been her ruin.
The cock is lying, Sire.
What he says is all cockadoodle.
The cock himself killed his wife to implicate my cousin.
Jealous of the amorous activities of his wife, well known locally as a shameless cock teaser.
That's enough.
The law is the law.
I intend to see my decree enforced.
Captain Bear...
Bring back the fox, dead or alive.
You known where is his castle at Malpertuis.
Go and bring him back.
Daddy!
mummy!
The bear is coming, he doesn't look pleased, and he's coming here.
Quick, we'll try plan A.
Oh, I suffer so much!
Bear, what do you want?
Read this.
Lovely honey, isn't it?
There is no need to drool.
I can see you love honey, I can show you a mine of honey this deep,
As deep as that?
Come quickly, I'll show you.
Come closer, that's here.
Here, in this hole?
Yes you'll see, it's wonderful, it's full right to the bottom.
I've to stick my snout down there?
is there really honey in there?
Yes, but you'll have to stick your snout right in to reach it.
Right in, all the way.
Now you can reap your reward.
Come, hurry, there's a bear here!
Come on, he's not far away.
Come closer, hit him bad.
Mr Greedy thought there was honey in there.
You may be a lion, still you eat like a pig, my dear.
I should advise a little moderation.
I've had a beating, Sire.
I'm just a poor, bruised and battered bear, Sire.
In beastly gods name, what's this mess?
The treacherous Reynard set a bear-trap for me, Sire.
A whole gang of peasants set upon me and talked of selling my skin.
It is horrible, but now that it is damaged, they let me go.
Ah, bloody honey!
Don't toy with my heart
You know how much I love you miaow, miaow I won't go away, miaow, miaow
Enough!
No more serenades!
By the way, come here, you!
Me?
I got a mission for you.
Go to Malpertuis and bring back Reynard, cost what it may.
Another cop, this time, it's the cat.
Quick, let's try plan B.
And you, Mouse, try to turn on the charm.
I know where there are swarms of mice.
That'll keep you fed for weeks.
It's called Mouseland.
Mouseland, Mouseland, Mouseland
Here it is, just say I sent you along.
And have fun.
Thank you, Sire Reynard.
Don't mention it, cuty pussy.
The fox, Sire, just look what he did to me.
Come here.
I fought like a lion and he caught me like a rat.
No one will be able to catch him, he is so treacherous...
Enough, everyone is laughing at me.
Send for the badger right now, I've got to talk with him.
Maitre Badger, you speak so well.
I want to give you a mission on which your life depends.
I want to see your cousin Reynard here at court, where signal punishment awaits him.
You alone seem cunning enough to persuade him to come.
If by tomorrow you have not succeeded, you will be punished in his stead.
I shall try, Sire.
The lion is in great good mood, I assure you, you have nothing to fear.
I'm not all sure of the king's good intentions towards me.
I will answer for him with my life, believe me.
You sure cannot imagine the reception that awaits you.
I'll sleep on it and I'll think about it.
That night, the fox had a remarkable nightmare.
So, male and female, the great day has now dawned
To settle these disruptive disputes, the king has decided on single combat between Sire Reynard, squire of Malpertuis and his enemy the wolf.
Captain Bear, that noted master of single combat, will see fair play.
The wolf has entered the list
A stir of excitement announces the fox's arrival.
Doffing his cape,
Reynard reveals a dazzling suit of armour.
He bows.
What an eye-catching figure.
Fierce and alert, the wolf looks at him askance.
The king wears the modest uniform of a Corporal of the guard.
The queen looks charming in brocaded satin, delightfully trimmed with fresh ermine.
The fox has dealt the first telling blow, but his adversary regains his feet.
The battle, listeners, is now waxing fast and furious.
Excuse me, but I can't really see.
The wolf has grabbed the fox tail, he's raining axe blows on him.
Captain Bear is firmly in control.
Another right from the wolf.
But his axe has broken and hit Captain Bear in the belly.
The battle, nevertheless, goes on, with the wolf belabouring the fox.
The fox has his second wind.
And the wolf is down.
The fox hammers the wolf.
The wolf grabs and throws the fox, the fox is finished.
Now Reynard, you are mine.
It's all over, I'm going to die in your arms.
So, as one might have predicted, the result is a victory for... ln a very good mood, Reynard decided to go see the king.
Reynard shall be well and truly hanged
A fine knot for you.
"By order of the king, Reynard is condemned
"to suffer the ignominy of public execution.
"As a malefactor unfit to live, may he find welcome in hell.
"We shall hang him forthwith
"to end his misdeeds.
"By decree of his majesty..."
We are ready, gentlemen, let justice be done.
Come, Madame Raven, there'll be fresh fox meat for lunch.
Before I die, Sire, I wish to make a last confession.
Wait, executioner, let the fox speak.
What you do not know is that I hoped to make you the richest monarch on earth.
My heart is as pure as the heavens themselves.
I had amassed for you a wonderful treasure of gold, pearls, rubies, amethysts, emeralds, aquamarines.
One vast diamond was shaped like a leg of mutton.
Alas, it's too late, now.
Shall I explain?
Speak.
The treachery of this bear, this wolf, this cat.
Approach.
Who, me... really?
The bear is compromised, the cat is compromised...
Do you think the cat's guilty, though he's in love with the queen?
Speak without fear.
You and I, Sire, are victims of a conspiracy.
I hardly dare reveal the danger that threatens us.
The bear, your Captain of the guard, has a burning desire to rule in your place.
His dream is to kill you and your lovely queen.
And then to settle on your throne.
Being too cowardly to act himself, he enlisted the cat, who was to secure for your successor the symbol of your authority, the golden banded goose claw.
Stop don't listen to these dreadful things.
I have not yet told you the most dreadful, incredible thing, Sire.
Your assassin...
There he stands.
The bear persuaded him to carry out his evil designs.
Your death is to occurs in a matter of days, maybe only minutes.
The assassination has been planned in every details.
He's gone too far!
I'll fix him.
Stop, assassin!
Arrest them all!
Throw them into jail.
Yes, in jail!
All three of them.
Damn!
missed it.
So great a menagerie!
Deliver this box to the king with my compliments.
Yes, Sir.
Here is a cute little box in a cute little bag.
For your treasure, consult your daily paper
The fox was making a fool of me!
That's too much!
Furious, the lion decided to apprehend
Sir Reynard and prepared to lay siege to the castle of Malpertuis.
There are many of them this time, see?
Brave and loyal companions in arms, centuries of guilt confront you in this castle.
Guard this horn, Captain.
Only if it is sounded will hostilities cease.
Swear allegiance and constancy!
is everything ready?
Come here, Wolf...
Go, I charge you to summon the fox to surrender.
Reynard, you are lost.
By order of the king, surrender!
What's that, I can't hear you!
I, Wolf, summon you to surrender!
Otherwise, we attack!
I can't hear you, come a little closer.
The wolf, Your Majesty.
That's too much.
Proceed, Captain Bear.
In the name of king, Reynard, surrender!
Or the king will send his armies and you'll die.
Obey, that's better.
The king is powerful.
One moment, I'm coming.
At last, he's being reasonable.
Gently now.
Have a good trip, Captain!
The honour to lead the attack shall be yours, Sir Ass.
Forward!
Don't play the mule, Reynard, surrender!
No!
into the breach, my second army.
Do not forget that you all are pigs.
Come on my friend.
On the head!
Stupid bloody ass!
Listen carefully, I'm entrusting the horn to your care.
Do not use it.
Now soldiers, follow me for the final assault.
The retreat... I'm going back home.
To the rear!
Cock, you turncoat!
The cock betrayed us.
I recant my oath to fight.
The king realised that cunning, witty Reynard would make the best minister.
Oh, my Queen, the crown.
Reynard is more resourceful than you all, and I have concluded a pact of peace and friendship with him.
I wish you all to obey him in future.
Obey him as you would me, this is my will.
That's all folks.

What?
So long, stupid.
You, rascal-
- The devil-
- No a fox-
Help, help-
Up here, I'm in the well-
Come on, Mathieu, the wolf is in the well.
You rascal-
Revenge...
Why?
Sire... the fox, the fox...
Look-
The court is shocked by this sight.
Come here and explain.
Since your royal decree, I have lived happily with my good wife and chickens.
But one day... beware-
Who goes there?
So that peace may reign, our subjects are forbidden to eat each other...
Ware fox, ware fox-
This decree is so stirring, isn't it?
Love... it's true enough.
Damned lion-
You're a very cute hen.
I'm not what you think.
No, we are not what you think.
Come and join the dance.
Oh, dear Reynard...
Stop thief-
Now I am widowed...
She loved to dance.
It has been her ruin.
The cock is lying, Sire.
What he says is all cockadoodle.
The cock himself killed his wife to implicate my cousin.
Jealous of the amorous activities of his wife, well known locally as a shameless cock teaser.
That's enough.
The law is the law.

Captain Bear...
Bring back the fox, dead or alive.
You known where is his castle at Malpertuis.
Go and bring him back.
Daddy- mummy- The bear is coming, he doesn't look pleased, and he's coming here.
Quick, we'll try plan A.
Oh, I suffer so much- Bear, what do you want?
Read this.
Lovely honey, isn't it?
There is no need to drool.
I can see you love honey, I can show you a mine of honey this deep,
As deep as that?
Come quickly, I'll show you.
Come closer, that's here.
Here, in this hole?
Yes you'll see, it's wonderful, it's full right to the bottom.
I've to stick my snout down there?
Is there really honey in there?
Yes, but you'll have to stick your snout right in to reach it.
Right in, all the way.
Now you can reap your reward.
Come, hurry, there's a bear here-
Come on, he's not far away.
Come closer, hit him bad.
Mr Greedy thought there was honey in there.
You may be a lion, still you eat like a pig, my dear.
I should advise a little moderation.
I've had a beating, Sire.
I'm just a poor, bruised and battered bear, Sire.
In beastly gods name, what's this mess?
The treacherous Reynard set a bear-trap for me, Sire.
A whole gang of peasants set upon me and talked of selling my skin.
It is horrible, but now that it is damaged, they let me go.
Ah, bloody honey-
Don't toy with my heart
You know how much I love you miaow, miaow I won't go away, miaow, miaow
Enough-
No more serenades-
By the way, come here, you-
Me?
I got a mission for you.
Go to Malpertuis and bring back Reynard, cost what it may.
Another cop, this time, it's the cat.
Quick, let's try plan B.
And you, Mouse, try to turn on the charm.
I know where there are swarms of mice.
That'll keep you fed for weeks.
It's called Mouseland.
Mouseland, Mouseland, Mouseland
Here it is, just say I sent you along.
And have fun.
Thank you, Sire Reynard.
Don't mention it, cutie pussy.
The fox, Sire, just look what he did to me.
Come here.
I fought like a lion and he caught me like a rat.
No one will be able to catch him, he is so treacherous...
Enough, everyone is laughing at me.
Send for the badger right now, I've got to talk with him.
Maître Badger, you speak so well.
I want to give you a mission on which your life depends.
I want to see your cousin Reynard here at court, where signal punishment awaits him.
You alone seem cunning enough to persuade him to come.
If by tomorrow you have not succeeded, you will be punished in his stead.
I shall try, Sire.
The lion is in great good mood, I assure you, you have nothing to fear.
I'm not all sure of the king's good intentions towards me.
I will answer for him with my life, believe me.
You sure cannot imagine the reception that awaits you.
I'll sleep on it and I'll think about it.
That night, the fox had a remarkable nightmare.
So, male and female, the great day has now dawned
To settle these disruptive disputes, the king has decided on single combat between Sire Reynard, squire of Malpertuis and his enemy the wolf.
Captain Bear, that noted master of single combat, will see fair play.
The wolf has entered the list
A stir of excitement announces the fox's arrival.
Doffing his cape,
Reynard reveals a dazzling suit of armour.
He bows.
What an eye-catching figure.
Fierce and alert, the wolf looks at him askance.
The king wears the modest uniform of a Corporal of the guard.
The queen looks charming in brocaded satin, delightfully trimmed with fresh ermine.
The fox has dealt the first telling blow, but his adversary regains his feet.
The battle, listeners, is now waxing fast and furious.
Excuse me, but I can't really see.
The wolf has grabbed the fox tail, he's raining axe blows on him.
Captain Bear is firmly in control.
Another right from the wolf.
But his axe has broken and hit Captain Bear in the belly.
The battle, nevertheless, goes on, with the wolf belabouring the fox.
The fox has his second wind.
And the wolf is down.
The fox hammers the wolf.
The wolf grabs and throws the fox, the fox is finished.
Now Reynard, you are mine.
It's all over, I'm going to die in your arms.
So, as one might have predicted, the result is a victory for...
In a very good mood, Reynard decided to go see the king.
Reynard shall be well and truly hanged
A fine knot for you.
"By order of the king, Reynard is condemned
"to suffer the ignominy of public execution.
"As a malefactor unfit to live, may he find welcome in hell.
"We shall hang him forthwith
"to end his misdeeds.
"By decree of his majesty..."
We are ready, gentlemen, let justice be done.
Come, Madame Raven, there'll be fresh fox meat for lunch.
Before I die, Sire, I wish to make a last confession.
Wait, executioner, let the fox speak.
What you do not know is that I hoped to make you the richest monarch on earth.
My heart is as pure as the heavens themselves.
I had amassed for you a wonderful treasure of gold, pearls, rubies, amethysts, emeralds, aquamarines.
One vast diamond was shaped like a leg of mutton.
Alas, it's too late, now.
Shall I explain?
Speak.
The treachery of this bear, this wolf, this cat.
Approach.
Who, me... really?
The bear is compromised, the cat is compromised...
Do you think the cat's guilty, though he's in love with the queen?
Speak without fear.
You and I, Sire, are victims of a conspiracy.
I hardly dare reveal the danger that threatens us.
The bear, your Captain of the guard, has a burning desire to rule in your place.
His dream is to kill you and your lovely queen.
And then to settle on your throne.
Being too cowardly to act himself, he enlisted the cat, who was to secure for your successor the symbol of your authority, the golden banded goose claw.
Stop don't listen to these dreadful things.
I have not yet told you the most dreadful, incredible thing, Sire.
Your assassin...
There he stands.
The bear persuaded him to carry out his evil designs.
Your death is to occurs in a matter of days, maybe only minutes.
The assassination has been planned in every details.
He's gone too far
- I'll fix him.
Stop, assassin-
Arrest them all-
Throw them into jail.
Yes, in jail-
All three of them.
Damn- missed it.
So great a menagerie-
Deliver this box to the king with my compliments.
Yes, Sir.
Here is a cute little box in a cute little bag.
For your treasure, consult your daily paper
The fox was making a fool of me-
That's too much-
Furious, the lion decided to apprehend
Sir Reynard and prepared to lay siege to the castle of Malpertuis.
There are many of them this time, see?
Brave and loyal companions in arms, centuries of guilt confront you in this castle.
Guard this horn, Captain.
Only if it is sounded will hostilities cease.
Swear allegiance and constancy-
Is everything ready?
Come here, Wolf...
Go, I charge you to summon the fox to surrender.
Reynard, you are lost.
By order of the king, surrender-
What's that, I can't hear you- l, Wolf, summon you to surrender-
Otherwise, we attack- l can't hear you, come a little closer.
The wolf, Your Majesty.
That's too much.
Proceed, Captain Bear.
In the name of king, Reynard, surrender-
Or the king will send his armies and you'll die.
Obey, that's better.
The king is powerful.
One moment, I'm coming.
At last, he's being reasonable.
Gently now.
Have a good trip, Captain-
The honour to lead the attack shall be yours, Sir Ass.
Forward-
Don't play the mule, Reynard, surrender-
No-
Into the breach, my second army.
Do not forget that you all are pigs.
Come on my friend.
On the head-
Stupid bloody ass-
Listen carefully,
I'm entrusting the horn to your care.
Do not use it.
Now soldiers, follow me for the final assault.
The retreat...
I'm going back home.
To the rear-
Cock, you turncoat-
The cock betrayed us.
I recant my oath to fight.
The king realised that cunning, witty Reynard would make the best minister.
Oh, my Queen, the crown.
Reynard is more resourceful than you all, and I have concluded a pact of peace and friendship with him.
I wish you all to obey him in future.
Obey him as you would me, this is my will.
That's all folks.

Luís Filipe Bernardes
Has Miss Cavendish gone home yet?
Oh, you're the young fellow from the Tribune.
No, Miss Cavendish ain't gone home yet.
Say, old timer, maybe you can tell us something about this rumor.
What rumor?
Why, about Miss Cavendish retiring from the stage... and letting her daughter take her place.
Say, listen.
Do you two young newspaper fellows want to know something?
- Sure.
- Well, I'll tell you.
The Cavendishes never retire.
Cavendishes are eternal.
They go on acting until they're dead.
And when the Cavendishes die they go right on up to heaven... and start acting with the Cavendishes that are up there.
- You don't tell me.
- Yes, I do tell you.
Go on down to the stage door around the corner and see if that looks like Julie Cavendish is going to retire.
Come on, Pete.
Miss Cavendish, would you please sign this?
Miss Cavendish, Miss Cavendish...
I'm from the news.
We've heard you were going to retire.
Retire?
Where would I retire to?
Anything to say about your brother Tony?
That scam on the coast.
I don't know anything about it.
Oh, for me?
Here's one for you.
Mother, do you want to act on the road this fall?
- I most certainly do.
- Then won't you please take care of yourself?
You know Dr. Parker said you weren't to go out at night for a while.
Dr. Parker is an old goat!
You know best.
Does Oscar know you're out?
It's Oscar Wolfe's business to look after my tour, not after my health.
All right, but please take care of yourself.
All right, all right!
Look!
Look at that!
Tony Cavendish!
My son, a Cavendish, in Hollywood!
All talking, all color.
All terrible.
I wonder what that reporter meant.
- What reporter?
- Oh, nothing.
Where are you going in all your fancy clothes?
I was going to a party but I changed my mind.
I'm tired tonight.
What's the matter, wasn't the house good?
Oh, they were lovely.
I took seven curtain calls.
No, eight.
I always considered it a bad night if I didn't take at least fourteen.
I know, Fanny, but that was you.
Oh, I suppose it's just because I'm tired, but somehow the fun seems to have gone out of it all.
I've been doing it so long, Mother.
- Wait till you're my age.
- You love it, don't you, Mother?
And Gwen loves it.
But I'm just in between now.
Between my mother and my daughter.
It's no fun to look either back or forward.
You are tired.
The way I feel tonight I'd give the whole thing up for one man who really loved me.
Who'd give me a happy, peaceful home.
Well, my dear, you're America's leading actress... beside with me.
You have a daughter who's going in to her first play next week... with you... and a brother who's almost as good an actor as his father Aubrey was... if that Hollywood date hadn't ruined him.
You are part of a great tradition, Julie.
Member of a royal family.
A little bit late to talk about love.
It's never too late to talk about love.
It's too late to talk about peaceful, happy homes.
Well, it doesn't hurt to wish occasionally that ours was a little less like a madhouse.
What do you want to do with the rest of your life, sit at home and crochet?
- I don't know how to crochet.
- Or do you want to end it as I am, still trouping, still carrying on?
With a heart full of splendid memories.
Memories of a great... a great career as a great actress.
A Cavendish.
One vote for Cavendish!
No, Miss Cavendish hasn't returned from the theater yet.
Well, any minute now.
What?
Yes, I'll tell her.
Yes, I'll tell her.
- What is it, Della?
- I don't know.
It's something for Miss Julie.
New York called, Marine operator at one.
Marine operator, what's that?
It's a ship at sea calling.
They've been trying to get you all evening.
Ship at sea?
Miss French wants you to speak at her school on the 11th.
And there's some radio company wants you to talk for 15 minutes on the 9th.
The Evening Journal telephoned again... and the Postal Telegraph wants you to call.
And Mr. Wolfe is coming in the morning about your new play.
- That'll be all, Della.
- There were flowers and letters... and here are these checks to sign for those bills.
Not now, Della, I'll tend to those later.
The Langhorn Studio wants you to have another sitting.
- That's all, Della, please.
- Yes, Miss Julie.
- Here's a telegram for you.
- Oh, thank you.
You see, Mother, that's what I mean.
My poor darling.
- You'll feel better in the morning, dear.
- Yes, of course, darling.
- Oh, good heavens!
- What?
It's from Tony, dear little brother Tony.
Good gracious, is it anything serious?
As far as I can make out, he seems to have killed somebody.
Anyone we know?
- From Dodge City.
- Dodge City, California?
Look, he's on his way here.
Listen.
Pay no attention to possible account of Denning incident.
His injury is not fatal.
It takes more than that to kill a movie director.
Arrive New York Wednesday.
California police have no authority outside state.
Under no condition talk to reporters.
Zita Zadak on this train but no trouble so far as I'm locked in drawing room.
Love to all.
He was a dirty dog anyway.
Tony.
Oh, good old Tony.
Zita Zadak.
- Who's she?
- A movie actress, I suppose.
Great heavens.
Oh, my dear, Julie, do you think it's serious?
No, Mother, of course not.
Now, Tony will get out of it all right.
He always does.
We may as well prepare for the storm when he arrives.
That's all this little house needs now, one more storm.
Still, I do hope, Julie, that Tony's all right.
Tony's all right, Mother.
Now please, why don't you go upstairs and get some sleep?
Yes...
To bed, to bed!
'Knocking at the gates, what's done cannot be undone!
'
To bed, to bed...
Hello.
No, Miss Cavendish is not here.
I don't know.
What?
What?
The S.S. Chrstabella calling?
I don't know any S.S. Christabella.
Who?
From where?
South America?
Who?
This is Miss Cavendish.
Who?
Marshall?
Oh, Gilmore Marshall.
Oh, but of course, of course.
Why, Gil!
What in the world?
Why, it's been years and years.
I know.
Well, uh...
Well, how are you?
What are you doing on a boat called the S.S. Christabella?
Oh... you're arriving tomorrow.
Oh...
What?
Oh, this is very exciting.
Yes...
Yes.
Yes, about tomorrow noon.
I was afraid you wouldn't remember me, Julia.
I'm glad you do.
Your beautiful roses have just arrived.
Such beautiful roses.
Gil, don't you think you can get here before tomorrow afternoon?
Couldn't you swim or something?
You can swim very well, I remember.
No, I'm afraid not.
But I want to see you tomorrow afternoon.
But of course.
At four sharp.
I'll have the real me downstairs.
No, of course not.
No... oh, you'd be surprised.
Oh, I'm much younger than I used to be.
No, not a silver thread.
Say, how about you?
Oh, I'm about the same.
I've settled down quite a bit.
At least I...
I'd like to settle down.
Tell me, Julia, are you er...
Are you still on the stage?
Why...
why what a question!
Don't you ever read the newspapers down there?
Now, Gil, you must tell me all about yourself.
Oh, no, not now, tomorrow at four.
Yes...
Yes...
Yes...
Good-bye then.
I'm taking your roses up to my room.
Good-bye, my dear.
Table for two, waiter, not too near the music.
Aren't you giving a matinée today, Julia?
Being a star, Oscar, they'll wait for me.
It was a very good entrance, Julie.
Dear little mother, wouldn't you like to go up and come down again?
You're looking particularly beautiful today, if I may say so.
Oh, please do, Oscar because it's the most particular day for a beautiful party.
At least beginning at four o'clock it is.
Hello, darling.
Don't you look terrible.
I know I'm must fly, Mother.
I'm going right up and change.
Ah, how lovely, how peaceful and lovely...
Oh, peace, peace...
Go on, Oscar, that's beautiful.
A C.O.D package, Miss Julie, $39.
C.O.... what?
A package, $39.
What am I buying for $39?
All that for $39?
Who's got $39?
Oscar, let me have it.
Oh, Oscar, you're terrifying.
Julia, I'll cut it short.
We have now, let me see...
Oh, it's five minutes past two already.
I want you downtown at my office, you and Gwen, 3:00 sharp.
Your office, I never go to your office, Oscar, what do you mean?
Don't start to holler before I tell you.
Now...
You remember I told you last night I was going to meet the Mauritania?
Well, he came in.
Sir John Clark-Morton.
Oh, the author, oh, send him back.
- Avoid authors that come over water.
- An old Chinese proverb.
- In fact, avoid all authors.
- Let them eat cake.
If you Camilles will keep still a minute, I'll tell you what it is.
Now, this Clarke-Morton is a new playwright, and English.
And nothing will satisfy him.
He wants to read his new play to the entire company.
Is that so?
I never heard anything so idiotic in my life.
But if you're really serious, I'll go through with it.
But it can't be this afternoon.
Julia, how often do I ask you a favor?
This fellow has a play that I'm crazy to get a hold of.
- Oh, no...
- Humor him a little bit... and tell him how good he is.
Now, what do you say?
- Oh, Oscar, no.
- What do you say, Fanny?
Tell him to go jump in the lake.
But why must it be this afternoon?
Some other afternoon, perhaps, some less particular afternoon.
What's going on this afternoon, anyway?
Are you going to be married or something?
I can't do it, that's all, I can't.
So you wouldn't even do this for your poor old manager, huh?
You've got a little appointment, tea, or buy a new hat, and compared to that,
Oscar doesn't matter...
Oscar, don't cry.
Your tears unman me.
Well, well, never mind, never mind, but the next time you ask me to do something for you,
I...
I...
I...
Oh, I'll do it anyhow.
What are you doing that's so important this afternoon?
Well, I uh...
I...
Don't pay any attention to her, Oscar.
I'll see that she's there.
- Mother, you don't understand, that's all...
- Oscar's done a lot of things for you.
You win, Oscar.
At 3 o'clock enter Julie Cavendish.
That's my girl.
Now, don't forget, 3 o'clock sharp.
You and Gwen go down to my office.
You start in 20 minutes sharp, eh?
All right?
We'll be there, but I could kill you for it.
That's the way to talk!
Good-bye everybody, good-bye!
- Good-bye, Oscar.
- Good-bye, good-bye.
Now, look here.
Now, Julie Cavendish, what's all this mooning about?
What's this big renunciation scene, 'I can't do it this afternoon, I can't'?
What does it mean?
Gil's back.
Gil, what's that?
Gilmore Marshall.
Sent me flowers last night and a note.
So that's it, eh?
Would have been nice to have this afternoon free.
Good gracious, is he going to come here?
He said about 4 o'clock.
Della will only have to put him off, that's all.
So he's come back to New York to spend his millions.
And I think if it hadn't been for me you'd have gone off to South America and given up your career and everything.
I wonder what he's like now.
He may have become very charming.
South America, millions...
Probably a little gray hair.
Sounds all romantic, huh?
No more romantic now than he was years ago.
What a siege that was.
Yes, and what a demon you were, darling.
I had to be.
You certainly acted like a mother in a melodrama.
How I ever got you where you are today is more than I know.
You were always at the point of running off with some young squirt.
And when you finally married Rex Colbert, ooph!
Mother, out of the whole crowd why did I marry Rex?
He was a wicked singer.
- Yet with lovely manners.
- Yes.
He was the kind of man that would kiss your hand without looking silly.
I guess that's what he must have been doing when I needed him.
That's one thing you must admit about Gil, Mother, he would have been dependable.
Oh, when you get a little older you begin to think that maybe...
What's that, what's that?
Oh, don't be alarmed, darling.
But I am curious to see him.
I had it all staged so beautifully, too.
I was going to wear my rose beige and a hat with a brim... look dignified and wistful, look girlish, a little provocative withal...
Oh dear, oh dear...
Oh, dear, behave yourself.
You can put that act on for him just as well tomorrow.
It's been a good many years.
What's a couple of hours more?
I do hate disappointing Gil, though.
Well...
And I did so want to look gorgeous, and gay, and glamorous...
Is that all?
That won't be very difficult, my darling.
Thanks, Mother.
- You're sweet.
- Yes.
- Am I a fool?
- Yes.
Yes!
Oh, don't you look swell?
Oh, Gwen!
Was it this afternoon you were going out to Westchester with Perry?
Yes, he'll be along any minute.
Oh well, darling...
You can't go, that's all.
You'll just have to put him off.
You must go with me down to Oscar's office to hear the author read the new play.
Mother, that's absurd.
You know I've had this date with Perry for a week.
I've never met his mother.
She's giving the tea just for me and she's having all those people there,
How can I?
- It can be some other time.
- No, no, it can't now.
I've been all over it with Oscar and it's got to be this afternoon.
I promised.
Now there, Perry will understand.
I hope someone else will.
He picked a good day for it, this mister singing bob.
What is that?
Joe!
Della!
I never heard such a scandal in my life.
Oh, Mother, surely that can't be Gil already.
All right, shut up, everyone!
- Take everything up to my room, Joe.
- Yes, sir.
This way, boys.
Somebody run and lock the back door.
And you, take a look out of that window see if there's a man out there in a long overcoat of a filthy cut.
Well, how's America's sweetheart?
Aren't you glad to see your baby boy?
Tony, Tony, Tony!
Tony, will you explain this trick, how did you get here?
Tell you all about it in a minute.
Joe, get me 20 bucks.
Jerry brought me in from Mineola.
Ten apiece for the rest of the boys.
How many are there?
- Seven, sir.
Six, without me.
- That makes about 90 bucks.
Now remember, you fellas, if any of those reporters ask, you didn't see me.
Never came near me, don't know anything about me in fact you never even heard of me.
Uh... you better not say that.
They wouldn't believe it.
Hello, sis.
Well!
Hey, uh...
Let them have the money, will you?
Here, Joe.
Tony, your arm!
That doesn't amount to anything, I hit him too hard, that's all.
How did the fight start in the first place?
- Well, you see...
- Ah, this will be good.
- Tell us all about it, Uncle Tony.
- Uncle?
I'll strangle her.
Hello, Dell, how you been?
How about a bite for us?
Bring everything you got, will you, eh, babe?
But first I've got to have a hot bath.
Come on upstairs, everybody, while I take a bath.
Now look here, Tony Cavendish, you listen to me!
- What is it, Ma?
- How did you get here?
- You were in Dodge City yesterday...
- Sure, I came by airplane from Chicago.
A plane, Mother, what a disappointment...
I couldn't come on a train, they're watching the trains.
And I've got to lay low in this apartment till I sail.
- Sail?
- Sail where?
Europe, of course.
Tomorrow in the Aquitania.
Oh, I hate pictures!
Come on, come on, I'm gonna have a bath.
How did it start, tell me, how did this fight start?
Oh, this alleged director!
He had it coming to him ever since we started to shoot.
He put this girl on the picture and when she got stuck on me he got sore.
But Tony...
And then what happened then?
Come on, we're over here.
I'll tell you what happened.
When I'm on location doing a desert scene, see, this guy Denning picks out the worst camel in the pack and says, 'You ride that one.'
I took one look at it and said,
'You ride it yourself and see how you like it.'
He said, 'Who's directing this picture, you or me?
'
I said, 'You're directing the picture nut you're not directing me,
I'm through with it, and you can take this to remember me by.'
I wouldn't be so worried about it unless you killed him.
Who is this train woman?
Who is this zickary-zackory?
Just the same as Tony's other zickary-zackories, Mother.
I'm late, I must go.
Bye, you!
Hey!
Who is this zickary-zackory?
Oh, Mama, she's a Pole.
- Look out for Poles!
- Yeah.
Well, fancy meeting you here.
Hello, Perry.
Well, I can't go.
What do you mean you can't go?
I've got to go to Wolfe's office to hear the play read.
There's no way out of it.
I've got to do it.
You can't mean that you're breaking this date just to go and hear somebody read their play.
- What play?
- The play.
The play that goes in rehearsal tomorrow.
That Mother and I are doing.
Why, you've read it a thousand times.
You've read it to me.
But this is different.
The author is reading it.
Oh, well let him, the silly ass.
What do you care?
Oh, Perry.
I wanted horribly to go with you.
I made an awful fuss, but what could I do?
You know, Gwen, this isn't the first time you've done this to me.
Oh, Perry, don't be unreasonable.
You know it's just because of the new play.
Yes, but there'll always be a new play, won't there?
Well, I realize it's inconvenient sometimes, but it is for me too.
Well, what are we heading for, that's what I'd like to know.
How is it all going to work out?
Well, I don't know.
What is there to work out?
After all, you marry the person you'd rather be with more than anyone else in the world.
But where will you be half the time?
Rehearsing or something.
Now, don't be fantastic.
Rehearsals last three weeks.
All right, and then what?
You'll be at the theater every night.
Your work will just begin when mine's all over.
You'll have dinner at six.
I probably won't even be home.
By midnight, you're all teed up and ready to start out.
And I've got to be at work in the morning.
Now, you wouldn't want me to be one of those wives, would you?
- Bridge, and household, and babies...
- Why not?
What's the matter with that?
Because I can't do that sort of thing any more than you can do the other.
I'm an actress, Perry, an actress.
What does that mean?
Suppose you turn out to be as good as your mother, or better.
What is there to it when it's all over?
Get you name up in electric lights, a fuse blows out, phht, and where are you?
Oh, I suppose the world would go to pieces if you didn't sell 100 shares of consolidated whatnots for ten cents more than somebody paid for it.
Listen, you can't compare acting with business.
Is that so?
I can give you the names of actors and actresses of 300 hundred years ago.
Dozens of them.
Name me two XVII century stockbrokers.
All right, I'll give up my work, trail along after you carrying a little Pekingese...
It's not a Pekingese!
Oh, Perry, how can you...
How can you...
Listen, Gwen I...
Forgive me, darling.
It wasn't my fault.
Forgive me.
Oh, dear, it's just that I'm such a fig about you.
I can't help but want you all to myself.
Oh, we're a couple of idiots.
- We've never quarreled before.
- And we won't again.
There isn't anything in the world that matters to me except you.
- We must have been crazy.
- You're all that matters to me.
Oh, Gwen darling, darling...
Now come on, honey.
It's late.
- What?
- You're coming with me, aren't you?
- Oh, Perry.
- What?
You haven't heard a word I've said.
I heard everything you said.
You heard what I said too, didn't you?
Oh, it's like a bad dream.
I can't go.
Haven't I explained to you I can't?
Oh, yes?
Well, I've got to be going, of course.
And get there.
- Julie, are you ready?
- I'll be right there.
Gwen, are you ready?
Bravo, Tony!
Bravo!
If I'm not violating any dear old tradition of the Cavendishes, would it be all right for me to ask where my lunch is?
In fact, where the...
Asta mañana!
Mr. Wolfe just telephoned from the office, Miss Julie.
Good-bye, Mother darling.
Good-bye, you brute.
Come on, Gwen.
- I'm not coming.
- Gwen!
Will you please put on your hat and coat.
I don't just mean that I'm not coming now.
I'm not going to be in this play.
I'm not going to be in any play.
I'm through with the stage!
Before you've started?
I'm not going to let it mess up my whole life.
You mean...
as you think it has mine?
- If you like.
- Oh Gwen, darling.
What do you want at the end of your life?
A box full of stocks and bonds?
Or a heart full of splendid memories?
Oh, my dear, you don't know what you're talking about.
I'm sick of all this.
I'm sick of being a Cavendish.
I want to be a human being.
- But you are a Cavendish.
- Then I don't want to be.
But you've got to be.
Gwen, you can be the greatest of us all.
All preceding Cavendishes have just been stepping stones for you.
What's that, what's that?
I'll be a stepping stone for nobody.
And as for Aubrey Cavendish, there's nobody since his day that can touch him.
That's what I mean!
What's there to it when it's all over?
Get your name up in electric lights and then the lights don't work, or something.
And then where are you?
And you, the great Cavendish, that none of the young girls in this country can go to sleep on account of.
On account of you none of the...
Oh, you know what I mean.
What have you ever done with your life?
Have you ever had babies?
Have you ever known what it was to have a home and a husband?
You touched on a secret dream of mine, Gwen.
I wish you had spared me.
Lunch!
I'm through with you all!
I'm going to be Mrs. Perry Stewart.
And whoever wants to be a Cavendish is welcome to it!
Gwen!
Tony shouldn't be making that noise.
He's only been here 24 hours.
You can scarcely read in any room in the house.
I had to lock the door in my bathroom.
( Lines from Romeo and Juliet )
Oh-oh, Mr. Tony!
- Sorry, toots.
( Lines from Romeo and Juliet )
Have I not won thee fairly?
Fine, dear!
Here you are, Mack, I'll be up in a couple of minutes.
Yes, Mr. Tony.
Oh, you should have seen your father hold off eight of them.
Oh, what a swordsman he was.
What a master!
Aubrey and Fanny Cavendish... in 'A Gentleman of Trust'.
He'd turn around, hit him right down the stairway.
Then, up the banister and quick as a wink he'd whirl and catch one coming up behind him!
Thrust, yank, exit!
That scene was, oh...
It took a full bottle of liniment every week.
Oh, those were the days, Fanny.
Those were the days.
Yeah...
Say, where's Julie?
What time is it anyhow, it's late!
She should be here any minute.
The matinée's over.
It's a quarter after five.
Is she getting my passport or isn't she?
I've got to get out of here.
Can't sail without a passport, she ought to know that.
She isn't getting your passport.
Who says you've got to go to Europe?
- What for?
- A million reasons.
I feel like it.
I want to get away.
You can have it, your ancient and royal profession of acting.
I'm through!
You've been saying that ever since you played Little Lord Fauntleroy.
I mean it this time.
That's why I'm going abroad.
You give me two years in Munich with my violin and that Ascher... and I'll show you what the stage means to me.
I can be a great musician.
Or I might go away into India with Krishnamurti.
Study Hindu philosophy, it's the only real thing in the world.
You wear just one garment, a long white robe.
And you eat just one food: rice.
That ought to be restful.
The stage, agh!
I'm gonna spend ten minutes in the Cathedral of Chartres...
Now look here, look here.
You think you're fooling me about why you're going to Europe.
Cathedrals, and violins, and rice?
It's that dago woman you're running away from.
Well, suppose I am.
But I'm not afraid of her!
Then what is it?
It's just...
that breach of promise...
- What breach of promise, dear?
- $200,000.
She wants two...
That's why I've got to stay cooped up here.
You don't suppose I'm afraid of reporters, do you?
But if they ever tag that little paper on me, I can't sail.
$200.00 for breach of promise?
Why wasn't I told of this?
I suppose I was too young to know.
- Well, you see, Fanny...
- Get away from me!
$200.00 for breach of promise?
Assault and battery on this director, probably another $100.000
Well, it's worth it, I tell you.
What did you ever promise this movie actress that's worth $200.000?
What...
Woman's voice?
No, but I'm not taking any chances.
Who's that?
Oh, it's Julie, Julie, it's all right.
Oh, hello, Julie.
Oh, I'm getting pretty fed up on your dear public, Tony.
Did you get it, Julie?
The entire population of New York is standing out the doorstep howling for a glimpse of America's foremost screen lover.
In the meantime they take what fortune sends... or a piece of it.
My dear, your coat is ripped.
Come and sit down.
You'll be worn out for another performance...
My passport, have you got my passport?
Oh dear, what a day this has been.
Mother, how's Gwen?
Is she better?
No, no, she's still sulking in her room.
She hasn't been out all day.
- Now look here, Julie...
- Shut up, Tony.
- Has she eaten anything?
- No, she wouldn't even drink her tea.
Miss Julie, Mr. Cartwright phoned.
Mrs. Blair's dinner has been postponed
- ...for a week from Wednesday.
- Not now, Della, please.
The shop called up about your fitting.
Your dress won't be ready...
That be hanged!
My boat sails at midnight, what have you done about my passport?
Tony, my love, Wolfe is bringing it.
Oh, he is, eh?
Why didn't you say so?
- He's bringing the money, too.
- Thanks, Ma.
I paid for your reservation.
By the way, you neglected to tell me that you were roughing it across in the royal suite.
You don't expect him to travel like a stowaway, do you?
You got the right idea, Mom.
Oh, hire a battle ship, if you like.
Only don't forget I'm a poor working girl.
It'll all blow over in a month.
That's why I want to get away.
Why must it be Europe?
What are you going to do when you get there?
He's going to eat rice and play the violin.
Oh well, I'm going to see Gwen.
Don't forget, nobody is to know I'm in the house.
There are only about 10.000 people downstairs who seem to have caught on to your secret.
I'll lure them all right.
But you'll have to go out to catch the boat, won't you?
Oh, no...
Oh, no, it's all been arranged.
They're going to back the Aquitania up to the door for him.
Della, did he phone?
Mr. Marshall phoned eight times.
Last time he said he'd be right over.
Now, why don't you lie down and relax?
I'll bring you dinner on a tray.
- You have another performance tonight.
- I know, Della.
I'm going up to see Gwen.
Are you feeling better, darling?
Oh, Mother, I don't mean to act like a prima donna but I feel like hell, that's all.
I know, dear.
Bless my soul, what's all this darkness about here?
You can't see a hand before your face.
He didn't even telephone.
He might at least have telephoned.
How do you know he didn't telephone?
Tony's had the receiver off almost all day.
- Then maybe he tried?
- Yes, yes.
There, Gwen.
Oh, Mother, I love him so.
There's nothing to cry about, darling.
No, you can love him and marry him too, can't you?
You see, Gwen, it's hard for us to realize that you wouldn't want to carry on.
Your mother and I both got married but we didn't think we had to drop more important things to do it.
- There isn't anything more important.
- Oh, for heaven's sake.
Marriage isn't a career, dear.
It's an incident.
Aubrey Cavendish and I were married in the Church of St. Mary Redcliffe, in Bristol, England, just before the matinée.
- The wedding stopped all...
- I know.
I know, but I guess I'm not like the rest of you.
You think you're not, but you are.
Mary him if you love him, Gwen.
But don't give up everything to do it.
The time may come when you'll hate him for it.
Hate Perry?
You just don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, but I do.
There are all sorts of things you'll have to give up, darling.
Gay things, and amusing things.
Oh, but Gwen,
If I could only make you realize that the thrill you get out of doing your work is bigger than any other single thing in the world.
Oh, I know, there's love.
But you can be the most fortunate person in the world, Gwen.
You can have both.
Just don't make the mistake of giving up one for the other.
- No, child.
- Work!
Acting isn't anything.
- What's acting compared to...
- Oh, it's everything!
It's work and play, meats and drinks, and home and babies.
Oh, they'll tell you it isn't your fancy, Gwen, but that's a lie.
They'd give their years to be in your place.
Do you think I could have stood these last two years hobbling around on this thing...
If I hadn't known that I was going back to it?
Every night, when I'm sitting here alone,
I'm really down there, at the theater.
Seven-thirty, they're just going in at the stage door.
Good evening, to the doorman.
Taking down their cues, looking at the mirror at...
Eight o'clock!
The stage hands are setting up!
Come on, Miss Cavendish!
Come on...
Greasepaint, rouge, mascara...
Fifteen minutes, Miss Cavendish!
My costume.
Miles, where's the rabbit's foot?
Overture, overture...
Good evening, everybody!
How's the house tonight?
Shhh...
Curtains up, props huge...
Enter!
That's all that's kept me alive... these last two years.
And you were down there for me.
Going on, going on... going on!
Oh, Mother!
Grandmother, Grandmother, what is it?
- What happened?
- Joe!
Joe!
I'll do it, I'll go on, Grandma, I promise I'll go on!
- What happened?
- Send for the doctor.
- What's the matter, what is it?
- It's Mama.
Well do something, what are you all standing around for?
- Be quiet...
- Mom, Mom, Mom...
Oh, my poor Mama...
Mama, can't you come to, Mom?
There you are.
Oh, Mom, are you all right, Mom?
Oh, Tony...
Tony!
Oh, Mom...
Here, I'll take your shoes off, dear.
There, Mom...
Hold her head, hold her head.
Here you are, take a swig of this, Mom.
Sure, that'll make you feel better, Mom.
Are you better now, Mom?
Take her over there on the couch.
I'll take her, Joe, I'll take her.
Come along now.
Make her lie down, put her head... here...
There you are, right over here...
- Come along, darling.
- Just take it easy, lean on me.
You're doing swell, there you go.
There you are...
Pull her feet up.
There you are...
there you are, Mom.
Now come on, get out of here, get out of here, go on...
- It's all my fault!
- Good golly, Gwen...
Get out, get out, all she needs is rest,
I'll take care of her.
There you are, Mom.
Feel better now?
I'll never forgive myself.
Now Gwen, you must stop blaming yourself.
- Ahhh...
- Well, how's Mother?
Oh, she's all right.
You know, it's a funny thing.
What's so funny?
I can't get a quiet moment in this house.
I suppose the bull felt the same way about the china shop.
- Hello, hello...
- Oscar, how about my passport?
- That's what I came to talk about.
- What?
It is not so easy, these fellows...
Oscar, you don't mean to say you can't get it.
No, I don't say I can't get exactly...
Oscar, another 24 hours in the house with this caged lunatic and you could order straitjackets for two.
- Now, now, now...
- Oh, you promised me.
Did Oscar ever fail you?
We'll get that passport all right.
I hope...
I won't take no for an answer!
You got to get that passport!
- Tony you're being unreasonable!
- Chuck me I'm being unreasonable!
But you haven't done anything so terrible.
You've hit a movie director and made love to a Pole.
Chances are both will recover.
You don't know what you're talking about.
You'll find out if it's terrible or not!
Oh...
- Why, if this woman...
- Oh, Tony, stop acting!
Now, what can she do to you?
Now keep quiet and calm down.
Ha!
What can she do to me?
What kind of a jam do you think I'm in?
What do you suppose I drove all the way from California for, the ride?
I've got to get out of here, I tell you.
Zita's in town this time, do you know what that means?
You don't know that Pole cat.
Why, I've seen her pick up...
She's a killer.
She just can shoot as look at you.
She's a Pole!
She's cuckoo about me.
And she knows I'm through with her.
If you don't want anything to happen to me, well, all right.
You're a fine sister.
I'm only your brother, so why should you bother about me?
But I'm telling you now, if you get me all over the front page so will you, and so will Gwen and the whole royal family!
Now if that's what you want, believe me, you're going to get it!
Much obliged, Oscar, for all your trouble.
Poor Tony.
He's gone completely Hollywood.
I wonder what he's doing now.
Probably cutting his throat.
- Well, Oscar, he probably is.
- No, no...
I'm going to see how Grandma is.
- What's the matter with your grandma?
- She's ill.
- She's ill?
- Oh, yes, she fainted.
She fainted?
She fainted and you didn't tell me...
- I hadn't any time...
- (Oscar in German)
I don't want you to go up there, Oscar,
She must have quiet, she mustn't have any excitement now, remember.
Oh...
Gil.
Oh, Gil...
You must really make allowances for us... we're even more... more...
upset than usual this afternoon.
Something wrong, can I help?
- Oh, it's just.
- Perhaps I shouldn't have come.
Oh no, I'm glad you did.
You're still sane, aren't you, Gil?
So strong, and reliable and sure.
Oh dear...
I was going to be so ravishing on our first meeting.
I was going to be so divinely cool, so beautifully serene...
I had it all planned.
- Would... you go out and come in again?
- Hm?
Just go out and come in and then hold my hand, like that.
And I'll say, 'Oh, Gil, so it's really you after all these years.'
That seem like centuries.
You haven't changed a bit.
Come over here.
Still the same.
The same slim, fair-haired girl I knew so well.
Tell me.
- Are you as famous as they say?
- Oh, probably.
But you haven't exactly been hidden from the public age yourself.
What was it you found lying in the streets, radium or something?
No, not radium, platinum.
Oh, only platinum, oh...
Bet you've made millions and millions, haven't you?
- Let me touch you.
- Oh, I've done pretty well.
You're certainly the top of the heap in your line, aren't you?
No, just Zita.
I feel eager to get out of tabloid newspaper nowadays without a story of one of the family.
Tony's king at the moment.
Yes, I saw the crowds downstairs.
Say, what's he going to do?
Try and get away?
Oh, it's really an awful mess.
He wants to sail tomorrow on the Aquitania... and we can't get a passport.
Passport?
Aquitania?
Tonight?
Why, Gil...
You mean you know somebody who might...
Lohengrin 92097
Oh!
- How soon can he get down there?
- Oh, right away, I should think.
- Tell him to get ready.
- All right.
John, let me talk to Moran.
You actually mean you can do it?
Oh, if you only could.
Don't you know there isn't anything in the world I wouldn't...
Hello.
Julie, if I thought you needed me, I'd go to the end of the...
Hello, Moran, this is Marshall.
Now get this.
I want an emergency passport, Aquitania tonight.
That's right.
Meet me on the Cunard dock in half an hour.
- Can he make it in half an hour?
- Yes, yes...
Oh, 20 minutes.
I'll give you the data when I see you.
Tony, Tony!
Oh, Gil, it's wonderful of you.
You're one of those strong-hearted men, aren't you?
Tony, Tony!
We got it.
Hurry up, get your things on!
- What do you mean, the passport?
- Yes.
- Gil got it for you.
- Gil who?
Never mind, never mind, give him 50 bucks.
Shhh, Mother.
- Joe, Joe!
- Yes, sir?
- Is everything ready?
- Yes, it will be.
- All right, get to it.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, sis, you're grand.
I knew I could count on you.
Old reliable.
Much obliged, old fellow.
Who is he anyway?
Is he always like this?
Oh...
Oh, sometimes families are...
Just happens that blood is a little thicker than usual today.
Julia...
The reason I went away was so that you could go ahead and be an actress.
All that stuff about Cavendish and the stage being your real life and... the only way you can be happy.
Well, you've got everything you went after.
And how about it?
Are you happy?
Happy?
I don't know.
Why, of course you're not, Julia.
I stayed away all these years because I thought at least you were living the life you wanted most.
And now I come back and find this.
Why, you ought to have everything in the world.
You ought to have everything done for you.
Done for you by someone who loves you.
Don't you know what you ought to be doing instead of this, the sort of life you ought to be living?
Why, you ought to be in a country house somewhere... with a garden, and trees...
Somehow you look garden and trees.
- Oh, Gil...
- Julia, I...
I've got a little place in England, it's...
Oh, I can't describe it, I'm not good at that sort of things.
Don't try.
Let me imagine.
Or you can go...
You can go anyplace else you want, Cairo...
St. Moritz... any place you want.
Well, my dear?
Oh, I'm so tired of deciding things.
Julia... what fools we've been.
Wait, let me think.
You've had too long to think.
It's settled.
No, please...
I'm not sure what's happened.
I can't think clearly.
I'll tell you what's happened.
Something that should have happened years ago, that's what happened.
I think you'd better go now.
All right.
But I can come back, can't I?
Yes, tonight after the theater.
Till tonight.
- Joe, Joe, where's the...
- Tony, you'll disturb Mother.
We gotta get out, Joe!
Come on, tell those men to come up!
What's all this hullaballoo?
Tony, how I wish you were out of this house...
I'm not making any hullaballoo, you're making all the hullaballoo!
Nobody's been quieter than I have in this house...
- Blather, one can't get a wink!
- Mother, what are you doing up?
You're quite all right again, eh?
You haven't been to sleep, go back to bed.
Julia, you make her go to bed.
I'll go get her some medicine.
What's all this excitement about?
What's this all about?
There you are, Fanny, you're the comeback kid.
It's not excitement...
Gwen!
I can't go to bed, I can't go to bed, not with Tony going.
- How soon will Tony be gone?
- I'll be gone in 30 seconds.
All aboard, finger up...
Hello, Gwen.
- Did you call me?
- Yes, take Mother by her arm.
- Lean on me, Mama...
- You leave me alone!
- I don't want to?
- You oughtn't to be up at all.
- Gwen, you've been crying.
- No, I haven't.
- Tony, are you ready?
- What?
Oh, one more day of this is just about all for me.
Now, Mother, you've got to go back to bed.
Not until Tony has gone.
The very minute he...
Tony, are you coming?
- All set!
- Oh!
- The end of a perfect day.
- Joe!
Now, Tony, don't hire a cab and come back.
Joe, send him away no matter what happens.
Tony...
Tony, aren't you going to say good-bye?
Tony...
He didn't even say good-bye.
- Why, that's outrageous!
- Tony, wait for me.
Don't let him go, don't let him go...
He's never gone away like this before.
He didn't look at me.
He didn't... speak to me.
Oh, Tony...
Oh...
Oh, Mother darling, it's all right.
He's not going to Arabia.
Now, don't make yourself ill, dear.
All aboard!
Farewell appearance.
- Tony!
- Well, how do you like it?
It fit on me, didn't it, huh?
- What are you all made up for?
- Boarding a boat, of course.
- What's that?
- Why, sure...
My double makes a dash for the taxi the crowds swarm after him, give them a nice run up 5th Avenue, then I get out, get into my cab, in ten minutes I'm on the dock.
- Voilà!
- Oh, Tony!
Good-bye everybody!
Good-bye, Mom.
The open sea, the salt, the Arctic wind, I'm on my way!
Remember, the Cavendish tribe.
Oh, let's all go out and ring doorbells.
Oh, Miss Julie, you must eat something.
It's late, you've got to go to your performance.
I know, now mother, you promised me you'd go to bed.
I won't, I won't go to bed.
What, Fanny's not in bed?
Julia, what are you thinking of?
- What?
I tried to...
- You should be in the theater anyway.
You've got to see Ferenc Molnár before you go on.
- What?
- But Mother hasn't had dinner yet.
She doesn't need any dinner.
She's got to watch her weight.
Ohhh!
Someone!
What's the matter?
What's going on?
Perry take her out of this!
Take her away before it's too late.
Take her where she'll never hear the word stage again, or Cavendish.
- Take her away!
- Julie!
I'm not going to marry him.
Not going to marry him?
Not going to marry him?
I'm not going to marry him and spoil his whole life.
Oh, Gwen!
If you don't you're going to throw away your whole life and for what?
This?
So that years from now you can be standing here as I am, a madwoman in a family of maniacs?
Not much, Gwen, you're not going to.
You're going to marry Perry Stewart.
- No, I won't.
- Oh yes you are.
You're going to do what I didn't do.
They told me I had to be a Cavendish, oh yes, you did!
But you're going to marry him now, tonight, tomorrow, and I'm going to be there with you and stand up beside you and cry for happiness as if it was me.
And why not?
You've all had your turn, why didn't I have mine?
I can walk out and nobody can stop me.
From now on I'm going to live!
You don't believe it, but I'll show you.
I'm going to marry Gil Marshall.
I'm going to Egypt, Cairo and Constantinople.
What do you think of that?
If it's hard to take it, then I'm through with it.
I'm never going to act again.
I'm never going to put my foot on a stage again as long as I live.
I'm never going inside of a theater again.
- I'm never...
- Miss Julie, it's 8 o'clock!
Oh, good heavens, I'm late!
Come in.
- Oh, Oscar, my lamb.
- Lieblich.
You renegade.
Oh, it should do, it should do, the lot you care about me.
The only man in your mind is this Mr. Whosis.
All the way from South America he's got to come to ruin my business.
His boat gets in tonight, eh?
It couldn't sink or anything.
Oscar, it's your own fault.
Why didn't you marry me?
Marry you?
It's bad enough to manage you.
My sympathy, Oscar.
Julia, what do you want with being a millionaire's wife?
With Gwen being a society woman, all I need is Fanny should marry
John D. Rockefeller when my season is over.
Oscar, that's what I came to talk to you about.
What, is Fanny marrying Rockefeller?
The doctor called up this morning.
She can't go on with this tour.
Fanny?
He says you've got to cancel some way or other without her knowing it,
I knew it would be a blow to you, dear Oscar.
I'll fix it.
She won't suspect anything.
But Julia, do you realize what that means?
There won't be a Cavendish left on the stage.
Yes, I know, but...
Oh Julia, listen, I've got a play here for you...
- No, Oscar...
- I've got a play, I'm so crazy to produce it, Julia.
I don't care how much I lose on it.
No, Oscar, I'm through with it.
I'm through with it forever.
I know, that's how you talk now.
You've just closed a big run, you're tired.
What will you do when you're restless?
What will I do?
Why, I'm going on my honeymoon.
What are you going to talk about alone with this fellow?
Platinum mining?
Don't be absurd, lots of things.
The theater he don't care about.
Imagine.
Well, there are lots of other things in the world besides the theater.
Yes, but not for you.
We're going to travel, we're going places...
Music and places, exciting places.
Well, you might just as well see the world.
With him you'll need it.
- Oh, Oscar, you just don't like Gil.
- No, no, not for you.
He's the kind that will tell you you've got too much makeup on.
He'll organize you.
Well, that might be rather pleasant after years of practically checking my own trunk.
No, no, not for you.
You were independent too long.
You got to be headman.
Oscar, you just don't understand.
I want to have fun.
Fun?
It's work that's fun.
You've had more fun in the last 20 years than any other woman in America.
You're the finest actress we have in this country and you stand here and you tell me you want to have fun?
Oh, Oscar, I want peace and quiet.
- I want to relax.
- All right, go ahead.
Relax while you could be making history.
Go on, get married.
But wait till 8 o'clock comes and you don't have to go to the theater anymore.
How bored you'll be with your bargain.
Oh... don't be ridiculous.
Della, are there any messages?
No, Miss Julie.
- Nobody called up?
- No.
- All day?
- All day.
Oh...
Della, what time is it?
- Oh, about 8 o'clock.
- Oh, dear...
Forget it.
Della.
Come here.
What's that you're doing?
I'm making a mat out of your old stockings.
Out of stockings?
Oh dear!
I always wondered what happened to old stockings.
- Isn't it pretty?
- Yes, it's lovely.
Della...
What's the matter with this place?
Looks so dreary.
Flowers, that's what it is.
We don't have flowers here anymore.
No.
- Hm, the don't come in like they used to.
- They certainly don't.
Well, maybe we'll have to buy some.
Della, what do you suppose women who aren't actresses do with their evenings?
Oh...
Go to the theater, I suppose, hm?
That looks nice, let me see.
Let me try it, Della, wait a minute.
- What do you do now?
- Now put this through your fingers.
There... now...
Now put your needle through the next hole.
- That one?
- Yes, dear.
- Now what?
- Catch the silk and pull it through.
All the way through, all the way.
- That's the way.
- Oh, that's fun.
- Now the next hole.
- Ah...
There, it's just a simple crochet stitch.
Crochet?
Is that what this...
Am I crocheting?
Take it away, take it away, please.
I never thought I'd come to that.
Oh, It's Mr. Marshall!
Never mind, Della, I'll go, I'll go.
Oh, Gil, I thought you'd never get here!
Julie, I'm sorry, I'm so glad to see you too.
Oh, I have chocolate on my hands, put your coat down.
I couldn't wait to get here, you know?
- You look simply marvelous.
- I never saw you looking better in your life.
Come and talk all about yourself, what you've been doing and everything about yourself.
The radium mines... or was it copper...
I've forgotten...
Come on, tell me about everything.
Well, the trip was about as usual, pretty hot when we started, but cooled off when we came up north.
How nice.
The trip usually takes eighteen and a half days but this time owing to the perfect weather we did it in exactly eighteen days.
Eighteen days!
Oh, is it as far as that?
Julia, you'll love it down there.
Sixty miles from the nearest town.
You won't see a theater, electric signs on a stage door from one year's end to the other.
Up at six, bed at ten.
Peace, quiet, no traffic, no motor horns...
Nothing but the vast solitude of those tremendous planes.
It sounds rather... restful.
Our nearest neighbor is 30 miles away.
Señor Zamarco, he's a Spaniard of the highest type.
You'll see a lot of the Zamarcos.
He married a Kansas City girl, daughter of Julius Kranz.
The meat packer, you know.
Oh, Julius Kranz, yes...
She's a very fine woman.
And most entertaining.
They're staying at the Ritz.
I told them that I'd take you over there a little later on tonight.
- Tonight, Gil?
- Hm-hmm.
You and she will have lots in common.
- Really?
- Yes, she plays the harp.
Oh...
Yes, I tell you, Julia, they're fine solid, substantial people.
None of your...
I wonder what that is.
No one, I hope, on our first evening together.
Hello, darling.
Hello, Oscar.
Hello, Gil...
Or should I say Father?
- Darling,
- How do you like being a lady of leisure?
So your boat didn't sink, eh?
Well, it's certainly delightful to be all together like this, isn't it?
Well, Gwen, giving up the stage certainly seems to agree with people.
Eh, Perry?
Well, as a matter of fact I uh...
- Oh, Oscar, you tell them.
- No, no, you tell them yourself.
Oh, it's the most marvelous play, only a bit, but the sort of part I've always wanted to do.
You know, it's a lady with her hair back like this and she stands like this...
Anyway, Perry's going on a business trip...
What on earth is she talking about?
She'll tell you.
Oh, is the boyfriend a little upstaged tonight, Mrs. Stewart?
No... only a sort of a shock to him having the leopard show it's thoughts.
But Perry, darling, you'll be gone five whole weeks.
- Four.
- And the house runs itself... and I'll have nothing to do and...
I just can't give up this play.
Because if I'm any good at all, it will put me where I can...
Well, anywhere.
Oscar says it can't possibly last more than two months at the most.
Oh, a light begins to dawn.
So it's Oscar's play.
Oh, Oscar, aren't you the wily one?
Well, what's so immature?
Last season you and Gwen were going to read the play for me.
Then Gwen got married, now you're doing the walking out.
But you still can have your part if you want.
No, no, Julia's through with all that sort of thing.
Oh, Mother, you're pleased, aren't you?
Of course, darling, of course I am, especially...
Julia, where's your mother?
Mother's on the road this season.
She's playing in Brooklyn here.
On the road?
I wonder you allow it.
She wouldn't be happy doing anything else.
Oh, it's a dog's life.
By the way, here's something that will interest you.
There was a theatrical troupe on board, American.
They'd been stranded in Buenos Aires.
Poor devils, they... they didn't even have enough money to get home.
But we uh... we got together and followed through.
Yes, I suppose I got a little sentimental on account of you people.
- I'm sure they must have appreciated it.
- Oh, they certainly did.
It seems the manager skipped off with the money.
You know how these fellows are.
- Dear me, yes.
- Oh, Oscar knows best.
You'd think they'd be downhearted, but not a bit of it.
They were absolutely carefree as soon as they got on the boat.
And they turned out to be quite a decent lot.
- Why, some of them are married.
- Oh, yes, even actors marry, you know.
Oh, what is that noise?
Tony!
You're back!
Hello, sis, how have you been?
How are you, Gwen, Oscar?
Joe, got any beefsteak?
Take them out of here.
How's my pretty?
Tell you all about it in a minute.
All the fascinating facts...
Gunga... ( Native language )
Hey, toots, show him where to go, will you?
He's going to stay in the house?
Gunga saved my like over in India... another minute and the tiger would have had me.
What do you mean by bursting in on us like this?
Why didn't you let us know?
Couldn't ley you know, that's why I came by way of Canada.
- I landed in Canada.
- Canada?
Hello, George, how are you?
Glad to see you, boy.
Why Canada?
The Aalkanians and the Shlesingens were going to declare war on each other.
I knew if I got out she'd marry him and everything would be all right.
What's he talking about, or is he making it up?
Oh, it's been in the papers.
Natalia broke off her engagement with Rupert of Schlesingen.
- And the Albanians...
- Just a moment, who's Natalia?
Natalia's the princess of Albania.
She's a nice kid, but I didn't mean anything serious.
That's the trouble with these princesses, sheltered lives... you dance with them a couple of times, they want to elope with you.
Of course, when she broke off with Rupert, the Prime Minister sent for me...
Oh, I'm beginning to understand.
You started the European War.
Oh, no, I don't think they'll fight.
No, she'll get over it.
Say, toots, how about a little food?
That's a good idea.
I'll start that now.
Anyway, that isn't why I came back, Oscar, listen.
I was cruising around to buy something for a bite and I happened to pass by a little theater stuck away in a courtyard.
There's a poster standing on the outside and I started to read it.
I don't know, I got a hunch about it and I went in.
- Well, say.
- Good, eh?
Good?
It's the greatest show I ever saw in my life.
And I bought it.
You're to wire them $3000 tomorrow, American money.
- You bought it?
- What for?
I'm going to act in it, of course.
- Tony, you're going back to the stage?
- Sure!
- What's so wonderful about that?
- Wait, I'll show you, I'll show you.
Where the devil...
Here it is.
Now here's the scene plan.
You can't make anything out of this but I'll show you how it works.
What's that there?
You don't enter or exit in the ordinary sense, you just slide...
- ...or else slipped down by wires.
- Wires?
Swenger, the fellow who does it in Koenisberg fainted six times the first night.
Here's the big kick.
You see that, where my finger is?
Yes.
Well, in that way, we cut out our overhead 14%.
Yes, but I should think that would increase your depreciation.
That swings the whole thing around, the audience becomes the actors and the actors become the audience.
- It serves them right.
- I tell you it's a knockout.
Of course, the great thing about this play is takes two nights to do it.
- Two nights?
- Tony, you're cuckoo.
Wait a minute, You don't understand what this thing is.
It's a modern version of the Passion Play.
And you play what?
The lead, of course.
Pure blank verse and the incidental music...
Wait, I'll play it for you.
Is there a good woman's part in it?
Julia, I'd like to have a word with you.
The sacrificial moment runs right through.
Tear your heart out.
Julia, you're not interested in this sort of nonsense anymore, are you?
Imagine.
Get your things, darling.
I don't like to be late.
Oh not now, dear.
Now, and then when he comes down from the mountains there's a stunning passage.
Hello?
What?
Oscar, it's for you.
Hello?
Oh, shut up, you kids.
What?
Mrs. Cavendish?
Yes, yes, yes...
Right away.
What is it, Oscar?
Your mother.
- We've got to go to the theater.
- Tony, Gwen, hurry up.
I never was so proud in my life, I should say.
She was giving one of the best performances I ever saw her give.
Mr. Ferguson, what shall we do?
Will Mrs. Cavendish be able to finish?
- I don't know...
- Shall I call the act as usual?
- Yes, yes.
- Okay.
There, there, all right now, Mom?
The music...
the intermission's almost over.
Help me...
Help me to get up.
No, I advise you to lie quiet.
Advise, advise...
Doesn't the man realize there's a performance going on?
- Listen, Mom, take it easy...
- Please lie down, it's all right.
It's all right, Ma, you'll go on again tomorrow.
You can't go on tonight.
Better go out and tell them.
Money refunded at the box office.
Bring down the curtain.
Bring down the curtain?
Are you mad, Wolfe?
Bring down the curtain?
Cavendishes don't bring down the curtain.
We always finish the play.
Oh, Julie, help me.
No, Mom, you can't go on, no...
Kitty, get my costume!
Fanny, Fanny, my darling, don't try,
Kitty, fix that dress for me.
Julie...
It's all right, Mother dear, I know the part perfectly.
We'll finish the play.
She can play it, Mom.
Last act!
Everybody on the stage for the last act.
Oh, Gwen, go help Julie.
Mother, the first line of Miss Whitlow is 'So good to be home.'
Yes, and then enter with 'How nice, sweetheart,'
And then, 'Is there anybody home beside yourself?
'.
No, no, 'Who's at home beside yourself?
'
'Who's at home beside yourself?
, yes.
Last act!
Last act!
Ready, Mrs. Cavendish?
Yes, yes...
I'm ready.
Mother, Mother...
Doctor, please...
Quick!
Quick!
Oh, Grandma.
Oscar, she's gone.
The greatest trouper of them all.
Fanny... my girl.
Curtain's going up!
Go on, darling.
Julia...
I'm going back to South America... alone.
But I want you to know that I understand.
This is your life up here and that's mine down there.
And we could never make a go of it.
I think you're right to stay.
And I am proud of you, Julia.
I'm proud of your family.
Good-bye.
God bless you.
- All right, bring up the curtain.
- Yes, Miss Cavendish.

DEFENDANT, PLEASE RISE
REHEARSAL ROSTER
SEPTEMBER 15, 1929
NOON:
DRESS REHEARSAL STARTING WITH 4TH ACT
It's nice to hear French music once in a while, isn't it?
Yes, people must be getting fed up with jazz.
Stop!
-Is that your costume?
-No, they're fixing it.
They're redoing the feathers.
They're redoing the feathers?
-What about you?
-My pants are too small.
Your pants are too small?
Are you sure?
What do you do?
-What do you mean?
-In the show?
-Oh, I'm the water lily.
-And you?
I'm the crane.
Larivière!
What'd I say?
You have another bird coming in with a flower!
They're new.
They weren't here yesterday.
So what?
Birds on the right!
Flowers in front!
-Or the audience will be lost.
-As usual!
Let's go.
-Legris!
-Yes, sir!
-Let's go to the next act.
-Yes, sir.
"My little angels,
"My little angels,
"Come to your mother's breast.
"And you, vile seducer,
"must face my sword to get her back.
"Don't you dare try to take him from me.
"He's my son."
Don't mind me, they're old memories.
My Lady.
OK, girls, time for the 15th act!
-Legris!
-Yes?
-Ready?
-Yes, sir.
Let's go!
Stop!
Ladies, you're holding guns, not syringes.
Continue.
Larivière!
Larivière!
Off the stage!
You're in their way.
-Mr.
Bastien!
-Yes?
Can't you get your girl to sing in tune?
I tried, but there's nothing we can do.
Go on.
She's our silent partner's favorite.
-Jules.
-Yes.
This dress rehearsal is going to be painful.
It's almost 4 AM.
You should change your costume, dear.
-Blanche!
Costume change.
-Yes, ma'am.
Legris!
Next act!
Clear the stage!
Next act!
Ready, Legris?
-Yes, sir!
-Let's go!
It was a very long time ago.
You wouldn't believe me.
But I won't tell you, because you'll print it.
Don't be rude.
He's a journalist.
Quiet, André.
You wouldn't believe where we've been.
When I look back, it's been hard for André and me.
We've toured the country in unheated, 3rd class trains.
And dirty, stuffy rooms...
Think he's interested in that?
Of course he is.
Aren't you?
-See?
-Alright, then.
My husband and I met in a show in St. Étienne.
They paid us peanuts, so we didn't eat every day, as you can imagine.
Then there was Maubeuge.
The audience was on both sides of the stage.
We sang for the right side first, then the middle, then the left.
So the left side only heard the end!
-And Limoges!
-Oh, yeah!
We weren't paid there either, just fed.
The lead actor did the cooking.
You can imagine the food!
We also got coffee and postcard profits, which was nice, right?
-Yes.
-You know...
It wasn't always funny at the time.
I was lucky to have my husband.
He's very talented.
Much more so than me.
Be sure to add that.
-No, don't.
-Yes, add it.
Quiet.
Come here.
We've never left each other.
We've always worked together.
We kept each other's spirits up.
We'd tell each other our luck would change someday.
It sure did.
We're in Paris now.
Our act is very good, very original.
-He came up with it.
-I did.
He got the idea when we were in the country.
We love the countryside.
-One day...
-There's no stopping her now!
I have to see the conductor about the cut we made.
-Fine.
-Excuse me.
Give me a goodbye kiss!
-There!
-Do you love me?
-A little.
-Don't be mean.
I adore you.
-See you later.
-Yes.
Sorry, what was I saying?
What was I...?
Right, the country.
We just love the country.
We always planned to buy a house when we would have enough money.
Quiet!
They're doing a number.
André!
Want some candy?
André?
André!
Yes?
-Yes?
-Come in.
Have a seat.
Have a cigarette.
Did you practice with the orchestra?
Yes, ma'am.
There's no need to call me "ma'am."
We're alone.
Call me Yvette.
I'd like to, but it's a bit complicated.
You're not only the star, you're the director.
And there's my wife to think of.
She might not understand.
I don't want to hurt her under any circumstances.
It took you a while to come up with that!
Do you love your wife?
Of course I do.
Why wouldn't I?
That's what I thought.
Ridiculous!
I don't see how that's ridiculous.
I'm not the only man who loves his wife.
She didn't come down with you?
No, she's in our dressing room.
A journalist is interviewing her about how she got started.
Have some champagne with me.
-No, thank you.
-Yes, it'll help with your act.
If you were a reasonable young man, André,
I'd have a proposition for you.
I'm a reasonable young man.
The boss has found a new guy!
-She can't help herself.
-She has to try them all.
"André, I have a proposition for you."
I know what kind!
-Goodbye, ma'am.
-Goodbye.
-Where's Ms. Gary's room?
-One floor down.
-More champagne?
-No, thank you.
I have to do my act later.
About that...
You know, André, you could be in my summer show.
We'd make a lovely couple.
You'd benefit from my name.
I have an idea for a sensational act, one people will talk about.
With your name next to mine, it could be your big break.
I run things around here, so just say the word.
Wouldn't it be nice, André?
What do you think?
I'm going!
Ladies of Louis XIV's court!
Do I have to drag you down the stairs?
This is unbelievable!
Got nothing to say?
What do you think?
I'm not saying no.
Obviously, it would be great.
Let's talk about it over dinner tonight.
A friendly dinner.
We'll talk it over.
It's a date!
It would be a pleasure, but I really can't, because of my wife.
You don't have to tell her.
You'll see her afterwards.
Come to my place as soon as you're done.
No, I really can't.
Fine.
I won't mention it again.
Blanche!
Quickly!
This isn't going to work.
I'll be going, then.
You're so clumsy!
It's not like that at all.
My legs have had enough!
Well, I've had 12 costume changes!
Isn't life grand?
-Shoot, I broke a nail!
-What time is it?
2 AM.
We've been here since noon.
The 14th act is starting!
The 14th act is starting!
Ready, Gaby?
We're up next.
They finished Louis XIV's Court and started Babylon Gardens.
It's about time.
I'm fed up with waiting.
The makeup is nice.
Pass me the matches.
I need to tell the orchestra about the cut we made.
I was going down to tell him, but...
I got stopped on the way and I forgot.
We'll see.
It's just a rehearsal.
Wish we could get it over with.
Did you tell them about the lighting?
I'm out of powder.
Can you pass me yours?
You're awfully quiet.
What's wrong?
Look at me.
What's wrong, Gaby?
Did something happen?
-You went downstairs to see her.
-Me?
I heard you two.
She asked you to be her partner and you had champagne.
Then she shut the door, so I couldn't hear more.
-You're crazy.
-No, I'm not.
I heard you clearly.
She wants you, but she doesn't need you.
That's crazy.
Are you jealous?
That's silly.
You know I love you.
I'm lucky to have you.
I'd be a fool to be with another woman.
Are you trying to hurt me?
Haven't we been happy together?
Do you want to ruin it all over nothing?
Over nothing...
I hate her!
If she tries to split us up, I'll get her!
Enough!
Are you trying to make me mad?
Come here.
Look me in the eye.
I love you, only you.
Hear me?
-Are you sure?
-Of course.
Don't be silly!
We're going to be a huge hit.
Our act is great.
We're gonna make a lot of money.
I'll buy you that house in the country.
And if anyone talks about theatre,
I'll kick them out!
So you won't talk to her again?
-No.
-She's ugly.
And old!
She's 42!
The costume girl told me.
-42?
-And have you seen her hair?
It's not real.
It's a wig.
It's true, her dresser told me.
And that voice!
There's nothing more grating.
Hardly anyone knows her name.
Well, maybe in a few places...
I'm just telling you what I think.
And have you seen her legs?
They're awful!
You've got her all figured out!
-You won't talk to her again?
-No.
-Promise?
-Yes.
I know you.
You can be weak.
-Swear.
-Of course!
No, say "I swear."
I swear.
Happy now?
Get me a brandy, will you?
A big one.
-A big brandy?
-Yes.
Be right back.
A big brandy, please.
It's for my wife.
I don't want her to fall over.
Great, thanks.
Put it on my tab.
-How's the act?
-Good, we're on soon.
It's always the same thing.
Take this and get my handkerchief.
-Got my fan?
-Yes, ma'am.
-What's this piece?
-A popular Argentinean song.
-It's nice.
-Yes.
That's a costume I could wear.
It'd be a change from feathers.
They always cover me in them!
This is too long.
The audience will fall asleep!
Give it a minute, dear.
It just started.
Who's that woman?
-I don't like her!
-It's an original act, though.
It's not bad.
Maybe with another actress.
My handkerchief, Blanche!
She's still not back?
What could she be doing?
There you are!
Thank you.
Stay close, I'll need you.
-Did you close my door?
-Yes.
Did you lock it?
Fine, then.
I can't do it!
She won't stop talking!
What did you say?
I've had enough!
You should leave!
-Calm down.
-No, I won't calm down.
I heard her what she said about me.
-Enough!
-Let me go!
I don't like her either!
I'll take notes from the director.
Everyone else should shut up!
Let me go!
She's jealous!
-Enough!
-She's jealous!
Get out of here!
I don't want her in the show!
-But the act is...
-Fine, I'll take her role.
-Sure.
-You'll see the difference!
It's difficult.
That's the final word.
-What am I to you?
-Everything!
Cut the act or I'm taking her role.
So?
What do you want me to say?
Your wife is a problem.
-We couldn't practice.
-But what happened is a problem.
You can't cut our act.
It's sure to be a hit!
I'm not the only one in charge.
-Think about your losses.
-There won't be any.
-You'll get a severance.
-That's not what worries me.
After all these years, we finally got to Paris.
What can I say, André?
I feel for you, but there's nothing I can do.
Go talk to her.
I would if I were you.
-Think so?
-It's worth a try.
-Think it'll work?
-It's your only hope.
Fine, I'll try.
Oh...
Don't tell my wife.
You know how she can be.
-I'm counting on you.
-Understood.
Looking for something, sir?
Ms. Delys's dressing room.
End of the hall, then up the stairs.
-Legris!
-Yes?
-Leave the set for tomorrow.
-Very well.
Think I'm in for it with the girls?
Don't worry, it'll work out.
Sure, it always does.
One way or another.
Come here, ladies!
You're finished for tonight!
Be back here at noon tomorrow!
-Yes?
-Yvette.
We're waiting on you.
-I'm tired.
I'm going home.
-Without dinner?
Not tonight.
I'm going home.
-See you tomorrow.
-Goodnight.
You?
-Yes, me.
-How?
You already got out?
Already?
Guess the time flew for you.
I got out yesterday.
Why come here?
Anyone see you?
-Is that you, Blanche?
-Yes, ma'am.
-Don't come up.
You can go home.
-Fine, ma'am.
Goodnight.
Nice welcome after being gone 5 years.
Cut to the chase.
What do you want?
-A little money.
-I don't have any!
I'm sure I'm in trouble.
Hope they didn't cut our act.
Your act is really good.
-That's what made her mad.
-Exactly.
That awful woman is jealous!
I got it, Gaby.
Give her another so she stops.
I'm done, don't worry.
Thanks.
How's work, Mr. Bonneau?
Not great.
You always complain.
Look at that face.
You'd think he was at a funeral!
That's enough.
-Not making enough money?
-OK, OK.
-Look at these.
-Hardly brandy glasses!
More like thimbles!
-Want another?
-No, I'm done.
-I have to see what happened.
-It'll be fine.
-As long as they didn't cut it.
-They won't!
That woman could do anything.
-How much do we owe you?
-I got it.
-It's on me.
-No.
You always pay.
DON'T WAIT FOR ME.
GO STRAIGHT TO THE HOTEL.
I'LL BE BACK...
You're a good friend, you know.
There aren't many in our field.
That's why I can't stand women.
-See you tomorrow!
-See you!
So what'd they say?
It's going to work out.
She's not gonna get an apology.
Certainly not from me.
Absolutely not.
What's this?
-Where are you going?
-To see the boss.
-Why?
-He thinks our act needs work.
-What does that mean?
-I don't know.
Probably just a few cuts.
I'm having dinner with him.
You're lying.
You're seeing her!
-Come on!
-I heard you two earlier.
-You're going!
-Gaby!
You don't care about me or the act!
-That's ridiculous!
-I get it now!
You arranged for her to make that scene during our act.
You wanted me to get upset.
It was all planned!
I'm begging you.
Don't go, André.
Don't leave me alone.
I'm still upset about earlier.
-You've got the wrong idea.
-Please don't go, honey.
If you go, I don't want to ever see you again!
Be reasonable.
-I'm late, I have to go.
-She'd better watch out.
She doesn't know what I can do!
I'm going to talk about our contract!
You don't care about the contract!
I don't care!
I don't care who hears me!
She doesn't know what I'm capable of!
André!
André!
Come in!
I don't know, Mr. Larivière.
Have you seen the poster?
Because I have.
I needed a microscope to find my name!
That's awful, young man, just awful.
Say, Flamberger.
Do you remember the infamous parade in the last show?
That night, the boss said,
"Larivière, you don't even know how to climb stairs!"
Me!
I've lived on the 6th floor for 30 years.
Young people know nothing about theater.
Nothing.
I played the lead in all kinds of plays in Carcassonne.
Let me tell you one thing.
It'll be beneficial to you, young man.
When I was in "Léonard ou les Égoutiers,"
there was a chorus in act II.
Remember?
The famous chorus!
"Sewer workers are good men."
"No one can refute that."
That's what we sang back then.
It was at least as good as what they sing nowadays.
-Where's the manager?
-On his rounds.
What's my boss up to?
Everybody's gone at this hour.
It's always the same thing!
I like theater, but I'm fed up!
She's tough to please.
I get yelled at all the time.
Don't complain.
You have a good job!
Think so?
I'll wait until my Christmas bonus, then I'm quitting!
Young man, theater is a thing of the past.
So are actors.
Did you see me in "Les Oubliettes du Vieux Louvre"?
What a fond memory.
In "Le Crétin de la Montagne," I played the idiot, of course.
You should have seen the audience.
"Sire, I'm waiting for the ring."
"To do what, Bertrand?"
"To do what?"
"To die on the day the Emperor dies."
"They won't stain..."
"these tears."
If you'd only seen it, young man.
There isn't the same feeling anymore.
There isn't the same artistic satisfaction.
Think of the plays we did...
-Bonneau!
He's not here?
-He's on his rounds, sir.
Larivière, tell him the fire department is coming tomorrow.
-What's that?
-Help!
A killer's on the loose!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
What's wrong, Bonneau?
-A killer!
-Who?
Ms. Delys...
in her dressing room!
Call the police.
-Is she dead?
-Yes.
How awful!
-Go take a look!
-Yes, sir.
Let's go.
-Take the lead, Bonneau.
-No, I can't.
There are 6 of us!
Yvette Delys... muddled... molded...murdered!
It's terrible, just terrible!
She's in here.
There's blood!
Oh, I can't look!
-Is she dead?
-Call the police!
Looks like she defended herself.
-Did it just happen?
-The killer must still be here!
Was she strangled?
-Who's there?
-Don't say anything!
Oh, it's you, Flamberger.
OK.
Yes.
Get the doctor.
Yes.
-Was she strangled?
-No, there's a knife.
-Don't touch!
-I'm not!
I'm just looking.
-That knife...
-What about it?
It's Gaby's knife!
Yes, from her act.
-It does look like hers.
-Impossible.
-Don't touch!
-OK, OK!
-Hello.
-Is this 2237?
-What?
-Is this 2237?
-Yes.
-So, it's the theater?
Yes.
Is Ms. Delys still there?
No, she isn't.
-She's not home, either.
-Is this André?
Yes.
What?
We found Ms. Delys dead in her dressing room.
-What?
-She's dead.
She was stabbed.
By whom?
We don't know, looks like revenge.
-I can't believe it.
-Yes.
The knife looks like...
-Hello?
-Don't talk about it.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello, hello.
Get me the police station.
Gaby!
Who are you?
Let go!
No need to yell.
Let go!
Help!
André!
Let go!
Help!
Help!
-Help!
-Get her to police headquarters.
GABRIELLE DELANGE ACCUSED OF HOMICIDE
We shall proceed with the cross-examination.
I advise you to follow the proceedings closely and to listen carefully to the charges brought against you.
Remember, each of your answers will carry significant weight.
Your parents lived in Bordeaux and loved you very much.
They spent a considerable amount to ensure you had an excellent education.
In spite of that, you left home without any explanation at the age of 16.
My authoritarian father wanted me to marry a man I didn't love.
To escape your father, you saw fit to run away with some 1,100 francs.
That proves 2 things, Gabrielle Delange.
Firstly, from a very young age, you rebelled against discipline.
Secondly, you already lacked scruples.
I've always regretted leaving...
My father was inflexible.
I had to obey him or leave.
I tried to obey him, but the man I was to marry was an imposter.
I wanted to tell my parents, but my father refused to listen.
That's why I left, but the money was mine.
I'd been saving up since my childhood.
I'd like to inform the jury that the reasons given by the defendant are not true.
She, herself, would admit that her father did not believe her.
This proves that Ms. Delange was accustomed to lying from a young age and her father no longer trusted her.
I'd like the jury to take into account that this information about my client was taken from a few neighbors and should not be taken seriously.
Your Honor, would the defendant please remove her hat.
Let's move on to a later date in St. Étienne.
You met André Robert, with whom you now live.
You call him your husband, but you've never been married.
-No, your Honor.
-But you live together.
You're both dancers.
Let's skip over the years prior to your time in Paris.
You're currently preparing a pantomime act.
You wear a costume in it.
The costume includes a knife attached to your belt in a leather sheath, correct?
-Yes, your Honor.
-Is it also true that in the pantomime, you use the knife frequently?
And at the end of the act, you throw it with such precision that it pierces the chest of a dummy, which is supposed to represent your partner.
-Yes.
-Here are 2 established facts.
Please listen carefully.
On the night of September 14, rehearsals were underway at the Folies Montmartre for the winter show.
That night, you had a violent argument with the victim.
Shortly after, Ms. Delys was found dead in her dressing room, stabbed to death with your knife.
The weapon had been thrown at the victim with the same precision and accuracy as in your act.
Although gravely wounded by the knife that had pierced her, the victim tried to defend herself with a small revolver.
She shot one bullet at her assailant, later found in the paneling.
Yvette Delys was fatally stabbed and the killer got away, leaving your knife in the wound.
Gabrielle Delange, that killer was you.
It's not true!
It wasn't me!
It's a horrible accusation!
Why did you arm yourself with a knife before going to the victim's dressing room?
I wasn't armed with a knife, your Honor.
I had it on me when I left my dressing room.
It was part of my costume, but I didn't notice.
When I got to Ms. Delys's room, I didn't think about having it.
-You didn't think about it?
-No.
Yet, you threatened the victim with it during your interaction.
No, I didn't threaten her.
I'm going to have to contradict you.
A witness who was passing by during your conversation with Ms. Delys claimed he heard someone yell,
"Throw this knife!"
It's true, I threatened her, but only with words.
I swear, I never used my knife.
I'll explain.
I love my husband.
We're not married, but it's like we are.
We've been together so long.
We've had good days and bad days, but we're happy because we love each other.
I sensed this woman wanted to take him away, so I went to try to work things out.
I asked her what right she had to take him away from me, to shatter our existence.
I wanted her to promise to leave him alone, but she just laughed.
When I saw she was mocking me,
I lost my head.
I went towards her.
I might've made a gesture that she took as a threat.
But if I did, I didn't realize it.
I swear, I never threatened her with my knife.
Never!
How can you explain it, then?
When she screamed, I realized she was afraid of the knife.
So I threw it on the ground.
You've admitted you threatened the victim, but only with words.
What were those words?
I don't remember exactly.
I was beside myself.
You don't remember.
That defense isn't new and it won't get you anywhere.
It's not a defense, your Honor.
It's the truth expressed by someone incapable of lying.
Or a convenient method for avoiding a question.
That's a sly use of psychology to sway the jury.
No, I'll leave it to you to make up stories that tug at the heartstrings of gossips.
Please note that the prosecutor has called the jury "gossips."
The matter is closed.
I'll ask you for the last time to remember your words.
They were insults, whatever came into my head.
You don't always remember what you say in anger.
I knew my husband was at her place.
To scare her, I said I'd keep her from going there by force.
Once I said that, I stopped.
She said, "Are you crazy?
"Why would I stay here if your husband's at my place?
"Work it out for yourselves." Then she turned around.
I didn't know what to say.
I wasn't expecting indifference.
I didn't know how to answer.
I was upset, I didn't even have it in me to cry.
I thought I might faint.
So I left her alone and she slammed the door behind me.
You told investigators you couldn't remember what time you left the theater.
The building manager, Mr. Bonneau, claimed he saw you leave 10 minutes before the crime was discovered.
The crime was discovered at 4:05 AM.
So you must've left the theater at 3:55 AM.
That's impossible!
I left well before then.
He must have lied!
Why would he have lied?
Because it's impossible.
I saw the time at the Quai d'Orsay train station.
It was definitely 4 AM.
It's more than a 5 minute walk.
You remember that now?
Anyway, let's move on.
What were you doing at the Quai d'Orsay station at 4 AM?
I was completely distraught.
I didn't want to go back to an empty room without my husband, so I walked around.
Near the Quai d'Orsay station?
Yes, along the Seine.
Along the Seine?
I was going to jump in.
You were about to kill yourself by jumping into the river, yet you noticed the time?
Very impressive, ma'am.
It's the truth.
I was looking into the water when I noticed the clock's reflection.
It felt like someone was watching over me.
As I looked at it, the clock chimed 4:00.
So you immediately decided not to kill yourself?
Why did you change your mind?
I got scared.
You then went back to the hotel, where you were arrested.
That was about 5:30 AM.
What did you do in between?
I walked around, trying to calm down.
-Did you run into anyone?
-No, your Honor.
You walked around Paris for an hour and a half without running into anyone?
You know that type of defense...
WITNESSES FOR THE DEFENSE
AFTER AN INTENSE INTERROGATION OF THE DEFENDANT,
SEVERAL WITNESSES TESTIFIED, SPEAKING HIGHLY OF THE VICTIM.
THE FINAL WITNESSES WILL TESTIFY TODAY.
A VERDICT IS EXPECTED THIS EVENING.
I must defend the defendant's rights.
I firmly believe in my client's innocence.
It was never a question...
It's easy to be disdainful
-of the defense's rights!
-I'm respecting your rights.
-Only in words!
-In deed as well!
You only respect the form!
You can't claim for an instant...
Enough, Counselors.
It's been insinuated that the prosecutor has failed to respect the defendant's rights.
However, throughout this hearing, he has shown the utmost impartiality.
Your Honor, I commend the prosecutor for his impartiality.
The doctor has just described in detail how he believes the victim was struck with a large knife from 2 meters away.
The weapon was thrown with so much force that it caused a deadly wound to the thorax.
Dr. Louis, please look at my client.
Ms. Delange, please stand up.
I have a question for you.
You said the weapon was thrown with extreme force.
Given my client's physical stature, do you believe she's capable of throwing the weapon with such force?
-No, I do not.
-Doctor.
Would you agree that, with sufficient practice, anyone, including a woman, could attain such force, particularly if that person was very angry?
Yes, it's possible.
For the record, the prosecutor has claimed the crime could have been committed by anyone.
Provided they could throw a knife as skillfully as the defendant.
That isn't impossible.
Does the defendant have anything to add to this testimony?
Does the jury, prosecution or defense have any questions?
No, your Honor.
You're dismissed, doctor.
Call witness Georges Barreau.
Mr. Barreau, you testified earlier that as cashier at the Folies Montmartre, on the night of the crime, you brought the victim 20,000 f.
At her request, you brought that amount to her in her dressing room.
Can you tell us the exact time you were in her dressing room?
Approximately 3 AM.
When you left her dressing room at 3 AM, did you run into anyone?
Ms. Delange was on her way out.
She went right back to her room.
Did her attitude seem suspicious?
Perhaps.
I didn't pay attention.
Did you notice a knife in her hand?
-I didn't have it!
-I didn't notice.
Ms. Delange, when you entered the victim's dressing room, did you see the money the cashier had given her?
No, I wasn't paying attention.
The 20,000 f has never been found.
Mr. Barreau...
At the dress rehearsal, which involved a number of people, some of whom may have questionable characters, did anyone see you bring the money to the victim?
I put the money in my pocket and brought it to Ms. Delys, so no one could have seen me.
Your Honor, in the interest of getting to the truth,
I'd like to question Mr. Bonneau.
Call him in.
When the victim called you to send the cashier, what time was it?
Around 2:30 AM.
Are you sure?
Yes, sir, 2:30, maybe a bit earlier.
-It couldn't have been.
-Why not?
I was in the theater at 2:30, watching the rehearsal.
On my way to my office to get my hat, I noticed it was 3 AM.
That's when I got the call.
Mr. Bonneau, we have a witness claiming it was 3 AM.
It couldn't have been.
That's when I was serving Ms. Delange at the bar.
She had 3 brandies.
She was very upset and angry.
She was saying, "That woman is jealous.
"I don't know what I'll do to her."
You've already told us that.
You accused the defendant of a suspicious animosity.
However, one point has been contradicted by a witness whose honesty is above suspicion.
No more than his own!
He's also under oath.
I won't allow anyone to question his honesty!
Does the defendant have anything to add?
Does the jury, the defense or the prosecution have anything to add?
-No, your Honor.
-Call the next witness.
Larivière!
Larivière!
Your full name, age and occupation?
-Désiré Larivière, 74.
-Occupation?
Former lead actor in all genres.
Following that, a diction professor for 1 month, and, temporarily, assistant stage manager at the Folies Montmartre.
One has to make a living.
You live at 47 Trois-Couronnes.
You aren't a relative or employee of the defendant?
Raise your right hand.
Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
I swear, your Honor.
-Only "I swear."
-I swear.
Proceed.
"Beware, my son, of accusing the innocent.
"The gods, both fair and good, will look out for their defense.
"By uncovering the facts,
"judges and witnesses will discover the truth.
-"The gods..."
-Excuse me.
Are you reciting verse?
Exactly, your Honor.
It's in the second act...
You're not on stage.
Tell us what you know about the crime.
Where were you on September 15 at 3 AM?
Pardon?
Where were you when the crime was committed?
-Pardon?
-Address the jury.
Er...
On the night of...
Where was I?
That's a funny question.
On the night of...
Oh, I remember!
I was at the bar, having a drink with a friend,
Flamberger.
He's Alsatian, your Honor.
We were at the bar.
A drink from time to time takes the edge off.
It doesn't make you an alcoholic.
I was there with Flamberger.
He's also an artist, a great one, actually.
He hasn't been successful, but we're not all successful, your Honor.
Otherwise...
Please stick to the facts.
Yes, your Honor.
I understand.
At the time, I was telling him a story about my past.
So, obviously...
Er...
Let's finish this up!
Then what?
Then what?
That's it.
What do you mean?
-That's all.
-That's all?
Yes, your Honor.
That's all.
Oh, yeah!
I was having a drink with Flamberger.
We were having a drink.
Then, all of a sudden, we heard screams.
That's the truth, your Honor.
We heard noises in the night.
Screams!
Screams, I tell you!
So, everybody went to look.
But I, your Honor,
I stayed back alone.
-That's it.
-And?
And?
-That's all.
-That's all you know?
I swear.
Fine, take a seat.
Thank you.
No, thank you, your Honor.
Call the next witness.
Mr. Larivière...
The judge certainly looked the part.
André Robert!
André Robert!
Your full name, age and occupation?
André Robert, 30, artist.
Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
Raise your right hand and say, "I swear."
-I swear.
-Lower your hand.
I swore you in because you aren't legally married to the defendant.
We're aware of your situation.
Please don't let your feelings for her impede the truth.
Proceed with your testimony.
I have nothing to say, your Honor.
-I was...
-Address the jury.
I don't know what happened.
But I know she's innocent!
She couldn't have committed this crime.
I know her after 8 years together.
Stick to the facts directly related to the crime and, again, address the jury.
I'm sorry, it's upsetting to see her this way.
I don't know
I'd left the theater, but I know she's innocent.
We had an argument that night, a rather serious one, but it was my fault.
I know she gets jealous and I should've listened to her.
I hope she can forgive me.
It was my fault she was upset.
I'd like to repair things here.
Please forgive me.
I forgave you long ago.
This isn't your fault.
But if I'd told you the truth, if I hadn't...
Please tell us what you know.
Your Honor, she couldn't have done this!
That night, she tried to keep me from going.
If I'd listened, we'd have left together and you'd know she wasn't guilty.
You can't convict her without proof.
It wasn't me.
I didn't do it.
It wasn't me!
This testimony adds nothing.
His protests can't refute the mounting evidence.
I'd like to remind the jury how often the defense has endured unjustified attacks from the prosecution.
-My client...
-Your client is a great actress.
I'm sure some of her tears are real, but her exaggerated emotions are characteristic of her trade.
How dare you say that!
She's in tears and has claimed her innocence since her arrest.
She keeps saying she didn't do it.
How can you say such a thing?
Is her paleness acting too?
And her tears?
Her sobs?
Her weight loss?
Is that acting?
You can't mistake her sincerity!
Prosecutor, you're trying to sway this impartial jury to convict the defendant by trying to convince them all of this is acting!
Do you have anything to add?
Yes, I mentioned something during the investigation, but nothing's been done about it.
That night, I ran into a man hiding backstage.
Yes, you mentioned it during the investigation.
He was acting strange, like I'd caught him.
I asked him what he wanted.
He said Yvette Delys's room.
-So I directed him.
-And?
Why haven't they found this man?
No one else saw the man you claim to have met.
He was lurking about, looking worried he'd be caught.
What was he doing there?
Why was he hiding?
I'm sure he's the killer.
I've done all I can to find him.
I have people still looking for him.
Why go to Yvette Delys's room?
Why hide?
You've already asked these questions.
We couldn't find him.
But I saw him.
How do you know he's not the killer?
You're here to answer questions, not ask them, Mr. Robert.
A full investigation was done.
You've done your best to find this man.
However, he hasn't been found.
If he can't be found, he likely doesn't exist.
You're excused.
Take the defendant away.
Hearing adjourned.
-Will it be over tonight?
-It's likely.
There are a few more witnesses, but they've agreed to finish tonight.
Thanks.
It was a good show, very good, indeed.
However, it could've been better.
When we put on "Roger La Honte" in Nevers, there was a courtroom scene.
Of course, I played Noirville.
André!
I think we found him!
Nénette found him.
Come on!
-Where?
-I'll take you.
It's time!
-Is it him?
-Yes.
Come on!
Let's go!
Why are you looking at me like that?
It's him!
He's the killer!
No, I'm not!
I don't know what you're talking about.
-You don't?
-No.
Remember me from the theater on the night of the crime?
-It wasn't me!
-You're coming with us.
-Where?
-Court!
What for?
-You're the killer!
-No, I'm innocent!
She says she doesn't know, that she doesn't remember.
Regardless of what the defense says, this isn't about psychology.
That girl is a killer!
She killed out of cowardice.
She ran into the shadows, forgetting about the weapon, the weapon she'd thrown so forcefully, which penetrated so deeply, it killed the victim instantly.
The victim's death was swift and rapid.
She's not only a killer, she's also a thief!
Gentlemen of the jury, you're about to hear a defense argued by a lawyer who raised the pitch of this hearing.
He'll likely talk about passion over reason and blinding jealousy.
He may even allude to the specter of judicial error.
Don't let him instill doubt in you.
You've brought here a respect for justice and the strength of your opinion.
I ask you to resist sentimentality.
Remember, Ms. Delange is, and always has been, an actress.
Her claims of innocence, her tears and her lies are all an act to try to sway you.
Moreover, this woman didn't even come up with an alibi.
She's too smart not to think her lie would be discovered.
"It wasn't me.
I didn't do it.
I'm innocent."
Lies!
This woman is a liar!
She's tried to appear mysterious in an attempt to create doubt in your minds.
Don't fall into her trap.
Weigh the evidence and find her guilty, as she deserves by answering yes to the questions you're asked.
Justice must prevail.
The truth must come out.
Do not be trapped into feeling pity or mercy.
We live in a time when too many take justice into their own hands.
Don't confuse pity with weakness.
The killer is here.
A weak verdict on your part would mean a breach in the ramparts built to protect our society.
Your weakness would only encourage future crimes.
I've fulfilled my duties.
I ask that you do the same.
Now for the defense.
Your Honor...
Before giving my closing argument,
I'd like to call a new witness, of whom we were just made aware.
Sir, the hearing is over.
Yes, but the verdict isn't in, so the debate is still open.
His testimony may have a major impact for my client.
Prosecutor, do you object to hearing this new testimony?
No, I do not.
Call the witness.
Your full name, age and occupation?
Henri Capelle, 41.
Occupation?
None.
You're not a relative or employee of the defendant?
I didn't swear you in because you weren't on the witness list.
The jury will only use your testimony for informational purposes.
What do you know about the crime committed at the Folies Montmartre?
I don't know anything.
Where were you on the night of September 14?
-I was home.
-That's a lie, your Honor!
He's the man I saw backstage!
Remain quiet or I'll clear the room.
You said you were home.
Where do you live?
I live at 18 Goutte d'Or.
-But at that time...
-At that time?
When the crime was committed, I wasn't home.
You should be careful what you say.
You seem unaware of the serious allegations made against you.
You were seen in the theatre on the night of the crime.
-You appeared to be hiding.
-Yes.
I might as well spill it.
It'll do me good.
I went to the theatre that night to see Yvette Delys.
She was my wife.
-Your wife?
-Yes.
We were married 12 years ago.
She didn't want anyone to know because as a successful actress, it would hinder her from building her career, etc.
Anyway.
It was fine with me because she brought in a lot of money.
I didn't have anything to do with the crime, though.
If you're innocent, as you claim, in spite of being seen near the victim's dressing room and clearly being sought after, why didn't you go to the authorities on your own?
I can explain.
I know the justice system.
After 5 years in prison, you learn a thing or two.
I figured if I came forward...
Since I was seen in the area the night my wife died and I have a police record, and all that, they'd pin it on me for sure.
They wouldn't believe me and I'd be finished!
I'm not impressed with your opinion.
And you should watch your language.
Let's move on.
You claim you went to your wife for money.
-Did she give you any?
-Yes, 5,000 f.
The theater cashier claimed he gave her 20,000 f.
I'd asked for 20,000, but she only gave me 5,000.
I said it wasn't much and I'd be back soon.
So, the victim kept 15,000 f?
Yes, she put it on her vanity.
If I were dishonest, I could've swiped it all.
Did you see the manager when you came in?
No, he wasn't at his desk.
He wasn't at his desk?
Your Honor, I'd like to question the building manager.
Call Mr. Bonneau.
Did you ever leave your desk the night of the crime?
I watched a bit of the rehearsal.
You're in a position of trust.
You're supposed to guard the artist entrance.
You left to watch the show rehearsals?
I'm not impressed with how you handle your job.
You could be accused of being an accessory to the murder.
Me?
What do you have to say?
I don't know.
You asked so many questions.
I don't speak as well as you.
I didn't understand half of it.
-You didn't?
-No.
Then I'll make myself clearer.
Here's another question.
The witness here present, whom you didn't see come in.
-Did you see him leave?
-Yes.
Pardon?
-You saw me leave?
-Of course.
I was already back at my desk.
-You were at your desk?
-Yes.
I saw you when you left.
You're a liar!
How could you see me from your desk when I left through the public entrance?
How's that?
My wife didn't want anyone to see me.
She took me through the theater to the main entrance on the street.
How could you see me, then?
How can you explain that?
Perhaps I'm mistaken.
Where were you?
I may be mistaken.
Maybe I was on my rounds.
You discovered the crime on your rounds?
Yes, your Honor.
When I got to Ms. Delys's room, the door was ajar and the lights were on.
I waited a minute, but I didn't hear anything.
I thought she might've left with the lights on.
So, I knocked on the door and went in.
That's when I saw her with the knife on the floor.
She didn't move.
I got scared and ran to get the others.
-You said all that before.
-Excuse me, your Honor.
You said the lights were on when you reached the victim's room?
Yes, sir.
Then how could they be off when the driver went in?
What?
He claims he had to use the flashlight he had in his car.
I have another question.
You must've heard a gunshot on your rounds.
It's been established that the victim shot her assailant before being stabbed.
The bullet was found in the paneling.
-You didn't hear a gunshot?
-No, I didn't hear anything.
Really?
You were very close by.
I'm hard of hearing, sir.
It's not an important detail.
Your Honor, I'd like your permission to perform a reenactment of the crime.
This is a sketch of the victim's room.
I strongly object to this last-minute demonstration.
This isn't a theater, it's a French courtroom!
The defense is overstepping its bounds.
Prosecutor, you cannot restrict the defense's rights.
Your own rights may be restricted, but a lawyer's rights may not.
The average lawyer puts his energy into his argument, but it's in the hands of his adversary.
It's his right and I won't allow it to be compromised!
My client's freedom and, perhaps, her life are at stake.
I'm about to save her and have her charges dismissed.
She's not a criminal and I'll prove it.
Gentlemen of the jury, this is the scene,
the scene of the crime the witnesses testified about.
the scene only the killer knows about since he fled it.
He fled unseen and escaped punishment for his crime.
I'll present you with the scene right now.
I'll go back to the night of the crime.
I'm backstage at the theater, deserted at this time of night.
It's full of dark corners.
I'm walking behind Yvette Delys.
She's undressed, wearing only this kimono.
She's leading her husband, who she wants to hide, to the exit.
He escapes unseen.
Yvette Delys then heads back towards her dressing room.
She walks down the same dark hallways to her brightly lit dressing room, where she'd left the money, the 15,000 f we talked about earlier, foolishly left on her vanity.
The 15,000 f attracts one man's attention.
He sees the bills through her open door.
He's fascinated by and drawn to them.
Thinking he's alone, since he doesn't hear anything, he tiptoes his way in.
Holding his breath, he takes the money.
He wants to make a run for it, but he hears a noise.
It's the victim's footsteps heading towards the room.
What can he do?
He'll be caught!
He rushes into the back room, which doesn't have a door.
That's when his eyes fall on a knife.
This weapon, which the defendant foolishly tossed.
This weapon, left there, as if by evil design, was at his fingertips.
Yvette Delys suddenly comes back into the dressing room.
She walks into the back room, unaware of the danger.
Suddenly the lights go out.
In the darkness, she can't see anything.
She only hears her heart racing with fear.
A minute passes, then several more.
Then she hears footsteps.
He brushes past her as he runs to the door.
"Who's there?" she cries.
No answer.
She has a feeling that someone, perhaps armed, is hiding in the shadows.
So, she grabs her revolver.
Would you take this, please?
She points her ivory-handled revolver into the dark, in the direction of the noise she heard, and she shoots.
He's the killer!
I remember doing a court scene in a play in St. Amand back in 1876.
Yes, sir.
I was young and handsome then...

The Mt.
Kachikachi Baseball Tournament.
The raccoon dogs leading 5-4 against the rabbits.
Rabbits' time-out.
Don't let them hit.
Game resumed.
Next up, Tankichi is eager to bat.
I can do it!
Play ball!
A sign is given.
Strike one!
Hooray!
Strike two!
Good pitch!
That there...
Should be an easy hit.
Tell him...
Instruction is sent.
Code Round Belly, alright?
Got it.
Ever more eager,
Tankichi steps into the batter's box.
It's a hit!
Running to first base!
Hey!
Wrong direction!
Safe!
The crowd sings aloud... the "Belly Drum" song.
Hooray!
They're forming letters too!
Ouch!
Don't smash my head!
That hurt.
I know!
I know!
What?
Here comes the next batter up.
What?
Yep, it's over here!
Safe!
What was that!
Stealing a base like that!
This is the real "stolen base"!
The fans... madly cheer even louder.
Beat the rabbits!
Drum your belly!
You can do it!
Give us a hit!
Excitement fills the stadium.
That was close.
Finally here comes Tantaro, the mega-size player on the team.
Give us a homerun!
The rabbit crowd then starts... their cheer, "Smash 'Em."
Raccoon dogs use mud... for their boats and bats!
Show 'em!
Smash 'em!
Cream 'em!
This is it!
It's a hit!
A big one!
Homerun!
It's a homerun!
The ball flies... into a forest far away.
Tantaro takes his time.
So where did the ball go?
What could this be?
I'm a born rider!
STOP!
A huge frog appears.
The boss of this area.
That there...
What is it?
Don't know, sir!
Perhaps an egg.
A bird's egg.
An egg?
I see.
That's where it came from.
That's strange...
Have you seen a ball around?
Any idea?
Oh!
It could be In a stomach.
A what!
Hatch, hatch, hatch, hatch, hatch...
Let me take a look.
Maybe a chick?
It wasn't an egg.
I'm sorry.
Sorry for the confusion.
Get it out of me.
Not working.
What're you doing!
That's my tongue!
Let's ride on him.
What is this!
This here is the ball...
Or what remains of it.
No ball, no game.
But we were winning!
Too bad...!
We're out of balls.
It's a draw.
A muddy draw?
Muddy, muddy wherever I go!
The game ended in a draw.
And that is how the tournament ended.

Skeleton Shrimp and Spider Crabs
Skeleton shrimp are classified among crustaceans.
They are thread-like, about one centimetre long.
This passing shrimp shows the size of a skeleton shrimp.
They are mostly found among algae.
With the hooks on their legs they can cling to anything.
Ship wreckers on a raft.
A tiny starfish is given a rough time by furious skeleton shrimp.
They are real acrobats among the algae.
The head with its appendages.
The head carries big and small antennae.
In front of the mouth, there are two legs for chewing.
The hook on the leg.
Two small breathing appendages are fixed on each side of the body.
Bending in three is a typical posture of the skeleton shrimp.
The first pair of legs, on the hind part of the body, carries venomous hooks.
These venomous legs are very big among males.
Circulation in the legs and the body.
Notice the one way arrival and departure of blood cells.
The heart stretches along the skeleton shrimp's back.
The intestine is agitated by the movement of the cardiac blood vessels.
They can swim by fits of the whole body... or by sliding on the sand.
We're going to follow a running skeleton shrimp.
Here is a skeleton shrimp cleaning one of its legs.
They never stop curtsying.
At a given moment, two lamellae appear under the female's abdomen.
The eggs go down through these lamellae and are stirred by the incessant movement of the lamellae.
She hasn't lost her agility.
This movement of the lamellae bathes the eggs in constantly renewed water.
The skeleton shrimp's soliloquy.
An egg, shortly before hatching.
We can see the baby's movement, rolled up in the egg.
The small skeleton shrimp come out by sliding between the lamellae.
The baby skeleton shrimp already has the adult shape.
The lamellae, after the children have left.
Sincerely yours.
Spider crabs are related to crustaceans.
(However they present certain characteristics proper to spiders.)
Like the skeleton shrimp, they can be found among algae.
They have a tiny body which forks out in very long legs.
The body measures 5 millimetres and the legs 25 millimetres.
The head and its chelicerae
(horns at the front of the head).
We shall see certain organs pulsate.
Like all the organs, they fork out in the legs.
The body is in fact too small to contain the organs.
In a leg.
The legs have hooks;
this enables the spider crab to live in the same habitat as the skeleton shrimp.
With this magnification, the hook seems to be quite far.
The spider crabs swim with all their legs and walk like spiders.
The underwater landing of a spider crab.
The eggs are shaped inside the female's legs.
The organs which shape the eggs, are ramified in the legs, like all the organs.
Once the eggs are laid, they gather around two hooks on the male's abdomen.
These make him look as if he were carrying two life buoys.
When ready, all the little spider crabs hatch at the same time.
The baby spider crab calls to mind a charming human parasite.
A farmer cultivating the land, seen from behind.
The baby spider crab is very different from the adult.
As it grows, the body remains small, the legs stretch out, and the organs are forced to ramify into the legs.
Once freed of the eggs, the carrier hooks are very visible.
"La Danse macabre"
In Nazareth, the fishermen's beach there was a boat that was called...
The skipper was Uncle Falacha.
It was part of the marketing year ?
Dieu?
, married Aunt Aurella "islander".
Maria do Mar, the daughter of the skipper, who was known by the name of the boat.
Everyone knew "Peru" and his friend "Lacraio".
During the night I left nets at sea all by myself.
What do you guys say?
Manuel, the son of Aunt "islander", hasn't got it overboard yet.
That day, the skipper had been years ...
What a woman...
Let's get sober... then ?
That day, there was the most abundant fish stew.
At the same moment, at the house of aunt "islander"...
End of first part - Second part
One morning...
What a great wave in the sea!
Pushed up the cables of the frame!
Uncle Ilheu!
Uncle Ilheu!
The boat goes into the sea.
Before getting those lost nets, you stay here!
Don't go to the south!
Don't go!
Danger!
Don't go!
Don't go!
The skipper made a mistake...
The boat is not saved.
SHIPWRECK!
It's useless!
The boat is lost!
Only one man was saved!
End of second part - Third part
Murderer!
Murderer!
Murderer!
You wanted to lose the boat!
Virgin Mother of the lost ones!
Our Father, who art in heaven...
God will never forgive you!
Which brings to the skipper... when you respond (quizeram?
) it was late.
A new morning arrived and new lives to the sea.
End of third part - Fourth part
Her father died, Maria works in the field...
Selling at the market in Leiria.
Now is the time of (sortes?
)...
My son ... is my only support!
No need for endeavors ...
Go (escançada?
) that the law protects itself.
The son of "islander" goes back to the joy of the sea ...
The girls return from the market.
And if we were to "take a bath"...
End of fourth part - Fifth part
Swirls in the mouth, the most dangerous place of the coast ...
Distress!
Distress!
The sea is rough and the tide (vasa?
)...
Maria do Mar!
Saved!
The next morning, everyone knew that the son of "islander" had saved Maria do Mar.
Damn people, they want to entangle my son, as he lost his father.
It were your words that killed my man!
By order of "islander", the (Patareca?
), who was a midwife and knew some witchcraft...
? "salt" at the door of the skipper.
?
(google-translate gives gibberish)
At my door ... already impudence!
End of fifth part
How can I thank you, if we can't talk?
They ask to beat up the mothers, for the desire, that the children...
(this can't be right...?
)
One day she came back from the market...
Are you thirsty?
Do you want some grapes?
Well yes, lets see...
The source had no water...
I didn't thank you yet...
When I jumped into the water, I didn't know it was you ...
If you'd have known, would you have left me to die?
No.
There is a lot to look at you and never get to talk!
We really can't talk...
If you ?
...
They began to meet every afternoon.
Give me ?
...
mothers to sound and they this!

Then the feasts came...
End of sixth part - Seventh part
It was no secret to anyone...
They combined godparents (?

I knew you would come...
It is my wife...
She's the daughter of the man who killed your father!
Because she's here, I'm leaving.
End of seventh part
Leave!
And both doors closed to them.
The day came that had also "your home".
The sea ... gave daily bread.
Ninth part
And one day, back to work...
It's a girl!
Let her rest!
And the months passed...
Naughty dog!
Naughty dog!
Take care of her granddaughter, because the mother is not at home.
I don't have daughters, nor grandchildren!
Bring it where you want to...
to my house, never!
At that moment the burial of another of the same age...

Your daughter...
She wasn't bitten!
And back in the crib, it was a miracle.

You can start with 100 eggs, and by saving the pullets... at the end of the year you'll have 10,000 eggs.
- Yeah?
Listen.
Get out and fix that.

Friends, you wouldn't "tink" to look at me now that I once was as wicked as you.
But, yea, verily, there's no sinner among you what I can't call "brudder."
You know how I got lost in crime and sin?
Bad company.
But I found the error of my ways.
I found that crime don't pay.
Now I'm happy in the light and love the whole world.
- [Drum Banging] - [All] Praise be!
Praise be!
Yeah, even the-the depraved wretch what led me into sin... even him I love and forgive.
And remember, "brudders," crime don't pay.
[Horn Honks]
No, sir.
Crime don't pay.
And verily, I say to you... even the depraved wr- louse... what led me into sin... even him I love and forgive.
And there is a blow of vengeance coming what- on all sinners what knows no mercy.
There is retribution for all.

- Look at that pan!
[Jeering Continues]
Say, is there a piccolo player in the crowd?
Why, no, sir.
But I can play a saxophone.
So that's what you're in for.
For three months, I been tryin' to get a piccolo player, and all they send up is saxophones.
Just a lot of punks.
That's all.
[Man] Oh, noo that's a shame.
What'd you do, boy, rob your mama's bank?
Poor kids.
What do you think of that?
- Ain't that a dirty shame?
- Get the pan on this guy.
[Men Jeering]
I been in this jail 40 years... and the saps they send up here gets worse and worse.
It's gettin' to be a day nursery.
They wouldn't even allow those kind of guys in here in my time.
How'd they keep 'em out?
Blackball 'em?
- You know what they'd have called Big Pete in my day?

Yes, I'm here.
And you're here too, where you belong.
You got me all wrong, kid.
I lost more money on that horse than you did.
Did you, Jessell?
Did you lose your position and money and friends?
And mother?
She died at my trial.
You killed her.
- If it hadn't been for you-
- Shut up, you little soine.
- You were a thief long before I knew you.
- That's a lie!
Take it back!
Cut it out!
Go on.

Don't do that.
Come on.
Don't take it so hard.
I can't help it.
How did your family feel?
Well, they don't know.
I changed my name.
They think I'm in China.

- Well, I got friends out there.
They forward my letters home and cable my folks once a month.

Go on and get over there then.
Pop'll plaster you with kisses.
Hurry up.
And this is the men's yard.
Aren't you afraid here with all these dreadful characters?
Oh, dear, no.
They're just like little children to me.
In fact, to all the welfare workers.
Watch it.
Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Massey?
- How do you do?
- So jolly to see you again.
Uh, I missed you terribly last Thursday.

Oh.
Well, then, you worked with someone?
- A broker.
- Did you know what you were doing?
- Of course.
- Well, then, ohy?
It was fun!
I always wanted to travel.
You know, we never hit the same town twice.
Oh, you can't understand.
Oh, yes, I do.
I've felt the same way.
- I was headed for China.
- China?
- Gee, I'd love that.
- Gee, you know... we had jobs out there- three of us boys and, well, then this came up.
And you threw that over to work here?
No, you don't understand.
I don't work here.
I belong here.
- A convict?
- Yes.
But we call ourselves inmates.
- Gee, that's tough.
You don't look it.
- Well, neither do you.
Well, tell me, uh, what- what did you do?
Afight, just before the boat sailed.
- The other boy-
- What a rotten break.
[Clears Throat] Married?
No.
Engaged?
- Say, is that on the card?
- Oh, no.
- [Typing]
- What are you in for?
Shoplifting.
I was framed!
Sure.
We all was framed.
- What's yours?
- Spittin' in a river.
Gee, I didn't know they could pinch you for that.
Why, you told Mrs. Massey it was for winking' at a cop.
- For not winking' at a cop.
- Terrible creature!
Well, at least she don't scare 'em to death with blackmail.
Is it necessary that I wait in here with these other persons?
Cut the ritz!
We was all arrested and here we are, in the "cansky."
- Who's she?
- Edith La Verne.
- I don't see what men see in her.
- Oh, is that the love thief?
- The extortionist.
- Extortionist?
Honey, was you in the circus?
- [Giggling]
- I'm so sorry for them.
Really, I [Typing Stops]
- And these are the women!
Come, girls.
- Yes, sir.
- [Chattering]
Say, there's nobody but ladies allowed in here.
So I see.
We want to see the warden a minute.
[Women] St. Louis!
- [Chattering]
- Okay, boys.
Hey, buddy, buddy, where's the warden?
Oh, you got company.
- Not a bad jail.
- [Laughs]
- Hey, hey, what's the idea?
- Hello, Warden.
How are you?
Well, St. Louis, glad to have you with us.
Hello, Curly.
Say, listen, Warden.
I want to make a little bargain with you.
You know, I thought you looked a little bit worried out there in the yard.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you know, thinkin' that I might leave here unexpectedly.
- [Chuckles]
- I wanna tell you somethin'.
I'm on the square with this.
I shoot straight, see?
- When I decide to go, I give fair warning.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
How's that?
- That's fair.
- Okay, Warden.
That's a bargain.
- Show him to his cell.
Oh.
Oh, now, please, please.
Wait a minute.
You know, Warden, about this cell business-
- Sorry, I haven't any cigars.
- Thanks, I don't use 'em anyway.
About this cell business, Warden, if you don't mind, I don't like to sleep too high up.
- No?
- No.
And, if you don't mind, I'd like a nice airy cell, you know... plenty of windows, and a nice southern exposure.
- Southern exposure?
- Yeah, if you don't mind.
- I'd like a double bed.
And running water.
- Sure.
And I'd like- Say, I'm not boring you, am I?
No, no.
Go on.
Outta here!
Okay, Warden.
See you at supper.
Beans again, I suppose.
Southern exposure.
Running water.
Not too high up.
Sunshine.
- Say, if I had a cell like that, I'd sleep in it myself.
- [Laughs]
[Bell Rings]
Don't forget to lock that.
A lot of new guys come in here today.
- Letters from home?
- Yeah.
Yeah, pretty regular.
Now, look here.
Here's a picture of my mother here.
And here's my kid sister Frances over here.
- Let's see it, Steve, will you?
- Sure.
Too skinny.
I don't like 'em so skinny.
- I like legs.
- What?
Limbs.
When I left home, she was a kid on roller skates.
- Now she's off to college.
- College?
- Yeah.
- Gee, your folks must be swell.
And look at that house!
You know, it makes me real sick to look at a house like that.
- [Chuckles] Why?
- Why?
'Cause I could've had a house like that.
Easiest thing in the world.
Only mine would've had a tower on it with my chicken farm...
- if it wasn't for that big baboon.
- What baboon?
- He come in here today.
- He means St. Louis.
And you shut up about him.
He's the greatest ballplayer you ever saw.
Oh, how that guy can pitch.
Well, ballplayer or no ballplayer, he'd better stay out of my way... 'cause if I ever lay my hands on that guy, I'll croak him.
I never know how they're gonna turn out.
[Chattering]
[Cheering]
- [Punch Lands] - [Groans]
You're a fine guy, you are.
Leave me flat in the middle of the road.
- You callin' me a double-crosser?
- Yeah!
- You think I'd double-cross a pal?
- Didn't you?
- I thought there was a rumble seat.
- There was no rumble seat!
- That kind of car don't have a rumble seat.
- Keep quiet!
- You're not gonna let-
- All right, maybe there was a rumble seat on the car.
- Look out for his arm, will you?
- That's the way, boys.
Don't fight.
- Don't let 'em fight, Pop.
- I won't let 'em.
- Steve's my name.
- How are you?
Glad to know you, kid.
Glad to know you too.
What do you say we turn in, boys?
- I think you're up there.
- Me?
[No Audible Dialogue]
Say, you wouldn't let a pitcher climb way up there, would you?
- He might strain his arm.
- I've gotta throw too, ain't I?
You throw higher than him.
You have to throw way down to second base.
I ain't gonna let that guy put anything else over on me.
- I'm gettin' smart!
- What do you mean, put something over on you?
- Wait a minute.
- [Voices Overlapping]
- Wait a minute.
- I'm not dumb.
I'm settlin' this thing without any fighting.
Think of a number from one to 10.
- One to 10?
- Yeah.
- Seven.
- That's it.
You sleep in the lower one.
- Get on up there.
- That's fair enough, ain't it?
Long as I lost on the level, it's okay.
[Bell Rings]
- ?
[Man Singing] - ?
[Guitar Strumming]
Say, on second thought, I remember.
- There was a rumble seat on that car, all right.
- [Pop] Oh, shut up!

[Sobbing]
Knock it off, Freda.
Try and get some sleep.
[Sobbing Continues]

[Bell Rings]

[Guards] All out!
Attention.
Forward.
March!
- [Chattering]
- Well, how are you today, Genesis?
- How is y'all, Mrs. Massey?
- [No Audible Dialogue]
Well, Judy, quite an honor it seems to me to be selected to instruct the warden's daughter.
Of course, it's quite against my better judgment... but, uh, I hope it'll turn out all right.
Thank you, Mrs. Massey.
[Woman] Too and too is four.
Four and four is eight.
- Sour grapes, kid.
Sour grapes.
- Mrs. Reilly... can Judy and I go in the yard and take a walk?
- Surely, dear.
Go right along.
- Thank you.
Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Massey?
- What a beautiful apple.
- Strange.
Such good-looking girls, aren't them?
- Not a homely one among them.
- [All] Thank you, Mrs. Massey.
Years ago, when I started doing welfare work, it was quite the reverse.
Well, in those days women wore long skirts.
The only ones that were acquitted... were the ones smart enough to cross their legs during the trial.
- What a peculiar psychology.
Have an apple, dear.
- Oh, thank you, Mrs. Massey.
- And I have a magazine for you, my dear.
- Thank you, Mrs. Massey.
And here's the latest style magazine for you.
Girls, isn't this jolly?
Dewey's won the Battle of Manila.
- I oughta-
- Why don't you leave me alone?
I haven't done anything to you.
- What a jam!
- [Laughs]
[Steve] Let 'im alone!
- What do you mean let him alone?
- I said let him alone.
Scram, kid.
What are you gonna do?
Make a favorite of that punk around here?
- Keep your hands off him.
- Say, who are you to tell me to keep my hands off anybody?
What's the matter, Steve?
What's all the trouble?
Pop and I found this big lug, and he give me an argument.
He thinks everybody's scared of him.
- Sure, everybody's scared of me.
- Everybody's scared, are they?
[Groans]
You don't wanna bother with them guys.
It's a waste of breath.
I know, but look out for your arm.
Look out for your arm.
- Hey, the "ame-day" is waitin' at the "ate-gay." - [Together] Thanks.
Don't mention it.
Hey, Steve.
I wouldn't go down there.
Keep away from that girl.
Gettin' pretty near your parole.
I wouldn't take any chances.
Yeah, listen, kid.
He's right about that.
You do what Pop says, and you'll never go wrong.
- I'll go.
- Hey-
Hey, some guy hit a great big lug out there right on the button.
Hey, buddy, I'm sorry.
I butted into something.
I didn't know.
She don't want to see me.
She wants to see you.
- Me?
- Yeah.
I didn't know that you two were fond of each other.
Well, gee, I don't know how fond she is of me... but I think she's a fine girl.
- Well, ain't you never said anything to her?
- No, I haven't had a chance.
You know what the rules are.
Oh, we waved a couple of times from the window.
Well, you come on over.
I'd like to have you meet her.
Yeah, but listen, if she's caught talkin' to me-
Don't let that worry you.
I'll take care of all that.
Hey, lug.
Come here.
No, he means you.
Say, who do you think you are, ordering me around?
What do you want?
?
Judy's got a boyfriend Judy's got a-?
- Jean-
- Judy, there's a couple of fellas in reception to see you.
I got the pass right here.
[No Audible Dialogue]
Jean, come over here.
Your Uncle Danny wants to tell you a fairy story.
Aw, Danny.
Why does a chicken cross the street?
To get on the other side.
Heard you were being paroled in a few days.
Yes, I am.
I just wanted to say good-bye to you before you left and... thank you for being so sweet to me that day in the office.
Well, that's all right.
I've
- I've been trying to get to see you too... because, well, I
- I have a lot of things I want to talk to you about.
Remember that first day in the office when I asked you if you were engaged?
Yes, and I said, "Is that on the card?"
Yeah.
Well it- You know it wasn't.
I wanted to know because-
Well, are you engaged?
No, Steve, I'm not.
Are you?
No, I'm not.
Oh, but I'd like to be... to you.
Now, look out for this one, Jean.
This is a hard one.
Why does the president of the United States wear a high silk hat?
To keep his head warm.
I'm on the level too, Steve.
But I guess it- it can't be.
Why not?
Well, I've heard all about your home and your family and-
- Well, I'm-I'm just-
- Well, wait a minute.
That's just storybook stuff about the rich boy and the poor girl not being able to marry.
Doesn't count here at all.
When we get outta here, we're just gonna be a couple of ex-convicts... and that's not storybook stuff.
We got to start all over, bottom of the ladder.
And I- I'd like for us to start together.
Well, that is, if- if you're fond enough of me.
I am fond of you, Steve.
I'm more than fond of you.
If there was five birds in a tree, and St. Louis and I shot one of the birds... how many of the birds would be left in the tree?
None, because they'd all fly away.
Jean, you ain't been reading a book, have you?
- No.
- Can't understand it.
- I'll wave you an answer tonight.
- Beat it, kid.
- Judy, that isn't the man you-
- Judy, tell 'im you're not at home.
- [Chattering]
- Fellas, Miss Fields.
- [Chattering]
- Fellas, Miss Fields.
Two minutes.
Well, darling, here I am.
Just three months too late, Frosby, and never mind the "darling."
- But, Judy-
- I didn't come in here because I wanted to see you.
I came in here because I wanted to tell you what a dirty rat you are.
- You don't understand-
- I do understand now.
I thought your business was a little shady... but I didn't know it was gonna land me in jail.
- Well, it's finished.
I'm paying for it.
- What could I do?
What could you do?
You could have stayed and faced it out... not run away like a coward and leave me to take the rap.
Listen, Judy.
I've got friends and influence, and I've got some dough left.
- I can get you out, and oe can go aoay.
- We?
We can't do anything.
I'm through olth you and all your kind.
Noo, listen.
There's a fine, clean kid inside, and he's stuck on me.
And I'm crazy about him.
He gets outta here in a week.
He's gonna wait for me.
We're gonna start together at the bottom of the ladder-
Steve and I.
- Steve.
- Yes, that's the name of the kid that's waitin' in there for me.
He's waitin' in there now for my answer.
Okay, Judy.
Time's up!
Genny, be sure this gets to him.
Don't forget.
[Chattering]
And Genesis, poor lamb.
[Crying] Oh, Miss Massey.
Miss Massey.
You is such a good woman.
- And I's such a bad woman.
- No, Genny.
If I'd only met you when I was a little child...
I'd have been in my chariot... on my way to glory.
- There, there.
- Oh, Genny.
You mustn't cry like that.
Everything's gonna be all right.
- [Chattering]
- Don't cry.
That's two chocolate bars and an apple you owes me now.
- What's goin' on?
- Signal.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, from the women's quarters.
- Oh, is that how they do it?
- Sure.
Didn't you know that?
With all the cans you've been in.
Yeah, but I never stayed in one long enough to find those things out.
- What does it say?
- Wait a minute.
Message... gate.
- [Bell Rings]
- Good day, boys.
Mrs. Massey, look at your shoes!
All dusty again.
Imagine that.
Why, boys, every time I come through that gate, you clean off my shoes.
- That's all right, Mrs. Massey.
It's a pleasure.
- Not at all.
- Good-bye, boys.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Did you get it?
- For Steve.
Ah, none of them bimbos ever write me.
No sex appeal, my boy.
No sex appeal.
- Where's Steve?
- Why?
- I got a kite for him.
- I'll take it.
- You'll take it?
- I'm in on this.
Oh.
Hey, don't look over my shoulder when I'm reading Steve's mail.
This is from a lady.
Hey, Steve.
Come here a minute, will ya?
- Congratulations, Steve.
- For what?
Well, you're e- Uh, I got a little note here for you.
[Laughs] I'm engaged.
- [All] No!
- Yeah.
- Judy.
- [All] No!
Yeah.
Hey, you fellas- You didn't read this, did you?
[All] Nah.
Four times six- 25.
- No, dear.
It's 24.
- [Warden] Hello, Judy.
- Hoo's the youngster getting on?
- Just fine, Warden.
That's great.
[Man] 1136 oants to see you, boss.
- I'm busy.
- It's Steve.
He oants to say good-bye.
Oh, sure.
Show him in.
Good luck to you, my boy.
Thanks, Warden.
I, uh, I know it's against the rules... but could I give you a message for a girl here?
A prisoner?
You see, we're, well- We're engaged.
I want her to know that I'm gonna work hard for her... and make something of myself so that when she's free-
Just you wait a moment.
Wait till I get a pencil and write that message down.
- Here's a pencil, Daddy.
- All right, bring it to me.
How am I going to get it unless you bring it to me?
- I'll write every week.
- I won't write at all.
Your family mustn't see letters with this postmark.
They mustn't know.
Don't worry.
I'll stick it out.
It's only five months.
You won't forget?
Huh?
Oh-Oh, yes.
I found a pencil.
Now, what was that message?
Well, what I wanted to say was, "Thanks."
So long, Jean.
Four times eight- 43.
- He's gone.
- Four times nine-
- Bye-bye.
- [Men Calling Good-byes]
- [Man] Don't come back!
- I'll do that.
Take care of yourself, kid.
I'm gonna miss you.
- Look out for the kids.
- You bet I will, Steve.
- [All] Bye!

Well, Stephen!
Why, I'm glad to see you.
Thank you very much, Mr. Sterling.
I'm glad to be home.
Well, good-bye.
Hope you've enjoyed the service.
- Yes, we have.
- Hope to see you next Sunday.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, girls.
Good-bye.
Glad to see you.
- Why, hello, Steve.
- Hello.
- How's China?
- Oh, fine.
Thought you'd be wearing a pigtail.
You going back there?
No.
Not till I've been around home for a while.
No, he's going home a while and get some of Mother's good cooking.
How do you do, sir?
You're a stranger here, aren't you?
- Yes.
- I'm glad to see you at our service.
Thank you very much.
Most delightfully edifying.
- My name is Frosby.
- I'm Reverend Sterling.
Delighted to meet you, I'm sure.
- Oh, isn't that Stephen-
- Jordan.
Do you know him?
No, I'm not acquainted with him personally, but I know a very dear friend of his.
- I should be delighted to introduce you.
- Most gracious of you.
Mr. Jordan, will you allow me to present Mr. Frosby?
- How do you do, Mr. Frosby?
- This is her son, Stephen.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
My sister, Cynthia.
- How do you do?
- Ma'am.
I'm very, very pleased to meet theJordan family.
In fact, I might say I was most anxious.
- Really?
- Indeed.
Your son and I happen to have a mutual acquaintance.
- Yes?
- A Miss Fields.
A Miss Judith Fields.
- She was formerly in my employ.
- [Sterling] Really?
How interesting.
Perhaps you'd come and have supper with us tonight.
- Mother, I-
- It's all right, dear.
Sophie always has enough for a dozen.
- You'll come, won't you?
- Thank you very much.
- Good-bye, Mr. Sterling.
- Good-bye.
- Supper is at 6:00.
- I shall be there most promptly.
?
[Chorus Continues]
See you this evening.
Oh, I'm going to open up a branch office here.
Of course, I shall miss Judy.
She was a most valuable assistant.
But as you know everyone in town... you may be able to take her position.
?
[Chorus Continues]
[Man] Don't forget your ABC's, boys.
Hiya, lug.
What are you doing in there?
- We're takin' intelligence tests.
- Thought we was trying out for the show.
Hey, you're in the wrong line.
Get over in front of the welfare building.
Any of you guys that's trying out for the show.
You stick here.
You're gonna take a test.
You better take that intelligence test, boy.
You'll need it.
- Hey, Happy.
- Yeah?
- Gimme the works here, will you?
- Right.
Come on, come on.
Get a little pep into it.
What's the matter?
- What's the matter with you?
You stiff?
- St. Louis.
Keep your back turned, kid.
- Heard from Steve?
- No.
I have.
He's in a jam.
- How?
- You know Frosby?
- He's the guy you took the rap for, isn't he?
- Yeah.
He followed Steve to New England.
He's trying to use him.
- Blackmail, huh?
- The old stock racket.
- He threatened to-
- Yeah, yeah.
I know.
He's gonna tell the folks that Steve was in the stir, huh?
- What'll I do?
- You don't do nothin', kid.
Just leave it to me.
- Say, listen, Judy.
- Yeah?
- Are you really stuck on Steve?
- Yeah.
There's, uh, no chance for a guy to muscle in there, is there?
I'm on the level.
- I really love him.
- Okay, baby.
What does m-o-r-o-n spell?
Why-Why, that spells moron.
I passed, 100%.
- Hey, lug, you oas never in Neo England, oere you?
- No.
Well, you're goin' now.

[Applause]
Hello, fellas.
As you know, we're gathered here tonight for our annual entertainment... which is sponsored by our good friend, Mrs. Massey.
[Applause]
Also, we have as our honored guests... a number of people from the outside, which we take great pleasure in welcoming.
[Applause]
And now, ladies and gentlemen...
I take great pleasure in introducing our master of ceremonies-
One who is a master of ceremonies, one who has acted in a similar capacity... in a great many institutions of this kind... both in this country and abroad... and one whom we hope to have with us for many, many years to come.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I take great pleasure in introducing our master of ceremonies...
HonestJohn Jessup!
[Applause]
Mr. Warden.
Ladies... and gentlemen.
I can scarcely find the words to express my gratitude... in having being selected as master of ceremony for this delightful performance.
It is a very unusual compliment.
And now, with your kind permission...
I take infinite pleasure in presenting that ever-popular team...
Black and Blue.
[Cheering]
?
[Fanfare]
Come on there, Blue.
Let me ask you somethin' now.
You owe me some money, and what I wanna know is...
- when is you gonna pay me my money?
- Why, I pay you when you alone.
- When I'm alone?
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm alone now.
- No, you ain't.
I'm here.
[Cheering, Laughing]
- What is that thing you got there?
- That's my bazooka.
- But-
- Musical instrument.
Bazooka?
You don't mean to tell me you get music outta that.
- Sure, I do.
- Let me see this thing.
- [Clangs] - [Laughter]
That ain't nothin' but an old piece of gas pipe.
- Yeah, but I makes my livin' with that piece of gas pipe.
- [Laughs]
Yeah, but I play good music on this thing.
Let me hear you play something on it.
I'm just gonna play the "St. Louis Blues" on this thing... in honor of St. Louis.
- I'll be seeing you.
- Go ahead, mister.
Will you play it for me?

Come on, kid.
Knock 'em in the aisles.
You're a cinch.
- They're a pushover.

Go on out and look 'em in the eye and sing, kid.

And I gave my word toJudy.
And we're goin' to New England, and we're goin' tonight.
I can't go to New England, not tonight.
I'm in the finale.
- [Man] Oh, ohat's the use, St. Louis?
- Say, listen.
If you don't do like I tell you, it's gonna be your finale.
All right, I'll go.
What's that got to do with the act?
- It's part of my plan, you sap.
- Oh.
- What do I do when I get on the stage?
- You just stand there.
- Don't I sing or dance or do nothin'?
- Yeah.
You do nothin'.
I'm gettin' smart.
There's somethin' screwy about this.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, our next act will hardly need an introduction.
Allow me to present St. Louis and Company.
[Cheering]
Thanks very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, they've asked me to do my little bit for the entertainment tonight.
I can't sing, and I can't dance.
But I'll tell you what I will do.
I'll do an act that I used to do when I was a little kid and ran away with the circus.
This is a knife-throwing act, and I use a human target.
And the gentleman that's kindly consented to act as my target tonight... is none other than my old partner and pal, Dannemora Dan.
?
[Orchestral]
Right over there, Danny.
Right over there.
Listen, you guys wanna be quiet out there.
I gotta have absolute quiet.
Are all the lights in this theater controlled from that switchboard right there?
- [Man] That's right, sir.
- Thanks very much.
- Throw a little more light on Danny's head.
- [Man] All right, sir.
Listen, you wanna remember that I haven't done this act for a long time.
I'm liable to make a few slips.
You've got to overlook that.
I'll do my best though to go through the act without any serious injury.
Now, Danny, Danny-

- Yeah.
[Engine Puffing]
[Whistle Bloos]
Frosby.
You'd tell everybody that I was an ex-convict.
- But now that you've started to swindle my mother-
- Swindle?
She told me all about you.
She told me about every crooked deal you ever pulled.
- Well, what do you want me to do?
- I want you to get out of town.
Well, I won't get out of town.
And I'll tell your mother that you weren't in China- that you were in jail.
- An ex-convict!
- You'd do that?
Well, you won't have to, because I'll tell her myself.
- Now, listen, you little jailbird-
- All right, I am a jailbird!
But in jail, I learned how to handle crooks like you!
You've been threatening me!
Now, I'll threaten you!
If you don't get out of this town by tonight, I'll kill you!
We're not intruding, are we?
Oh, no, not at all, gentlemen.
Would you sit down?
Our business can wait.
Glad to know you, Mr. Jones.
- Well, ohat can I do for you?
- I wanted to have a little business talk with ya.
Well, you'll have to make it pretty short, because he's leaving town.
- That's too bad.
I'll see you when you come back.
- He won't be back.
Oh.
Well, that's- that's tough.
Oh, say, by the way, which is the best hotel in town?
Well, there isn't any best.
They're all terrible.
But I'd like very much to have you stay at my house.
Oh, no.
I don't wanna put you to all that trouble.
[Slams Door]
Why, it won't be any trouble at all.
Really, I'd like to have you meet my mother and my sister.
Give you a nice room, and put him in the garage.
- Swell.
- And I know how you traveling men... like to get a good home-cooked meal.
Ah, boy, now you're talkin'.
Say, I haven't had a home-cooked meal in year-
Uh, it's been quite some time now.
Okay, then.
Suppose we go right over?
Fine and dandy.
Come along there, brains.
There are millions to be made in this stock.
Wrap that up and save it for me.
I'll be back later.
[Steve] Frosby, be doon at the train tonight to make sure you don't miss it.
- Bye-bye.
- Good-bye.
[Slams]
- Say, listen, Frosby, what are you trying to do?
- Huh?
Those two guns from New York- What about them?
I never saw them before.
- Say, have you got some new game you're not gonna cut us in?
- Now, listen, cutie.
- As long as you're as pretty as you are-
- Oh!
Listen, if you even try to double-cross us... you know what will happen to you.
Aw, shut up!
Get out of my way!
I'm busy.
Come on in, fellas.
- Oh.
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, dear.
- Say, listen, Mother...
I brought a couple of friends home to spend the weekend with me.
- You don't mind, do you?
- Oh, no, of course not.
Bring them right in.
All right.
Come on in, boys.
Mother, I want you to meet Mr. -
- Jones.
- Do you belong to the Salem Joneses or New Bedford Joneses?
Well, I'll tell you, ma'am, I come from New York State.
Yes, you see, and this is Mr. -
- Dannemora.
- Oh.
- Say, where's baby?
- Danny Mora.
I think she's upstairs.
Hello, Sis.
Sis, I want you to meet a couple of friends of mine.
This is my sister.
This is Mr. Jones and Mr. Mora.
- How do you do?
How do you do?
- Thank you.
Now, come right in, children, and make yourselves perfectly at home.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thanks.
- You sit here, will you?
- Thank you very much.
I'll take your hat.
And I'll take your hat.
You can sit right here.
I hope you'll make yourselves perfectly at home.
And you may smoke if you like.
Steve smokes.
I caught him once smoking corn silk when he was a little boy.
Gee, Steve, that was wrong.
Well, anyway, he's grown up to be a fine young boy.
I'll help Sophie get supper.
- Could I help you, ma'am?
- Oh, no, thank you, dear.
Sophie's here.
Gee, Steve, this is great.
This is swell.
Boy, your mother and- This is great.
- [Coughs]
- Do you like our home?
Sure.
And your mother's nice.
Pretty.
Who's his nobs here, your father?
Oh, no.
That's Abraham Lincoln.
Oh.
Is that him?
I know.
The father of this country.
Come along, children.
Our dinner is served.
Now, let me see.
How am I going to seat you?
Mr. Sterling dines with us about once a month... so I'll put our newest guest, Mr. Jones, at my right.
- Thank you.
- And, Mr. Sterling, my left.
And I'll sit here.
Oh, thank you, dear.
And, Mr. Mora, you may sit next to baby.
Thank you.
And now, Mr. Sterling, will you say grace?
[Clearing Throat]
Accept our thanks, O Lord, for this food...
- and bless it to our use for thy namesake-
- Amen.
I think I'll take these flowers off.
Daffodils are lovely this time of year, but they're in the way.
- Thank you, dear.
- You're welcome.
I hope you'll enjoy your supper, children.
It's a very simple one.
Our regular Saturday night meal.
But no one in the country can cook them as we New Englanders do.
Boston beans.
- Well, that's- that's splendid.
- Thank you.
- I'm so sorry Mr. Frosby couldn't come tonight.
- Frosby?
Yes.
I invited Mr. Frosby to come and have supper with us, but he couldn't.
Marvelous stock he's offering for sale.
It ought to enrich many of our townspeople.
Mr. Sterling, I- I don't know very much about stocks, but-
Well, if I were you, I wouldn't invest in any stock until I'd consulted my banker.
Are you going to invest much?
- Well, with my modest salary-
- Blessed are the poor in spirit.
For their's is the kingdom of heaven.
[Fork Rattles On Plate]
[Utensil Strikes Plate]
- [Shouting, Indistinct]
- Hayride!
Hayride!
Oh!
- We didn't know you had company.
- Oh, that's all right, dear.
[In Unison] We're sorry if we're intruding.
Oh, no, you're not intruding.
Just a couple of friends for supper.
- Oh, Steve, aren't you going?
- Going where?
Well, your friends are cordially invited... to attend the third annual hayride and dance.
- The choir leaders are giving it.
- You'd like to go, wouldn't you, boys?
- Sure!
- Where'd you put my hat?
Wait a minute.
There's plenty of time, Danny.
- Sit down, girls, and have a cup of coffee.
- [Voices Overlapping]
- Sophie, bring some coffee.
- Thank you.
[Voices Overlapping]
No, they don't have hayrides in New York.
Sophie, hurry olth the coffee!

Ah!
Good evening, my dear boys.
- How do you do?
- Out in the night air, eh?
Delightful.
Music and moonlight.
Well, enjoy them while you may.
It's always a pleasure to see the young enjoy themselves.
To some of us, that has been denied.
But-Ah, well.
Ah.
Good evening.
Good evening.
What was Frosby doing here?
Steve, I've just made a wonderful investment... that will make you and your sister independent for life.
- You bought his stock?
- Yes, dear.
You gave him your bonds?
- Why, yes.
Why?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
Aw, Steve don't know anything about business.
He don't know how those things are done.
You know, Mother, I think you'd better go to bed.
You know, you had a hard day, all those people here and everything.
Oh.
Always the nice little gentleman.
I believe I will.
Come along, Cynthia dear.
- Oh, Mother.
- Cynthia.
Well, gee, I had a lot of fun.
Thanks a lot.
- Thank you.
Good night.
- Good night, boys.
- Good night.
- Steve will show you where you're going to sleep tonight.
- Sure.
- Good night.
Happy dreams.
[Cynthia] Good night.
- Where are you goin'?
- You heard what I told that guy.
Not with that gat, you're not!
- You think I'm gonna stand by and see him rob my mother?
- Shh!
- Give me that gun.
Come on.
Get out of my way.
- You'll wake up your mother.
Go on in there.
I wanna have a little talk with you.
- Here's a cigarette.
- I don't want one.
Smoke it!
Now, Steve, you gotta snap out of this.
You're only a kid.
You're gonna marryJudy, ain't ya?
And you got a great home here, and you got a wonderful mother.
And just one shot out of that gat, and you're gonna blow the whole works.
- Well, you know what it means-
- Aw, forget it.
Forget it, Steve.
It's a sucker's game.
Nobody but chumps uses guns.
Steve.
Did you ever see a guy go to the chair?
Huh?
Well, I did.
I spent eight months in that condemned row.
Watched 'em go one by one.
Pals of mine.
Guys that you'd say good morning to in the morning... and then you'd say good night at night.
And then they'd go.
And I'd wait day after day, week after week, month after month... wonderin' if I was gonna be the next one to go.
Let me tell you, that's no picnic, kid... listenin' to the drone of that lousy motor and watchin' those lights go dim!
Come on.
Don't be a sap.
What am I gonna do?
Don't worry about Frosby.
He'll be taken care of.
Well taken care of.
Say, what do you think Danny and I come up here for, to go on hayrides?
[Mother] Steve?
Yes, Mother?
Aren't you going to say good night to Mother?
Coming, Mother.
?
[Man Singing]
There you are, Steve.
There's the works.
- What's this?
- Your mother's bonds.
- Why, say
- Gee, fellas, I-
- Aw, that's nothin'.
- But, listen, I could-
- Aw, forget it.
Steve, we gotta scram.
We got a date.
Besides, if you're seen around here with us... it'll break your parole, and you know what that means.
And, Steve, we're gonna tellJudy just exactly what you told us to tell her.
- Word for word.
- Make her believe it, will ya?
Steve, you're on the square with Judy, ain't ya?
You bet I am.
That's all we wanted to know.
Oh, and... here's a little- little piece of poetry I-
I copied out of a book.
Give it to her for me, will ya?
Why, Sure, Steve.
Sure.
- [Train Whistle Bloos]
- Hey, that's our freight.
Now, wait a minute.
Nuts!
?
[March]
Don't forget, boys, everybody on their toes.
This is a tough bunch of hombres and they crave action, and you should see them slug.
Now, listen, fellas.
I've been in this can 40 years, and my one ambition-
- Is to get out.
- Oh, shut up!
No.
It's to win the- the Institutional Championship three times.
You won it twice already and nearly copped it again last year.
- I would've too if my third baseman hadn't sat down on me.
- Sat down on you?
- Yes.
- [Man] Electrocuted.
Look out for his arm, will you?
And now, St. Louis and that other gorilla... have to walk out on me just one week before this big game.
Now, here's what I want you to do, fellas.
I'm pretty old.
I haven't got very far to go.
But I'd be the happiest guy in any jail if I could cop this game today.
Now, will you go in and fight and try to win for old Pop?
- [Voices Overlapping]
- That's the way to talk.
Now, remember our slogan-
[All] From first base to second base to third base, we roam.
Be it ever so humble, there's no base like home.
That's the place that counts- home base.
And remember who you're playin' with- a bunch of crooks.
No ethics.
Show 'em that you're gentlemen.
I oant everything in this game on the up-and-up.
[Shouts Of Approval]
- Like needles!
- [Yelling, Shouting]
Go after those guys now!
?
[March]
You know, St Louis, what my ambition is?
To ride on a real train with towels and everything.
In the distance, one sees the gray walls and towers... of dear old Bensonatta.
- Home again, pal.
- Yeah, and I'm glad to get back.
Now have you got that poem forJudy, ya half-wit?
Why, certainly.
I got it right here.
There ya are.
[Mouths Words]
[Chattering, Shouting]
[Booing]
[Booing Intensifies]
How are ya, Bill?
How's your team?
We'll give you a game, all right.
If our pitcher hadn't busted out, you wouldn't have a chance.
- Oh, yeah?
- Good luck.
- Same to you.
- [Booing Continues]
- [Indistinct] - [Booing Continues]
Now, listen, fellas, this game is gonna be on the square... and be gentlemen at all times.
- Sure, sure.
Where's your pitcher?
- There he is.
- Oh, is this your pitcher?
- Yeah.
- Now, remember, the game's gotta be on the up-and-up.
- Okay.
- None of that, you know.
And none of that.
- No?
- Not through the game.
- And none of this!
See what I mean?
- Where's your pitcher?
- Right here, buddy.
Oh, uh, I've heard about you.
- You just heard the rules, didn't ya?
- Sure.
- None of that!
- Say, what's the idea?
- And none of that!
- Come on!
Leave him alone!
And none of that!
- You don't have to show him that.
- No?
- Didn't I tell you there was none of that?
- Sure!
- And that?
- Well, how about this?
- Say, what's the idea?
Leave that bat alone!
- Come on!
Play ball, you guys!
All right, everybody ready?
Good luck.
- Come on!
- Lots of luck.
Go right to it.
Over the fence.
- I'll get that ball for ya, Warden.
- Oh, let me get it.
[Bell Ringing]
[Ringing Stops]
Okay to come in?
[Ringing Resumes]
- [Ringing Stops]
- Good-bye, dear.
Good luck.
[Ringing Resumes]
[Ringing Stops]
St. Louis!
Hello, Danny.
Gee, I'm sorry to see you kids back here again.
Oh, that's all right, kid.
I told 'em I'd be back, and I never break my word.
Besides, I'll tell ya, it wasn't so much fun out there as you might think.
You know, traveling' around by yourself all alone.
- Wasn't I with you?
- Yeah, that's what I mean.
Say, what are you gonna do, kid?
I don't know.
I'll go back to the old racket, I suppose.
[Chuckling]
No, no.
No, no.
You won't go back to the old racket.
You're goin' right to New England.
- New England?
- Sure.
- Steve's waitin' for you.
- [Chuckles] Steve's waitin' for me?
Well, I'm tellin' ya he's waitin'-
Listen, he gave us a message to give to you.
He
- He told us to tell ya-
What was that message that he gave us?
Well, he told us to tell you all about the- the birds and the- the lilacs- you know, flowers- and the-the blue skies... and, uh, the love what comes but once-
Well, the meat of the whole thing is you're to go back to New England.
Yeah, yeah.
Now, what he's trying to tell you is this.
You know.
You know, the birds are singin'... and the- and the flowers... and the river's kind of-
It's pretty, ain't it?
And it's all
- It's-
Well, listen, here's the dough for you to go back there with.
- I don't need it.
- Sure you do.
Them Chinese mannequin coats cost a lot of jack.
- Chinese coats?
- Why, certainly.
Steve's gonna take you to China.
- We told you that, didn't we?
- Sure.
Tokyo, Honolulu- All them Chinese towns.
Say, are you kiddin'?
[St. Louis] No.
You mean Steve is...
really waiting' for me?
Say, what the heck- Listen, baby.
I am tellin' ya on my word, and I never break my word.
That's one thing I'll say for the louse.
Hey, Sam.
Now here's your big chance.
We're gonna send you in there to hit that ball.
Do you think you can do it?
- Sure, Pop.
- That's a boy.
Okay.
Now, listen.
If ever you laid on an apple in your life, lay on this one.
It's our only chance to win.
You'll do that for your old pals, won't you?
- Sure.
- All right.
Do it for Pop.
- That's the boy.
- [Voices Overlapping]
Hello there, Warden.
So you're the fellow that never breaks his word?
Oh, now, listen, Warden.
I'm sorry about that.
But I had to leave in such a hurry, I just couldn't say good-bye.
You know that this doubles your sentences, don't you?
- All right, I'll redouble.
- Gee, that makes me 286 years.
I won't need that.
- Take them to the cooler.
- Oh, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.
Judy's gone, and we're losing the ball game.
- Huh?
Yeah?
- That's right, Chief.
Three runs behind.
Take 'em to the cooler.
Send St. Louis and uncle Dan to the cooler when we're losing the ball game?
Oh, now, listen, Warden.
You're not gonna do that.
With Jean and the gang waiting' for us out there, we gotta win that ball game.
Look here, St. Louis.
Can I trust you and Dan... to go out to that diamond without leaving us?
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll give you my word... and you know that I never break my word.
- No?
- Well, never twice in succession.
Take 'em to the cooler.
After the game!
Why does a fireman wear red suspenders?
- To keep his trousers up.
- [Laughing]
Say, St. Louis, you know that fellow McDowell on the other side?
Now, don't give him a high ball.
Keep 'em down and close-
I don't care if there oas a rumble seat on the car or if there oasn't!
If it hadn't been for you, we wouldn't be spendin' a month in the cooler!
Will you shut up about that rumble seat?
Take that cigar out of your mouth.
You're in training.
- All right!
- And I'm tellin' ya, there was a rumble seat.
I don't care.
Ever since I met you, I've been in trouble.
Yeah, well, you know, you're no turning point-

Look at this, a roadster.
And the gang promised me a limousine.
- It's piecrust to you, ain't it?
- Shut up, you sap.
We ain't out of danger yet.
It's 10 miles to town.
Well, so long.
I hope I never see you again.
- Boy, I hate these country prisons.
- I hate all prisons.
- The food is bad.
- Well, listen.
Next time-
There ain't gonna be any next time.
Not for me.
- No?
What are you gonna do for a livin'?
- Start a chicken farm.
You can start with 100 eggs, and by saving the pullets... at the end of the year you'll have 10,000 eggs.
- Yeah?
Listen.
Get out and fix that.
- What's the matter?
- I think we got a flat tire.
- Flat tire?
That's luck for you.
I don't see any flat tire.
No?
Well, buy a mirror!
- Hey, there!
- Friends, we will hear from Brother Dan... once lost in the sea of sin... but now safe on the shores of love.
Praise be!
Praise be!
Praise be!
Friends, you wouldn't "tink" to look at me now that I once was as wicked as you.
But, yea, verily, there's no sinner among you what I can't call "brudder."
You know how I got lost in crime and sin?
Bad company.
But I found the error of my ways.
I found that crime don't pay.
Now I'm happy in the light and love the whole world.
- Praise be!
Praise be!
Yeah, even the-the depraved wretch what led me into sin... even him I love and forgive.
And remember, "brudders," crime don't pay.
No, sir.
Crime don't pay.
And verily, I say to you... even the depraved wr- louse... what led me into sin... even him I love and forgive.
And there is a blow of vengeance coming what- on all sinners what knows no mercy.
There is retribution for all.
And there is "tunderbolts" comin' from the sky... on your head, unexpected.
And verily I say to you, the wages of sin is a punch in the jaw, you louse!
What are you pinching' me for?
He's the one that did it!
Twenty-four, 26...
- 28, 30, 32... 34, 36, 38, 40, 42.
Another one?
Hello, Al.
Another load?
- Howdy, Joe.
Yeah.
- Got another load for you.
- Oh, look at the mug on that guy.
- Look at that pan!
Say, is there a piccolo player in the crowd?
Why, no, sir.
But I can play a saxophone.
So that's what you're in for.
For three months, I been tryin' to get a piccolo player, and all they send up is saxophones.
Just a lot of punks.
That's all.
Oh, now that's a shame.
What'd you do, boy, rob your mama's bank?
Poor kids.
What do you think of that?
- Ain't that a dirty shame?
- Get the pan on this guy.
I been in this jail 40 years... and the saps they send up here gets worse and worse.
It's gettin' to be a day nursery.
They wouldn't even allow those kind of guys in here in my time.
How'd they keep 'em out?
Blackball 'em?
- You know what they'd have called Big Pete in my day?
- What?
- A sissy.
Yeah, there was men in those days- men with needles in their chests, men like meself.
Come on over and play ball.
Just one week before the big game, and they had to go and pardon the pitcher.
It's politics.
That's what it is- politics.
- Somebody higher up don't want us to win.
- You know who it is?
The governor.
- Jessell!
- Well, if it ain't little Morris.
So you're here!
Yes, I'm here.
And you're here too, where you belong.
You got me all wrong, kid.
I lost more money on that horse than you did.
Did you, Jessell?
Did you lose your position and money and friends?
And mother?
She died at my trial.
You killed her.
- If it hadn't been for you-
- Shut up, you little swine.
- You were a thief long before I knew you.
- That's a lie!
Take it back!
Cut it out!
Go on.
Scram!
Don't do that.
Come on.
Don't take it so hard.
I can't help it.
How did your family feel?
Well, they don't know.
I changed my name.
They think I'm in China.
- How'd you do that?
- Well, I got friends out there.
They forward my letters home and cable my folks once a month.
I'll see you around.
I work in the office there.
Got a lot of new fish coming in.
You know, associates, inmates.
Come on, son.
Buck up, boy.
Come on, you fellas, will you?
Come on.
All right, Pop.
What's the hurry?
- I got plenty of time- 30 years.
- Nix, only 20 for me.
Say, do you think they'd mind if I was to join in?
- Can you play ball?
- Why, sure.
Go on and get over there then.
Pop'll plaster you with kisses.
Hurry up.
And this is the men's yard.
Aren't you afraid here with all these dreadful characters?
Oh, dear, no.
They're just like little children to me.
In fact, to all the welfare workers.
Watch it.
Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Massey?
- How do you do?
- So jolly to see you again.
Uh, I missed you terribly last Thursday.
Had some friends up from the city.
Charming people.
They were very disappointed not to meet you.
Well, cheerio.
See you again.
- You see?
- And who is he?
Electrical genius.
Wiretapper.
Hi, Dooley.
- Famous strangler.
Now we go over to the welfare rooms.
You see?
They're right over there.
- Don't be afraid.
He's just amusing little Jean... the warden's daughter.
Jean, say hello to my friends.
- How do you do?
- How do you do, dear?
Have you a kiss for Mrs. Massey?
- Yes, Mrs. Massey.
I gave it to Rex.
- The dog?
Let's go over to the welfare room.
- Okay, what's next, Eddie?
- Try this one, Jean.
That-a-boy, Eddie.
- Oh, I can do that!
- No, you can't.
- Geez, that-a-girl!
- Here's one you can't do.
Walk on your ear, Jean.
No.
Of course not!
I got him.
- Look this way please.
Keep smilin' now.
Big smile, St. Louis.
All right, one with your lawyer, St. Louis.
Come on.
Get over here, Marvin.
- Thanks!
- Thank you.
- Come on, buddy.
Move up.
Guy with the camera, move up.
Through here.
Number one, right here please.
- Number two, right here.
- Well, hello, Sophie.
- Number three-
- Hello, Kitty.
Glad to see you back again.
Lemme see.
I ain't seen you in about a month, ain't it?
- I know.
- Well, come on.
I'm gonna take care of you two myself.
Lovely.
By golly, you girls
- I'm going to check these two girls in personally.
- How's it been?
- Everything is lovely.
We've got a new wing on the place.
The mockingbirds are singing just the same.
- Name?
- Judith Fields.
- Age?
- Twenty-one.
- Your first offense?
- The first time they caught me.
- Fraud?
- I told fortunes.
And they gave you three years for that?
Well, after I'd finished telling fortunes, I'd, uh... recommend certain oil stocks.
Oh.
Well, then, you worked with someone?
- A broker.
- Did you know what you were doing?
- Of course.
- Well, then, why?
It was fun!
I always wanted to travel.
You know, we never hit the same town twice.
Oh, you can't understand.
Oh, yes, I do.
I've felt the same way.
- I was headed for China.
- China?
- Gee, I'd love that.
- Gee, you know... we had jobs out there- three of us boys and, well, then this came up.
And you threw that over to work here?
No, you don't understand.
I don't work here.
I belong here.
- A convict?
- Yes.
But we call ourselves inmates.
- Gee, that's tough.
You don't look it.
- Well, neither do you.
Well, tell me, uh, what- what did you do?
A fight, just before the boat sailed.
- The other boy-
- What a rotten break.
Married?
No.
Engaged?
- Say, is that on the card?
- Oh, no.
- What are you in for?
Shoplifting.
I was framed!
Sure.
We all was framed.
- What's yours?
- Spittin' in a river.
Gee, I didn't know they could pinch you for that.
Why, you told Mrs. Massey it was for winking' at a cop.
- For not winking' at a cop.
- Terrible creature!
Well, at least she don't scare 'em to death with blackmail.
Is it necessary that I wait in here with these other persons?
Cut the ritz!
We was all arrested and here we are, in the "cansky."
- Who's she?
- Edith La Verne.
- I don't see what men see in her.
- Oh, is that the love thief?
- The extortionist.
- Extortionist?
Honey, was you in the circus?
- I'm so sorry for them.
Really, I-
- And these are the women!
Come, girls.
- Yes, sir.
Say, there's nobody but ladies allowed in here.
So I see.
We want to see the warden a minute.
St. Louis!
- Okay, boys.
Hey, buddy, buddy, where's the warden?
Oh, you got company.
- Not a bad jail.
- Hey, hey, what's the idea?
- Hello, Warden.
How are you?
Well, St. Louis, glad to have you with us.
Hello, Curly.
Say, listen, Warden.
I want to make a little bargain with you.
You know, I thought you looked a little bit worried out there in the yard.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you know, thinkin' that I might leave here unexpectedly.
- I wanna tell you somethin'.
I'm on the square with this.
I shoot straight, see?
- When I decide to go, I give fair warning.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
How's that?
- That's fair.
- Okay, Warden.
That's a bargain.
- Show him to his cell.
Oh.
Oh, now, please, please.
Wait a minute.
You know, Warden, about this cell business-
- Sorry, I haven't any cigars.
- Thanks, I don't use 'em anyway.
About this cell business, Warden, if you don't mind, I don't like to sleep too high up.
- No?
- No.
And, if you don't mind, I'd like a nice airy cell, you know... plenty of windows, and a nice southern exposure.
- Southern exposure?
- Yeah, if you don't mind.
- I'd like a double bed.
And running water.
- Sure.
And I'd like- Say, I'm not boring you, am I?
No, no.
Go on.
Outta here!
Okay, Warden.
See you at supper.
Beans again, I suppose.
Southern exposure.
Running water.
Not too high up.
Sunshine.
- Say, if I had a cell like that, I'd sleep in it myself.
Don't forget to lock that.
A lot of new guys come in here today.
- Letters from home?
- Yeah.
Yeah, pretty regular.
Now, look here.
Here's a picture of my mother here.
And here's my kid sister Frances over here.
- Let's see it, Steve, will you?
- Sure.
Too skinny.
I don't like 'em so skinny.
- I like legs.
- What?
Limbs.
When I left home, she was a kid on roller skates.
- Now she's off to college.
- College?
- Yeah.
- Gee, your folks must be swell.
And look at that house!
You know, it makes me real sick to look at a house like that.
- Why?
- Why?
'Cause I could've had a house like that.
Easiest thing in the world.
Only mine would've had a tower on it with my chicken farm...
- if it wasn't for that big baboon.
- What baboon?
- He come in here today.
- He means St. Louis.
And you shut up about him.
He's the greatest ballplayer you ever saw.
Oh, how that guy can pitch.
Well, ballplayer or no ballplayer, he'd better stay out of my way... 'cause if I ever lay my hands on that guy, I'll croak him.
I never know how they're gonna turn out.
You're a fine guy, you are.
Leave me flat in the middle of the road.
- You callin' me a double-crosser?
- Yeah!
- You think I'd double-cross a pal?
- Didn't you?
- I thought there was a rumble seat.
- There was no rumble seat!
- That kind of car don't have a rumble seat.
- Keep quiet!
- You're not gonna let-
- All right, maybe there was a rumble seat on the car.
- Look out for his arm, will you?
- That's the way, boys.
Don't fight.
- Don't let 'em fight, Pop.
- I won't let 'em.
- Steve's my name.
- How are you?
Glad to know you, kid.
Glad to know you too.
What do you say we turn in, boys?
- I think you're up there.
- Me?
Say, you wouldn't let a pitcher climb way up there, would you?
- He might strain his arm.
- I've gotta throw too, ain't I?
You throw higher than him.
You have to throw way down to second base.
I ain't gonna let that guy put anything else over on me.
- I'm gettin' smart!
- What do you mean, put something over on you?
- Wait a minute.
- Wait a minute.
- I'm not dumb.
I'm settlin' this thing without any fighting.
Think of a number from one to 10.
- One to 10?
- Yeah.
- Seven.
- That's it.
You sleep in the lower one.
- Get on up there.
- That's fair enough, ain't it?
Long as I lost on the level, it's okay.
Say, on second thought, I remember.
- There was a rumble seat on that car, all right.
- Oh, shut up!
Knock it off, Freda.
Try and get some sleep.
All out!
Attention.
Forward.
March!
- Well, how are you today, Genesis?
- How is y'all, Mrs. Massey?
Well, Judy, quite an honor it seems to me to be selected to instruct the warden's daughter.
Of course, it's quite against my better judgment... but, uh, I hope it'll turn out all right.
Thank you, Mrs. Massey.
Two and two is four.
Four and four is eight.
- Sour grapes, kid.
Sour grapes.
- Mrs. Reilly... can Judy and I go in the yard and take a walk?
- Surely, dear.
Go right along.
- Thank you.
Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Massey?
- What a beautiful apple.
- Strange.
Such good-looking girls, aren't them?
- Not a homely one among them.
- Thank you, Mrs. Massey.
Years ago, when I started doing welfare work, it was quite the reverse.
Well, in those days women wore long skirts.
The only ones that were acquitted... were the ones smart enough to cross their legs during the trial.
- What a peculiar psychology.
Have an apple, dear.
- Oh, thank you, Mrs. Massey.
- And I have a magazine for you, my dear.
- Thank you, Mrs. Massey.
And here's the latest style magazine for you.
Girls, isn't this jolly?
Dewey's won the Battle of Manila.
- I oughta-
- Why don't you leave me alone?
I haven't done anything to you.
- What a jam!
Let 'im alone!
- What do you mean let him alone?
- I said let him alone.
Scram, kid.
What are you gonna do?
Make a favorite of that punk around here?
- Keep your hands off him.
- Say, who are you to tell me to keep my hands off anybody?
What's the matter, Steve?
What's all the trouble?
Pop and I found this big lug, and he give me an argument.
He thinks everybody's scared of him.
- Sure, everybody's scared of me.
- Everybody's scared, are they?
You don't wanna bother with them guys.
It's a waste of breath.
I know, but look out for your arm.
Look out for your arm.
- Hey, the "ame-day" is waitin' at the "ate-gay."
- Thanks.
Don't mention it.
Hey, Steve.
I wouldn't go down there.
Keep away from that girl.
Gettin' pretty near your parole.
I wouldn't take any chances.
Yeah, listen, kid.
He's right about that.
You do what Pop says, and you'll never go wrong.
- I'll go.
- Hey-
Hey, some guy hit a great big lug out there right on the button.
Hey, buddy, I'm sorry.
I butted into something.
I didn't know.
She don't want to see me.
She wants to see you.
- Me?
- Yeah.
I didn't know that you two were fond of each other.
Well, gee, I don't know how fond she is of me... but I think she's a fine girl.
- Well, ain't you never said anything to her?
- No, I haven't had a chance.
You know what the rules are.
Oh, we waved a couple of times from the window.
Well, you come on over.
I'd like to have you meet her.
Yeah, but listen, if she's caught talkin' to me-
Don't let that worry you.
I'll take care of all that.
Hey, lug.
Come here.
No, he means you.
Say, who do you think you are, ordering me around?
What do you want?
Judy's got a boyfriend Judy's got a-
- Jean-
- Judy, there's a couple of fellas in reception to see you.
I got the pass right here.
Jean, come over here.
Your Uncle Danny wants to tell you a fairy story.
Aw, Danny.
Why does a chicken cross the street?
To get on the other side.
Heard you were being paroled in a few days.
Yes, I am.
I just wanted to say good-bye to you before you left and... thank you for being so sweet to me that day in the office.
Well, that's all right.
I've
- I've been trying to get to see you too... because, well, I
- I have a lot of things I want to talk to you about.
Remember that first day in the office when I asked you if you were engaged?
Yes, and I said, "Is that on the card?"
Yeah.
Well it- You know it wasn't.
I wanted to know because-
Well, are you engaged?
No, Steve, I'm not.
Are you?
No, I'm not.
Oh, but I'd like to be... to you.
Now, look out for this one, Jean.
This is a hard one.
Why does the president of the United States wear a high silk hat?
To keep his head warm.
I'm on the level too, Steve.
But I guess it- it can't be.
Why not?
Well, I've heard all about your home and your family and-
- Well, I'm-I'm just-
- Well, wait a minute.
That's just storybook stuff about the rich boy and the poor girl not being able to marry.
Doesn't count here at all.
When we get outta here, we're just gonna be a couple of ex-convicts... and that's not storybook stuff.
We got to start all over, bottom of the ladder.
And I- I'd like for us to start together.
Well, that is, if- if you're fond enough of me.
I am fond of you, Steve.
I'm more than fond of you.
If there was five birds in a tree, and St. Louis and I shot one of the birds... how many of the birds would be left in the tree?
None, because they'd all fly away.
Jean, you ain't been reading a book, have you?
- No.
- Can't understand it.
- I'll wave you an answer tonight.
- Beat it, kid.
- Judy, that isn't the man you-
- Judy, tell 'im you're not at home.
- Fellas, Miss Fields.
- Fellas, Miss Fields.
Two minutes.
Well, darling, here I am.
Just three months too late, Frosby, and never mind the "darling."
- But, Judy-
- I didn't come in here because I wanted to see you.
I came in here because I wanted to tell you what a dirty rat you are.
- You don't understand-
- I do understand now.
I thought your business was a little shady... but I didn't know it was gonna land me in jail.
- Well, it's finished.
I'm paying for it.
- What could I do?
What could you do?
You could have stayed and faced it out... not run away like a coward and leave me to take the rap.
Listen, Judy.
I've got friends and influence, and I've got some dough left.
- I can get you out, and we can go away.
- We?
We can't do anything.
I'm through with you and all your kind.
Now, listen.
There's a fine, clean kid inside, and he's stuck on me.
And I'm crazy about him.
He gets outta here in a week.
He's gonna wait for me.
We're gonna start together at the bottom of the ladder-
Steve and I.
- Steve.
- Yes, that's the name of the kid that's waitin' in there for me.
He's waitin' in there now for my answer.
Okay, Judy.
Time's up!
Genny, be sure this gets to him.
Don't forget.
And Genesis, poor lamb.
Oh, Miss Massey.
Miss Massey.
You is such a good woman.
- And I's such a bad woman.
- No, Genny.
If I'd only met you when I was a little child...
I'd have been in my chariot... on my way to glory.
- There, there.
- Oh, Genny.
You mustn't cry like that.
Everything's gonna be all right.
- Don't cry.
That's two chocolate bars and an apple you owes me now.
- What's goin' on?
- Signal.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, from the women's quarters.
- Oh, is that how they do it?
- Sure.
Didn't you know that?
With all the cans you've been in.
Yeah, but I never stayed in one long enough to find those things out.
- What does it say?
- Wait a minute.
Message... gate.
- Good day, boys.
Mrs. Massey, look at your shoes!
All dusty again.
Imagine that.
Why, boys, every time I come through that gate, you clean off my shoes.
- That's all right, Mrs. Massey.
It's a pleasure.
- Not at all.
- Good-bye, boys.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Did you get it?
- For Steve.
Ah, none of them bimbos ever write me.
No sex appeal, my boy.
No sex appeal.
- Where's Steve?
- Why?
- I got a kite for him.
- I'll take it.
- You'll take it?
- I'm in on this.
Oh.
Hey, don't look over my shoulder when I'm reading Steve's mail.
This is from a lady.
Hey, Steve.
Come here a minute, will ya?
- Congratulations, Steve.
- For what?
Well, you're e- Uh, I got a little note here for you.
I'm engaged.
- No!
- Yeah.
- Judy.
- No!
Yeah.
Hey, you fellas- You didn't read this, did you?
Nah.
Four times six- 25.
- No, dear.
It's 24.
- Hello, Judy.
- How's the youngster getting on?
- Just fine, Warden.
That's great.
1136 wants to see you, boss.
- I'm busy.
- It's Steve.
He wants to say good-bye.
Oh, sure.
Show him in.
Good luck to you, my boy.
Thanks, Warden.
I, uh, I know it's against the rules... but could I give you a message for a girl here?
A prisoner?
You see, we're, well- We're engaged.
I want her to know that I'm gonna work hard for her... and make something of myself so that when she's free-
Just you wait a moment.
Wait till I get a pencil and write that message down.
- Here's a pencil, Daddy.
- All right, bring it to me.
How am I going to get it unless you bring it to me?
- I'll write every week.
- I won't write at all.
Your family mustn't see letters with this postmark.
They mustn't know.
Don't worry.
I'll stick it out.
It's only five months.
You won't forget?
Huh?
Oh-Oh, yes.
I found a pencil.
Now, what was that message?
Well, what I wanted to say was, "Thanks."
So long, Jean.
Four times eight- 43.
- He's gone.
- Four times nine-
- Bye-bye.
- Don't come back!
- I'll do that.
Take care of yourself, kid.
I'm gonna miss you.
- Look out for the kids.
- You bet I will, Steve.
- Bye!
Well, Stephen!
Why, I'm glad to see you.
Thank you very much, Mr. Sterling.
I'm glad to be home.
Well, good-bye.
Hope you've enjoyed the service.
- Yes, we have.
- Hope to see you next Sunday.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, girls.
Good-bye.
Glad to see you.
- Why, hello, Steve.
- Hello.
- How's China?
- Oh, fine.
Thought you'd be wearing a pigtail.
You going back there?
No.
Not till I've been around home for a while.
No, he's going home a while and get some of Mother's good cooking.
How do you do, sir?
You're a stranger here, aren't you?
- Yes.
- I'm glad to see you at our service.
Thank you very much.
Most delightfully edifying.
- My name is Frosby.
- I'm Reverend Sterling.
Delighted to meet you, I'm sure.
- Oh, isn't that Stephen-
- Jordan.
Do you know him?
No, I'm not acquainted with him personally, but I know a very dear friend of his.
- I should be delighted to introduce you.
- Most gracious of you.
Mr. Jordan, will you allow me to present Mr. Frosby?
- How do you do, Mr. Frosby?
- This is her son, Stephen.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
My sister, Cynthia.
- How do you do?
- Ma'am.
I'm very, very pleased to meet the Jordan family.
In fact, I might say I was most anxious.
- Really?
- Indeed.
Your son and I happen to have a mutual acquaintance.
- Yes?
- A Miss Fields.
A Miss Judith Fields.
- She was formerly in my employ.
- Really?
How interesting.
Perhaps you'd come and have supper with us tonight.
- Mother, I-
- It's all right, dear.
Sophie always has enough for a dozen.
- You'll come, won't you?
- Thank you very much.
- Good-bye, Mr. Sterling.
- Good-bye.
- Supper is at 6:00.
- I shall be there most promptly.
See you this evening.
Oh, I'm going to open up a branch office here.
Of course, I shall miss Judy.
She was a most valuable assistant.
But as you know everyone in town... you may be able to take her position.
Don't forget your ABC's, boys.
Hiya, lug.
What are you doing in there?
- We're takin' intelligence tests.
- Thought we was trying out for the show.
Hey, you're in the wrong line.
Get over in front of the welfare building.
Any of you guys that's trying out for the show.
You stick here.
You're gonna take a test.
You better take that intelligence test, boy.
You'll need it.
- Hey, Happy.
- Yeah?
- Gimme the works here, will you?
- Right.
Come on, come on.
Get a little pep into it.
What's the matter?
- What's the matter with you?
You stiff?
- St. Louis.
Keep your back turned, kid.
- Heard from Steve?
- No.
I have.
He's in a jam.
- How?
- You know Frosby?
- He's the guy you took the rap for, isn't he?
- Yeah.
He followed Steve to New England.
He's trying to use him.
- Blackmail, huh?
- The old stock racket.
- He threatened to-
- Yeah, yeah.
I know.
He's gonna tell the folks that Steve was in the stir, huh?
- What'll I do?
- You don't do nothin', kid.
Just leave it to me.
- Say, listen, Judy.
- Yeah?
- Are you really stuck on Steve?
- Yeah.
There's, uh, no chance for a guy to muscle in there, is there?
I'm on the level.
- I really love him.
- Okay, baby.
What does m-o-r-o-n spell?
Why-Why, that spells moron.
I passed, 100%.
- Hey, lug, you was never in New England, were you?
- No.
Well, you're goin' now.
Hello, fellas.
As you know, we're gathered here tonight for our annual entertainment... which is sponsored by our good friend, Mrs. Massey.
Also, we have as our honored guests... a number of people from the outside, which we take great pleasure in welcoming.
And now, ladies and gentlemen...
I take great pleasure in introducing our master of ceremonies-
One who is a master of ceremonies, one who has acted in a similar capacity... in a great many institutions of this kind... both in this country and abroad... and one whom we hope to have with us for many, many years to come.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I take great pleasure in introducing our master of ceremonies...
Honest John Jessup!
Mr. Warden.
Ladies... and gentlemen.
I can scarcely find the words to express my gratitude... in having being selected as master of ceremony for this delightful performance.
It is a very unusual compliment.
And now, with your kind permission...
I take infinite pleasure in presenting that ever-popular team...
Black and Blue.
Come on there, Blue.
Let me ask you somethin' now.
You owe me some money, and what I wanna know is...
- when is you gonna pay me my money?
- Why, I pay you when you alone.
- When I'm alone?
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm alone now.
- No, you ain't.
I'm here.
- What is that thing you got there?
- That's my bazooka.
- But-
- Musical instrument.
Bazooka?
You don't mean to tell me you get music outta that.
- Sure, I do.
- Let me see this thing.
That ain't nothin' but an old piece of gas pipe.
- Yeah, but I makes my livin' with that piece of gas pipe.
Yeah, but I play good music on this thing.
Let me hear you play something on it.
I'm just gonna play the "St. Louis Blues" on this thing... in honor of St. Louis.
- I'll be seeing you.
- Go ahead, mister.
Will you play it for me?
Gee, those guys are swell!
Oh, we certainly knocked them cold out there tonight.
- Boy, they're laughin' out there yet.
- Mi, mi, mi-mi-mi-mi.
Mi, mi, mi.
Come on, kid.
Knock 'em in the aisles.
You're a cinch.
- They're a pushover.
- Gee, but I'm scared.
Go on out and look 'em in the eye and sing, kid.
They can't walk out on you anyway, kid.
- Well?
- Well, I ain't goin' through with it, I tell you.
Now, listen.
I never break my word.
And I gave my word to Judy.
And we're goin' to New England, and we're goin' tonight.
I can't go to New England, not tonight.
I'm in the finale.
- Oh, what's the use, St. Louis?
- Say, listen.
If you don't do like I tell you, it's gonna be your finale.
All right, I'll go.
What's that got to do with the act?
- It's part of my plan, you sap.
- Oh.
- What do I do when I get on the stage?
- You just stand there.
- Don't I sing or dance or do nothin'?
- Yeah.
You do nothin'.
I'm gettin' smart.
There's somethin' screwy about this.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, our next act will hardly need an introduction.
Allow me to present St. Louis and Company.
Thanks very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, they've asked me to do my little bit for the entertainment tonight.
I can't sing, and I can't dance.
But I'll tell you what I will do.
I'll do an act that I used to do when I was a little kid and ran away with the circus.
This is a knife-throwing act, and I use a human target.
And the gentleman that's kindly consented to act as my target tonight... is none other than my old partner and pal, Dannemora Dan.
Right over there, Danny.
Right over there.
Listen, you guys wanna be quiet out there.
I gotta have absolute quiet.
Are all the lights in this theater controlled from that switchboard right there?
- That's right, sir.
- Thanks very much.
- Throw a little more light on Danny's head.
- All right, sir.
Listen, you wanna remember that I haven't done this act for a long time.
I'm liable to make a few slips.
You've got to overlook that.
I'll do my best though to go through the act without any serious injury.
Now, Danny, Danny-
He missed him!
Quiet, quiet.
Everybody, now-
Quiet, now.
Quiet, boys.
Every man stay in his own place.
No commotion, please.
Miss Massey, will you leave by the side door?
Joe, open that door.
Thanks, boys.
Thanks.
I'm proud of you.
Come on, boys.
Give the warden a great big cheer.
- I guess they made it.
- Yeah.
Frosby.
You'd tell everybody that I was an ex-convict.
- But now that you've started to swindle my mother-
- Swindle?
She told me all about you.
She told me about every crooked deal you ever pulled.
- Well, what do you want me to do?
- I want you to get out of town.
Well, I won't get out of town.
And I'll tell your mother that you weren't in China- that you were in jail.
- An ex-convict!
- You'd do that?
Well, you won't have to, because I'll tell her myself.
- Now, listen, you little jailbird-
- All right, I am a jailbird!
But in jail, I learned how to handle crooks like you!
You've been threatening me!
Now, I'll threaten you!
If you don't get out of this town by tonight, I'll kill you!
We're not intruding, are we?
Oh, no, not at all, gentlemen.
Would you sit down?
Our business can wait.
Glad to know you, Mr. Jones.
- Well, what can I do for you?
- I wanted to have a little business talk with ya.
Well, you'll have to make it pretty short, because he's leaving town.
- That's too bad.
I'll see you when you come back.
- He won't be back.
Oh.
Well, that's- that's tough.
Oh, say, by the way, which is the best hotel in town?
Well, there isn't any best.
They're all terrible.
But I'd like very much to have you stay at my house.
Oh, no.
I don't wanna put you to all that trouble.
Why, it won't be any trouble at all.
Really, I'd like to have you meet my mother and my sister.
Give you a nice room, and put him in the garage.
- Swell.
- And I know how you traveling men... like to get a good home-cooked meal.
Ah, boy, now you're talkin'.
Say, I haven't had a home-cooked meal in year-
Uh, it's been quite some time now.
Okay, then.
Suppose we go right over?
Fine and dandy.
Come along there, brains.
There are millions to be made in this stock.
Wrap that up and save it for me.
I'll be back later.
Frosby, be down at the train tonight to make sure you don't miss it.
- Bye-bye.
- Good-bye.
- Say, listen, Frosby, what are you trying to do?
- Huh?
Those two guns from New York- What about them?
I never saw them before.
- Say, have you got some new game you're not gonna cut us in?
- Now, listen, cutie.
- As long as you're as pretty as you are-
- Oh!
Listen, if you even try to double-cross us... you know what will happen to you.
Aw, shut up!
Get out of my way!
I'm busy.
Come on in, fellas.
- Oh.
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, dear.
- Say, listen, Mother...
I brought a couple of friends home to spend the weekend with me.
- You don't mind, do you?
- Oh, no, of course not.
Bring them right in.
All right.
Come on in, boys.
Mother, I want you to meet Mr. -
- Jones.
- Do you belong to the Salem Joneses or New Bedford Joneses?
Well, I'll tell you, ma'am, I come from New York State.
Yes, you see, and this is Mr. -
- Dannemora.
- Oh.
- Say, where's baby?
- Danny Mora.
I think she's upstairs.
Hello, Sis.
Sis, I want you to meet a couple of friends of mine.
This is my sister.
This is Mr. Jones and Mr. Mora.
- How do you do?
How do you do?
- Thank you.
Now, come right in, children, and make yourselves perfectly at home.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thanks.
- You sit here, will you?
- Thank you very much.
I'll take your hat.
And I'll take your hat.
You can sit right here.
I hope you'll make yourselves perfectly at home.
And you may smoke if you like.
Steve smokes.
I caught him once smoking corn silk when he was a little boy.
Gee, Steve, that was wrong.
Well, anyway, he's grown up to be a fine young boy.
I'll help Sophie get supper.
- Could I help you, ma'am?
- Oh, no, thank you, dear.
Sophie's here.
Gee, Steve, this is great.
This is swell.
Boy, your mother and- This is great.
- Do you like our home?
Sure.
And your mother's nice.
Pretty.
Who's his nobs here, your father?
Oh, no.
That's Abraham Lincoln.
Oh.
Is that him?
I know.
The father of this country.
Come along, children.
Our dinner is served.
Now, let me see.
How am I going to seat you?
Mr. Sterling dines with us about once a month... so I'll put our newest guest, Mr. Jones, at my right.
- Thank you.
- And, Mr. Sterling, my left.
And I'll sit here.
Oh, thank you, dear.
And, Mr. Mora, you may sit next to baby.
Thank you.
And now, Mr. Sterling, will you say grace?
Accept our thanks, O Lord, for this food...
- and bless it to our use for thy namesake-
- Amen.
I think I'll take these flowers off.
Daffodils are lovely this time of year, but they're in the way.
- Thank you, dear.
- You're welcome.
I hope you'll enjoy your supper, children.
It's a very simple one.
Our regular Saturday night meal.
But no one in the country can cook them as we New Englanders do.
Boston beans.
- Well, that's- that's splendid.
- Thank you.
- I'm so sorry Mr. Frosby couldn't come tonight.
- Frosby?
Yes.
I invited Mr. Frosby to come and have supper with us, but he couldn't.
Marvelous stock he's offering for sale.
It ought to enrich many of our townspeople.
Mr. Sterling, I- I don't know very much about stocks, but-
Well, if I were you, I wouldn't invest in any stock until I'd consulted my banker.
Are you going to invest much?
- Well, with my modest salary-
- Blessed are the poor in spirit.
For their's is the kingdom of heaven.
- Hayride!
Hayride!
Oh!
- We didn't know you had company.
- Oh, that's all right, dear.
We're sorry if we're intruding.
Oh, no, you're not intruding.
Just a couple of friends for supper.
- Oh, Steve, aren't you going?
- Going where?
Well, your friends are cordially invited... to attend the third annual hayride and dance.
- The choir leaders are giving it.
- You'd like to go, wouldn't you, boys?
- Sure!
- Where'd you put my hat?
Wait a minute.
There's plenty of time, Danny.
- Sit down, girls, and have a cup of coffee.
- Sophie, bring some coffee.
- Thank you.
No, they don't have hayrides in New York.
Sophie, hurry with the coffee!
Helen, sing us a song.
Ah!
Good evening, my dear boys.
- How do you do?
- Out in the night air, eh?
Delightful.
Music and moonlight.
Well, enjoy them while you may.
It's always a pleasure to see the young enjoy themselves.
To some of us, that has been denied.
But-Ah, well.
Ah.
Good evening.
Good evening.
What was Frosby doing here?
Steve, I've just made a wonderful investment... that will make you and your sister independent for life.
- You bought his stock?
- Yes, dear.
You gave him your bonds?
- Why, yes.
Why?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
Aw, Steve don't know anything about business.
He don't know how those things are done.
You know, Mother, I think you'd better go to bed.
You know, you had a hard day, all those people here and everything.
Oh.
Always the nice little gentleman.
I believe I will.
Come along, Cynthia dear.
- Oh, Mother.
- Cynthia.
Well, gee, I had a lot of fun.
Thanks a lot.
- Thank you.
Good night.
- Good night, boys.
- Good night.
- Steve will show you where you're going to sleep tonight.
- Sure.
- Good night.
Happy dreams.
Good night.
- Where are you goin'?
- You heard what I told that guy.
Not with that gat, you're not!
- You think I'm gonna stand by and see him rob my mother?
- Shh!
- Give me that gun.
Come on.
Get out of my way.
- You'll wake up your mother.
Go on in there.
I wanna have a little talk with you.
- Here's a cigarette.
- I don't want one.
Smoke it!
Now, Steve, you gotta snap out of this.
You're only a kid.
You're gonna marry Judy, ain't ya?
And you got a great home here, and you got a wonderful mother.
And just one shot out of that gat, and you're gonna blow the whole works.
- Well, you know what it means-
- Aw, forget it.
Forget it, Steve.
It's a sucker's game.
Nobody but chumps uses guns.
Steve.
Did you ever see a guy go to the chair?
Huh?
Well, I did.
I spent eight months in that condemned row.
Watched 'em go one by one.
Pals of mine.
Guys that you'd say good morning to in the morning... and then you'd say good night at night.
And then they'd go.
And I'd wait day after day, week after week, month after month... wonderin' if I was gonna be the next one to go.
Let me tell you, that's no picnic, kid... listenin' to the drone of that lousy motor and watchin' those lights go dim!
Come on.
Don't be a sap.
What am I gonna do?
Don't worry about Frosby.
He'll be taken care of.
Well taken care of.
Say, what do you think Danny and I come up here for, to go on hayrides?
Steve?
Yes, Mother?
Aren't you going to say good night to Mother?
Coming, Mother.
There you are, Steve.
There's the works.
- What's this?
- Your mother's bonds.
- Why, say
- Gee, fellas, I-
- Aw, that's nothin'.
- But, listen, I could-
- Aw, forget it.
Steve, we gotta scram.
We got a date.
Besides, if you're seen around here with us... it'll break your parole, and you know what that means.
And, Steve, we're gonna tell Judy just exactly what you told us to tell her.
- Word for word.
- Make her believe it, will ya?
Steve, you're on the square with Judy, ain't ya?
You bet I am.
That's all we wanted to know.
Oh, and... here's a little- little piece of poetry I-
I copied out of a book.
Give it to her for me, will ya?
Why, Sure, Steve.
Sure.
- Hey, that's our freight.
Now, wait a minute.
Nuts!
Don't forget, boys, everybody on their toes.
This is a tough bunch of hombres and they crave action, and you should see them slug.
Now, listen, fellas.
I've been in this can 40 years, and my one ambition-
- Is to get out.
- Oh, shut up!
No.
It's to win the- the Institutional Championship three times.
You won it twice already and nearly copped it again last year.
- I would've too if my third baseman hadn't sat down on me.
- Sat down on you?
- Yes.
- Electrocuted.
Look out for his arm, will you?
And now, St. Louis and that other gorilla... have to walk out on me just one week before this big game.
Now, here's what I want you to do, fellas.
I'm pretty old.
I haven't got very far to go.
But I'd be the happiest guy in any jail if I could cop this game today.
Now, will you go in and fight and try to win for old Pop?
- That's the way to talk.
Now, remember our slogan-
From first base to second base to third base, we roam.
Be it ever so humble, there's no base like home.
That's the place that counts- home base.
And remember who you're playin' with- a bunch of crooks.
No ethics.
Show 'em that you're gentlemen.
I want everything in this game on the up-and-up.
- Like needles!
Go after those guys now!
You know, St Louis, what my ambition is?
To ride on a real train with towels and everything.
In the distance, one sees the gray walls and towers... of dear old Bensonatta.
- Home again, pal.
- Yeah, and I'm glad to get back.
Now have you got that poem for Judy, ya half-wit?
Why, certainly.
I got it right here.
There ya are.
How are ya, Bill?
How's your team?
We'll give you a game, all right.
If our pitcher hadn't busted out, you wouldn't have a chance.
- Oh, yeah?
- Good luck.
- Same to you.
Now, listen, fellas, this game is gonna be on the square... and be gentlemen at all times.
- Sure, sure.
Where's your pitcher?
- There he is.
- Oh, is this your pitcher?
- Yeah.
- Now, remember, the game's gotta be on the up-and-up.
- Okay.
- None of that, you know.
And none of that.
- No?
- Not through the game.
- And none of this!
See what I mean?
- Where's your pitcher?
- Right here, buddy.
Oh, uh, I've heard about you.
- You just heard the rules, didn't ya?
- Sure.
- None of that!
- Say, what's the idea?
- And none of that!
- Come on!
Leave him alone!
And none of that!
- You don't have to show him that.
- No?
- Didn't I tell you there was none of that?
- Sure!
- And that?
- Well, how about this?
- Say, what's the idea?
Leave that bat alone!
- Come on!
Play ball, you guys!
All right, everybody ready?
Good luck.
- Come on!
- Lots of luck.
Go right to it.
Over the fence.
- I'll get that ball for ya, Warden.
- Oh, let me get it.
Okay to come in?
- Good-bye, dear.
Good luck.
St. Louis!
Hello, Danny.
Gee, I'm sorry to see you kids back here again.
Oh, that's all right, kid.
I told 'em I'd be back, and I never break my word.
Besides, I'll tell ya, it wasn't so much fun out there as you might think.
You know, traveling' around by yourself all alone.
- Wasn't I with you?
- Yeah, that's what I mean.
Say, what are you gonna do, kid?
I don't know.
I'll go back to the old racket, I suppose.
No, no.
No, no.
You won't go back to the old racket.
You're goin' right to New England.
- New England?
- Sure.
- Steve's waitin' for you.
- Steve's waitin' for me?
Well, I'm tellin' ya he's waitin'-
Listen, he gave us a message to give to you.
He
- He told us to tell ya-
What was that message that he gave us?
Well, he told us to tell you all about the- the birds and the- the lilacs- you know, flowers- and the-the blue skies... and, uh, the love what comes but once-
Well, the meat of the whole thing is you're to go back to New England.
Yeah, yeah.
Now, what he's trying to tell you is this.
You know.
You know, the birds are singin'... and the- and the flowers... and the river's kind of-
It's pretty, ain't it?
And it's all
- It's-
Well, listen, here's the dough for you to go back there with.
- I don't need it.
- Sure you do.
Them Chinese mannequin coats cost a lot of jack.
- Chinese coats?
- Why, certainly.
Steve's gonna take you to China.
- We told you that, didn't we?
- Sure.
Tokyo, Honolulu- All them Chinese towns.
Say, are you kiddin'?
No.
You mean Steve is...
really waiting' for me?
Say, what the heck- Listen, baby.
I am tellin' ya on my word, and I never break my word.
That's one thing I'll say for the louse.
Hey, Sam.
Now here's your big chance.
We're gonna send you in there to hit that ball.
Do you think you can do it?
- Sure, Pop.
- That's a boy.
Okay.
Now, listen.
If ever you laid on an apple in your life, lay on this one.
It's our only chance to win.
You'll do that for your old pals, won't you?
- Sure.
- All right.
Do it for Pop.
- That's the boy.
Hello there, Warden.
So you're the fellow that never breaks his word?
Oh, now, listen, Warden.
I'm sorry about that.
But I had to leave in such a hurry, I just couldn't say good-bye.
You know that this doubles your sentences, don't you?
- All right, I'll redouble.
- Gee, that makes me 286 years.
I won't need that.
- Take them to the cooler.
- Oh, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.
Judy's gone, and we're losing the ball game.
- Huh?
Yeah?
- That's right, Chief.
Three runs behind.
Take 'em to the cooler.
Send St. Louis and uncle Dan to the cooler when we're losing the ball game?
Oh, now, listen, Warden.
You're not gonna do that.
With Jean and the gang waiting' for us out there, we gotta win that ball game.
Look here, St. Louis.
Can I trust you and Dan... to go out to that diamond without leaving us?
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll give you my word... and you know that I never break my word.
- No?
- Well, never twice in succession.
Take 'em to the cooler.
After the game!
Why does a fireman wear red suspenders?
- To keep his trousers up.
Say, St. Louis, you know that fellow McDowell on the other side?
Now, don't give him a high ball.
Keep 'em down and close-
I don't care if there was a rumble seat on the car or if there wasn't!
If it hadn't been for you, we wouldn't be spendin' a month in the cooler!
Will you shut up about that rumble seat?
Take that cigar out of your mouth.
You're in training.
- All right!
- And I'm tellin' ya, there was a rumble seat.
I don't care.
Ever since I met you, I've been in trouble.
Yeah, well, you know, you're no turning point-
St. Louis!
Say, what are you guys runnin'?

Hello, Mac.
Hello, Step.
Great fight tonight.
Did you like it?
Great.
The boys are waiting for you.
Hello, Bill.
How are you?
Hiya, Frank.
Hello, you all.
Mac, my boy, I'm proud of you.
Hello, Mac.
That was some fight you put up there.
Did you like it?
I'll say I did.
Mountains snap their fingers at times since this old world began.
But they're mole hills compared to the mountains you'll climb when a gal cares for a man.
Rivers have been flowing for years, part of the mighty plan.
But they're ripples compared to the river of tears when a gal weeps for a man.
Beggar or millionaire crooked or on the square
Mansion or furnished room, she doesn't care when a woman loves a man.
Sharing his pain and ills both going through the mill
Just being miserable gives her a thrill when a woman loves a man.
He may be conceited, a weakling who cheated
But still one woman in town can't help but feel that some day he'll settle down.
When you pile up your seven seas mountains and rocks and trees and you're up against a thing stronger than these when a woman loves a man.
Beggar or millionaire crooked or on the square
Hello, Lil.
Mansion or furnished room, she doesn't care when a woman loves a man.
Sharing his pain and ills both going through the mill
See you later, sweetheart.
Okay, honey, I'll be right here.
... When a woman loves a man...
Okay?
Don't forget.
He may be conceited, a weakling who's cheated
But still one woman in town can't help but feel that some day he'll settle down.
Pile up the seven seas mountains, rocks and trees you're up against a thing stronger than these
When a woman loves a man.
Crooked or on the square
Mansion or furnished room, she doesn't care when a woman loves a man.
Pooh-pooh-pa-dooh.
Furnished ah... room with a... just being satisfied knowing... when a woman loves a man.
Pooh-pooh-pa-dooh.
...a weakling who cheated but still one woman in town can't help but feel that someday he'll settle down, pooh-pooh-pa-doo...
Pile up the seven seas ... rocks and trees and you're up against a thing stronger than these when a woman pooh-pooh-pa-dooh.
Doesn't your elbow ever get tired?
I'm giving a party.
A party?
To whom?
To me.
I just canned my manager.
I'm looking for another one.
Do you know one?
Keep training on that and you wouldn't need a manager.
Well, I certainly don't need one around here.
These heels in this town won't fight me.
I got 'em scared.
I'm gonna leave this bird flat on its so and so.
Going away?
Why not?
An outsider's got no chance around here.
You couldn't break into a fight game with a crowbar.
They got it all sewed up.
It's a racket.
So is tennis.
But you got to be sober to play it.
Liquor never hurt my old man.
He's been drinking all his life and he's 80 years old.
Wait.
It'll get him.
Well, as far as I'm concerned, you can have me right now.
I'll be sorry to see you go, Jerry.
Yeah?
You're a funny girl, Fannie.
I gotta be.
That's how I make my living.
No.
I mean you pass up these other mugs around here and come over and sit down with me.
Why?
I don't know.
Maybe it's because you seem kinda lonesome.
And I've taken you for a square shooter.
And then again maybe it's because sometimes you seem like a little boy.
You know, Fannie... when you ain't clownin'
You ain't bad lookin'.
Honest?
Hey, Fannie.
I got some friends here I want you to meet.
By and by, Mac.
But I want you to meet 'em now.
Oh, I'm having too good a time right here.
Aw, come on.
Scram!
You slug nutty ape, don't tell me to scram.
Well, then, amscray!
Oh, Mac, what's the matter with you?
You're acting like a little baby.
Certainly.
Who do you think you...
Who do you think you are, anyway?
I'll show you who I am.
Sit down, Mac.
Sit down.
This guy don't like the way I talk.
He wants to know who I am.
All right, Mac, all right.
Listen, honey, you're too big a guy to hit anyone outside the ring.
Why, a great fighter like you don't start brawls in a café.
Besides, you have your reputation to consider.
Yeah, I guess you're right, Lil.
I gotta think about my reputation.
But somebody better tip that ape off who I am.
You know it's lucky for that cheese champ I didn't take a pump at him.
He's got all the luck.
Ain't it the truth?
Better get ready for your next number, Fannie.
I'm coming right along, Step.
Stick around, I'll be back.
Say, listen.
Lay off those window washers.
Those pooh-pooh-padooh- pooh-poops.
If anyone said that to me I'd turn on him like a flash.
I looked him right in the eye and told the big Bozo if he didn't marry me I'd shoot myself.
And what did he say?
You should have seen his face when he begged me for time to think it over.
I told him he had to make up his mind and let me know by tonight.
Yeah?
Sure.
Come in.
Package for you, Miss Wilson.
Thanks.
It's from him.
A wedding present.
Ain't it exciting?
Well, I never could say he wasn't liberal.
A gun!
Well, of all the dirty low-down tricks.
Somebody sent you a present?
He must think a lot of you.
The dirty tramp.
What do you want to call him names for?
He figured a poor little innocent girl like you needed something for protection.
Oh, yeah?
It ain't his fault if it came five years too late.
Oh, you think you're funny, don't you?
That's McCloskey, he's always butting in here.
I don't want to see that pest.
Fannie, if you're not in, why don't you say so?
I'm not in.
Oh, your brother.
Yeah, that bright young lawyer.
Are you decent?
Where's Fannie?
Fannie, congratulations.
Congratulations, thanks.
Congratulations, thank you.
I won, I won, Fannie.
Verdict for the plaintiff on a fifty-fifty basis, and I get half.
Half!
The jury just brought it in.
I wanted you to be the first to hear it.
You mean you won a case?
My first first important litigation.
Didn't I tell you, Fannie, I couldn't lose?
Not under section 346 of our Code.
The minute I said it to the judge, he said to me, Harry, my boy...
I beg your pardon?
What kind of a case was it?
Oh, damages.
Damages for difammation of my client's character.
Two hundred thousand dollars, I sued for.
How much was the verdict?
From 3 o'clock till just now the jury was out deliberating.
Tomorrow you'll see it in all the papers.
I gave all the reporters a copy of my speech.
You think I'm a fool?
Yeah, but how much was the verdict?
Of course, I could have sued under Section 541 but I picked Section 346 because it also provided for putative damages
Smart, ain't it?
Harry, how much?
Fannie, don't be so mercenary.
I'm telling you, I won my first big case.
Think of the glory when you see...
Never mind the glory.
What I want to know is how much did you win?
Well, the verdict was for 6 cents.
Six c...
Yeah, but the very fact that the verdict was in my favor definitely makes it...
Six cents.
And you get half.
Three cents.
What's the matter with you there?
Well, now you can buy an envelope and a two-cent stamp and you can write home and tell Mama.
And for that I paid three years in Law School, two years' office rent.
He had to be a lawyer.
Nothing else would do.
A lawyer he had to be.
(IN YIDDISH)
That's all right, Fannie.
You'll get it all back someday.
Yeah, three cents.
Now that I've broken the ice you can never can tell what's going to happen.
What's this?
Under Section 729 it's a felony to possess a deadly weapon.
Oh, a guy sent it to me.
If he meant it as an insult I think you've got a very good suit under Section... 819, yes, 819.
Yeah, well I'll sue him for worse than that if he don't marry me.
Say, breech of promise is a good case, too.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll take your case fifty-fifty and believe me, you couldn't do better no place...
Second number Fannie.
Okay.
...because I know all the judges and if you listen to me
I could get you at least...
Six cents!
Please, Fannie, who's asking you?
I had a similar case once with Mathilda Levcovitch
Her uncle M. Levcovitch came to me and told me that Montgomery Levcovitch said to her...
Listen, Miss Ritz,
I didn't ask you to come to my table just to hear myself talk.
Get me?
Hey, if you wanna hold hands with somebody, I'd be delighted.
Sit down, Jerry.
Relax.
Mac's only clowning.
If you got any complaints to make we got a special department for them.
Stay right here.
I'm gonna go change.
Take my advice.
Don't even shake hands with him.
Unless you shake both of them.
Go to your rooms.
There's a fight!
What's going on here?
Who's fighting?
Hey, what's the matter?
Cut out your shoving.
Who's shoving?
You're shoving me I'm not shoving you.
Aw, that's a lie, cut it out, that's all.
I'm a lawyer, I can...
Bring him in here.
All you girls go to your rooms.
I'll need witnesses.
Get names and addresses.
Everyone who saw the assault.
You understand?
What are you standing here like dummies?
I'm telling you I need witnesses.
Go out and get witnesses...
What's the matter with you?
Standing and looking here.
Well, you finally got a fight.
I'd like to see this guy fight when he isn't drunk.
Maybe when he isn't drunk he wouldn't fight.
This guy's got a real wallop.
Yes?
He fought McCloskey once.
Is that possible?
Did I kill him?
Not yet.
He's still breathing a little.
What hospital did they take him to?
I always send him flowers.
Well, this time you won't have to bother.
Are you all right, kid?
All right?
He never touched me.
How could you say such a thing, "he never touched me."
Why, it was a malicious unprovoked assault.
For nothing, for nothing at all a guy jumps up and he hits you.
He did not, I hit him first.
Oh, you, you, you...
you shlemiel...
You don't know what you're talking about.
He hit you first.
Oh, go on, I hit him first.
Fannie.
If my brother says he hit you first, he hit you first.
Yeah?
It's a clear case of assault and battery.
Well he couldn't do nothing to me for it, could he?
I'm gonna sue him.
You are?
Yes, damages.
Heavy damages.
And I think under Section 952
I might even make it with intent to kill.
But I didn't intend to kil him.
No, he hit you with intent to kill.
He did not, I hit him.
My brother says he hit you with intent to kill.
And if my brother says he hit you with intent to kill
You're already dead.
I'll kill him if I ever get him in a ring.
He might at that.
Say, kid, who's your manager?
I ain't got any, but all I need is a good manager...
But you got a good lawyer.
Sure, you got a good lawyer.
Step, you really think the kid's got it?
Sure looked it out there.
You say he did have a wallop, didn't he?
Wallop?
Say, when he landed that right to McCloskey's jaw it looked like curtains for McCloskey.
You want a manager?
You've got a manager.
Yeah, where is he?
Him.
I, I, I, I'm a lawyer.
No, you're a manager.
Harry, don't argue with me, I've had an idea.
Don't get me angry, listen, I'm telling you, you're a...
Harry, you're a manager.
All right, I'm a manager.
So, all right.
One, two.
One, two.
One, two.
One, two.
One, two.
One, two.
One, two.
One, two.
One, two.
Fannie.
What?
Please, come quick.
I want to talk to you very privately.
One, two.
One, two.
One, two...
Fannie, it'a a calamity.
It's worse, it's a catastrophe.
It's, it's, it's terrible.
Here, look for yourself.
Read there.
The second preliminary on tomorrow night's card is a four-round bop between Slug McNut and Jerry Moore.
How Moore got on the card at all is a mystery.
He hails from Racine, Wisconsin, where he has a record of four fights.
He won the technical decision over Sandy Brown.
Read, read. read further.
He won the technical decision over Sandy Brown by claiming a foul.
His second fight was with Cocky Wexler.
He dropped to his back in the second round and again claimed a foul but the referee counted him out.
Next he was matched up against Dopey Dwyer
Again he dropped to his back in the first round but was saved by the bell at the count of eight.
He failed to come back for the second round claiming he had been doped.
His last fight in Racine was with Lefty Schnitzler
Lefty landed a light left hook to the stomach and Moore promptly dropped on his back.
Instead of counting him out, the referee picked him up and rushed him out of the ring to save him from mob violence.
That was the last scene of him in Racine.
Here is one guy that you can't knock off his back.
He's a dog.
He's a lay-down dog.
Maybe it ain't as bad as it sounds.
Let's look.
Fannie!
He's still on his back.
On his back?
Would you like a pillow?
Look.
The cord broke.
Look, the cord broke!
Get off your back, you turtle.
I gotta lie down once in a while.
Once in a while?
With him it's a habit.
Get up on those round heels.
Let me rest.
That's a tough guy I'm up against tomorrow night.
Yeah?
Well, read that.
If I'm not asking too much, would you mind sitting up?
Them newspaper guys has always been sore at me.
Yeah, you and Peggy Joyce.
Who's she?
Listen,
I had to flip that matchmaker 200 dollars to get you into this fight.
I did it because I thought you could scrap and I wanted to give you a chance.
I spent 15 hundred dollars training you.
Why, this stuff alone cost me $920.
And it wouldn't bring $150 in a foresale.
Who's asking you?
I made a statement.
Why didn't you tell me you had sleeping sickness?
I tell you it was the booze that made him fight in the café.
He's a booze fighter.
Hey, pipe down, sawyer.
Sawyer?
I don't even know him.
Tomorrow night you fight to win.
That's something new to you, ain't it?
What do you mean?
I mean you gotta win.
But not by yelling foul the first time you're hit below the eyes.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Turn out the lights, them guys wanna be alone.
Aw, pluck him, he's a ham.
Break!
Break it up!
Come on, break it.
Now listen you guys, get in here and fight.
I mean the both of you.
Get together, come on!
Say, they oughta kill that guy and his manager too.
Hey, turn on the lights.
I wanna read.
Come on, Jerry, give it to him.
Go on!
Fannie, look!
He's on his back!
Get off your back!
Get off your back, you turtle.
Get off your back!
Get up!
You heard me.
Get up!
Fannie, he can fight.
Yeah, if he'll stay off his back.
Mornings, I'll be gettin' up
Mornin's I'll be settin' up a tiny table for two.
Breakfast, I'll be making his breakfast he'll be taking his shave and his shower.
My happy hour.
The coffee is steamin'
Oh, boy, what I'm dreamin' while I'm cookin' breakfast for the one I love.
My baby likes bacon and that's what I'm bakin' while I'm cookin' breakfast For the one I love
Our life has been so nice and chummy right from the start
When I won his tummy
I won his heart.
My baby is happy.
No wonder I'm happy while I'm cooking breakfast for the one I love.
I'm baking' that biscuit
He's willing to risk it while I'm cookin' breakfast for the one I love.
He's crazy for grapefruit
I'd rather have grape-nuts
While I'm cooking breakfast
For the one I love.
A plate of steaming oatmeal
Taste it!
Aw, schucks!
Who the heck wants oatmeal sprinkled with Lux?
To show that he's grateful
He eats a big plateful.
And faints right after breakfast
For the one I love.
Ah, good morning.
I see you're waiting for me, as usual.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Who could that be?
I don't know.
Hey, listen, you.
What's the idea of attaching my share of the game on the Merillo fight tonight?
You've been tailing me long enough with that joke suit of yours.
Joke?
I'm laughing to you.
Oh, I'm wise to you.
You're trying to get my goat.
Goat?
I don't want your goat.
I want damages.
He wouldn't have gone to court.
It's all your doing, you cheap little scheister.
Scheister?
I warn you under Section 541, difammation of character.
I oughta take a smack at you.
Look out.
Section 428 provides and now I am under Section 513.
With glasses on.
Come on, touch me, touch me.
I'm gonna tear you apart.
Wait a minute!
Tear me apart.
As if I was afraid.
You ain't gonna tear nobody apart.
Oh, no?
Who's gonna stop me?
Who do you think?
Wait.
Don't fight here.
Fight in the ring.
Where you get paid for it.
I'd like to get that Bozo in the ring.
Well, that could be arranged.
What I want is this attachment off.
When I fight I don't want nothing bothering me.
Oh, you want to settle out of court.
Well, that could be arranged amicably or legally.
What's your proposition?
What right have you to attach my dough?
Because under Section 1122...
Harry, will you stop talking in sections.
Tell him what we want.
Mr McCloskey...
If you will agree to give my client a match my client will agree to withdraw the suit.
Fight him?
With pleasure.
All right.
Then I'll send you up the papers tomorrow to sign.
Then I'll witdraw the suit and remove the attachment.
Okay.
Say, if he can sue me for what I did to him in the café they can send me to the chair for what I'll do to him in the ring
A laughing hiena.
Hey, is that guy laughing at me?
Let him laugh.
He's so dumb he don't know that he who laughs last lasts laugh...
laughs... last laugh...
You know the one I mean.
The one about laughing'.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Didn't I tell you I'd get you your first big chance?
Yeah.
You see how it worked?
Maybe I didn't send you through Law School for nothing.
And he can't back out.
Because under Section 296 a verbal agreement...
Is not worth the paper it's written on.
Fannie, how could you say a thing...
Eat, eat, eat.
All right, I'll eat.
Thank you.
But anyhow I'm the one that put it over, you must admit this.
You put it over?
Oh, Harry, how can you say that?
I'm not saying...
Now, listen, Harry.
You know it was me that winked at you.
I admit that you winked...
You never would have thought of it.
Now, Harry, listen, they were gonna fight and I said... don't fight here, go fight in a ring.
Yes.
Yes, you said that.
I give in to you there...
Listen, Harry, give me credit.
I'm giving you credit...
Harry, I put it over.
You put it over?
Yeah.
All right, you put it over.
Am I saying anything?
Eat.
So I'll eat.
But...
You put it over.
McCloskey shoots the right across to Jerry's chin, just missed...
Jerry folds up after that one.
I don't blame him.
They clinch.
Moore ties up another cut coming out.
It makes McClosky sore and he tears after Jerry shooting right and left to the body.
It's beginning to look like a fight.
Moore is sure taking them, McCloskey leads again...
Jerry is recovering as we go...
He shoots the right across to McCloskey's chin, no harm done...
This boy is tough!
Jerry is wide open and is jolted by a terrific left hook that sent him to his heels.
McCloskey aims right at the jaw...
Moore is dragging McCloskey to the right and a left to the stomach
Moore holding on for dear life...
There goes the bell saving Mr Jerry Moore at the end of the second round.
Stand by, ladies and gentlemen for the third round.
Well, Fannie, where do you want the body sent?
I don't know where Mac lives.
I'll have it sent to your house.
Oh, yeah?
Yes.
Listen, you haven't been getting away with this either.
Who do you think you are?
You and your wisecracks.
Cut the argument here.
Fannie, you're on.
Yeah?
Well not for a long time.
There goes the bell for the third round.
McCloskey dashes out of his corner
Moore meets him halfway
They spar around, both looking for an opening
Moore leads with a left to the head, not much steam behind his punches...
McCloskey counters with a left jab trying to get set with that deadly right
He lets it go and it lands on the point of Jerry Moore's chin.
Fannie, that's enough, you gotta go.
Not now, just a minute...
Go ahead, we'll call you when he's knocked down.
Oh, yeah?
Who says he's gonna be knocked down?
I'll be here when you're finished!
You think I'm afraid?
Otto Kahn, the big millionaire is a man who's crazy for art.
Singing Slovaks, Greeks and Romanians look to him for their stunts.
Gaze upon a dainty vocalist with artistic temperament and to think that great philanthropist he wouldn't even give me a cent.
Is there something the matter with Otto Kahn, or something the matter with me?
I wrote a note and I told him what a hit I would make
He sent it back and marked it opened up by mistake.
Why, I'd even get fatter for Otto Kahn as all prima donnas must be.
I met Galla Hershey and I trilled like a bird
She handed me a razor without saying a word.
And if my high C won't hand over a thrill
I think my tra-la-la-la will.
And the words that I bring and the song that I sing is a song of a heart that's free.
And the words that I bring and the song that I sing is a song of a heart that's free.
McCloskey's still at the peek
Morris is using his famed left trying a little scientific punch in this round.
McCloskey is wise to this and he wants to deliver that one too.
They shoot left and right both boys gather at the center of the ring, the referee warns the boys
McCloskey shoots a terrific right and he missed.
He's punched but he's missin'!
Yeah, but I'll stuff you one, and I won't miss.
You'll do what?
You heard me.
Listen now, you...
One, two, three, four, five six, seven, eight, nine
Ten!
McCloskey is out!
And so is this vile friend.
My Jerry won!
My Jerry won!
Jerry won!
Jerry won!
Oh, Hello, Jerry.
Hello, Step.
Great stuff.
Thanks.
There's a table down at the club.
Thanks.
Congratulations, Jerry.
Congratulations, champ.
Hello, Ned.
Gee, you look swell.
Thanks.
Say, I rented this.
Hello, Jerry.
Some wallop.
Hello.
Your right's a forker See you later, Jerry.
Thanks.
The coffee is steamin'
Oh, boy, what I'm dreamin'
While I'm cooking breakfast, breakfast
For the one I love.
Now, my baby likes bacon so it's bacon I'm makin'
While I'm cookin', cooking' breakfast
For the one I love.
My baby is happy, happy
No wonder I'm happy.
While I'm cookin' breakfast
For the one I love.
Come to me, ye dancing fools
Throw away your golden rules lovely ladies down in Hades
Satan will be waiting with the pleasure you crave
Satisfy your appetites with a thousand wild delights
Earthly troubles fade like bubbles when you let the devil show you how to behave
Don't be frightened and don't believe in Mr Devil's lies
Hallelujah
The Lord is waiting in the golden skies
So, throw up your hands sing out your souls and send the devil where he belongs kicking a hole in the sky.
Laugh at the rain laugh at the snow up on your heels, down on your toes kicking a hole in the sky
Laugh at your pains, laugh at your blues we'll have the rainbows coming in twos
Kicking a hole in the sky.
Sing Hosannah when you're upset and cursing and sing, sing Hosannah and don't forget God's children but sing on
This war you won't and that war you can and we're warned the times are heavenly sent
Kicking a hole in the...
Let the devil shovel his hole in...
He can never gather your soul in... if you'll all just kick him a hole in the sky.
Well, you came through.
Gee, I'm proud of you.
Are you?
So am I.
I'll see you in the dressing room after the next song.
All right.
Hello, Lil.
Hello, Jerry.
I just came over to tell you how happy I am.
Yeah?
It's time somebody licked that big bag of wind.
And I'm tickled to death it was you that done it.
What?
I know you're surprised my talking this way.
But I've been rooting for you.
Yes, I have.
Ever since that night he talked to you when you were drinking.
Do you remember how I dragged him away?
But I thought you was...
I know.
You thought I was sweet on him.
Say...
why, I couldn't fall for that guy.
I have to be nice to him.
You know, he's a big spender here.
You understand.
Don't you, Jerry?
Oh, sure, sure, I understand.
I'm giving a little party up at the house tonight.
I'd sure like to have you come up.
Fannie kind of expects me to be with her...
I know, but you're entitled to some fun.
I'm just crazy to have you.
Won't you, Jerry?
Please.
Well, er... er...
But I gotta give credit, where credit is due, and Jerry deserves an awful lot of credit because he followed my instructions to the letter.
If prize fighters would only realize what a good lawyer could do for them
Yessir, every paper that he signed was legally 100% correct.
And if you girls don't think I'm gonna make him the world's champion... you're even dumber than I thought you were.
You're gonna make him the world's champion.
Well, that is, of course, provided he doesn't lose his head.
You mean, if he doesn't lose my head.
Maybe.
And besides being a great fighter you'd be handsome if it wasn't for that nose.
What's the matter with my nose?
Jerry, why don't you have it fixed?
Hm?
You'd look swell.
Honest you would.
Aw, you're kidding me.
No, I'm on the level.
The one consuming passion of my life is not to play a fiddle or a pipe.
I want to be a dancer my spirit fancy free
(...)
I long to be so slender and so slim.
To show my limb to him and him and him
My dress is a cocoon
If I don't breathe I'll swoon
Oh, I can't get this outfit off too soon
I'll take it off, yes I will, no I wouldn't...
Oh, it's gorgeous to be graceful to fleet and float and fly.
to make like this and make like that and let the evening breeze go by.
In public I'm Phoenecian but Grecian on the sly
I bought myself a bearskin
It makes me so appealing
When I dance in my bearskin
I show a lot of feeling
Oh, it's gorgeous to be graceful
(...)
It's gorgeous to be graceful and to fleet and float and fly.
You won't disappoint me, will you, Jerry?
I'll see you later.
Come in.
Gee, Fannie, you was funny.
Did you like it, Jerry?
I like everything you do.
That dance certainly is hard work, ain't it?
It sure is.
It always tires me out.
Yeah.
Guess you're pretty tired yourself.
Yeah, I am.
That was a tough scrap I had.
Would you mind very much if I didn't wait for you tonight?
If you don't want to wait, Jerry, it's all right with me.
Well, you understand...
Sure.
I understand.
Well...
Good night.
Good night, Jerry.
Hey, I wonder how much it would cost to get this nose of mine fixed up.
You mean by one of those trick surgeons?
Well, I wouldn't want no carpenter doing it.
I imagine it costs plenty.
What's the use of having it fixed when some guy will come along and unfix it?
What guy?
Say, I look like a different person.
Don't I?
I'll say so.
Didn't I tell you you'd be handsome?
You know, a lot of people is gonna be surprised when they see me, eh, Lil?
You're the only one that knows about it.
I'm gonna be awfully proud of you, Jerry.
That's why I done it.
Somebody's at the door.
Hello, Fannie.
Hello, Jerry.
So this is where you've been hanging out.
So you had it fixed, eh?
I'm pretty good lookin' now, eh, Fannie?
Yeah, you'll look great steppin' into the ring.
Thanks.
But when they carry you out...
Hey, listen, the Bozo don't live that can mess up my nose.
No wonder I couldn't find you for the past two weeks.
Hello, Fannie.
Oh...
You.
Swell apartment.
Swell nose.
Swell dame.
And for you a swell finish.
What do you mean?
They come and go with you, don't they?
One champ after the other.
It's a very good idea, don't you think, Fannie?
I'll give you a better idea.
You leave him alone.
He's got a career ahead of him.
And he don't need a tramp like you to ruin him.
Don't you dare call me a tramp.
You've never been anything else but a tramp.
Don't talk like that to her, Fannie.
She's gonna hear what I've gotta say and like it.
And you too, you big boob.
You weren't fooling me.
I knew you were running around with her.
But I thought you'd get wise to yourself.
Why, a blind man can see what she is.
Fannie, you got no right to talk like this.
She's heard worse than anything I've said.
Let her tell you what Mac's wife said to her when she took up with him.
Oh, go ahead, rave on.
I'll do worse than rave.
No, you won't.
I won't let you.
Not about my future wife.
Your what?
Sure, me and Lil's gonna get married.
Oh, that's how it is.
Yes, that's how it is.
If you have anything more to tell on me spill it right now, or shut your big mouth and get out.
So you think she's gonna marry you.
What an awakening you're gonna have.
Aw, Fannie, why can't we all be friends?
I'll always be your friend, Jerry.
And you'll keep right on being me manager.
You know you're the real manager.
Sure, I'll manage you.
Anything you say.
Of course, Jerry and I always did appreciate that you were a good businesswoman.
That's what I am, a businesswoman?
That's all it's ever been with us, Jerry.
Business.
Sure, that's all.
That's all.
Mountains snap their fingers at times since this whole world began
But they're mole hills compared to the mountains she'll climb when a gal cares for a man.
Rivers have been flowing for years part of the mighty plan
But they're ripples compared to the river of tears when a gal weeps for a man.
Beggar or millionaire crooked or on the square
mansion or furnished room she doesn't care when a woman loves a man.
Fannie certainly puts a lot of feeling into that song, don't she?
Both going through the mill...
Jerry, darling, please fasten this for me.
Just being miserable gives her a thrill.
Thank you, honey.
When a woman loves a man.
He may be conceited, a weakling who cheated
But still one woman in town
Can't help but feel that some day he'll settle down
Pile up the seven seas mountains and rocks and trees
and you're up against a thing stronger than these
When a woman... loves... a man.
Oh, hello, Fannie.
Fannie, I tell you, will you laugh.
I just heard one of the funniest stories I ever heard in my life.
I don't want to hear it.
You're not acting like yourself at all, Fannie.
You haven't been for the last four weeks.
And I can't bear to see you like this.
Honest, you're making me very unhappy.
And you shouldn't do it.
Even if you've lost that prize fighter, you've still got me.
And besides, what have you got to be unhappy about?
You've got your health, you're making good money.
You're getting offers from Broadway managers.
Why, you're a big success, Fannie.
And if you listen to me...
Harry.
Yes, dear.
Will you do me a favor?
Sure.
Leave me alone.
Leave you alone.
It's sad enough when a girl like you grieves herself sick over a cheap prize fighter.
What do you see in him, anyhow?
Just answer me this, tell me.
What do you see in him?
I wouldn't care if she was on the level.
But she's only a cheap gold digger.
Oh, what's the difference who takes him?
One gold digger is the same as the other.
She only wants him while he's champ.
Then she'll give him the air like she did Mac.
Oh, he'll see through her in time.
And besides, you know, we're still his manager.
Yeah.
We're still his manager.
Sure we are.
I'd almost forgotten.
Harry, I want you to do something.
I want you to arrange a return match with McCloskey.
McCloskey's in great shape.
He's likely to lick him.
Do as I tell you, see McCloskey's manager.
Tell them they can have a return match, the sooner the better.
Go on, do it.
Do it now.
Fannie...
Oh, Harry, I know what I'm doing.
All right.
Don't get excited.
I'll do it.
I've never seen anything like it in my life.
Everybody's excited around here.
Love.
Crazy people.
Why, I didn't think of it before.
You're doing fine.
But what's the idea?
when you had him going, why didn't you knock him out?
I'm playing with him, I'll murder...
Save your wind, save your wind.
All you have to do is use your left.
Stick the left as fast as you can and you can't lose.
If you get your left on his face...
Stop talkin'.
Did I say something?
You can't lose, Mac.
Go out there and sock him.
Just sock him.
Smell, smell.
Drink.
Take, take.
It's good for you.
Spit there.
Relax, will ya?
Please!
Keep your left in his face all the time.
Come on, you got him, Jerry!
That's it, that's it!
Go for the nose.
One!
Go for the nose.
Two!
What are you talking to him for?
Did you hear me?
Go for the nose.
Beat his nose, he'll try to protect it.
The nose, the beezer.
The beezer, the schnozzle...
The beezer, go for the nose.
That's it!
You got him going, Mac.
That's fine!
Go on!
That's it.
Don't let up on him.
Go on, hit him right on the beezer.
Shut up, will ya.
I know what I'm doin'.
two, three, four... five, six, seven, eight, nine, out.
Here, put him here, please.
I want the dope on this.
Wait a minute, boys.
Please, wait a minute.
Give me a chance
I'll give you all a statement as soon as I know what I'm talking about.
Wait a minute, please.
You see what you've done?
You've lost a championship for us.
What was the idea of yelling
"Hit him in the nose", "Hit him in the beezer"
"Hit him in the schnozzle."
Because I liked his old nose better.
Yeah.
Did I kill him?
Did I kill him?
You should live so long.
Fannie, tell him.
Did he kill him?
What are you doing here?
I just came in to see if I could be of any help.
Yeah, a lot of help you are.
You doublecrossing...
Tipping that guy off just when I had him licked.
Oh, go on.
Get out of here.
You really want me to go?
You made me lose the championship.
Fannie, what did you do it for?
I'm sorry, Jerry.
But somebody had to bring you to your senses.
A little longer and nothing could have saved you.
I couldn't stand by and see you dragged down by somebody like her.
Thanks for the tip, Fanny.
But I'd have knocked him out, anyway.
Yes, you would.
Mac, what are you doing in here?
I came here to tell this this punch drunk pug to lay off you from now on.
Lillian, you're not...
Look what you did to his nose, Mac.
Well, darling, don't be long.
I'll wait for you out in the car.
Right.
Now get this.
If I ever catch you with Lil again I'll beat your ears off.
Are you gonna let him get away with that?
Get out of here.
You better get out before he throws you out.
Him throw me out?
Ha!
Hey, what is this here?
How many times I have to tell you you shouldn't fight for nothing.
Let him fight.
Get in there, Jerry.
Use that right!
Get in closer!
Sock him!
Fannie, under Section 219 you can't do a thing like that.
Never mind Section 219.
Hit him in the midsection.
Go on in there, Jerry.
Go on, Jerry, you got him.
You got him, Jerry.
You got him.
One, two, three, four, five and five are ten.
You're out.
I knew you could do it.
You can lick any guy in the world.
You mean we can.

The Hermit Crab
Marine Crustacean
The Hermit crab has a soft abdomen and takes refuge in abandoned mollusc shells.
Once hidden, it becomes very lively and the "hermit" qualifier isn't justified, for it is looking for the company of its kin.
The hermit crabs in this film measure four centimetres.
Its right claw is larger than its left,
Its eyes, supported by a stem, and mobile, like its antennas and jaws.
At certain enlargements, this charming animal is transformed into a monster.
The hermit crab lives in abandoned mollusc shells, sometimes covered in sponge.
This flower pot is an anemone.
With such a weight on its back, it is not easy to be agile.
It's impossible for the anemone to eat the hermit crab...
Yet, this is shown documentary films with special effects.
The anemone's tentacles call to mind an embrace.
Microscopic hydras attach themselves to the shells.
Cirripeds:
Crustaceans fixed on the shells, spread their respiratory panache,
Theory of entering a shell:
Explore the exterior, the interior, enter the abdomen and settle in,
The hermit crab always behaves the same way when it moves into a new place without hurrying.
The sense of touch guides the hermit,
Witness this one whose eyes have been taken out,
It is impossible to lift the hermit from its shell without tearing it, given the manner in which it coils itself,
The longitudinal sectioned shell presents several openings.
The hermit crab enters and feels safe.
We can see the way the body rolls up...
By pulling the crab, it just rolls up more and more around the shell.
... unless one proceeds like this other hermit crab shell shock.
It tires its adversary on a java rhythm and jolts it to and fro.
The hermit crab is going to give a big knock.
There we go!
The expelled protests!
After a quick look at what is in store if it remains naked...
The evicted crab prefers his small shell to death,
Housing crisis.
In the sea, there are more shells than hermit crabs, so this housing crisis is purely experimental.
It shows that the crab which penetrates a shell successfully isn't tender with its homeless relatives.
A glass tube will suffice against danger.
A hermit without shelter will prefer this glass tube to remaining naked.
Once out of danger, it tries to carry it along resulting in the waltz between the glass tube and the hermit crab.
A cramped hermit.
A hermit that has lost its carapace grows quickly and is bothered by its shell.
It's going to try another larger.
It applies its theory:
After measuring the shell, it weighs this one.
Notice it seems to be heavy...
Then makes sure it"s empty and moves in.
Too heavy,
Back to reason and to the small shell.
It keeps turning the shell as if it were unfamiliar, although it has left it only a few seconds.
It must believe it never had lived here, because it can't even introduce both claws at the same time.
It holds the shell with its hind legs, so it doesn"t fall.
Regrets
You can see it hesitate before looking for a neighbouring house.
A new attempt.
Having played ball with its shell, it doesn"t have to weigh it.
It still has to measure and search it.
It enters with familiar greetings.
Now it wants a shell with an anemone.
An unsettling relative.
A black hermit arrives on the left while the white one is very busy.
The black hermit doesn't seem threatening... it"s shrivelling.
However, the white hermit crab feels menaced and throws itself against the black one.
Brawl
Great excitement is expressed in the play of the mandibles.
The black one has the lower hand, but it squeezes the white's hind leg, paralyzing it, but when the claw is released, it will get bitten.
Here is a nice jiu-jitsu:
The black hermit seems defeated, but the white hermit freezes and we see the tip of its legs in the black hermit's claw.
Notice how carefully the black hermit slowly jerks itself out.
Before letting go the protective leg, it recedes as it can.
It doesn't get far and the brawl continues.
Furious with the black hermit's escape, the white hermit chucks everything, even innocent little crabs.
Lunch on the sand.
Exquisite things can be found in the sand.
Notice the masticatory system.
Exercise:
Fun with a cork ball.
Unable to understand the excitement produced by this ball, we have resorted to showing a football match.
This ball might represent a shell without an entrance to them... cause of astonishment.
The End
Sunny day, blissful day, hopeful heart, the motor running
Laughing goal, laughing start and a beautiful drive
Passed Rome and Madrid, a trio reeling through life
Over the sea, over the land we came to realise
That a friend, a good friend
Is the best thing in the world.
A friend's always faithful
Even if the whole world collapses
So don't get upset
If your sweetheart no longer loves you
A friend, a good friend
Is the best thing that there is
Here we are at home again.
Do you see that?
No one here to open up for us.
No wonder, we've come unannounced.
- And were gone 3 months.
You can't expect the servants to be ready.
Pet, where is he?
- There he is.
Where's the dreadful bird?
What's to eat?
- Betty, where are you?
No one here.
What's that?
Look over here.
What is it?
It looks like a cuckoo.
- What's that?
A bailiff's seal?
- A bailiff's seal?
How did that get here?
We're in a nice mess.
Come here.
You are reminded of the auction of all your distrained furniture.
It will be fetched on June 18.
- At eleven in the morning.
June 18, that's today.
And it's eleven o'clock now.
Someone's made a silly joke.
I don't think this joke is much to laugh about.
Who are you calling?
- Our lawyer.
Dr. Kalmus' office here.
Helbing.
Can I speak to Dr. Kalmus?
Dr. Kalmus.
Who's there?
Here's Helbing.
The three mad musketeers are back.
Miss Mondschein, what do we do now?
Break it gently.
Pardon, who's there?
- Helbing.
Tell me what's going on?
What a good lawyer if our home's distrained whilst we're away?
You should've prevented it.
With a few words I can...
You had our instructions...
But for God's sake...
Stop a minute, please.
Don't shout at me.
- No more of your cheek!
You can't beat that!
- I won't put up with this.
It's a misunderstanding.
I don't mean you.
Hang it, be quiet now!
Did he hurt you?
- Shouting at me!
Something very unpleasant has happened in the meantime.
Something unpleasant?
What?
Give it to me.
Something very unpleasant?
What?
An earthquake?
Change of government in Lippe-Detmold?
Or perhaps your wife's had a blond baby?
Be sensible.
What... even worse.
Gentlemen, may I have your kind attention.
To break it gently, you're bankrupt.
- Bankrupt?
Yes, bankrupt.
B for beggar, A for ancient debts N for never paid, K for kept R for really penniless, U for utterly poor P for poverty, and T for... touch wood.
There's a lot of money in our bank account.
That's what you think.
- We only have to ring up.
You won't get through.
There are cells were your banker is but not phone-boxes.
Cells?
- Cells?
Yes, C like credit difficulties, E like a mess two I's like imprisoned for life.
Imprisoned?
Your money's gone.
We don't own a penny?
Are completely broke?
Broke isn't the word.
Stone broke.
If I may spell it for you...
B for...
And the same to you.
It seems to be out of order.
Cuckoo
It calls from the wilds
Dear good Bailiff
Go away You won't find anything here
The call comes from the wilds
It'll soon be time for us to stop wearing dinner jackets
Oh, how shall we feel.
We must forget about playing polo, eating oysters
Oh, how it hurts.
We had goods and money, and thousand things
Now the beautiful life's over
Instead of whiskey only lemonade
Instead of caviar, marmelade
Good God, we're bankrupt
Cuckoo
Cuckoo
It calls from the woods
Dear good Bailiff
Go away You'll find nothing here
Cuckoo
Cuckoo
It calls back from the woods
Here we are Take a firm hold
Use your muscles Then we'll manage
Look, my seal's stuck here on each piece
You can see it at a glance
The vulture's bondsman.
Dear Augustin Everything, everything's gone.
Good-bye, dear couch
Who knows, when I'll see you again
Good-bye dear silver cabinet, I'll remember you all my life
They're taking the carpet as well
Who knows who'll walk on it
They only leave the walls standing
And we, we have to go on the dol
Sweet doing nothing, doing as we please, we'll have to change
Fortune's angry with us
Money alone doesn't make you happy
But as soon as you've got no money you become nervous
We only saw work from afar
And even from afar it didn't look nice
Back!
What does that mean?
Oh God, he wants to bite me
Get out!
We're going
Dear good Bailiff
Go away, you won't find anything here
Now it's up to us
The car's the only thing he didn't take.
What do we know?
Work.
What have we learned to do?
Tennis.
Dancing.
Driving.
Something must happen.
What's wrong?
- Not a drop of petrol.
Then we must fill up.
- But where?
Where?
- We'll see.
There isn't a petrol station far and wide.
Unbelievable on such a busy road where hundreds of cars drive past daily.
Our future's ensured.
We'll get rid of our car and set up a petrol station here with the money.
And we'll call the petrol station "Cuckoo".
Sunny world, blissful world, joined us together for ever
Love dies, love blows away, friendship alone remains
Yes, you forget your kisses because fidelity's old-fashioned
Yes, we betrayed many a woman, but we stick together
A friend, a good friend
Is the best thing in the world
A friend remains a friend
Even when the whole world collapses
So don't be upset
If your sweetheart no longer loves you.
A friend, a good friend
Is the greatest treasure there is
Well and now to work.
How have we done?
Isn't it beautiful?
Slim as a bayadere.
You can fatten yourself up as well.
Children our first customer.
Pay attention, now, now, now.
Here come our first earnings.
Good day, sir.
- What can I do for you?
What would you like?
- What can I do for you?
Air.
Yes, the air's good here, we've got fantastic air.
In the tyres!
He's an idiot.
Anything else?
Water.
- Pardon?
Water.
My God, he's thirsty.
- Water for the radiator.
An idiot.
Can't we give you some petrol?
Yes, a little.
But I'd like to say you'll break my neck.
He even laughs, the stupid boy.
Is the tank here or there?
- There.
Then put some in.
- Of course.
Enough.
Was the gentleman satisfied with my water?
OK.
Have a good journey.
The air was for me.
Another one.
Is there another one?
Ten pfennigs?
Ten pfennigs.
Our own earnings.
Hello Willy, get up!
It's seven o'clock.
You must get up.
Me?
Why me?
You must go to the petrol station.
Hans will be back any moment.
You must get up.
Today you're on duty.
Yesterday I cooked and tidied up and Hans the day before.
This three shift system makes me sick.
You can never lie in.
- I can.
Even when you're so tired after eight hours working at the petrol station.
Quick, hurry, breakfast.
Hurry, quick, get up.
Hans needs his bed.
Quiet, I want to eat.
- Enjoy your meal.
Help!
Murderer!
Robber!
Police!
- Shut up!
Be quiet!
You.
- Please rock me a bit more.
How about that!
I was sleeping so well.
I hope you're not too angry with me for disturbing you.
It's great.
What can I do for you?
Guess.
Wait a minute.
I've got it!
Petrol or oil.
You're brilliant.
What do you say now?
Great.
I'd like 2 litres of oil if you can spare some.
I can.
2 litres of oil for you anytime.
One moment.
Straight away.
Thanks.
- You're welcome.
What's that?
- For our regulars.
Nice.
Thanks.
- Don't mention it.
Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Great.
Great...
Yes, that's enough for today.
I'll be right back
Brilliant... great.
Damned beast!
Now the beast's running.
Here's the tea.
Milk.
- Sorry, I forgot.
Miserable service.
Here's the milk.
Marmelade.
Here's your marmelade.
My toast!
Old pig.
Who's in there?
Doesn't it taste good?
When I think of how we ate breakfast three months ago.
You've no reason to complain.
The petrol station's doing well.
The coffee's bad.
- We've got a nice house.
The milk's burnt.
- And even bought a car.
Don't exaggerate.
Look what a row it makes.
It's a slow-combustion stove.
Move - petrol station.
What?
A sip.
- Out of the question.
Give it to me.
Give it.
- Go to work.
What am I?
Your dog?
- No, you're lazy.
Does it taste good?
- Wonderful.
I made it.
What can I do for you?
- 30 litres of petrol.
And five litres of oil.
Straight away.
What can I do for you?
- Water for the radiator.
What can I do for you?
- 20 litres of petrol.
50 litres of petrol.
A can of oil.
To drive a car, drive a car
Is the greatest weakness of every little woman
And all young girls dream
Today of a driving licence
Super cars, classy cars, with a sweet girl in it
And a sky of blue
Who wouldn't want to be her partner
And many a man calls out:
Hello, you sweet lady
Don't drive alone, you could steer wrongly
And pass by happiness
Why, my sweetheart?
I need all the room for myself
Take me with you, I know the way there and back
If the right man's at the wheel
He'll lead you to adventure
Hello, you sweet lady, don't drive alone, take me along
I know the way to paradise
Why, my dear one
Do you need all the room for yourself?
Take me with you, I'll find the way there and back
Hello, you super woman, don't drive alone, take me with you
I know the way to paradise
We forgot that!
If in spring you don't drive in company
We'll be lonely in the nicest car
Hello, you sweet lady, don't drive alone
Take me with you,
I know the way to paradise
Yes, Dr. Lutter?
I'd like to speak to Consul Cossmann.
The Consul's busy.
Hello, miss!
- Yes?
The Consul mustn't be disturbed.
- Then that's it.
I can't put you through to the Consul, he's got an urgent discussion.
I told you that the Consul's engaged.
You know exactly that the wedding doesn't depend on me.
You'd have been my wife for ages if my daughter weren't so strict with me.
Have you spoken to her at all?
- What an idea?
!
Then I'll speak to her.
- But Edith...
Good day, Mops.
I've asked you a thousand times not to call me Mops.
But Mop suits you.
I'm pleased to meet you at last.
Your father told me so much about you.
He told me less about you.
You've come just right.
I was telling your father that I'd like to speak to you in private.
That's not at all necessary.
You can go into the conference room in the meantime.
Go, march, march.
- But Lilian, but Edith...
Here, so you don't get bored, Mopsi.
Well.
- Thanks, I'll be brief.
Miss Lilian, I'd like to ask you for your father's hand.
Madam, you do us an honour but I regret to have to inform you that my father's temperament requires a firm hand which you unfortunately don't have.
I must, therefore, keep him under my control for now.
I knew it.
I knew it!
You can come back in again.
But you can't...
Give me 200 marks instead and don't talk so much.
Why 200 marks again?
I must go to the cinema and buy myself cigarettes.
Well in that case... here.
- Thanks.
Good-bye, Mops.
A splendid girl.
- Isn't she?
If only she wouldn't call me Mops.
Maestro.
What's the matter?
Why are you shining your lights on me?
Sorry, I thought you were someone else.
What can I do for you?
There must be something wrong with my car.
I filled up this afternoon, now the petrol's all gone.
We'll soon have that.
One moment.
No wonder, you're driving without a petrol cap.
So much for women drivers.
I bet I can drive better than you.
Possible.
But now I'll get you a new petrol cap.
Take your time, I'm not in a hurry.
That's too big.
- You see everything.
This one's too small.
- Then wrap something around it.
No, that would be a pity.
- You can bring it back sometime.
Yes, gladly.
What are your working hours?
If I'm not here give it to one of my colleagues.
Are your colleagues all as nice as you?
This doll is to remind you to keep your car in good shape.
What's that for?
- For your trouble.
I didn't mean to insult you.
If you want to make amends tell me your phone number and name.
You're quite mad.
Oh, please, please.
Lilian Cossmann, Breitenbach 1387.
I know the way to paradise
What have you got there?
Oh, nothing.
What are you mumbling about?
Oh, nothing.
Good evening, little one.
What have you got there?
Mops, I've met three charming young men three friends and none of them knows that I know the others.
You're a good one.
You're so strict with me whereas you have...
I've been thinking all evening which of the three is the nicest.
Where are these people?
I don't know.
I've been waiting an hour.
I can't wait that long.
- Stay, they must be here soon.
Why?
- Can't you read?
Back in a moment
Give me the parcel.
- No, it belongs to me.
I want to see what you're doing with our hard-earned money.
Pure silk, silk.
Wraps himself in silk like an old geisha so that he can please his secret love.
Cheek.
I don't ask who you bath in lavender for.
You've got a smell that even a dog couldn't stand.
I smell quite all right.
I smell very nice.
And who am I bathing for if you know it already?
For this impossible person.
What did you say?
Lmpossible...
Which impossible person?
What sort of a girl would have anything to do with you?
Better than the female that hangs a sardine tin round your neck.
Where is it?
Show me.
What did you say, you ridiculous dwarf?
Female?
Help!
Leave my friend alone.
If you touch me, I'll spit at you.
Willy, help!
What's the matter?
- Nothing to do with you.
What are you doing here?
You should be at the petrol station.
Me?
You!
Or Hans
- Me?
Are you mad?
I'm not going to get consumption and you laze about.
A filthy mess.
- Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not as ridiculous as you.
Mysterious stranger.
Have you introduced your girl to me?
My girl's a lady who musn't be compromised.
You're hiding her because you're afraid we'll take her away.
Just wait!
That's fine, just hit each other, I'll be the referee.
Give him a hand, I've got to go to the petrol station.
That's a mess.
A mess!
Now we'll break the door down!
Damned awful weather!
Lilian!
You here?
The storm took me by surprise.
What a sight you are!
The storm also took me by surprise.
And besides, I had a bit of a fight.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
What else can I do when a lady dear to me is insulted?
A lady dear to you?
That's exaggerating.
A friend, a casual friend.
Tell me, Willy, if someone insulted me would you fight for me?
Of course
- That's nice.
I mean to say I'd do it for any other lady.
You think you're irresistable, don't you?
No, not irresistable, but clever enough to realise that you're rude to me because you're afraid of being as kind to me as you'd like to be.
How do you know that I want to be kind to you?
I hear it.
There.
Darling, my heart greets you
Only with you alone
Can it be happy
All my sweet dreams
Are wrapped in my greeting
Don't let the days fly past
Spring is nearly over
Darling, my heart greets you
And tells you how much I love you
Still only sympathy entwines us
We are still formal
We've never kissed
But in my dreams
I use your first name
And whisper softly to you...
Darling, my heart greets you
Only with you alone
Can it be happy
All my sweet dreams
Are wrapped in the greeting
Don't let the days fly past
Spring is nearly over
Darling, my heart greets you
And tells you how much I love you
An eye
A black eye
Is the worst thing in the world
A cloth, a damp cloth
Is always good if you hold it against it
My child, do not be upset
If there's no wedding
A friend, a good friend
Is the greatest treasure that there is
Stop!
I know the chorus, dear friend.
It comes after every verse you utter.
Edith, I'd like to...
Lilian's come.
Your strict guardian.
Allow me?
Thank you, madam.
- For the first time you're nice to me.
You've picked a lucky day.
A lucky day?
I bet there's a man behind this.
If only it were so simple!
There are two men involved.
Two men?
- To tell the truth three.
With all respect!
You must tell me about it.
Come.
Of course only one can seriously be considered.
You must make your choice.
You think so?
You can deceive one man.
You even have to.
But three men together are as clever as one woman.
Then I must tell the truth.
But diplomatically.
Then the best thing is to write each one a letter.
It's not as simple as that.
Why?
I'll just write:
My dear Willy, I...
Yes, what shall I write so that he doesn't misunderstand?
I...
I never thought it'd be so difficult to write letters diplomatically telling the truth.
I told you so.
Objectively a letter
Can be very awkward
Many a person looks at it and reads behind the lines
Be careful how you do it
So that it's understood
What you mean
By each line
First a large question mark
Which means:
When will you give in?
Then comes...
A dash
Which means:
Darling, I love you
Then from time to time whilst kissing
You'll have to put in a comma
And finally a full-stop
Which means:
Leave me alone
No, I can't do it like that.
I'd better tell all three.
That won't be easy, I don't want to hurt any of them.
Then we'll anesthetize patient beforehand.
How?
- With champagne.
Tell all three to come to the Gigepfel at 10 tomorrow evening.
There they'll all see that they're in love with the same girl.
You're clever and charming, pity I didn't know that before.
Where are you going?
I've got a date.
You too?
That's... very good.
What's going on?
Is this a fashion show?
We've got a date.
And the petrol station?
One of you is on duty.
Would you like to take over for me?
I've got a date.
- Leave me alone.
Would you like take over my duty?
I've got a date.
Why should I?
Besides, with your permission I also have something special on this evening.
Well, one of you has to go to the petrol station.
Why me?
Why always me?
It's a cheek if no one does one a favour.
What cheek!
I know.
We'll draw lots for who's on duty.
Yes, but without me.
I wouldn't dream of it.
What then?
Yes, why not draw lots?
Willy, don't be a spoilsport.
What for?
Why?
Go on.
- Well, I don't mind.
Here are three bits a paper.
There's a nought on one.
Whoever draws the nought's on duty.
Willy, you start.
- Good, I'll start.
My God, the nought.
The nought.
Bad luck.
Poor chap.
- Shall we go?
Oh, go to the devil.
We pulled a fast one on him.
We did a good job.
Well, where exactly is your rendezvous?
Oh, I've completely forgotten.
- Well, well.
And you, where's your rendezvous?
I've completely forgotten.
Quick, quick!
It's urgent.
Suspicious scoundrel!
These rascals!
Nice, isn't it?
I'm a bit afraid.
A drink'll give you courage.
- Yes, you're right.
Tell me, what have you been whispering about all evening?
Nothing for small children.
- And nothing for large Mops.
Give me a drink.
Yes, right away.
There they are.
Now.
Gin, please.
- A cherry cola, please.
That's fantastic.
- Yes, that worked.
Cognac.
Cocktail.
Now, my friend, you'll see how pretty my girl is.
Cheers.
- Cheers.
Yours won't even exist when you see mine.
We'll see.
Shall we bet that mine's prettier?
- You're crazy.
Good evening, gentlemen.
May I introduce...
I've won my bet.
She's my rendezvous.
Yours?
She's mine.
Lilian, please tell this incorrigible bragger with whom you've got a date.
Yes, please, tell this notorious boaster...
Yes, gentlemen, I'll explain everything to you, but for the moment I've got a date with each of you.
With both of us?
With both of us?
- Not so loud!
I must say...
Look, Hans...
- No, I'm not interested.
Please, Kurt, I can...
- I'd rather do without.
I never thought much of you, you fool, but to be so mean!
If I'd known with whom I was hand in glove living under one and the same roof...
Don't be so angry, it's all my fault.
You lied to us.
- And betrayed us.
Played with us.
- Leered from one to the other.
Laughed at us.
- Made us look ridiculous.
She's also got a rendezvous with Willy.
I'd credit the lady with anything.
In your place I'd be ashamed.
In you place I'd behave myself decently.
Him as well?
!
May I take you to your table?
You dressed yourself in silk for that!
And you bathed in lavender.
A cognac, a large one.
Soda, a lot.
That was nice of you.
Lilian, child, where have you been so long?
Papa, I'd like to introduce Mr. Willy Helbing, my Papa.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
- My pleasure.
I've got several things to say.
Mops, before he speaks to you, you have to know that he's the nicest young man that I know.
Well, young friend?
Don't be offended, Consul your family affairs are no concern of mine but I'd advise you to bring up your daughter better.
You needn't give up hope that she'll become a useful person one day.
At the moment she's a heartless, superficial, coquettish, spoilt brat.
Good evening, Consul.
He's put you in your place.
By Jove!
That'd be a son-in-law for me.
Come.
Willy's coming.
Look, it's Willy.
Here he comes.
Look, Willy!
Well, where's your heart's desire?
Yes, where's your darling?
You should be ashamed.
You fools.
Are you putting up with his?
Filthy dog.
A friend
A good friend
Is the greatest treasure that there is
Oh, he's a nice fellow.
You got me into this.
You with your diplomacy.
But Lilian...
It's all your fault.
Yes, now I know.
Yes.
When you have only one daughter, you take care of her and don't let her flirt with three men at the same time.
Three?
Why three men?
- Oh, that's my affair.
I don't understand.
What kind of advice did you give her?
- That's my affair.
Will you pay so that we can go?
- Pay, that's my affair...
But children...
Darling, my heart greets you
It can only be happy with you alone
All my sweet dreams
Are wrapped in the greeting
Darling, my heart greets you
And tells you how much I love you.
Shut For sale
Well...
Please...
Good day, miss, it's good of you to come to me I didn't have time, after the recess there's a lot to do.
Consul, please be seated.
Ladies and gentlemen, I herewith open today's meeting.
You can leave.
- Me?
Why me?
Because it's a private matter.
- I'm your private secretary.
You were if you don't go at once and close the door.
Excuse me.
Ladies and gentlemen, I open today's meeting.
For the second time?
Which has been called to discuss the arrangements which shall lead to a marriage between Miss Lilian Cossmann and the one hand - charming - ...and Willy Helbing on the other.
I beg to speak.
- Please.
To let
You're decent and fall in love with one woman and such a little beast falls in love with three men.
You live unaware with two people you took for your friends who turn out to be rascals with whom it's impossible to live.
Then we all agree.
- That's it.
Each of us goes his own way.
- Exactly my opinion.
Come in.
Good day.
Do the three men from the garage live here?
I've brought a lady here who'd like to speak to the gentlemen.
A lady?
I'm not in.
- Nothing doing.
I very much regret...
- That would make me very sorry.
Good day, gentlemen.
Jacket, jacket, where's my...
It's my pleasure to meet Willy Helbing...
No, dear stranger.
Edith von Turoff.
I'm pleased to meet you.
Can you spare me 5 minutes?
- In what matter?
I'd like to speak to you in private.
Pity.
- Yes, I'd like to have listened.
Will you please be seated?
I've often admired your efficiency at the garage.
There's a plan to found a garage company for which they are looking for a competent director.
I'm sorry, you must look for another director.
Why?
I intend to leave Berlin for good.
It's more blessed to give than to receive
If I accept your offer, then only on one condition.
That you engage my two colleagues with me.
Your condition's accepted.
Gentlemen, you'll hear from me again today.
Good-bye.
- Good-bye, madam.
Many thanks, madam.
It was delightful.
- Yes, it was very nice.
You two fools, I thought we were angry.
We'd almost forgotten that.
- Yes, really.
If we're going to get on together promise me one thing.
The name of the girl who almost tore us apart will never be mentioned.
Good, agreed.
- Word of honour.
Word of honour.
Shut up, we're working here this is the directors' office of Kutag, Kuckuck Tank AG.
Never be gloomy
If your sweetheart no longer loves you
A friend, a good friend...
- Shut up!
Kutag general management here.
Kutag general management here.
Yes...
No, no here's the general manager's secretary.
You want to speak to the general manager personally?
Well, no.
Let's see... well, I'll see if the general manager can speak to you.
One moment, please.
I very much regret that the general manager is not available.
The entire management is...
Be quiet!
Let me do it!
I wanted to say the manager is at a conference.
But I've got full authority, with whom do I have the pleasure of speaking?
Pardon?
The telephone exchange?
What do you want, miss?
You only wanted to hear if the phone works?
You can see that, hear it.
Am I a crackling?
Damn it, take the thing away, it's absurd, say, it's ridiculous.
That's...
Don't get upset, it's just the fire department.
Come in.
A young lady's here.
What kind of young lady?
Oh, our money lender's protégée.
Oh, from Frau von Turoff.
- Who?
The secretary she recommended to us.
Let her wait.
Have you gone mad?
- She'll tell Turoff everything.
Go on, you work, you write, I'll telephone.
Please, is that the Bank for petrol trade and garage supplies?
Here's the Kutag general manager.
Kutag, yes.
Kuckuck Tank AG.
Good day, gentlemen.
I'm your new secretary.
Out of the question.
- Pardon?
The job's already taken.
But Willy she's our money lenders protégée.
Don't you see that this is all a conspiracy.
I'll not be a part of it.
- Willy, go on.
Go on...
Do you believe that the vamp seriously intends to work here?
Mistake.
The vamp seriously intends to work.
That's what she came here for.
- Can you type at all?
Naturally.
Please, I'm here, sit there.
Please be seated.
- Are you comfortable?
Don't be afraid.
- It'll be all right.
Please, convince yourself.
I'm curious about that.
First comes a large question mark
Which means how can I soften you up?
Then a dash
Which means:
My sweetheart, I love you
Then from time to time whilst kissing
You have to put in a small comma
And finally a full stop
Which means:
Leave me alone
So, and now to you, miss.
Yes, sir.
Better than I thought.
It's of no use.
Write another letter.
Yes, sir.
Are you ready?
- Go ahead.
To the board of directors of Kutag.
Since the company was founded under other conditions...
Other conditions?
Write, took place under circumstances other than they appeared to be and I want to build up my existence under my own steam and not thanks to the protection of some kind of female...
Have you got it?
- Female, naturally.
...female...
I give notice as of today.
And resign from the board of Kutag.
Have you got that?
...and resign as of today from the board of Kutag.
And perhaps you'll add:
Yours faithfully?
Yes, as you like.
And respectfully?
I find that very polite.
So, and now, sir, just your signature, please.
Put it down.
Is there anything else?
What were you doing in there?
Willy, be sensible!
Don't give up our garage company.
Characterless fools.
Listen...
You're past helping.
He's mad.
Cheers to the young couple
We offer our congratulations
Cheers to the young couple
Come to my heart, dear son-in-law
Be mine and be kissed
Because today's your wedding day
The bride
The beautiful bride
You stole from us
Have you all gone mad?
On the contrary, we're delighted!
About the super marriage contract.
Marriage contract?
Who's marrying who?
Marriage contract, how am I to understand that?
Here, read it, then you'll be informed
You dictated it yourself
Dictated it yourself, dictated yourself, for the marriage
Dictated yourself, yes, dictated yourself
I declare herewith that Miss Lilian Cossmann
Is the sweetest girl in the world
And I consider myself lucky
To marry her here on the spot
The sooner the better
I never dictated that, I didn't
It's not true
Here's your signature, plain and clear
That's true, that's true
Good bait catches fine fish, but not me
Stop.
Listen to what it says in the legal code
If someone promises marriage
And breaks his promise deliberately
Then it's been the rule for years
To imprison the culprit on demand
The penalty for the crime
Will be at least twenty-one weeks
Oh, so that's what you mean!
A clever bit of blackmail!
My girl, between us everything's settled, isn't it?
First we'll go to the altar...
- And then?
And then we'll get a divorce
What does it matter?
You're only interested
In being a married woman...
I've had enough of this, thanks, I can do without.
Bravo!
- It calls from the wilds
Take another husband
Look at me closely
I've had enough
I've had enough, I'm not a dog
You tormented me for 20 years, I said yes to everything
Whatever happened was my fault, now I've lost my patience
I say no and no again
- Don't shout!
I want to shout!
- Consul, this is too much!
I speak now!
Be quiet!
Listen and take note, I'm going to make Edith my wife
When, where and how I like, and if you complain
I'll spank your bottom no matter what happens
Stop!
I'll never allow you to so brutally attack such a defenceless, weak charming, sweet creature.
Well, thank God.
Only with you can I be happy
All our sweet dreams
Will come true today
And us?
What's going to happen to us?
No one here to love us
A friend, a good friend
Is the best thing that there is
That's enough now!
But, Willy!
- What is it now?
The people!
- What people?
The audience.
- Where?
There!
Yes, really...
And all strangers, too.
What are they doing here?
The film is over.
Shall we ask them?
Ladies and gentlemen...
- Wait, Willy!
I know why!
A real operetta needs a finale.
Oh, I see.
Lilian, come with me.
Just a moment, please.

Looks more like a shoelace.

That's right.
Why, André?
If she's pretty, she's got a right to try out.

Nothing at all.
Speak up!
No, it's nothing.

I was joking.
Don't even dream of it.
Stop it.
Enough.

Such freshness and fantasy.

In my life as an artist -
- Don't move.
I've photographed kings, queens, and famous stars, but --
Don't move.
When it comes to elegance, you are far ahead, and I should know.
You're very attractive.
No kidding.
You'll look wonderful for years.
You can have an extra six for only two francs 50.
No kidding.
I'm the photographer of love.
The lady's mischievous.
No kidding.
Madam, lift your head.
A bit more.
Very good.
Smile.
Smile.
Fine.
Hold it there.
Don't move.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Good morning, sir.
Can I help you, miss?
I need a favor.
Yes?
It's about the contest.
I submitted my pictures yesterday without telling my fiancé.
On second thought, he'll be very hurt if he finds out.
I'd like to have my pictures back, sir.
It's too late, miss.
Why?
What do you mean, "Why"?
You're among the finalists.
Here.
Me?
You're the favorite.
Besides, the jury is in deliberation right now.
Think it over.
You can't back out now.
- No, sir.
- You can't.
- It's impossible.
- You accept.
Great things await you.
Soon, you'll thank me.
Here. 20 lines of 8-point.
So, see you tonight at 8:00 at the café.
Okay.
Hey, come here.
I'm going to buy her the ring she likes so much.
I'll give it to her tonight.
Leave me alone.
I'm working!
Grumpy.
What a pain.
"Miss Lucienne Garnier is the new Miss France."
Set this.
Use caps.
MISS LUCIENNE GARNIER IS THE NEW MISS FRANCE
It's lovely on you.
What a figure.
So elegant.
You're too kind.
And that one?
- Look.
- They're all so pretty.
- Is Miss France here?
- This way, sir.
Hello.
- Quick, the train won't wait.
- Ready in five minutes.
"More today than yesterday, but less than tomorrow."
- Original, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- She'll be so happy.
- Yeah.
A magnificent trip in luxury.
You're a celebrity now.
You'll be treated like royalty.
You have a sleeping compartment.
I've reserved it for you.
Enjoy yourself.
Good-bye.
The train's about to leave.
The Globe, latest edition.
Get your copy of The Globe.
Thank you, sir.
- Yes, it's her.
- The Globe.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
- See the sports pages.
- No, thanks.
That's nice.
Thanks, boss.
You hear that, boss?
It's Miss Garnier.
She's the girlfriend of the guy in the back.
Look.
Yes, it's her.
- Hey, let's have some fun.
- Let's go.
- Sir--
- Let me talk.
Me first.
Sir, please let me speak first.
Sir, some say that fortune smiles on us while we sleep.
In your case, it smiles on you while eating.
I'm proud to be the first to congratulate you on behalf of this modest, but now famous café, for the glory bestowed upon you today.
You are now prince consort of a beauty queen.
But I'm simply amazed that The Globe has neglected to place... your own photo next to this magnificent one of her.
You knew?
- Did you know?
- No.
I mean, by chance...
Yes.
André, what's the matter?
What's all the drama?
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Please, don't forget to explain things to my fiancé.
Of course.
How many times must I say it?
Don't worry.
I'll see him tonight.
I'll take care of everything.
- I swear.
- You're sweet.
Thank you.
Have a nice trip.
Come back a winner.
She's gone?
It's for reading at night.
Miss France.
May I?
Of course.
I'm sorry.
You don't smoke?
- All ladies do.
- No.
- You're going to stand out.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
It's a maharaja.
Miss France, please.
Thanks.
Come in.
For you, miss.
Thank you.
"Prince Adolphe de Grabovsky"
Attention!
The San Sebastian International Beauty Contest is now open.
Ten nations have sent us their most gracious... ambassadors of beauty.
Miss England, Miss France.
Where's Miss France?
- Me?
- Hurry up.
- Come on.
- Okay?
Perfect.
Right there.
Ladies and gentlemen, prepare yourselves.
Our young beauty queens will now parade before you, first as a group and then one by one.
You will select the most beautiful one.
For the first time, a beauty contest has no official jury.
Timers will record the duration of your applause.
The contestant who receives the longest applause will be the winner.
And now for the parade of beauty queens.
- Hello.
- Hello, Grabovsky.
- How are you?
- Have a seat.
A little late.
"Five foot five, 119 pounds.
Pearl-gray swimsuit."
Miss England.
It's going to be quite a show!
Miss England.
You like her?
Miss France.
She's the one?
- It's her?
- Yes.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Ravishing.
In my country, we don't fox trot or tango.
Our dances are sacred.
Imagine that.
It takes years to learn them.
Give me a drum roll.
Ladies and gentlemen, to close this day devoted to beauty, we offer a grand finale.
A tango in honor of our queen,
Miss Europe.
May I have the honor?
I'm stealing you away at last.
All your admirers are jealous.
I'm living in a dream.
Say but one word, and it will never end.
Lucienne,
I love you.
Here we are far from all those devouring eyes.
I must talk to you.
One night in India, at the quiet hour when the lions drink,
I dreamt of a young girl.
I've found her.
It's you.
Love clutches me like an eagle.
I possess a land more vast than Europe, yet to live there without you would be a harsh exile.
One single person is missing and the whole world seems depopulated.
My happiness is in your hands.
You must decide.
Excuse me, Your Excellency.
Miss.
- What is it?
- You have a visitor.
Who?
He didn't say his name.
A young man who just arrived from Paris.
- André!
- He seemed a bit upset.
I sent him to your suite.
- Excuse me.
- Of course.
André.
It's you, darling.
What a surprise.
I'm so glad.
Are you angry?
Nasty boy.
Do you like my dress?
Pretty, eh?
Come look at my wardrobe.
Here.
An evening gown.
Pretty, eh?
And this one?
The phone.
It's you.
What?
Certainly.
What?
No, I promise.
Be quiet.
What?
I'll be right down.
Right away.
Good-bye.
See you soon.
Good-bye.
Darling, I have to leave.
Tomorrow,
I'll do my best to be with you.
My train leaves in one hour.
If you don't come with me, we're through.
Why?
Listen --
You can't leave.
Listen, André.
Don't leave me alone.
You can't.
Tonight or never.
I've been looking everywhere for you.
I was worried.
Don't be.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Go away!
You're not the one I love.
But you do love me.
Tell the truth.
I'll never see you again.
Listen to me.
You can't make him happy, nor yourself.
You!
Darling!
You came.
I was so afraid.
I thought I'd never see you again.
Hello.
Kiss me, here.
"Miss Europe."
Here, for you.
Your soup's getting cold!
It's getting cold!
I've had it.
I don't want to hear another word about Miss Europe!
Understand?
Lucienne, listen.
Listen.
Don't cry.
Don't cry, darling.
Please.
I love you.
I love you so much.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
It's over.
Please, ma'am.
Could you lend me some oil?
It's for my onion soup.
Thank you.
I'll replace it tomorrow.
Hello there.
I've found you at last.
Miss Europe hasn't changed.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
May I come in?
- Whiskey?
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I've heard that song somewhere before.
Why did you look for me?
What do you want?
Sound Film International saw the tests we shot in San Sebastian.
They've asked me to make you an attractive offer.
You'll be a star.
Here's the contract.
All you have to do is sign it.
I don't want to.
I'm not signing anything.
You never know.
Think it over.
Here's my card with my address.
Go away!

I sincerely loved you, maybe I still do.
Forgive me, Lucienne.

Can I help you?
I'd like to speak with Miss Europe.
There's someone here who wants to see Miss Europe.
All right.
She can't come down?
Yes, I'll tell him.
I'm afraid not.
She's in the screening room and can't be disturbed right now.
Perfect.
Very pretty.

- Ready?
- Can we start?
When a passer-by
Gives me the eye
I see your own eyes fill with doubt
You think I'm flirtatious
I'm just being gracious
Yet all evening long you pout
Don't think I'm untrue
My only love is you
Don't be demanding
Be understanding
If a man says I'm a Venus
His most flattering praise
Can my heart never phase
Nothing can come between us
No matter what I do
DO NOT ENTER WHEN RED LIGHT Is LIT

My only love is you
At times a desire
Like a raging fire
May suddenly race through my brain
For rich furs I long
Yet it never lasts long
I'm simply a woman.
Don't complain
Don't think I'm untrue
My only love is you
Don't be demanding
Be understanding
If a man says I'm a Venus
His most flattering praise
Can my heart never phase
Nothing can come between us
No matter what I do
My only love is you
Perhaps one day
I may go away
Without saying farewell to you
For the heart of a wife
May cause you great strife
But always without meaning to
Don't think I'm untrue

If she's pretty, she's got a right to try out.

Nothing at all.
Speak up!
No, it's nothing.

Before, during and after."
Hey, Lulu.

- Good morning.
- Morning.
Good morning, sir.
Can I help you, miss?
I need a favor.
Yes?
It's about the contest.
I submitted my pictures yesterday without telling my fiancé.
On second thought, he'll be very hurt if he finds out.
I'd like to have my pictures back, sir.
It's too late, miss.
Why?
What do you mean, "Why"?
You're among the finalists.
Here.
Me?
You're the favorite.
Besides, the jury is in deliberation right now.
Think it over.
You can't back out now.
- No, sir.
- You can't.
- It's impossible.
- You accept.
Great things await you.
Soon, you'll thank me.
Here. 20 lines of 8-point.
So, see you tonight at 8:00 at the café.
Okay.
Hey, come here.
I'm going to buy her the ring she likes so much.
I'll give it to her tonight.
Leave me alone.
I'm working!
Grumpy.
What a pain.
"Miss Lucienne Garnier is the new Miss France."
Set this.
Use caps.
MISS LUCIENNE GARNIER IS THE NEW MISS FRANCE
It's lovely on you.
What a figure.
So elegant.
You're too kind.
And that one?
- Look.
- They're all so pretty.
- Is Miss France here?
- This way, sir.
Hello.
- Quick, the train won't wait.
- Ready in five minutes.
"More today than yesterday, but less than tomorrow."
- Original, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- She'll be so happy.
- Yeah.
A magnificent trip in luxury.
You're a celebrity now.
You'll be treated like royalty.
You have a sleeping compartment.
I've reserved it for you.
Enjoy yourself.
Good-bye.
The train's about to leave.
The Globe, latest edition.
Get your copy of The Globe.
Thank you, sir.
- Yes, it's her.
- The Globe.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
- See the sports pages.
- No, thanks.
That's nice.
Thanks, boss.
You hear that, boss?
It's Miss Garnier.
She's the girlfriend of the guy in the back.
Look.
Yes, it's her.
- Hey, let's have some fun.
- Let's go.
- Sir--
- Let me talk.
Me first.
Sir, please let me speak first.
Sir, some say that fortune smiles on us while we sleep.
In your case, it smiles on you while eating.
I'm proud to be the first to congratulate you on behalf of this modest, but now famous café, for the glory bestowed upon you today.
You are now prince consort of a beauty queen.
But I'm simply amazed that The Globe has neglected to place... your own photo next to this magnificent one of her.
You knew?
- Did you know?
- No.
I mean, by chance...
Yes.
André, what's the matter?
What's all the drama?
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Please, don't forget to explain things to my fiancé.
Of course.
How many times must I say it?
Don't worry.
I'll see him tonight.
I'll take care of everything.
- I swear.
- You're sweet.
Thank you.
Have a nice trip.
Come back a winner.
She's gone?
It's for reading at night.
Miss France.
May I?
Of course.
I'm sorry.
You don't smoke?
- All ladies do.
- No.
- You're going to stand out.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
It's a maharaja.
Miss France, please.
Thanks.
Come in.
For you, miss.
Thank you.

Attention!
The San Sebastian International Beauty Contest is now open.
Ten nations have sent us their most gracious... ambassadors ofbeauty.
Miss England, Miss France.
Where's Miss France?
- Me?
- Hurry up.
- Come on.
- Okay?
Perfect.
Right there.
Ladies and gentlemen, prepare yourselves.
Our young beauty queens will now parade before you, first as a group and then one by one.
You will select the most beautiful one.
For the first time, a beauty contest has no official jury.
Timers will record the duration of your applause.
The contestant who receives the longest applause will be the winner.
And now for the parade ofbeauty queens.
- Hello.
- Hello, Grabovsky.

A little late.
"Five foot five, 1 1 9 pounds.

Miss England.
It's going to be quite a show!
Miss England.
You like her?
Miss France.
She's the one?
- It's her?
- Yes.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Ravishing.
In my country, we don't fox-trot or tango.
Our dances are sacred.
Imagine that.
It takes years to learn them.
Give me a drumroll.
Ladies and gentlemen, to close this day devoted to beauty, we offer a grand finale.
A tango in honor of our queen,
Miss Europe.
May I have the honor?
I'm stealing you away at last.
All your admirers are jealous.
I'm living in a dream.
Say but one word, and it will never end.
Lucienne,
I love you.
Here we are far from all those devouring eyes.
I must talk to you.
One night in India, at the quiet hour when the lions drink,
I dreamt of a young girl.
I've found her.
It's you.
Love clutches me like an eagle.
I possess a land more vast than Europe, yet to live there without you would be a harsh exile.
One single person is missing and the whole world seems depopulated.
My happiness is in your hands.
You must decide.
Excuse me, Your Excellency.
Miss.
- What is it?
- You have a visitor.
Who?
He didn't say his name.
Ayoung man who just arrived from Paris.
- André!
- He seemed a bit upset.
I sent him to your suite.
- Excuse me.
- Of course.
André.
It's you, darling.
What a surprise.
I'm so glad.
Are you angry?
Nasty boy.
Do you like my dress?
Pretty, eh?
Come look at my wardrobe.
Here.
An evening gown.
Pretty, eh?
And this one?
The phone.
It's you.
What?
Certainly.
What?
No, I promise.
Be quiet.
What?
I'll be right down.
Right away.
Good-bye.
See you soon.
Good-bye.
Darling, I have to leave.
Tomorrow,
I'll do my best to be with you.
My train leaves in one hour.
If you don't come with me, we're through.
Why?
Listen --
You can't leave.
Listen, André.
Don't leave me alone.
You can't.
Tonight or never.
I've been looking everywhere for you.
I was worried.
Don't be.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Go away!
You're not the one I love.
But you do love me.
Tell the truth.
I'll never see you again.
Listen to me.
You can't make him happy, nor yourself.
You!
Darling!
You came.
I was so afraid.
I thought I'd never see you again.
Hello.
Kiss me, here.
"Miss Europe."
Here, for you.
Your soup's getting cold!
It's getting cold!
I've had it.
I don't want to hear another word about Miss Europe!
Understand?
Lucienne, listen.
Listen.
Don't cry.
Don't cry, darling.
Please.
I love you.
I love you so much.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
It's over.
Please, ma'am.
Could you lend me some oil?
It's for my onion soup.
Thank you.
I'll replace it tomorrow.
Hello there.
I've found you at last.
Miss Europe hasn't changed.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
May I come in?
- Whiskey?
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I've heard that song somewhere before.
Why did you look for me?
What do you want?
Sound Film International saw the tests we shot in San Sebastian.
They've asked me to make you an attractive offer.
You'll be a star.
Here's the contract.
All you have to do is sign it.
I don't want to.
I'm not signing anything.
You never know.
Think it over.
Here's my card with my address.
Go away!

Remember I'm leaving everything in your care.
Be sure the person who rents my house is reliable.
-A person you could trust.
-Yes, sir.
-Very good.
Goodbye.
-Goodbye, Colonel.
And don't forget to tell me...
Thank heaven he's gone.
South Africa has my sympathies.
What's the matter?
Have you seen two bozos running this way?
Sure.
They just went in there.
What's wrong?
Trying to make a hotel out of the city park.
They put two benches together to make twin beds.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
When I told them to go, the little one tipped his hat and said:
"Yes, ma'am".
That's what I'm sore about.
He's gone.
Let's get out of here.
Another nice mess you've gotten me into.
Yes, ma'am.
Let's reconnoiter.
-Sure you have everything?
-Certain.
-Come on or we'll miss the boat.
-Alright.
Come on, hurry up.
-Get a move on.
-Alright.
is it really safe for us to go away and leave the place until Monday.
Sure.
The colonel won't be back for at least six months.
What's the difference if we rent the house today or next week?
-lt's the same.
-Alright.
Go on.
-Always starting an argument.
-And you're always blaming me.
Get over there.
Come on.
Let's go out the side window.
Close the drapes.
-This must be the place.
-lt's perfectly splendid.
-lt reminds me of old England.
-lt's just the thing.
is it the cops?
Who is Colonel Buckshot?
What's he like?
No idea.
I've never met him.
I hope he rents us the place.
It's somebody to rent the place.
-What'll we do?
-Do?
Use your brains.
Put on the butler's clothes and say the colonel's not home.
It's simple.
-Yes, but if they don't...
-Why you...
Wait.
I hear someone coming.
is this the home of Colonel Wilburforce Buckshot?
Yes, sir.
I understand it's for rent.

He wants to rent a room.

None other.
Colonel Buckshot at your service.
I'm Lord Leopold Plumtree.
-Delighted.
-My wife.
Charmed.
We've just returned from our honeymoon.
The hotel is full and my dear wife suggested we rent a furnished home.
-You understand.
-Yes, yes.
We'd like to take possession immediately.
Nothing would give me greater pleasure.
-ls there also maid service?
-Yes, yes, yes.
I'd like to see the maid, please.
Just a moment.
Hives, you call Agnes.
-Who?
-Call Agnes.
Agnes!
Pardon me a moment.
Why'd you tell them the colonel was home?
I couldn't help it.
The...
You got me into this mess.
You've got to get me out of it.
-What do you mean I got...
-Get the maid's clothes on!
I'm not going to put the maid's...
What a lovely piano.

Well, yes and no.

-Beg your pardon, Lord Figtree.
Plumtree.
Lord Leopold Plumtree.

My mistake.
Pardon me.
It must be the postman.

Put them on.
You wear them.
Do you play anything else?
Yes. I'm very efficient at croquet,
Parcheesi and billiards.
-You have a billiard room?
-Sure.
I'd love to see it.
Certainly.
Follow me.
-Pardon me, my dear.
-Yes, darling.
-Agnes will be right down.
-Thanks, Colonel.
Come on.
The billiard room is right upstairs.
Right this way.
There's a beautiful, old masterpiece.
What is the title of that piece?
-"Physic at the well".
-l see.
-The billiard room.
-Yes, the billiard room.
That chair is an old heirloom.
There's a picture I must show you.
That's a gondola going through the Panama canal.
In Venice.
And now the billiard room.
-Yes.
-Yes, now we'll have that...
Agnes, this is your new master, Lord Flagpole Crabtree.
Plumtree.
Lord Leopold Plumtree.
-My card.
-That's right.
Pardon me.
Are you related to the butler?
Yes, they're twins.
One was born in Detroit and the other in Miami.
-l don't understand.
-That's alright.
Neither do they.
-Agnes, you may go.
-Yes, sir.
Agnes, when you see my wife, give her my regards.
Yes, sir.
The billiard room's this way.
Agnes.
You're Agnes?
Yes, ma'am.
What a striking resemblance between you and the butler.
Yes, ma'am. I'm twins.
Remarkable.
I'd like some details regarding the house.
-Yes, ma'am.
-Tell me, Agnes,
-how long have you been here?
-About half an hour.
How silly of me.
I'm so nervous.
I mean, half a year.
To be exact, three months.
How many bedrooms are there?
-l haven't looked yet.
-You haven't looked yet?
I'm still nervous.
That's silly of me.
Bedrooms.
Let me see.
There must be bedrooms.
Imagine a house without bedrooms.
That's silly.
Let me see.
There's mine and the master's, the master's and mine.
That's four.
Not forgetting the couch in the hall.
-Then there's...
-No, no.
There's the master's and yours.
That's two.
Yes, how silly.
-Then there's the nursery.
-Nursery?
-Yes, ma'am.
-l didn't know the Colonel was married.
No, of course.
He has it in case of accidents.
Accidents?
No, you misunderstood me.
That's silly.
He has it in case of accidents for any of the help.
Kind of a hospital.
-How noble of him.
-lsn't it?
Right.
Tell me.
How many maids does the colonel keep?
-He never tells me his private affairs.
-Private affairs?
Servants aren't private affairs.
Some of them are.
I'm the only one left.
The others left last week.
They had housemaid's knees.
Agnes, would you like to stay on with us?
Don't disappoint me.
Say you will.
You'll be a comfort to me.
My husband will be away most of the time.
Say that you will.
Go on.
At last I found it, Lord Appletree.
No, dear fellow.
Plumtree.
My card.
Plumtree, Plumtree, Plumtree.
I'm sorry.
Leopold.
-Are you satisfied, darling?
-Certainly, dear.
And what good news I have.
With the colonel's permission, Agnes has agreed to stay on.
Nothing would please me better.
She's been in my service since boyhood.
I mean girlhood.
You return to the depot and attend to our trunks while I go over details with dear old Buckie?
Quite right, Plumie.
-Come, Agnes, see me off.
-Yes, ma'am.
You're such a dear.
Agnes, call me a cab.
-Huh?
-Call me a cab.
You're a cab.
On the telephone!
Are you sure we can take immediate possession?
Absolutely.
I'm leaving in a few minutes.
-lt won't be long now.
-Wonderful.
What's the rental fee?
-ls $20 a month too much.
-$20 a month?
Yes.
That's practically giving it away.
I picked it up for practically nothing.
What a beautiful car.
is it for sale?
It could be purchased.
By the way, have you any horses?
Sorry. I've just shipped them to my plantation in Kentucky.
Kentucky?
What part of Kentucky are you from?
Omaha.
Dear old Omaha.
I thought Omaha was in Wisconsin.
About Agnes' salary.
Don't worry.
That's not due until next month.
Agnes, call Hives.
-What?
-Call Hives.
Hives!
Pardon me a moment.
Hives will be right down.
-Cigarette?
-Thank you.
Won't you have one?
Now, dear Plumtree.
I think that's everything.
I think so. I'll add it up and give you a check.
-Very good.
-Two, three, four, dot, carry the one, two...
There you are Hives.
-Hives, what is your salary?
-Pardon me a moment.
By the way, what is your day off?
.
-Tuesday.
-Tuesday?
Why today is Tuesday.
I won't alter conditions.
You may have your day off.
On your way out, tell Agnes I want to see her.
Tell Agnes he wants to see her.
Colonel, you're an easy man to do business with.
So they've told me.
The last the deal we had...
Just a minute.
I forgot my bow and arrow.
Agnes.
That's my cab.
Get my hat and coat and go to the door.
Who do you think I am?
Goodbye, Plumie.
-Pleasant journey, Colonel.
-Thank you.
Thank you.
What's this?
-You wish to see Colonel Buckshot?
-What?
Nothing would suit me better.
Colonel Buckshot!
-Pardon me.
-Just a moment.
-Your check.
-That's alright.
Mail it to me in South Africa.
Did you wish to see me?
-Are you Colonel Buckshot?
-At your service.
The last of the Kentucky Buckshots.
Then who do you think I am?
Don't tell me.
Let me guess.
Just a moment.
I'll get it.
Where have I seen that face?
Let's see.
No, no, that's not it.
It's...
No, that's not it, either.
Just wait a minute.
I'll get it.
Just wait a second.
Don't tell me, Agnes.
I'll get it.
I'll get it out of here.
Just a moment.
I know who you are.
You're Colonel Buckshot.
Right you are.
Police!
Help!
Officers!
Police!
Burglars!
Pardon me.
Come, Agnes.
Yes, sir.
-Who are you?
-Do you wish to see the colonel?
He's in there.
And who do you think I am?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Get out of my house.
God save the King!
-Help!
Help!
-Come on, boys.
-What's wrong?
-There are burglars in there!
-Burglars?
-That's right.
Give him room!
Halt!
Stop them!
Stop!
SALT FOR SVANETIA
Based upon an article by S. Tretlakov
Director Chief Cameraman Mikhail Kalatozov
Co-Cinematographer Sh.
Geglashvili
"The Soviet Union is a country so big and diverse..
...that every kind of social and economic way of life is to be found within it" Lenin
Even now there are far reaches of the Soviet Union where... ..the patriarchal way of life persists along with remnants of the clan system.
Map of the Caucasian Mountains, showing the Ingur River and the locations of various tribes.
The Ushkul Tribe
Upper Svanetia, cut off from civilization by mountains and glaciers.
Here converge two mountain ranges of the Caucasus.
Tvelhuld.
The clouds come from the sea and turn into shining, pure ice.
Through the slow-moving ice currents, the cold creeps down.
From the mist and ice are born the rivers.
One such river is the Ingur.
At its upper reaches lies...
Ushkul
Further down, where the currents are slower and the climate milder, lived the local barons.
Sole owners of this land's riches - until the October revolution.
The passage into the upper, free Svanetia is not easy.
Eight months of snow lie at its gates.
Behind the snowy pass stand the towers of Ushkul...
Strong towers of stone.
They are here for a reason.
Not too long ago they guarded this starving land.... ...from the looting barons.
The barons hated the towers.
Friend or foe?
Have they come to collect more taxes from the starving villagers?
The towers are made ready.
The ancient pulleys creak under the pressure.
The tower is ready for battle.
In this way, they fought and protected their freedom from the barons of the valley...
The great, all-enduring towers.
Cut off from the outside world, the Ushkul tribe can satisfy only the most basic needs of its members.
Livestock - the lifeblood of Ushkul.
There are pastures, but very little milk, as salt is lacking.
The rich breed oxen for sacrifices.
The poor have neither livestock nor bread.
Down into the valley, looking for work.
Ushkul is a subsistence farming community.
From lamb wool yarn is made.
Further down rumble the factories.
Here, people weave with the help of machines make their own clothing and get their haircuts according to their own fashions.
From the wet wool they make weave ropes and connect villagers with bridges.
For the towers.
...for the roofs...
Without wheels.
They sleep on stone beds.
Stone is everywhere, even in death.
By the glaciers lie the barley fields.
Only the barley can grow at the elevation of 1,800 meters.
july 28th, 1 929.
The day was hot.
Approaching suddenly...
Winter!
Summer betrayed the villagers.
The July snow covered all...
In snow and in sweat.
Save what you can.
The village is short-handed.
The strongest men have left to look for work.
The storm has passed and it's summer again.
Those flint boards are used as thrashers.
Another way to use stone.
Another day of hard work.
Save the barley!
Harsh, bone-breaking labour.
Around and around...
Look out!
Save the manure for fertilizer!
Nature is harsh - the work is exhausting.
The work is exhausting - the way of life never changes.
Cut off from civilization, Ushkul needs salt.
Here, salt isn't a common commodity it's like gold.
There's salt in sweat.
No salt...
SALT!
S-A-A-LT!
There's salt in urine.
Cut off from civilization, Ushkul is starving for salt.
The mountains that are white as salt stop the salt shipments from the valley.
There are no roads.
Driven by hunger from their own land the poor people of Svanetia the farmers and field workers the workers from tangerine orchards carry the salt back to their own land.
The salt of the earth.
From the factories, collective farms, highways.
The people of Ushkul are waiting.
Waiting for their arrival.
Waiting with new hope.
Bleeding from exhaustion.
Waiting anxiously.
Waiting for news...
In the stone walls of this savage land, religion still rules.
White smoke of mourning.
The funeral of a rich man is a ceremonial celebration.
The funeral of a poor man is only grief.
A birth during a funeral is considered unclean.
The mother is exiled.
Friends and relatives: make donations in memory of the deceased!
Alone...an outcast.
Friends, pay homage: throw yourself into the grave!
For you, O Lord!
This stallion is yours.
Let the blood of this ox spill on the grave.
The horse is to be driven to death.
Bless the Lord who created the mountains of Svanetia.
Another Svan is born.
Water!
WATER!
In the name of the God of Svanetia the Goddess of the valley Saint IIIina the horse's heart is about to burst.
The blood of Svanetia.
There's salt in blood.
Religion is feeding off Svanetia.
The sun rises and sets over the dead child.
Pregnancy is a curse in Ushkul.
And all because there are no roads.
We don't want to bear children!
Don't want to feed the soil with our milk!
Hear this, Svanetia!
Watch this, audience!
For the Svans - for communists -
-- there are no obstacles.
Our economic plan is stronger than religion and old customs.
They bring to Svanetia not a handful of salt...
They do not make a narrow path in the snow.
Thousands of Svans into the SOVIET SVANETIA!
building roads.
Of the 107 kilometers that Svanetia needs...
By the third year of the five year plan... 50 kilometers have been completed.
THE END
Music by Zoran Borisavljevic ~ Translation by Alexander Litvak Subtitles by MENiSCUS
Music hath charms that nothing else has
Music hath charms, though it's classic or jazz
A symphony grand by Schubert or Brahms
Popular bands or a uke 'neath the palms
A melody in minor key can make the teardrops start
And then again, a glad refrain can cheer a lonely heart
Sweet harmony when there's someone in your arms
Oh baby, it's then that music hath charms
How do you do, ladies and gentlemen.
Permit me to introduce myself.
I'm Charles Irwin.
And this book is Paul Whiteman's scrap book.
Its pages are crowded with melodies and anecdotes which we are going to bring to life for you by the magic of the camera.
Here we have Paul himself.
And by the way, you may be ineterested in knowing how he came to be crowned the King of Jazz.
Once upon a time, Paul, tiring of life in the great city had a grand idea.
He would go big-game hunting.
No sooner said than done.
Shooting the action to the camera we find him a few weeks later in darkest Africa.
My Lord delivered Daniel, my Lord delivered Daniel...
My Lord delivered Daniel...
Why can't he deliver me?
!
Ouch!
Mammy!
And that's how Paul Whiteman was crowned...
The King of Jazz.
Why, here comes Paul himself.
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Paul, where's the band?
Are you standing in front of them?
- Oh, the band?
- Yes.
I have them right in here.
What, 40 boys in that little bag?
In the bag!
I'm really very proud of the boys.
Some of them have been in the band a great many years.
Mike, how long have you been in the band?
11 years, Mr Whiteman.
Goldie, how long have you been in the band?
6 years, Pop.
- 6 years pop?
- Pop.
He's been in the band so long he's commenced to look like me.
However, as I said before, I'm really very proud of the boys collectively...
And I'd like to have you meet them individually.
Now that you know the boys...
I want you to meet our girls!
Here's my faded orange blossom, white as driven snow...
Fashioned with such loving care long centuries ago...
Worn in every generation by some happy bride...
Hiding modest blushes from the lover at her side...
Dear treasure of the past...
I've come for you at last...
What are the secrets you hold...
Within each delicate fold...
What tender memories you could reveal...
What dreams you seem to unfold of days romantic...
While phantom lovers of old around me steal...
How many hearts you have thrilled...
What hopes you've quickened and filled...
If you were only to tell the tale...
And how I wish that I knew what joy or sorrow...
I'll soon be finding in you, my bridal veil.
Oh happy bride one wish through your happy moments
We pray that happiness may/make ?
ever thine
Happy couple(?
)
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the path where we met...
Long, long ago...
Long, long ago.
Ah, yes, you told me you ne'er would forget
Long, long ago...
Long ago
Listen to the mellow chiming of the wedding bells
What a world of happiness their melody foretells
With the dawning of tomorrow comes our wedding day...
Do, I wonder, dreams come true.
we'll soon be on our way
There endless bliss will be
Awaiting you and me
And how I wish that I knew what joy or sorrow...
I'll soon be finding in you, my bridal veil.
Here's my assignment, boss.
Say, where have you been all day...
Your story's half an hour old.
- What's the matter?
- Matter?
!
If we women are gonna run this paper, I want speed.
And as long as I'm City editor, I've got to have news hot off the griddle!
Here you are, 40 storey building burnt to the ground.
- When did it happen?
- 10 minutes ago.
- That's better.
"Big bank robbery...
Three policemen shot."
- When did it happen?
- 5 minutes ago.
That's more like it.
"Woman shoots husband."
- When did it happen?
- Wait a minute!
- Listen...
- That's great!

Hey, Bing, this isn't the type of number for this kind of a production.
What kind of a production is this?
A super-super special-special production.
Well, I guess you're right...
We should get out of the mud and reach for the higher, and the finer things of life.
The silver lining and the bluebird...
and life and love!
Lookatmy doorstep,and look at my doorstep... andlookat thebluebird, and look at the blackbird and at the bad bug.
look at the good luck and the bad luck there
Ineversawbluebirds mingle with blackbirds
Ineversawbluebirdsdoingthingsbackwards...
Neverknewgoodluck ever could perch with care
Now,I overheard... thosebirdiestalking today,andIknowjust why they're acting this way.
Maybe I'd better pick up the thread of the story.
- Well you needn't.
- OK.
First, the bluebird said...
"We've got to have sunny weather."
So the bluebirds and the blackbirds got together.
Then the blackbird said...
"All we birds have a different feather."
So the bluebirds and the blackbirds...
got together.
Trouble, trouble, round my door...
Blackbirds, blackbirds, by the score.
- Pull it up now!
Bluebirds, bluebirds came one day...
And said to the blackbirds, "Hear our say"
Say, who the dickens are these revellers?
Oh, some quartet on the air...
It really doesn't matter.
Why, first the bluebird said...
"We got to have sunny weather."
So the bluebirds and the blackbirds got together.
Then the blackbirds said "We're birds of a different feather."
So the bluebirds and the blackbirds got together.
And when they talked it over, they let the blackbirds bring the rain.
All the bluebirds then agreed to bring that sunshine again...
For we can't have rain or sunshine that lasts forever.
You can take those bluebirds, take those blackbirds...
Mix them together you get fair weather...
And that's the reason the bluebirds and the blackbirds got together.
In my imagination I'm finding consolation
Somewhere along the Rio Grande.
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing
Someone along the Rio Grande.
It happened in Monterey a long time ago.
I met her in Monterey in old Mexico.
Stars and steel guitars and luscious lips as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart and I'm afraid that it was mine.
It happened in Monterey without thinking twice.
I left her and threw away the key to paradise.
My indiscreet heart longs for the sweetheart
That I left in old Monterey.
Stars and steel guitars and luscious lips as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart and I'm afraid that it was mine.
My indiscreet heart longs for the sweetheart
Yo soy la paloma errante
Que vengo aquí,
Buscando un hermoso nido,
Donde nací.
Si a tu ventana llega Una paloma...
Trátala con carino Que es mi persona.

Now I've caught you!
So this is the way you act when I'm not around!
No use you trying to explain...
I saw you with my own eyes.
- Well ... well won't you let me...?
- I'm through!
You'll never see me again as long as you live.
You brute!
Goodbye!
Well, wifey, there goes the best stenographer I ever had!
One day, while Paul was away...
And the boys in the band prevailed upon the probably man to do his stuff.
Jack White, a fellow of infinite jest, but...
Just a little bit nutty.
Come on there, Old Black Joe!
Yeah, Joe, come on and coo one, you'll be terific.
Old Black Joe...
When I was a little boy, my mother said to me...
What did your mother say to you?
When I grow up to be a big man, what do I wish to be?
What do you wish to be?
- 7 of spades?
- Right!
I always wanted to be a cop or a fireman or such.
But since those days of wishing'...
I've got a new ambition.
What is your ambition?
- Ace of clubs?
- Right.
Oh,howI'dliketo own a fish store
That'sallIwishfor...
A lovely fish store.
Why,toallthe Paddys...
I'd sell the fin and haddy.
TotheCohensand the Misches I would sell gefilte fishes.
I'dputaflounder in my window each day...
I'dputit on ascale and say I'm giving it away.
Oh,howI'dlike to own a fish store
I'ma fisherman...
Aren't we all?
I had a dream last night I dreamt I saw two fishes fight.
The champion was a tuna fish...
His opponent was a bass...
Before the title-fight began, they introduced a few...
They introduced Kid Sharky Battling White fish...
And Piccolo Pete.
- Ace of clubs?
- Right!
The house was packed with pole-fish, who paid 20 fish to get in.
And how the men were yelling for the main fight to begin.
Everyone's excited, and from the gallery, some fresh trout...
C'mon you Tuna fish knock that sea bass out!
The champion leads his left fin.
He leads it to the jaw...
He lands.
The bass...
he flounders...
Catch on?
Signals off.
The bass went down, he can't get up.
The champ was in his glory.
And then I hoped to find my dream was only a bedtime story.
Myfreshhalibutfish...
Myfreshhalibutfish...
Onlylastnighttheywere to sleep in the deep.
Want any fish, baby?
No, sir!
- D'yer sister want any?
- No, sir.
Well, you know that fish gives you brains?
What do you eat, sir?
Sardines?
And then the war broke out.
Millions of men and boys leaving their homes and wives and sweethearts.
Men... men... men... men!
Going up and down again... men!
Men... going up and down...
And where were you?
!
Where were you?
And where were you?
Where were you?
Never mind me!
They got me, buddy.
Did they really get you?
Yes, they really got me.
Well, they should've got you sooner.
Tell me your name.
So I can tell your poor old mother.
Why, you darned fool, my mother knows my name.
Romeo and Juliet I'm quite sure didn't have to pet upon a hardwood bench in the park like this is
They had moonlight up above and and all the scene of Eden's love
Things like that so helpful to hugs, and kisses...
But you and I, my dear...
Need no such atmosphere...
A bench in the park...
Unromantic and plain...
That bench in the park can be our lovers' lane
The glimmering light of a lamp for a moon
A cold dreary night, but in our hearts there is June
A lone little bird in the branches above
Is plaintively heard serenading his love
And what more do we need, you and I in the dark
On a bench in the park.
A bench in the park, unromantic and plain
That bench in the park can be our lovers' lane
The glimmering light of a lamp for a moon
A cold dreary night, but in our hearts there is June
A lone little bird in the branches above
Is plaintively heard serenading his love
And what more do we need, you and I in the dark
A bench in the park.
A lone little bird in the branches above
Is plaintively heard serenading his love
And what more do we need... you and I in the dark...
On a bench in the park
I beg your pardon, Sir...
Is this the place where you report a stolen automobile?
The Universal picture "All Quiet on the Western Front" inspired us to produce our own little war drama "All Noisy on the Eastern Front".
In it, we hope to prove for all time that Sherman was right.
Come in!
Marie...
My big American baby!
Have you been true to me?
Hide!
Quickly!
Come in!
Marie!
Mon Capitain, you look so handsome!
Soap!
Smells good!
Have you been true to me?
Hide!
Quickly!
Come in!
Marie darlin'!
Mon petit Colonel!
You are my jazz-baby, no?
- Look what I got for you.
- Chocolat!
Yum yum!
Marie, have you been true to me?
Hide!
Quickly!
Come in!
General!
Marie...
Have you been true to me?
Need you ask me that, baby?
The enemy is shelling the town.
We must leave immediately.
Come... my car is waiting.
Have you got any room for me?
How about me?
How about me?
How about us?
No record of American music would be complete without George Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue" which was written for the Whiteman orchestra and first played in the Aeolean Hall in 1924.
The most primitive and most modern musical elements are combined in this rhapsody...
For jazz was born in the African jungle...
The beating of the voodoo drum.
- Good evening, Mr. Kent.
- Hello, Ike.
- What are you gonna have?
- Oh, I don't know.
Most anything.
What is that?
Just what you ordered, most anything.
Well, here's it all.
Do you know what's the matter with this country?
It's the tariff!
That's who.
Partly tariff and partly income tax.
Now you take my wife...
All right...
Who you gonna take?
Here's a go...
Wait a minute...
Don't kick that dog!
That's not a dog.
It's a cat.
Then, don't kick the cat.
Don't you like animals?
- No.
- Do you like goldfish?
Goldfish?
I hate 'em!
Not so, quite... not so quiet
My boy, don't ever let anybody hear you talk that way.
A goldfish is one of the most faithful animals we have.
To mankind.
To the goldfish.
Would you mind if I told you a story...?
...about 2 little goldfish that I once had.
No.
I bought 'em at a s'pawnshop.
Two little wallahs for a wonderful heir.
Goldfish.
I called them Ella and Emma.
I brought them home and I put them in a glass bowl full of water.
And I used to sit and watch them grow.
Grow into womanh... to manh..
Big fish.
Then, prohibition came.
And they jumped out of the bowl onto the floor.
They used to follow me around wherever I went.
How I used to love them!
I used to come home each night...
And I'd stand at the bottom of the steps and I'd cry out...
Halloo Ella!
Halloo Emma!
And they would answer me back...
One day I...
I'd been working pretty hard.
I worked so hard I broke my shovel.
I came home...
And I stood at the bottom of the steps...
And I cried out...
Halloo Ella!
Halloo Emma!
But there was no...
No...?
Excuse me!
Ella!
Emma!
Emma!
A little tale we'll tell to you...
About the love of someone who...
We called the Ragamuffin Romeo
He'd sigh and wail as lovers do
When thinking of his sweetie too
Poor little Ragamuffin Romeo
In dreams only they had ever met
And at dawn he'd awake
Oh so lonely for his Juliet
And then he would take
His little sack and hit the road
A-picking rags at each abode
Poor little Ragamuffin Romeo.
Happiness he found in sorting' patches
Listen now for this is where the catch is
His Lady Love he'd start making of rag
Then he never used to be dejected...
Doing what the fairy tale directed
On the wall he'd tack 'em all and for a while he'd smile the blues away.
There'll come a day, I really feel... we're gonna love in manner real
My little Ragamuffin Romeo
I'm always gay and never blue...
I know that love will lead me too
My little Ragamuffin Romeo.
Until then, so happy we can be... and complaining' ain't right.
Until then, I promise faithfully...
To see you each night.
And just as true as skies above
His eyes are clear, by lit of love
My little Ragamuffin Romeo.
My Ragamuffin Romeo.
This moving' picture business is a bunk...
And this skin certainly gets my nanny!
I feel like a horse's neck!
Horse's neck?
How do you suppose I feel?
Good heavens, dear, this is terrible...
look!
The minister who married us wasn't a minister at all...
A crook, an imposter!
They've sent him to the penitentiary.
Why this is awful... it means that we're not married.
That's right, it makes me a bachelor.
It makes me a spinster!
What are you two squawking for...?
Look what it makes me!
When you find that your mind Keeps you worried and blue
You can always let your feet Keep your disposition sweet
I want to see What makes me feel the way I do?
Will you kindly cast an eye On two good reasons why?
Happy feet I've got those happy feet
Give them a low down beat And they begin dancing
I've got those ten little tapping toes And when they hear a tune
I can't control my dancing heels To save my soul
Weary blues...
can't get in to my shoes
Because my shoes refuse To ever grow weary
I keep cheerful On an earful of music, sweet
'Cause I've got those Hap, happy feet
Happy feet, We've got those happy feet
Give them a low down beat
And they begin dancing
I've got those Ten little tapping toes
And when they hear a tune
I can't control my dancing heels To save my soul
Traurigkeit quält mich nicht lange Zeit
Gar nicht mehr Schmerz und Leid.
sobald wir tanzen...
I keep cheerful, on an earful... ...of music... sweet!
'coz we've got those Hap, hap, happy feet!
Well done, girls!
Bravo!
Splendid!
- Thank you, Mr. Irwin.
- You're welcome.
Say, Charlie, what's the big idea?
Don't you think I'm entitled to a little consideration?
What for, Paul?
After all that's said and done.
It's dancing that puts a number over.
All you do is stand back there, wave a little stick and form a background.
And what a background!
How do you know that I can't dance?
You don't mean to tell me that you're well-versed in the intricacies of the art of terpsichore?
No... but I can dance.
Charlie, I've a secret confession...
Ever since I've been a little fellow I've been able to dance oh quite well.
Ever since I was about, oh about so high.
Yeah, but how wide?
You really want to dance?
Alright.
Ladies and gentleman, Mr. Paul Whiteman will now dance.
So help me, Bob!
Good evening, Charles.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Something I can do for you?
Well, sir...
I don't know how exactly to start... but you see...
I love your daughter.
And I know your daughter loves me.
We want to be married.
So I've come to get your consent.
Love is a wonderful thing, Charles.
But this is a practical world.
And I feel that I have the right to ask you a question.
Now, how about your financial status?
Are you making money enough to support a wife?
I'm making 65 dollars a week...
That ought to be enough.
There, my boy, you've hit the keynote of the entire situation.
65 a week is enough for 2.
But it may be rather scanty fare for more than 2.
And you know that...
After you and my daughter are married there may be some children.
We made up our mind not to have any.
But in spite of your intentions there may be a baby.
Well, we've been pretty lucky so far.
Though you are a great big grown-up...
You are like a child to me...
And somehow or other you make me want to mother you.
Every now and then I'll own up...
I want to take you on my knee...
The hardest thing for me to do... is to keep my hands off you
I live to fix your tie, smooth your hair...
Put things in order, here and there...
I'd like to do things for you.
I'd like to pick the lint off your suit...
Coz I want to keep you nice and cute...
Coz I like to do things for you.
There doesn't seem to be, need for me to mention...
That I'm the party who can give you attention
I'd like to tuck your shirt, straighten your hat poke all around you, just like that...
I'd like to do things for you.
Hardest thing for me to do is to keep my hands off you!
I get an awe-full kick, simply by taking a cinder from your eye...
I like to do things for you
I like to mend your things, darn your clothes... clean your ears, blow your nose...
I like to do things for you
I must, by hook or crook... make you look real snappy...
If there's a chance to do, things for you
I'm happy.
Tear buttons off, now and then...
So I can sew them on again...
-For evermore
I like to do things for you!
I like to touch your hair, hold your hand...
Play with your fingers, because you understand...
I like to do things for you.
I like to cuddle up close to you be momma's baby kitchy-coo!
Coz I like to do things for you
If anything I do... pleases you... don't thank me
When I'm bad place me on your knee and spank me.
If you'd like to hold me on your lap...
You just go to it Momma...
I'm no sap!
I like to do things for you.
There doesn't seem to be a need for me to mention,
That you're the party who can give us attention,
I'd tear your buttons off now and then so I can sew them on again
Coz I like to do things for you.
There doesn't seem to be need for me to mention that I'm the party who can give you attention
I like to pull your shirt...
douse your hat
You're acting all pretty ...like a pussy cat
Coz I like to do things for you!

"With trembling voice," the youth began to cry.
Has anybody seen our Nellie?
She's somewhere on the great white way...
Perhaps, dare to tell, there's some city swell...
Who ain't doing right, tonight, by our Nell.
She's just a child...
a little wild...
But then, she's just a kid
Some villain may lead her astray...
Ah!
Heaven forbid!
And if you see our darling Nellie...
Please send her back ...to Shamokin P.A.

Boycott
I'm in the habit of dealing with difficulties.
I think it's impossible this time.
Mr. General Manager you're expected in 15 minutes.
I know.
Marietta, I'll fetch you in 10 minutes.
no no no
I regret ...
I can't
no one will dare attack me no one you only call me when you need me for some social function
but I can't, do you hear!
I can't and I won't!
hallo?
hallo?
are you still there?
the lout!
Get up, you!
I'm waiting for your suggestions.
May I have this dance?
that proletarian's son seems to have made an impression on you don't brag about your family so much
I don't care a bit whose son he is
your brother has good taste
such men are needed in our times he's arrived
I'm coming
- what's the matter?
- the old Haller's here, the great philanthropist
?
vivat!
vivat!
vivat!
I thank you for the very kind reception, ladies and gentlemen
good day, father good day, my boy
- if you please, this way, General Manager - too kind he's a great guy, the old Haller, isn't he still a proletarian that's possible, but he's an able man
General Manager, allow me, Dr. Kehlmeyer
Dr. Hermann your son's tutor so delighted
General Manager ...
I don't know how to thank you
Headmaster, you can count on me any time and I think that ... gentlemen
my final hour has struck good-bye
I can find the way out myself
there you see the youth of today this isn't the youth of today youth has always been like this or would you prefer it if that youthful exuberance were lived out in secret?
in secret, it would be a sin in public, a scandal
you're again driving up with that old cart of yours
But that's what I got it for
I think it's showy if a boy drives to school in an eight-cylinder car they're only six.
come on, get it
No way!
- you may drive back home then - yessir
Scandal about General Manager Haller grave accusations - judicial inquest - squandering of millions of public funds for years silence!
we cannot associate with him any longer but what's he got to do with it?
read it!
morning, kids
Scandal about General Manager Haller
who put this on my desk?
I took the liberty you?
why?
so that you ["Sie"] may draw your own conclusions what do ... you [Sie] mean by conclusions?
one's code of honour would tell one that my own code of honour tells me that I mustn't cut off my neighbour's dignity and my code of honour tells me that I mustn't associate with the son of a defrauder
that's right ... that's right you rotten swine!
you cannot insult me
- unheard of!
- we'll complain to the Principal - that's right!
what's going on here?
Herr Doctor
I must ask you ...
Herr Doctor
I must ask you to protect me against my fellow pupils till it has been established whether the accusations against my father are justified or not
you want to be protected till the truth has been found out?
yes, Herr Doctor and if the truth turns out to be unfavourable ... then you would renounce protection?
of that case you haven't even thought.
of course you haven't
it is my wish that even in this worst case my pupils of the Upper First shall behave decently!
is that clear?
what do you think you're doing!
you're placing under a fellow pupil's nose a rag insulting his father!
this is brutalization!
even if the son of a convict were sitting among you you are to judge the human being not his father!
I beg your pardon, Herr Doctor we just wanted to avoid associating with a ... with him.
so this means boycott?
yes.
but my boys!
avoid such pathos!
nothing can be had cheaper than getting drunk on words and nothing is more foolish and nothing is more dangerous than stupidity.
Herr Doctor is there such a thing as honour or isn't there?
yes, Paal honour exists but each man has his own honour not his father's honour, not his brother's honour each has his own don't you understand?
no.
what was that?
if for instance ... if my father ... did something dishonourable
I wouldn't want to go on living not I.
well, I must say ... that I personally would consider such an act as weakness not fortitude as cowardice not heroism
still, Paal is right
Herr Doctor
I ask for permission to leave the class, I don't feel well
but tomorrow you'll be well again tomorrow you'll most certainly be well again!
I wish that all of you ... will never have to suffer the pain ... your fellow pupil is suffering right now.
Berlin Local News The briberies of General Manager Haller
Berlin Daily News Warrant of arrest
Defrauder Haller ...
Defrauder Haller
do you know it already?
of course I know it won't you take off your hat when you enter my room?
the accusations are lies, aren't they?
they'll hush up the affair which won't be difficult with your father's connections you mean that father somehow ... but he's totally above reproach, don't you thing so you know, a businessman can hardly be above reproach ... of course your father isn't that stupid, he wouldn't do something he might be caught at
he's guarded himself against any eventuality
I beg your pardon, you mean ... that he's legally above reproach but morally ... strictly morally speaking is that what you mean?
Erich your grandfather, the bricklayer from Uelzendorf, is showing through every seam of yours you're so ... so ridiculous some boys from my class, probably all of them, would kill themselves if their father put them to shame
do you think that's also ridiculous?
Erich you're not going to kill yourself!
come in
someone delivered a letter
from papa here
No reason to worry.
They wouldn't dare.
Peter what's the meaning of that?
who are "they"?
who wouldn't dare?
but the law-courts have nobody to fear!
don't shout!
nobody can touch him.
what's the meaning of that?
I cannot tell you in Ancient Greek your father isn't a brick layer, he's a man of the world, a modern human being and if he falls, a lot of men will topple as well and that's out of the question
so he's a crook?
one might put it like that and you're saying it just like that?
but he's your husband!
my husband ... who am I to him?
a figure on his chessboard
and not even the queen he's a stranger to me
stranger than any man on the street
actually, I feel sorry for him
nonsense!
the class' honour above everything!
silly phrases weakling!
braggart!
fool!
he's finished for us, and that's final!
and now let's stop talking about it
- you zero!
- rascal
second round
Möller too agrees with me he'll remain on Haller's bench then Möller too will fall under the boycott
coward bravo, Möller bravo Möller - bravo Möller
bravo Möller - bravo Möller
so you want to boycott me too?
then I'll have to submit to your terror.
didn't you know about his escape plan?
no.
but I'm used to it he was nothing but my cashier unfortunately, he's now a cashier on the run
I'll get over it but I feel sorry for my step-son
I didn't think the poor boy would take the affair so much to heart
Erich!
Erich!
why do you run away from me?
because I can no longer look another person in the face look at me, Erich
look at me
boy my boy
my father ... but nothing has been proven yet, Erich what's to become of me if it's true?
even that you'll have to bear
I couldn't!
even now, when nothing is proven, everybody is against me everybody, Erich?
everybody?
not everybody
Grete, not you
not you
# a colourful bunch of flowers # and golden sunshine # you only need so little # to feel gay and happy # and when you put your hand in mine
# I don't need anything else from life # for I know that you love me # a colourful bunch of flowers # and golden sunshine # you only need so little # to feel gay and happy # and when you put your hand in mine
# I don't need anything else from life # for I know that you love me
the nerve she has to come dancing here tonight and on top of it, with her ... cavalier
Oh well, the poor woman had to get a substitute that husband of hers hasn't been able to dance for years why?
you try dancing yourself, with one leg being already in prison
I can't stand it any longer what is it?
all that gossiping and staring don't you notice?
you must have overestimated your nerves
I advised you against coming here you ... you ...
I want to get away where?
I don't know, but I want to get away, as far as possible
# today I want to leave on a voyage # brighter than the moon and the stars ?
# charming little girl, you're my dream of happiness # and I give you my hear, keep it well or give it back to me
- we'll do it - we'll do it we'll do it, absolutely
- so it's decided?
- yes
what's the meaning of this?
you know that you cannot change the seating order without my permission
as the class' delegate I am to inform you
Haller's neighbours belatedly ask for permission to change seats for what reason?
they don't want to sit next to him for what reason?
because of his father
you'll return to your old seats at once!
Herr Doctor
I ask for everything to remain like this if you prefer it this way ... very well
good-bye
New Press Director von Paal wanted - warrant of arrest
In connection with the million marks fraud of building contractor Haller, the Public Prosecutor has issued a warrant of arrest against Director von Paal
Bieder, Kempe and Paal are absent.
come on, come on go outside into the schoolyard the fresh air will do you good
Möller, here are five marks take a cab and drive over to Paal
- you know the apartment?
- I do take him for a walk, go swimming or ... no, you'd better not do that today take a stroll with him, take him to a pastry shop and tell him this:
listen carefully tell him:
The Upper First has come to reason again tell him we think he's an honest and decent person even if he doesn't kill himself tell him he mustn't throw away his life only because he said so a few days ago
do you understand what I'm saying?
yessir
too late!
you ought to taste such a roast of roebuck at my home and my wife makes a sauce to go with it ... why, Dr. Hermann?
what's the matter with you, colleague?
don't you read the newspapers?
you mean the Paal affair?
he seems to be involved in Haller's crooked deals why are you so upset about it?
the young Paal didn't come to school today you know what he announced in class two days ago
I wouldn't take that seriously, colleague
I wish you were right good morning morning
yes yes the good Hermann knows every complex of his pupils
the latest convenience of our modern times teaching in class, psychoanalysis included
I wouldn't put it past him
give some thought in this hour it is a horrible hour
give some thought about the saying
"Living is the highest duty"
a farewell letter by Paal
"he'll keep his word"
the police has been notified
where's Haller?
where's Haller?
Krüger and Schneider, run to the schoolyard, look out for him
you all keep quiet, I ...
I'll go to the Director
did you hear anything?
don't ask me
Haller!
Erich!
what shall we do?
I ask for leave for my class and myself we want to search for him
Haller is nowhere to be found what?
I shouldn't have left him alone
I read in the newspaper ... my father has been arrested and brought here name?
Haller what do you want?
I want to see him.
well ... the examining magistrate will decide about that you'll be notified in writing or by telephone
where are you?
in the Treptow Park
yes please?
a lemonade no, a beer a pint
if anything happens to the two, it's all your fault
Miss yes please?
another beer
Erich
Erich
- Haller
here you are
morning, Lehmann morning
well, what's new?
nothing special the son of that aristocratic crook Paal ... shot himself.
a beer careful, young man!
check please
evening, little one evening well but you're drunk, Herr Erich!
you ought to be ashamed of yourself what?
I ought to be ashamed of myself?
Has there ever been a man more ashamed of himself than I?
Young Master the police have been asking after you after me?
I'm innocent!
I didn't have a clue about it all!
I swear, I didn't have a clue about it all!
no no!
not like that, Herr Erich even a teacher of yours was here he thought you might have ...
I see so he did think me capable of it after all he left a letter for you
I'll get it so he did think me capable of it after all
My dear boy, don't let Paal's example lead you astray.
Your comrades don't think of a boycott anymore.
They returned to the old seats of their own free will.
If you want to see me, I'm at your disposal, outside school hours as well.
Your Werner Hermann
Dr. Hermann
I'm ill do you hear
I'm in bed
I'm fast asleep yes ... he went to bed he's ill but now he's fast asleep
thank God, he said sure but what he really thought ... what he really thought ... go to bed, Herr Erich you need rest
how he must have felt inside!
he kept his word
I still can't believe it he kept his word
I saw him in the park yesterday, and today ... he kept his word still, it takes courage he kept his word
I don't think I could have done it myself he kept his word what if Haller too ... then we'll be the murderers then we'll be the murderers then we'll be the murderers then we'll be the murderers
permission to visit the prisoner has been granted this afternoon at 3 o'clock
court room 18 - hearing at 9 o'clock criminal proceedings vs. Marschalk
court room 19 - hearing at 8.30 o'clock criminal proceedings vs. Hölla and Sohn
whom did you come to see?
my father.
Haller can you identify yourself?
driver's license room 53
good day, my boy
well?
so?
shoot, my boy father, but you're not guilty?
so what but you're not going to be convicted?
that's possible
then I'll have to kill myself rubbish!
if you feel dishonoured, you model of a human being from Uelzendorf then you have all the more reason to stay alive you could prove marvelously that you're a totally different person from your embarrassing progenitor
couldn't you?
you were friends with Director von Paal?
a business associate his son shot himself yes I know
I'm being kept up to date in here
what important business have you come to tell me?
the fact that I want to take my own life isn't important to you?
that's nonsense of course
you don't seriously consider such a step but it's true
I hardly know you you were never really at home
Why should I die when you go to prison?
but I can't live any longer!
because Herbert von Paal died!
I see!
I see!
that's what it's all about!
then let me give you a good piece of advice, my son you go back to my brother at Uelzendorf he's a brick layer he has no head for business
I've had to help him out three times already but you two suit each other why don't you move in with him?
then you two can whimper about me no, my dear
I have no patience with such a worn-out, stale, spent ...
Director von Paal gave himself up to the court what?
he broke down after his son's death didn't you know?
that idiot gave himself up?
how touching!
well I never ... that spineless ... boneless, soft type disgusts me then you don't care whether I ...
Erich!
Erich!
I should never have gotten married should never have had a child
never never
please call Dr. Hermann but we can't disturb him again
I can't stand that uncertainty any longer!
don't shout
Grete just went to bed
I'm telling you ... he still hasn't come home
what if anything happens to him then it'll be us who drove him to his death
I warned you but you didn't want to listen to me
please in here, young sir
good evening, Herr Doctor
I couldn't do it
I wasn't allowed to do it
Thank God
I knew you'd find the way to me and I'm grateful to you for it
you've realized that each man is responsible for himself and it's a good thing too
and believe me the other one
the other one wasn't a hero
good morning, Haller
The End subtitles: serdar202
Hel, there appears to be... an unusual amount of Bailey activity... taking place on the surface.
Far more than we've ever monitored before.
Keep an eye on it, Mauser.
Right now we're needed for another mission.
Patch Voice through the lab's comm system.
You two need to hear this.
You mean I actually get to put a voice... with the Voice?
Patched in.
Go ahead, Voice.
One of our teams has turned against us, Hel.
She's British!
What?
The team leader has severed all communications with me.
Your directive is to neutralize them at once.
Neutralize them?
We have to take them out.
If we're going after another team, you better lay some serious firepower on me.
Come on, Mauser, load me up.
The hard stuff.
Yeah!
There you go.
Low-yield photon taser.
Defensive use only.
Futuristic pepper spray.
Great.
Hel, the other team is 2,000 meters down the shaft.
There's an abandoned level just ahead.
The other team's below us!
Voice, we've reached the level.
There's a larger room down the corridor, Hel.
You can set up an ambush there.
This way.
That'd be a nice spot, Hel.
Elevated position.
They'd never know what hit them.
Hel, the other team is closing.
No time.
Flank them from that alcove, and we'll take center stage.
Come on, up and over.
What you got, Sarge?
Five seconds to a clean shot.
Take it now, Sarge!
No!
Quint?
Get down!
Voice, we've got them pinned down!
Good work, Hel.
You have the advantage.
Eliminate them at once.
Voice, we've come under heavy fire.
Time is of the essence, Quint.
If there's no other choice, eliminate Hel's team.
Five hundred years into the future, she will enter a world where machines rule the Earth.
Mankind has been driven underground.
And Cleopatra is about to discover... there's no place like home.
"In the year 2525"
"There are women with the will to survive"
"Fighting for a brand new day"
"Nothing is gonna get in their way"
"And in the year 2525"
"Three women keep hope alive"
"Joining forces to reclaim the Earth"
"Looking ahead to humankind's rebirth"
CLEOPATRA 2525 2x14 "THE VOICE" Subtitles by subXpacio
Sit!
We're sitting ducks if we stay here much longer.
Back there.
Ready web launchers.
On my mark, Sarge.
Now!
Now!
Whoa.
We've got to remember that move.
You're not kidding.
Guys!
We're okay, Cleo.
But they're good.
They're the best.
That's Quint's team.
What?
The same Quint's team we met up with a few weeks back?
Huh-huh.
Is that new kid Porter still with them?
Looked like it.
Wait, that doesn't make any sense.
Those guys are totally loyal to Voice.
Yeah, well, I say their loyalties have shifted.
But don't you want to know why?
I mean, we should at least try to talk to them.
Cleo, they just tried to kill us.
I don't think they're interested in talk.
But we know them.
I mean, we have to try.
Hel, they've already killed three other teams... who've tried to talk.
Voice says they've already taken out three teams.
You see what they're capable of, Cleo.
We can't afford to ask why.
Quint, what is your status?
We're regrouping.
Do you have a read on Hel's position?
Not at present.
But I suggest you double back and take the offensive.
There's no other way out of here.
There's a ventilation shaft.
It might take us onto the second level.
If we can get above Hel's team, we might-
Hel's probably thought of that.
But we are running low on options.
I'll go.
No, I'll go.
That'll give you two a better chance.
Of doing what?
Neutralizing Hel's team... by going out the way we just came in:
full-on assault.
I'll be in touch.
Voice, can you get a reading on Quint's team?
Is there any other way out of here?
I'm sorry, Hel, there's too much structural interference... for a sensor sweep.
You'll have to go in after them.
Porter, I've reached the second floor.
Looks clear.
I read.
We're in position.
Copy that.
Quint.
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Cleopatra?
What are you doing?
I don't have much time.
Hel and Sarge think that I'm looking... for another way off this level.
Listen, the Voice really has it in... for you and your team, and Hel's going to follow her orders... even if it means taking you out.
Cleopatra, listen to me.
Why don't you listen to me?
Quint!
Good job, Cleo.
Yeah, great job, Cleo.
Do you hear me?
Quint!
Where are you going?
Quint's in trouble.
Tell me this has all just been... a real creative idea of foreplay.
I wish I could.
Please, Sarge, don't.
Voice, any news on the Bailey surface activity?
We'll discuss that later, Hel.
But for now, stay focused on the mission at hand.
Hel, come in.
Go ahead, Cleo.
We have Quint.
Uh, he tried to get above us, just as you thought.
Voice, did you hear that?
Yes, Hel.
I heard you.
Your directive remains the same.
Sarge must not hesitate to eliminate Quint... while she has the chance.
Please, Sarge, don't.
Sarge, do what you got to do.
Sarge, think about what you're doing.
Think about what you've done, Quint!
You killed three other teams.
You betrayed the Voice.
What are you talking about?
You're the team that's turned against the Voice.
You're the traitors.
That's some pretty good acting, huh, Cleo?
I don't think he's acting.
What are you talkin' about?
The Voice sent us to make contact with you... when Hel stopped responding to her receptor.
You're the one who cut off communications with Voice.
Wrong.
Voice, give me something here.
Sarge is going to slit my throat.
Quint, ask Sarge about her sister Lily, how Sarge spared her life at the Betrayer factory.
Sarge, tell me about your sister.
Tell me about Lily.
You saved her life at the Betrayer factory.
I never told you that.
No.
Voice just did.
Stand down, Hel.
Something's going on.
Say again, Sarge?
Quint's still talking to Voice.
I know this will sound strange, but I think the Voice you're hearing isn't the real one.
Sarge is mistaken.
She's been compromised, Hel.
Either that, or Quint is the one in contact with the impostor Voice.
Hel!
Hel, don't shoot!
We're coming down with Quint.
Everything's cool.
Everything is not cool, Cleo.
What are you talking about?
You talk to me fast, you two!
Hel, your Voice receptor's been tapped.
Hel, you must believe me.
My security has not been compromised in any way.
You're being set up.
Prove it.
The Voice in Quint's head knows about my sister, Hel, about our mission to the Betrayer factory.
I think he's on the level.
Lara, they got Quint.
Go for Hel.
Quint!
Drop!
Porter, no!
Quint?
Hel, behind you!
Oh, there's nothing quite like the sound... of Voice teams killing each other.
Cleo!
Make it quick, traitor.
Hel, they think we're the rogues.
Hel, don't question yourself.
Finish your mission.
Porter, no!
Lara!
Get out of there!
I'll cover you!
We need to stop this.
Talk to him!
Porter, Hel could've killed me if she wanted to.
I'm not their prisoner.
That's what they want you to think!
They killed Quint!
Come on, Quint, come on, you've got to tell Porter you're still kickin'.
Come on.
Cleo.
Hmm?
That mimic thing that you do.
Can you do Quint's voice and get Porter to stand down?
Uh, no, I-I really can't do guys.
Come on, kid, don't make me shoot you.
Porter, let's talk about this.
So, Hel, now you want to talk!
Hel, you're risking your entire team.
Sarge has a clear shot.
Finish this now.
Voice, I thought you said your sensors were jammed.
How do you know Sarge has a shot?
I'm getting a clearer reading now, Hel.
Eliminate them at once.
No.
Kill them now, Helen.
"Helen"?
Creegan.
Game's over.
Do you hear me, Creegan?
Here, Creegan, Creegan, Creegan.
I know you're here.
You'd want to see two teams blow each other away up close and personal.
Why?
To distract us... from your little Bailey playmates?
Come out, Creegan!
Show's over.
Isn't it, Porter?
Listen to her, Porter.
It's over.
Porter, get down!
So close, Helen.
Looks like I'll just have to kill you myself.
Hel, I've reacquired your signal.
There are multiple signals behind you.
Cleo, find cover!
Okay!
Lara, let's play.
Creegan!
Come on.
Hel, Quint, I want Creegan alive.
His shield's too strong, Voice!
Don't stop, Hel.
This is starting to feel really good!
What are you and the Bailies up to, Creegan?
Oh, you'll find out soon enough, Hel.
You all will.
You're too late, Voice!
This has got to have better range.
I got him!
C
- Cleo, disengage!
Cleo!
No!
Cleo.
Let her go, Creegan!
You had to try and talk Hel out of killing her friends.
You couldn't just shoot first and ask questions later, huh?
If you insist.
She-she fried his shield generator!
Heads up.
What's it gonna be, Hel?
Hel, we have our directive.
Voice wants Creegan alive.
Hel, this is connected to the Bailies.
During Creegan's little game, their activity has increased.
Take Creegan back to the prison level... and return to the lab for further directives.
Hey!
You've got a visitor.
Stand back from the energy screen.
You've got one hour.
After that, he won't be talking to anyone.
He said, "Stand back."
Or don't you listen?
It's my job to listen, Mr. Creegan.
I'm your Confessor.
What makes you think I want to confess anything?
It is the right of every condemned man... to unburden his soul, Mr. Creegan.
If you don't want to talk, that's fine.
Believe me,
I'm happy to get the hell out of this place.
That's not very charitable.
You know how it works, Creegan.
I have the power to open my mind to you.
I can take your sins.
Now, what sane man would want to do that... for you?
My sins are my own.
I treasure them.
I cherish them.
Why would I want to share them with you?
Oh.
Murder?
Betrayal?
These are the precious memories... you want to take from this world?
You don't get it, do you?
They're about to execute me for sins of the past, things I've already done.
But it's the crime I'm about to commit... that you'll all pay most dearly.
What are you talking about?
There's no stopping it.
When I die, the world dies with me.
What did you mean, the world ends with you?
It's pretty self-explanatory.
I will be solely responsible... for the extermination of the entire human race.
How's that for a legacy?
The world seems safe from you now, Mr. Creegan.
Tell me, how do you plan to go about this holocaust?
I thought you could see into my soul, Confessor.
You tell me:
How does the world end?
No, I told you that I can only accept... the thoughts you choose to give me.
Are you ready to reveal yourself?
Are you?
I don't have any secrets.
Hmm.
Nice.
To answer your question,
I don't need to be free to have my goals achieved.
I set this plan in motion a long time ago.
So how will you know if your plan's a success?
I mean, after you're gone.
Faith, Confessor.
Faith that the future will unfold as I ordained it,
despite her best efforts to stop me.
Whose best efforts?
Voice.
Voice?
The Voice?
And her precious teams of resistance fighters.
You see, now I know you're joking.
The Voice?
It's a myth.
It's a children's story.
She's as real as you and me, my friend.
I used to be close to Voice not so long ago.
Before my expulsion.
Before she became a recluse... and such a thorn in my side.
What the hell is that?
I don't know, but I don't like it.
Tuck and roll.
So, this vendetta of yours has lasted for...
Years.
Without much success, until recently.
The tides turned when I first learned the location of Mauser, a reprogrammed Betrayer... assigned to Voice's flagship team.
You see, my plan was to trace Voice... through Mauser's internal link to her network.
Creegan, we're not secure.
I don't care.
I want Mauser.
Hel, have you secured Mauser?
Not yet.
Mauser must not be captured.
If you can't secure him, eliminate him.
Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?
Mauser's dead.
Not dead, he's just offline.
Imagine my surprise... when I discovered the daughter of a former colleague... and one of my closest friends... was the leader of this particular Voice team.
Creegan!
My plan for Mauser would be unsuccessful, but it didn't matter... for on that day,
Voice had shown me her weakness:
Helen.
The lever I would use to overturn her.
And in turn...
Helen showed me her own weakness.
Hey there, little girl.
Hel, what's happening?
He's here, Voice.
My father.
Hel, that's not possible.
He's dead.
Hel, listen to me.
Hel, can you hear me?
Hel, say something.
Creegan.
Shh.
Try not to speak, Hel.
No, don't move Helen, you'll disrupt the link.
Hello again, Voice.
Creegan.
I should've known it was you.
Thank you, Voice.
That's all I needed.
Voice, Creegan's tracing you through my receptor.
Don't transmit!
I'm too brilliant for that, Voice.
Shutting up won't save you.
My tracer will locate you in minutes.
You did this, Creegan.
You caused the explosion.
And like clockwork, you dispatched Hel.
Your "A" number one foot soldier... who I knew could be lured away from the pack... simply be tapping into... that little obsessed part of her psyche:
Daddy.
Voice command.
Enable self-destruct.
Hel, what are you doing?
Yes, Hel, pray tell.
The way I see it,
I die, the receptor dies with me.
No receptor, no Voice, no trace.
Hel, is this the only option?
Yes!
Hel, I find your sudden zest for death... undeniably delicious.
Hook right.
It's only zest when you're dying with me.
Any more surprises... and I won't be responsible for my actions.
Keep tracing!
So, what do you think, Voice?
You really think the daughter of your most valued follower... has it in her to end her own life?
No.
Voice hasn't told you, huh, Hel?
You found that to be a recurring trait of hers lately?
The more she says, the less you know.
Isn't that really infuriating?
Yep, Dad and the Voice were really tight!
Creegan's about to compromise my location.
He's close.
We're close, aren't we, Hel?
You want what I want.
Let's sit down with the Voice... and clear some things up, eh?
Hel!
Creegan.
Abort self-destruct.
That's my Hel!
Hel, what are you doing?
Redirect half-burst.
This isn't over.
So tell me, how did you get away from Voice?
I never make a plan without leaving an escape route.
And yet, here you are.
I thought you were here to comfort me... in my final hour, Confessor.
Sometimes vigorous self-examination... is the path to peace.
Yeah, yeah, right.
Well, you know, I've only got 30 minutes to live here, so...
I'm sorry.
Please continue.
Now, let me guess:
Your narrow escape from Voice doesn't discourage you... from going after her again, right?
Well, if at first you don't succeed...
Why?
What do you mean?
The Voice.
If she really exists, she's fighting a noble cause:
to liberate us all.
And these people who are fighting for her... are just as dedicated.
What could this woman have possibly done to you... to justify this lust for vengeance, this mad fantasy of world destruction?
Five hundred years, five centuries, my legions of armies have readied themselves... to fulfill their destiny.
My destiny!
I will not be denied by some cut-rate scientist... and her army of insolent thugs!
Well done.
Not only did your attempt to kill two Voice teams at once fail, but you've left yourself... without an escape route this time.
When you play the odds, sometimes you eat the bear, sometimes the bear eats you.
The bear?
It's all becoming clear now, what you said a moment ago... about having to wait 500 years... to fulfill your destiny.
Well, I'm told I have a penchant for hyperbole.
And a knowledge of extinct animals.
And what about your skin?
Oh, please,
I'm a little sensitive about it.
It's damage caused by extensive exposure to cryo-fluid, isn't it?
You're what they call a thaw.
You're five centuries old.
We all have our little secrets.
That's why you're here, isn't it?
To learn my secrets?
Isn't that right...
Voice?
What did you call me?
You almost had me, Voice.
But a confessor listens.
He doesn't challenge, doesn't provoke.
Oh, come on, Voice!
I've shown you mine, time to show me yours!
You are mad.
Don't be shy.
You know what I want.
Hel wasn't afraid to come and ask for the truth, and I gave it to her!
Hel, your father is dead.
Same old story, and you're sticking to it.
It's the truth.
I've heard enough of your truth.
Hel, don't do this.
After all we've been through together, everything we've achieved.
It's meaningless without trust, and I don't trust you anymore, not where my father's concerned.
We can resolve this, Hel.
If you'll just give me the chance,
I'll explain everything to you.
You had your chance.
We do have posted visiting hours, Hel.
You listen to me, you freak.
My father's alive, and you're going to help me find him.
Cara, my friend, I don't believe it.
You actually did it.
Did what?
Where is he?
I can take you to him, but it'll cost you more than my freedom.
What do you want now?
You know what I want!
No.
All my life, Voice has stood in my way.
Her and her precious little teams, fighting for an impossible cause.
Well, not anymore.
You're going to help me achieve my lifelong dream, Hel.
You give me Voice, or there's no deal.
Where do we start?
It's a sionic transplane generator.
Used correctly, it's the perfect infiltration device
Daddy and I helped Voice conceive.
You saw the holo-photo, Hel.
We were one big happy think tank down here, huh, Harge?
I thought your father died keeping this out of my hands.
I'll take that.
Naturally.
Oh, my God!
Now, Hel, your journey is over.
Dad?
I just hate long hellos.
Get him!
You go get Daddy, I'll wait here.
The hell you will.
Damn it, Helen, get out of here now!
Not without you!
Get the girl!
Some family reunion, huh?
Fireworks and everything.
So, you are Creegan.
In the flesh.
We've received your communication.
You have served us well.
You will be rewarded.
Oh, will I ever.
Just ask me, Voice!
Your world's about to end in 20 minutes, and you're here to find out how to save it!
Voice.
How nice it is to see you again.
How did you forge an alliance with the Bailies, Creegan?
You're still beautiful.
Creegan, I give you one last chance to make amends.
Who leads the Bailies?
I do.
Or more precisely,
I did.
Well!
Looks like they've developed a will of their own.
It's over, Voice.
Surely now you see how futile your puny little resistance has been in the face of their power.
Tell me how to stop them, Creegan.
The name's Bailey.
George Bailey.
At least I get to live long enough to see this day come.
The day when my children will finally inherit the Earth.
Why did you do it?
Create those monsters.
Five hundred years ago, this planet was dying, infected by a swarming plague of humanity.
So you thought you would save the world... by destroying the human race?
Not at first.
Initially the Bailies were environmental control units... cleaning up the mess that we humans left behind.
Until you decided we humans were the mess.
Not me.
In due time, they decided that for themselves.
I just happened to agree with them.
It's not too late.
The Bailies have accomplished what you designed them to do.
The world is new again.
You can give it back to us.
What makes you think you deserve it?
How do we stop them?
You can't!
The Bailies may have been your legacy, Creegan, but my ancestors left us a legacy as well:
the shaft defense cannons, the only weapons capable of destroying a Bailey.
We've moved them to the surface.
This war isn't over yet, Creegan.
It's just beginning.
Hel, do you read me?
Voice!
I read you, Voice.
Go ahead.
Creegan told me nothing before he died.
Proceed with the counterattack.
Understood, Voice.
Commencing counterattack.

How soon we forget whet once was
Nothing remains what once it was
Love is fickle, it comes and goes
Like a dream that grows, and away it blows
How soon we forget whet once was
Nothing remains what once it was
Everything in life sounds like a song
Fading and vanishing in the farewell
What have I done?
Why does this happen to me?
What's going on?
What was that?
It came from outside.
- Llnal
- I'm coming.
I've been calling Salzburg 5054.
What was that bang?
Maybe you're imagining it.
No, miss.
I didn't mean you.
Go back to sleep.
Miss, I'm not talking to you.
I mean Salzburg, 5054.
It's always busy.
How can you sleep with ell that noise?
Come out now.
When she" we meet again?
Call me.
Well, I'll ring you.
Come along now.
Well, hello there, pretty lady.
Well, m'lad.
Taking a day off sick?
Are you mad?
I'm very sick.
Good Lord.
- Hello, Mrs. Webber.
- Hello, Mr. Winkler.
- Any mall for ma?
- No.
- Any phone calls?
- No.
- Is Halla here yet?
- No one is here yet.
Can you have my bath prepared for me?
Llnal I can't bear it anymore.
She's really getting deaf.
Do you have a cigarette?
No, Baron, I'm sorry.
What's wrong?
- What's wrong?
- Something's happened.
Bootz, do you have a cigarette?
- There are some there.
- Thanks.
What happened?
Did you kill someone?
It made a strange noise.
Look at it.
Look at this.
It's no!
my fault.
Good heavens.
- So It's broken again?
- Yes.
Walt a bit.
It's only the cord.
I'll fix it.
Just a minute.
You know."...
I had to take the sofa to room 7 yesterday.
These things must be done.
Two girls have moved in there.
Beautiful girls.
Two sisters.
Two dancers.
But they are both quite unapproachable.
Like princesses.
Like princesses.
There you are, it works again.
- Thanks a lot, Mr. Wlnkler.
- Quiet!
I can't even hear Russian, my own language.
Well, butterfly, why are you fluttering by?
You're no!
the only one engaged to play in Berlin.
I've put together e new piece.
I'd like you to hear It.
Come along.
The bath is ready.
- Fine.
- What?
Fine.
Hello.
- Is Mr. Wlnkler back?
- He's in the bath.
Peter, I'm here.
- I'm nearly finished.
- Fine.
Hello, Mrs. Weber.
- Hello, Hells darling.
May I have the butter dish?
Don't put blue cheese in it.
We won't eat that when we're going out.
Do you know If he bought tickets for the cinema?
I must go home first.
You can be home and back before 9.
I've had a new dress made, Mrs. Weber.
It's so beautiful.
It's quite tight at the top, in green silk.
It's a long dress.
Wlth black trim and it's six metres wide.
Then I bought stockings.
And gloves.
And now I'm totally penniless.
I paid two marks towards a hat as well.
Peter has to lend me the other ten marks.
Aren't you sad at all, Miss Hells?
Sad?
Why?
Don't you know Mr. Winklefs leaving tomorrow?
Where for?
- Where?
- Dresden.
Hasn't he mentioned I!
to you stall?
Llna's brought his suitcases down from the attic.
Do you think I like it?
He's lived here for three years.
The only one who paid his rent on time.
No one can say
I don't treat my guests well.
So that Idiot didn't tell her anything?
I don't understand it.
What are you snooping around here for?
Well I...
- What have you got there?
- Nothing at all.
Give I!
lo me.
Aspirin.
Keep it.
Hello, little one.
Don't.
Hang on to these.
Listen, Peter.
Is It true that you're going away?
What do you want, really?
You're going away and I don't know.
I want to know what It means.
Do you want to get rid of me?
Be quiet now and listen to me.
Where is that letter?
Read this.
Go ahead, read it.
I've received such an offer...
The sort that only comes once every hundred years.
300 marks, base salary.
And 10% commission for a new product.
Electric cooling apparatus.
Bear Brand sells them here, you've heard of them.
YOU $98.
You've always asked why that fellow has money.
He's their Berlin rep and he told me about it.
But, Hella, dear child.
Why are you crying?
Listen.
It's not definite yet.
I haven't decided.
I've been thinking about It all week.
So you knew all week and you didn't tell me.
Everything was still so uncertain.
I really didn't want to accept.
I'm still not sure now what to do.
I forgot the straps for the cases.
- Can I go In to Mr. Wlnkler.
- No. not now.
Wlll he still lend me his patent leather shoes?
You might be lucky.
He's not going till tomorrow.
You know."...
I'd love to travel somewhere too.
Belng In vaudeville is being like a gypsy.
It's quite enjoyable.
You get around a bit.
You get to know the ladies everywhere.
You end up terribly well educated.
- This stupid travelling.
- Hand me the blue one.
Be careful, stupid cow, with your things.
This always makes me sick, for a week beforehand.
What shall I do in a strange town?
Without you?
What's up?
Could I bother you for a second?
As I'm e short Hungarian?
Excuse ma, If I as a humble comedian...
My name is Neumann.
The railways managed to lose my luggage.
Thls mundane artiste must wear tails.
You should see me In them.
You have no idea.
An English Lord is nothing in comparison.
Mrs. Weber, the dragon, told me you're the one who owns patent leather shoes.
- For God's sake...
- Why bring him into it?
Don't worry about the size.
I've tried them on.
And I'll tell you this.
The left shoe is torn at the front.
It's like that now, so don't accuse me later.
I can'!
appear without patent leather shoes.
You shoes will laugh their socks off.
- You'll see.
- But I need them, Mr...
Neumann.
You should have remembered.
You'll get your Sunday best back at 4 pm.
Take my lemon soles as security.
For God's sake, take my shoes.
No, take those with you too.
You're as friendly as the sunrise.
A disgustingly friendly fellow.
That young man is e very good chap.
You know, I'm not really like that.
If I could only get a permanent job.
Your debts make you a fixture here.
Do you think I like fetching suitcases?
Carrying sofas?
Running upstairs and downstairs?
Just because I didn't pay rent for two years?
That landlady really exploits me.
For one whole week
I was paid only 50... 50 pfennigs.
Didn't you find any little extras?
Find?
But that's all.
- What have you got?
- Aspirin.
- Would you like one?
- No thanks.
If you know someone with a headache, tell me and I'll sell him one for five pfennigs.
Let me tell you.
If I don'!
get a permanent job soon I'll be the one with the headache.
You really should accept it.
Well...
- But...
- Think about it.
300 marks plus 10%.
Here you hardly get half that.
If only It didn't have to start so soon.
There's no time to really think about it.
The day after tomorrow.
At least you had more time than I did.
Do you think I like leaving you alone here?
I won't get stolen.
Or have you heard about a salesgirl getting pinched from a store?
Don't make fun now.
Come inl
Good evening.
I'm returning your laundry.
That's 6. 70 marks.
- Here.
Keep the change.
- Thanks.
Can I take the next lot?
No.
Mr Winkler is going away.
You don't say?
For ever?
Well then, good night.
Could you lend me a pair of black socks?
Have a look in the drawer.
Mr. Wlnkler promised to lend me some later, but... the performance might be over by then.
Did you find any?
I found one.
The other mustn't like me.
It looks a bi!
colourful in here.
When I still had a steady girlfriend things were different with me.
She was a lovely girl.
She married a merchant.
I didn't hold it against her.
What could she do with a Vagabond like me?
She had lovely brown hair.
A bit like Hells.
I've found two.
But they've got the measles.
- Would you have some Ink?
- Look over there?
- Turn on the light to write.
- Thanks, I can manage.
You're stupid.
Listen, Hells.
Are you sad?
No.
Tell me.
What do you like about me?
I don't know.
What do you like in other men?
What Is I!
that makes you like someone.
What?
Supposing someone talks to you in the street?
- I wouldn't allow that.
- Only supposing... and whet if you really liked him?
I have you.
And when I'm gone?
So you'll be waiting for me tonight.
And what about me?
Would you perhaps have a nice friend?
For my sister.
I can't just chloroform her whilst I'm out.
Yes, of course, it's Betty.
I changed it last year.
- Where?
The Casanova?
- of course.
What about The Casanova?
What?
Too expensive?
Who do you think you are?
It's not for your beautiful eyes, led.
No, if you can't afford us you'd better stay at home and let your canary sing to you.
You must have been hit by a peg bag.
How could you let him get away?
Why not give him a chance?
You don't give lip.
You use your sex appeal.
I don't understand.
After all, every woman needs a man.
Of course.
How many did you know before you met me?
One, two, three...
Four. five...
What. you had half a dozen?
Where's the white one with the initials.
That one?
I'm wearing it.
You, Hella, will you remain loyal?
I don't know.
- Be serious now.
- I don't know.
Perhaps.
As long as no one talks to me in the street.
I only meant, if I like him.
You...
Miss Hellal
Telephone!
SOWY -
- Yes?
- Telephone.
Hello?
Yes?
Baron, darling.
So they sent the hat to my place already?
Of course.
And you'll still have to pay?
Unfortunately.
What?
That's really nice of you.
I'll get you e nice present.
Yes.
Goodbye.
What ls It.
Who was it?
A SBCTGL
Don't get upset.
It's pointless.
I want to know who rings you here.
You must be jealous.
- You have secrets too.
- Me'!
You didn't tell me about the new job.
Why should I tell you?
And you?
You have to know everything.
I must go home for half an hour.
I thought we were going out tonight.
That's why I'll be back in half an hour.
What have you got to go home for?
Wouldn't you like to know!
Everyone else knew.
But he didn't tell Hella.
Listen, I don't think it will be possible.
If I pay what I owe here, as well as for the trip,
I'd have 80 marks.
80 marks for the month, and in a strange city.
And you'd give up, because of that?
You can leave me as security if it doesn't work out.
I'll ask Mrs. Weber if she'll agree to it.
You silly boy.
I'm going now.
He'll find a way round it.
Was it ever hard to convince him.
He didn't want to accept because of me.
He's still not quite sure.
I'll get him to take it.
Won't you be miserable when he goes away?
But it's such a good chance for him.
And Dresden...
Dresden is not so far.
You forgot to pack the toothbrush mug.
Where's our bath towel?
Here, the photos of your boxer.
And the Count brought his lover home to his ancestral castle.
I think that this sort of thing only exists in novels.
Stupid goose.
How can you be so stupid?
But we're not staying here on our last night.
What a pity I don't have the hat.
I can't borrow money from Peter now.
I'd like to be beautiful tonight.
But you always are, Miss Hells.
With sex appeal.
Why don't you borrow It from Mr. Bogdanoff?
You went money from me'!
I'd like to give you money.
But I prefer you without a hat.
- No.
- Take it, silly.
Repay him on the first of the month.
There's no hurry.
This month or next month.
Please.
Take as much as you like.
- Fifty?
A hundred?
- She only needs ten.
- Can you lend me ten?
- of course.
Take it.
Now I must...
- Can I send the Baron?
- of course.
BBFOHI
May I?
Thanks.
- Thank you very much.
- You're very welcome.
Baron, can you do me a great favour!
I'll give you a packet of cigarettes.
With pleasure, Miss Hella.
For you... anything.
Mr. Bootz, Why are you sitting in the dark?
I need the ambiance.
Oh, Mr. Boom.
You're so funny.
What's that?
Get the salt.
I've thought about It.
You'll do well on 300.
You'll get double with the commission.
If you put away 300 a month, that will be, per year...
- 3500 marks.
- 600.
And in two years... three thousand, six thousand.
7200.
You...
We could, in two years... you know, I am almost happy about it.
What?
Maybe you have someone waiting for you?
Do you want to get rid of me?
Hella.
Tell ma, Hella.
Have you ever been unfaithful?
Come here, Halla.
Right now.
Come, come.
Are you... 7 That's better.
What do you want?
Si!
down here.
A little kiss?
- A kiss?
- No.
Kiss!
What's wrong with you?
My little angel.
What's wrong?
- Is It better now?
- Yes.
Yes?
You'll see.
Are you afraid?
Who is the stronger one?
You are.
After all, you're the man.
Sorry, Mr. Wlnkler, for being a nuisance.
You wouldn't have a respectable pair of socks?
Neumann, leave me in peace.
I'll come and see you later on.
Give me the sticking plaster.
What an elegant place.
If you were renting here, you'd love it.
I've never seen such thin wells.
Imagine having a visitor.
Don't yell.
You can hear everything here.
I want to know why you are going home.
- It doesn't concern you.
- Really?
I believed it did concern me.
Who do you really think you are?
Do you want to control me from Dresden?
I didn't feel I had to.
You seem to be very sure of yourself.
Tell me, what do you mean by that?
Think about It till I get back.
"Are you nervy?"
'Suffer from sleeplessness.
'Neuralgia pslns, leg cramps, ear ache?
"Try Doctor Kraft's Mobilosan.
"The pine-needle bath for your nerves. '
There, for you.
Goodbye.
Fritz Rieder, 26 Ansbacher St.
Monday evening 7:30 p. m.
Monday, 30 September.
He won't notice a thing.
Don't ever say that.
I didn't mean you, old goggle eyes.
Hello, operator.

ls Miss Hells there?
This is Winkler.
No!
home?
What did she say?
She won't be back?
A parcel?
Who from?
Please check who it came from.
Riedefl
Thank you.
Listen to this one.
- Is It for grown ups?
- Sure.
Inside.
Listen lo this.
Mr. Muller meets Mr. Schulze.
Says Muller "Schulze. your wife is unfaithful. "
Thank you.
I've forgotten my keys.
Mrs. Weber!
- I want my bill?
- Why do you want it today?
There'll be time tomorrow.
That joke was excellent.
I want my bill.
What is it?
Was there trouble with Miss Hells?
Did she make a scene?
Did she cry?
I can write out the bill for you here.
When she left lust now she seemed cheerful.
She was singing in the hall.
Perhaps she was happy because I'm leaving.
I've though!
about that too, Mr. Winkler.
What do you mean?
She only chatted about hats and dresses in here.
Why shouldn't a girl buy a dress for herself?
But such an expensive dress?
You have to ask yourself where it all comes from.
And she has new shoes.
Where did she get all that from?
Did you buy them for her?
L!
didn't seem right to me.
Do you know that Mr. Bogdanoff gave her money.
I saw It with my own eyes, cross my heart.
She practically demanded it from him.
Rent comes to 85 marks.
Coffee 15 marks...
All this din they make, it's not nice.
But the heart is pure.
You know, always ash on the floor.
- Another coffee?
- I won't say no to that.
What does that blond guy see in that girl?
You called her a nice gin, but Isn't she moving In with that fellow?
- Think they pick flowers all day?
- I know I've never seen it.
If Neumann hadn't chatted so much,
I'd still have my job today.
When a man looks at them, they say "You can'!
have this for nothing.
'I won't be looked at unless I get something. "
I don't want to say anything, God knows.
I won't bite my tongue.
But let me tell you, that's how they are.
A bit of a pretty face, and they get uppity.
They want to...
Fritz Rieder, 26, Ansbacher St.
Don't know.
Lina has to help me pack.
- Why, Mr. Wlnkler?
- I went to pack.
What's all the rush?
- I'm catching the train.
- But it leaves tomorrow.
There's one tonight too.
Good God, Mr. Winkler.
- Llnel
- Leave it, I'll help you.
What on earth is the matter now?
- I don'!
understand you.
- Good heavens.
How can you take this so seriously?
Leave It now.
I'll help you.
Good Lord.
Llna has to clean number 4 too.
I'm coming, Mr. Winkler.
Neumann has my patent leather shoes.
Poor Mr. Neumann can't appear in his own shoes.
Tough!
I owe B0012 three marks.
My bathrobe's still here.
- It's still quite wet.
- It'll dry.
Fill the registration In yourself.
I don't have time.
Mr. Wlnkler, don't make me unhappy.
I can't appear like a barefoot dancer.
My jokes may be bad, but I need good shoes.
Leave me alone now.
You're bothering me.
Llna, I want you to get me a cab, double quick.
Ladies and gentlemen, we would like...
here's one that's asleep.
We wish to present the exotic snake dancer...
now, what was her name?
Age Hoppla Bestileta.
You've never experienced anyone so exotic.
Please keep your hands on the table.
If we were to go back in world history, we'd find the victory of female grace everywhere.
Once you've seen this excellent artiste... without tears filling your eyes...
Mr. Wlnkler, are you really leaving?
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Baron.
Take these cigarettes.
Smoke them and think of me.
If you mus!
go, then have a good trip.
I'll write.
Goodbye.
I'll still think of him for e while.
Greet, these Lennox sisters.
What do you say to that?
Mr. Winkler took off.
- What does that mean?
- He's left.
He's left?
And he didn't even say goodbye to me.
I knew it.
These Germans...
They don't have a heart.
Let the sun shine in your heart.
He lived here for three years.
He really was e decent men,
YES...
He didn't forget anything.
These potatoes are lumpy.
Yes, I'm coming.
What's the matter?
Come on, hurry up.
It's not my fault you're so fat.
Disgusting.
Too tight.
And after all this spicy business.
Here's something really sweet.
I ran ell the way.
I had to welt half an hour at the seamstress.
Then I had to fetch the hat.
What are you staring at?
Am I a ghost?
Aren't you surprised?
You didn't expect this?
No, I didn't.
Miss Hells.
Mrs. Weber.
Yes, Hella, darting.
What's happened?
What?
I don't know what got into him.
L!
was as If he had suddenly gone mad.
He yelled at Llna.
Didn't let me speak.
Took the shoes off Mr. Neumann.
L!
was a real drama, I can tell you.
You should have been here.
But then, that's men for you.
They always do whet they feel like doing.
They don't care what happens to others.
Miss Hells...
I've had experience with men as well.
Good heavens!
Look at the damage he has done here.
He's destroyed the whole chair.
He'll have to pay me for that.
Tell me, what would I get for this?
Probably 25 to 30 marks at one of the better pawn shops.
If I part with my heirloom
I at least want something for it.
You see, when it rains,
I can't go out any longer.
- Have you heard my ad?
- No.
Come here.
Take a seat.
Come here, boy.
Pay attention now.
Esteemed spectators, and everyone else, we're all miserable...
except you, my boy...
We're all miserable in these sad times.
But I can see, some retain their love of life.
Young man, hold onto your bride, lest someone pinch her.
Hells darling, don't be so unhappy.
Such a pretty girl like you.
Mrs. Weber!
He wasn't good enough for you.
Wait, I'm coming.
I'll be back, Hells darling.
A gentleman wishes to see the room.
Please do come in, Sir.
How did you get into the house?
The door was open.
Let's look at number four.
She was completely desperate.
Last year we had a girl, and her bridegroom left her just like that.
Do you know what she did?
No, for that you pay extra.
That's usual, isn't it?
I better look for her, so she won't do what the other gifl did.
Yes, Mr. Bogdanoff, you do that.
For bath and services you pay a little extra.
The music next door is included I guess.
Miss Hells.
Why are you so sad, dear child?
And you're wearing such a lovely dress.
Just like a beautiful meadow with a lovely flower.
So this is the hat.
How beautiful.
Very elegant.
end tasteful.
You're quite wrong.
Pests in my house?
When I've had the whole place fumigated?
You'd make me very happy-
Go out with me now, for a while.
It's not good for you to be alone now.
I just mean, let's go out for coffee and some music.
Just lo forget.
I beg you, please leave me alone now.
I want to be alone.
Would you like to see this room?
This is the best room.
The last gentleman was here for three years.
- I like this one.
- I'll have it prepared.
Thls ls the young lady I was telling you about.
Mrs. Weber!
You don't need to be ashamed, darling.
It's not your fault you've been wronged.
It can happen to anyone.
Don't cry for him, you know.
I wouldn't do that man such an honour.
Don't you agree?
He abandons the girl, leaves without any reason, without saying a word.
Would you do that?
A girl as pretty as you!
You'll get someone else, probably ten of them.
I guarantee that personally.
You can have anyone.
Ha was not a good-natured man.
He didn't even say goodbye to me, his friend.
Mrs. Weber.
Would you have a spare key?
We'll probably return separately.
Now he's taken the key as well.
The damage the!
man did is beyond belief.
Our new lodger needs a new key too.
Yes?
Do you know if Mr. Winkler took the keys?
The keys?
I didn't break anything.
Silly goose.
A man who abandons a girl like that, that would be the end of him.
I only saw him once.
When we met in the hall.
And do you think he even said hello?
That's the sort of man I really like!
He didn't even tip me.
What?
He was stingy too?
He must have been an arrogant chap.
If I'd have got my hands on him,
- I'd have shown him.
- I always say...
I'm sure he was planning all week how to get away.
A miserable fellow.
Come on, smile.
A man who leaves without one good word...
A lout.
- He told me something.
- Who did'!
He did.
Mr. Winkler.
He told me to give his regards to Miss Hella.
He did?
Yes...
He said that he will write.
That's whet he said.
And he...
This ring, he said... to give you.
Isn't it his?
- You know It, this ring?
- A ring?
- He gave you that?
- But yes.
That is really... and he told you that, you of all people.
Well, who else?
Don't you cry any more now.
Come now, smile.
Come on.
Such a lovely ring.
He must really have loved you.
I always felt he wasn't a mean man.
But he needs more soul, a little bit more soul.
He was really agitated.
Not everyone can take farewells.
I was almost tempted.
I needy said something bed about him.
Now you wanted the keys, didn't you?
I'll see If Mr. Bootz could lend me his.
Please excuse this commotion.
But when you've lived for three years with a man, you are deeply touched by this son of thing.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Mr. BOOtZ!
I!
Goodbye, Miss Hells.
If you write to him, write about me too.
You'll always have a friend in me.
You know,
I can't stand to see a woman cry.
When I see that...
I'll do anything.
- Everything's under water.
- Yes.
That stupid cow let the bath overflow.
Wear It always, don't ever forget me, Hells.
I just go!
through.
Why did you cut us off?
Everything in life sounds like a song
Fading and vanishing in the farewell
Fire in the Opera
Well, gentlemen ...
What shall we do for our next premiere?
Being only the cashier, I vote for an operetta.
Perhaps the Czardasfürstin?
# the girlies, the girlies
And I, considering artistic stage direction, vote for a real opera.
For instance, Götterdämmerung.
Leave us in peace with your "Dämmerung".
[twilight]
Nowadays the public wants light, life, the sun.
But we aren't a family seaside resort!
We've exchanged enough words, now let me see deeds. [Faust]
You're perfectly right, you want girls.
I can understand that, I know you intimately, dear friend.
And you want classical music, but the public wants both.
So I'm asking for suggestions.
Well ... difficult.
Flötenthal, take that cigar out of your mouth.
Why?
Director, do you know whom Flötenthal resembles?
Offenbach!
Of course!
Gentlemen ...
I've got it!
We'll give "The Tales of Hoffmann"
Excellent!
Of course, there's both in it:
you'll get your girlies, and you'll get your classical music.
# Joyfully we greet this noble hall where only art and peace shall ever dwell, # where long the glad cry shall resound:
# "Hail to Thuringia's prince, the Landgrave Hermann!"
Say, Monk, did you take away the part from..., what's her name, Majewsky?
Yes, of course.
But she refused to give up the part.
She says she's been playing Gretchen for 25 years, and she fails to understand why she shouldn't go on playing her.
When she's right, she's right.
25 years is enough.
Good God...
Oh well ...
What can we do?
Why are you always sneaking up behind me!
How far gone are they on the stage?
The entrance of the guests, Director.
All right, and why are you standing so close to me?
Do you want something?
Director, I wanted to tell you, Herr Faber is waiting in the parlour.
Herr Faber!
And he's only telling me now.
Have you gone crazy!
Only now you're telling me this!
My apologies.
How could you!
Faber!
Good evening, Herr Faber.
Good evening.
What a pleasure!
I'm infinitely pleased, my dear Herr Faber!
Such a pleasure, such an honour.
How are you?
Good evening, Director, thank you, I'm fine.
- You, too?
- Yes, me too.
I've just attended the performance.
Really great, very interesting.
A beautiful performance.
I always imagine how terribly tiring it must be, wearing all those curly wigs and beards.
Not at all, dear Herr Faber, tradition, just tradition.
of course
What'll be your next premiere?
Our next premiere?
The Tales of Hoffmann.,
Ah, Offenbach, that's beautiful, glad to hear this.
The Barcarolle, isn't it?
Which lady is going to play the main part?
Which one?
I mean, Hoffmann must have a sweetheart?
Of course, but Hoffmann has three sweethearts.
Well ... you little Director you ...
aren't you mistaken?
I think the guy with the three sweethearts, that's that pale demonic fellow, with the pointed beard.
Forgive me if I correct you, dear Herr Faber, that was in Spain, that was Don Juan.
That's right, Don Juan, I've mixed it up.
So who's playing the three sweethearts?
But this is our dilemma!
If we only knew!
I don't have anybody, I don't know anybody.
A catastrophe!
But that's wonderful!
Why wonderful?
I already told you: it's a catastrophe!
May I close the door for a moment?
Listen to me, Director.
- Can we sit down for a moment?
- Please, after you.
I'd like to make a little proposal, that is, we would like to make a little proposal.
Herr van Lingen ...
But of course, dear Herr Faber!
The singer shall, with the king...
Yes I know, I know.
It's already done.
Who is the person in question?
Let me see, the name ...
Here, the third noble page.
The third noble page, one moment...
Noble pages .... 3.
Floriane Bach
# Wolfram von Eschenbach, begin!
Third noble page ...
Floriane Bach.
Floriane Bach!
But of course!
# And lo!
I behold a fountain of delights # on which my spirit gazes, filled with wonder:
# from it there flows blissful joy # by which my heart is inexpressibly refreshed.
Do you know a Miss Floriane Bach?
Floriane Bach?
Yes, chorus and small parts.
Small parts, yes.
tell her to come up.
Director, she's engaged in the War of the Minstrels at the moment.
Get her out of the War of the Minstrels, I want to talk to her, at once.
You take her off the stage, just like that?
That's charming.
well, I thank you that you're so obliging.
Don't mention it, my dear.
I'd just like to remark ... of course my kapellmeister will have to examine the lady first.
I see, examine her...
By the way, I have all powers of attorney ... to grant the further financing of your theatre by Herr van Lingen.
Really?
I can assure you that the examination will be conducted most benevolently.
Then we're totally d'accord.
# Women's virtue and high honour will I, # as a knight, defend with my sword # but those delights that captured your immaturity # are shoddy, not worth a blow.
# Hail, Biterolf!
Here are our swords!
# Ha, you foolish braggart, Biterolf!
Do you sing of love, you fierce wolf?
# Assuredly you have never known that which I find pleasurable.
# What, poor wretch, have you known of pleasure?
# Your life was lacking in love, # and what paltry joys befell you were indeed not worth a blow!
# We'll hear no more!
End this audacity!
# Put up your sword!
Minstrels, keep the peace!
# O heaven, let me now implore thee, grant my song divine approval!
# Let me see sin banished from this noble, pure assembly!
Good evening, Miss Bach.
My congratulations!
Why?
I think Santa Claus has just been here.
You just go up to your Director, he'll tell you all about it.
Goodbye!
Goodbye.
# Thou didst come from heaven, I follow from afar;
# so guide me to that land where thy star shines forever.
# To you, goddess of love, shall my song be raised!
# Loudly let me now sing your praise!
# Your sweet charms are the source of all beauty, # and every fair wonder springs from you.
# Only he who has known your ardent embrace knows what love is;
# poor wretches who have never tasted love, # away!
hasten to the hill of Venus!
Come here.
Closer.
Closer.
Come on, don't feel embarrassed, for God's sake.
Tell me ... have you studied The Tales of Hoffmann?
Yes.
Which part?
All three.
All three?
In eight days we'll have the premiere.
You'll sing Antonia, understood?
Good day.
Isn't he an angel!
- Who?
- The old man.
Something must have happened here.
I'll sing Antonia!
Ouch!
don't step on my corns!
Well, then let's do it properly.
No, no.
My God, my God the Minister thinks that ... in view of the amount involved in the guarantee for payment, he would in fact be obliged to create a syndicate, but that the law leaves the question open
whether the obligatory syndicate has to be convoked immediately after the expiry of the former.
It is well known that the coal-mines are of the opinion ... that the obligatory syndification should to be enforced at once, whereas the authoritative jurists of the Ministry ... claim that the Minister is not bound to any time limit.
The Minister couldn't be forced... to decide such a complicated matter overnight.
Therefore the Ministry has decided that in case of emergency ...
The girl will play the main part.
Wonderful.
Does she already know how she got to be awarded that honour?
No.
I think the Director will tell her.
I hope he does.
Without taking into account the unclear wording...
That's right!
That's right, that's right.
Have you already found out something?
Of course, I've made enquiries.
She seems to be a really decent fellow.
All alone, without parents or relatives.
How agreeable.
She's from Glogau.
Glogau, municipal theatre.
She lives in a furnished room, earns a ridiculously low wage, lives entirely on art and ideals.
Is that so?
Then she'll come to supper, won't she?
I guess so, Herr van Lingen.
I say, you're in luck!
do you know who he is, van Lingen?
Why?
But he's the guy who finances our theatre.
But he's so young!
He's inherited all that stuff from his father, the dockyards, everything.
He owns half the town!
Is that so?
Perhaps I won't go after all.
Thus the unclear situation ...
Herr Doctor?
I beg your pardon, Herr Doctor.
How long will it take you?
I'll be finished soon.
Thank you.
That means it'll last another hour.
I won't be able to get away from here for the time being.
Faber, do me a favour.
You'll go first, apologize to the girl, entertain her a bit... till I'm there, won't you?
You have such a nice way of doing such things.
Thousand thanks, very kind.
# ... the Lord to whom I raise my song.
# The grace of salvation is granted to the penitent;
# now he enters into the bliss of heaven!
# Hell and death cannot affright him, # therefore will I praise God all the days of my life.
# Hallelujah!
# Hallelujah!
# For evermore, for evermore.
Lobster?
Caviar?
Hamburg spring chicken with Roman salad?
With old Madeira.
Champagne?
which brand?
Château Parc Clément Pessac.
Dix neuf cent vingt deux (1922).
What about the gypsies?
They'll be playing next door.
Very well.
Shall I lay a third place setting?
No, thank you, I'm not staying.
After all, he couldn't ask that of me !
- Good day, Madame.
- Good evening.
I beg your pardon.
Madame is already expected
Hallo!
Oh!
You're here?
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
It's nice of you to come.
I've thought it over for quite a while.
Really?
And now?
And now ...
Well ...
All those flowers!
Are there too many of them?
There can never be too many flowers.
Fabulous!
Well ...
How do the poets say?
"Let flowers speak".
I think they speak a bit too plainly.
Allow me, van Lingen.
Herr van Lingen, Miss Floriane Bach.
I'm very happy to make your acquaintance at last.
I've seen you often on the stage.
As a cigarette girl in Carmen, and as a maid of Flanders in Czar and Carpenter.
Very great.
And lately as the third but charming noble page of the Landgrave of Thuringia.
But please, sit down.
Yes, but ...
That's Faber, my dear friend and secretary Faber.
Richard Faber.
You must have gotten to know each other by now, did he entertain you?
A witty boy.
Listen my dear, do me the favour ... and see to that merger business.
Go and make a phone call, will you, this is important too, isn't it?
Well ...
Well, Miss Floriane.
I'm really very happy that we can finally chat quietly, just the two of us
You know, in fact, Floriane is a silly name, a bit too long.
Shouldn't I call you Flory?
If I have to say Floriane all the time, the whole evening will be over, won't it?
Flory, Miss Flory.
Right?
Faber is a charming person, he is ... eh...
You know, he isn't one of the "pencil" Fabers, he's another Faber.
But still a nice person.
I mean, he takes care of all my business affairs.
I always come along later and ...
Well ...
He's such a dear, that Faber, such a dear.
A thousand thanks.
Well ...
To the very great career?
Thank you, but won't Faber come back?
Faber?
No.
He's making a phone call.
He went out to make a phone call, long distance, takes a long time.
The two of us can grow quite old till he comes back.
I see
Then I'd like to go straight home, too.
Go straight home?
No!
We want to have a nice and quiet supper.
Don't be hasty!
One thing after another.
First supper, then we go home.
Well ... do sit down.
What is it?
Are you cold?
- My coat.
- Coat.
I'll help you.
Here you are.
The other sleeve, too.
I'm really curious about how we are going to keep up that act.
Tell me!
Huh?
- You're not to say "Du" to me, Herr van Lingen!
- But kid...
I'm sorry if I raised false hopes in you, but you're free to withdraw your casting proposition.
And you can stuff your spring chicken into your hat!
But Miss!
Stop it!
Stop it, will you!
Hallo!
- Shall I serve supper?
- What?
No!
Champagne!
Champagne.
One moment please, wait here.
Good evening, Herr Faber.
I saw you sitting here and ...
I just wanted to tell you what I think of you.
Miss Bach!
- You're surprised?
- You can say that aloud.
You thought we were already at the lobster.
And after lobster there's caviar, and after caviar there's champagne,
gypsy music, and after that, there's ... well, what usually comes after that.
One coffee, please.
Herr van Lingen imagined today's supper to be a bit more extensive, I suppose.
But what has happened, for God's sake?
Tell me, how dare you leave me alone with that cad?
But Herr van Lingen invited you, not I.
I see, you were only the procurer.
But Miss Bach!
I mean, the fact that you came at all ...
You must have known ...
Yes, yes, speak it out, what I came for, didn't I?
Yes, yes, you're quite right.
An influential gentleman sponsors an unknown singer, and in the evening he presents the bill.
Of course, it's perfectly alright.
But ...
Let me tell you something.
Yes, do.
What is it?
I ...
I only came ... because I thought that you ...
Waiter, the check.
But let me...
No, thank you, I'll pay for my own coffee.
Go on, play something.
Get started!
Syrupy torch music!
Miss Bach!
Miss Bach!
Thank God I caught you in time.
I followed you, because I had a feeling ...
Tell me ...
What makes Herr van Lingen think he can use you as procurer?
But I'm his secretary!
After 6 p.m. too?
I'm his private secretary.
I know a nice part for you in Don Juan.
Really?
Which part?
Leporello.
Ah, the crook.
Forgive me, I didn't want to insult you.
But Miss Bach!
But you didn't insult me at all.
Because of that Leporello?
No, it's a beautiful part, but ...
he's a mean character.
Oh well, you can't always play the hero, can you?
That's true.
May I say something?
Yes, please.
But you mustn't laugh!
Of course not.
Actually I'm very glad ... that you ran away from him.
Well... good evening.
Good evening, Miss Bach.
- Sleep well.
- Thank you.
- You live at no. 5!
- Yes.
That's charming.
What's the name of this street?
Sonnenstraße.
- I see, Sonnenstr. 5.
- Yes.
- Charming.
- Goodbye.
- Good night, Miss Bach.
- Goodbye.
Sonnenstr. 5.
# Sonnenstr. 5
# A chicken in my hat
Why on earth am I to stuff a chicken into my hat?
Well, she must have her reason.s
# The stick in the hand
# I don't seem to be her type
There's nothing one can do about that.
Now write down, Miss.
To Hermes Airplanes AG,
Berlin, Sonnenstr. 5.
Why Sonnenstr.?
Who says Sonnenstr.?
But you just said Sonnenstr. no. 5.
I said Sonnenstr.?
But Miss, it's Mauerstr., you know the address.
Dear Sirs,
Re. your demand... for deferring the payment of 7823 marks... we announce to you that our solicitor, at the district court...
Good morning!
Good morning!
Did you get district court?
... has filed a lawsuit.
Yours faithfully etc.
Miss!
Thank you, I'll see you later.
I'm here early, am I not?
Yes.
I didn't go to bed at all.
You don't say!
Well...
- And?
-What do you mean, "and"?
About yesterday?
Ah, yes...
With the girl... what's her name...
It was wonderful.
Really classy.
I wouldn't have thought that we could dig out such a treasure from our ramshackle hut.
The whole financing seems to be worthwhile all of a sudden.
You think so?
Tell me, where did you find that fantastic band?
They really get you into the right mood.
We danced, drank champagne...
That girl can sure hold her liquor.
Golly!
And then she got really temperamental, it was quite fantastic.
Fabulous.
I just drove her home.
Really incredible.
Say, can I have some Pyramidon?
Of course.
Miss Ottie, Pyramidon!
Well, and then ...
Send her a few flowers, with my card, the way we always do.
It's ... uh ...
Or ...
Perhaps I'll do it myself.
It'll be more tactful.
I mean, because it looks so ...
Thank you.
Well ... see you.
Well, I'll be blowed!
Well, I'll be blowed!
Good morning!
Good morning, Director!
How temperamental you're all getting.
I wish you'd be that temperamental during the performance.
Don't laugh, Miss!
Pull down your skirt.
And now allow me an "open" word, too, will you.
As you know, we're planning the premiere.
Offenbach's masterpiece.
Gather all your passion.
Yes, and your forces, too.
All right, your forces, too.
Gather all your forces,
- the forces ...
- Now it says pleasure.
Now it says pleasure, you see I was right.
And also the pain.
In a word, humanity's dignity... has been delivered into your hands.
And tomorrow he'll again give a little chorus girl a major part.
And that's why he'll get a credit again till next year.
Pretty, isn't it, those Tales of Hoffmann?
Why?
But that wasn't Tales of Hoffmann.
What was it?
What I've just sung?
Of course it was, the ... the ... the famous gondola thing, the...
# Beautiful night, night of love # and peaceful ...
I see, yes.
How come you know it so well?
But we're producing this at the Municipal Theatre at the moment.
And this is by the way the credit grant for our theatre.
200.000 marks.
Good God!
- Are the management's details correct?
- They are.
The theatre hasn't been renovated since its opening 70 years ago.
The fire department threatens with closure if nothing is done about it.
And I'm again the fool who pays up?
Let them burn down the whole ramshackle hut!
But you used to find it so rewarding.
What?
I mean, the financing of the theatre.
I see, the ... of course under the circumstances, quite rewarding.
Ladies and gentlemen, I've decided to give a part to Miss Bach.
The blonde with the skinny legs.
Ladies and gentlemen, I did this with a purpose.
And you don't have to cough about it, I know what I'm saying.
I did this with a purpose, in order to ... in order to ... uh ...
- To promote young talents.
- That's right, thank you.
To promote young talents.
- That's what he always used to do.
- He tried it with me, too.
We must pave the way for the hard-working!
Van Lingen, we know all about it, Director.
Drop your stupid remarks, Herr Zack!
Here you let us hear some big notes, but in the evening not a single one!
Besides, I cannot always show them those old war horses...
- ... who bring in the money, director.
- And fill the theatre.
Tell me, my dear Miss Riehl, my dear soprano, how are you?
How's the little daughter?
The little daughter is singing the first flower maiden in Bayreuth.
I heard the first flower maiden is going to have her second baby.
- What are you insinuating, Director?
- Nothing, nothing.
"Ancestress, grandmother, mother and child...", my congratulations.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
"... are gathered in a dusty chamber" [Uhland]
Tell me, what exactly do you want here?
But I'm singing Julietta, that's my part.
No way, I couldn't possibly do that to you!
You see, Julietta is at least 25 years old.
You'll play the mechanical doll, she's a minor!
Miss Bach!
Miss Bach!
Miss Bach, Miss Bach!
Where is Miss Bach?
Miss Bach!
Come here.
We want to get started.
Tell me, my dear Miss Bach, what is it exactly that you can do?
You have a very nice musical name, but you look as if you were not very competent.
However, it's one of Heaven's greatest gifts to hold such a dear child in one's arms.
Look at this.
"with the belt and the veil"
"the beautiful illusion is torn apart, my child" [Schiller]
But that wouldn't matter, you know what I mean.
Most importantly, sing well, don't be nervous, it'll all go well.
"A talent forms in silence, a character in the world's stream" [Goethe]
As you can see with me.
- Well, listen!
- Director, I'd like to ...
Yes, we'll take care of everything, one moment.
Repetiteur Kiefer, come.
Yes, Director, yes.
"Arion was the melodies' master".
[Schlegel]
Bring the piano front stage!
Give him a hand!
Careful!
A little bit more to the left, careful!
Halt, halt!
Well, get started!
"Sing to whom song is given!" [Uhland]
Antonia's song, please.
# She has fled, the sweet dove
What's the matter, ladies and gentlemen?
Do you have a cold?
then go and see the theatre doctor, right around the corner, but don't disturb in here.
Please go on.
Once more.
# She has fled, the sweet dove
# Ah cruel fate!
Memory sweet and tender!
# I still hear and see him on his knees, before me
# Ah God, I still hear and see him # on his knees, here before me
# She has fled, the sweet dove
# She has fled far from here!
# But his love is eternal and heartfelt, # and he remains true to me.
# Oh tender dove, I am yours only
# My whole heart belongs to you.
# yes, my heart is yours # yes, my heart is yours
# She has fled, the sweet dove
# She has fled far from here!
"And silence reigns in the circle like in the kingdom of the dead" [Mühler]
Tell me, my dear Miss, where was your last engagement?
In Glogau, Director.
- In Glogau.
- Yes.
You see, I noticed that at once.
By the way, don't be discouraged, I too started out in Glogau.
You're welcome.
My dear child, show me your legs.
Don't be shy, higher up, higher up, you don't have to be ashamed.
Very nice.
Do you know what?
You have an exceptional talent for courtesans.
- Have you studied Julietta?
- Yes, Director.
- Really?
Where did you sing her?
- In Glogau.
In Glogau too!
Everything in Glogau
What Glogau can accomplish, we can accomplish anytime.
You'll sing the Julietta with me.
Thank you, Director.
That'll be a hammy mess.
"Johanna leaves and hopefully she shall never return" [Schiller]
You know, Director, what you "can for me"?
- No.
- You can make me feel pity for you.
And that's the only thing you can expect from me.
Well, dear child, be courageous, work work work, tomorrow we'll have a rehearsal.
Through the night towards the light, or: no pain, no gain.
The night belongs to us.
As I said, rehearsal tomorrow, goodbye.
Goodbye, Director.
Miss!
the Brazilian is 15.000 marks behind with his payments.
I've known that for a while.
You might have mentioned it.
Herr Faber!
Frau Konsul and Miss daughter!
- Good day, dear Faber.
- Good day, Madame.
- How are you?
- Thank you.
Miss Ilse, how are you?
How's your tennis?
Tell me, why don't you come and see us anymore?
I'm so sorry, I miss you so much.
Frau Konsul, we have our general meeting in eight days.
- I see.
- What about last night?
Ilse!
You two rascals!
But Ilse!
Stand straight!
But it's the truth!
I'd like to speak with Otto about the party for the workers' children.
Can one talk to him today, or is he again ...
Daft?
No, Miss Ilse, I think he's in a splendid mood today.
Shall we go to him right now?
Shall we?
All right, come along, child.
He's such an old maid, the general manager.
Yes?
- Good day, Otto.
- Morning, Otto.
Good gracious!
Good day, Mama!
How are you?
But that's charming!
Good day, Ilse, my child what's the...
pardon, come here, sit down,
I'm thrilled that you're here, I haven't got a moment to spare.
Please come to the point, will you?
Little Otto, we need some money again.
Of course.
What for?
- For Ilse's childrens' party.
My God, leave me alone with your children's' party!
But they aren't my children, they're your children.
My children?
Our children, it's about our holiday camp.
Paper lanterns, garden decoration, costumes, toys, cakes, tombola.
I need at least 2.500.
2.000, that is ...
Who's answering the phone in here?
Van Lingen dockyards, general management.
We used to get a bit of chocolate and were sent out in the garden.
Hold on, the general manager is busy at a very important conference right now, but I'll see if he can speak to you, Director.
The Director of the Municipal Theatre, little Otto.
Don't call me "little Otto", that's driving me crazy.
Hallo, Director?
What's the matter?
What is it?
I have the great pleasure, Herr van Lingen, to tell you that Miss Floriane Bach has passed the audition quite brilliantly.
What?
That's charming for her.
Yes, sir.
I must thank you for this, that your artistic ear at once recognized this, how shall I put it, this extraordinary talent.
I'm overjoyed on your behalf.
She's so to speak a still water who was blooming in the dark
My good man!
And I just wanted to tell you, such a deep running violet
But I have other things on my mind, I'm really not that interested.
Herr van Lingen, the pleasure..
Calling me during my office hours!
Of course, the moor has done his duty...
Yes, thousand thanks.
Excuse me, Mama, perhaps you'll talk the matter over with Faber, he has time.
Right now I've my head full with other things, those Tales of Hoffmann...
# Do you hear the sweet melodies # from afar, a quiet sound, a quiet song,
# ah, the love song
# Do you hear the sweet melodies # from afar, the tender love song
No Miss Bach, again that wasn't good!
But I thought it fabulous.
Good evening, Miss Bach!
Good evening!
Excuse my sudden entry, but I still owe you a dinner because of last night.
I've brought everything.
Lobster from Helgoland, caviar,
Hamburg spring chicken, Roman salad, old Madeira, and to finish it all off: champagne.
Yes, but must one always eat?
But Miss Bach.
I haven't come here for the eating.
- But?
- You can guess.
I have ... in fact, I've come because ... uh ...
Because I like listening to music so much.
Well, what can we do about it?
Because I really don't have the time right now.
I absolutely must go on rehearsing, I'm singing the whole third act tomorrow, and the love duet is so difficult.
The love duet?
You see ...
I could help you out a bit.
Is that what you're thinking?
Do you know anything about singing?
No, not very much.
I know more about love.
Now stop it!
Sit down there like a good boy.
I've got to go on rehearsing, I've got to learn something, yes?
- You mean Miss Bach?
- Yes, yes, that's right, Miss Bach.
She lives in...
Sonnenstr. 5.
# Do you hear the sweet melodies # from afar, a quiet sound, a quiet song, ah, the love song
# Do you hear the sweet melodies # from afar, the tender love song
# the rays of love meekly illuminate you # they make you bloom anew
# they make you bloom anew # bloom anew...
# And the unruly lad broke # the little rose on the heath # the little rose defended herself and stung him # but no moaning and wailing could help her
# she had to suffer # little red rose
# little rose on the heath
Run along, boys!
Silence!
Who makes a noise now won't get anything!
Miss Ilse!
You've arranged that charmingly!
Don't you want to say a few words, too?
Of course, if you think so.
Excuse me.
My congratulations, really charming and beautiful.
Well, you rascals?
Yes, you all have ... uh
You've sung beautifully.
Yes.
Amuse yourselves, drink your coffee now.
Goodbye.
Now kids, let's attack those cakes, get going!
Miss Bach is still in the bathtub.
All that bathing, terrible!
Kapellmeister!
Yes, Miss Bach?
You can already start with the Barcarolle.
Very well, I'll start.
I'll be ready at once!
My chemise, please.
Thank you.
# Lovely night, oh night of love, quench our desire!
# sweet than the day ...
My stockings, please.
# the beautiful night of love
Now together!
# Time flees from our love, never to return
Keep the tempo, Miss Bach!
Once more from the moment where we start together, one bar earlier.
# Time flees from our love, never to return
Tell me, how do you manage to be so popular all at once, wherever you go?
What shall I say, Herr von Lingen?
That's the way it is.
That's the way it is.
I must be a pretty disgusting fellow, then, that not a single person likes me.
You're laughing, but you've just seen it yourself with the children.
They're all over your back, but when I come along, they stand to attention.
And it's always that way.
Always holding a general meeting.
Yes, a general meeting.
General meeting, it's not even a wonder.
If you don't have a person you can talk to, then you turn into something like that.
But this is again terribly exaggerated, Herr van Lingen.
I know a lot of people who like you very much and are very attached to you.
Now I'm curious.
For instance ... your mother.
- Oh well.
- And Ilse.
- Ilse.
And I too am not a piece of dirt.
No, you aren't.
You aren't a piece of dirt, of course you aren't.
You're really a nice guy, Faber, I can talk to you.
You know, ever since that night when the girl left me sitting there...
# To wander is the miller's delight
I don't know what to make of myself.
# To wander is the miller's delight
But I thought the affair was closed for good?
Not closed at all, on the contrary.
I told you terrible lies the next morning.
She left minutes after you did.
She told me I could stuff my spring chicken into my hat.
But I don't know, I ...
I've written to her twice.
She doesn't even answer.
But it's my fault of course, I behaved like a pig.
Where's the tenor?
Where's Zack?
He reported ill, Director, his voice is hoarse.
Hoarse?
That's nothing new.
We'll start without a tenor.
The tenor lies here, poured over you.
Go on, the barcarolle please.
# Lovely night, oh night of love, quench our desire!
# sweeter than the laughing day, the beautiful night of love
# Time flees from our love, never to return # far away from this cozy spot time flees
# Sweet zephyrs embrace us with their caresses!
# Sweet zephyrs have brought us your kisses!
# Sweet zephyrs have brought us your kisses!
Ach.
# Lovely night, oh night of love, quench our desire!
# sweeter than the laughing day, the beautiful night of love # sweeter than the laughing day, the beautiful night of love
# the beautiful night of love.
Ach.
- Well, my dear child...
- Excuse me, one moment, Director.
That's strange, for once I wanted to say something nice to the girl, and she has to ... has to ...
Make a phone call.
There's nobody here, come in.
Well?
How did I sing?
Wonderfully.
- I did?
- Fabulous!
It makes you feel all funny inside.
But you mustn't do this again, sitting in the audience.
It makes one miss a beat.
- There's no such danger with you, Flory.
- But there is!
Listen, this will be a really great premiere.
Toi, toi, toi.
Really!
Fabulous orchestra, and your voice... your voice... so beautiful.
It comes all silvery across the orchestra.
And it is so sweet.
You're a really great number.
Where's Venice?
Not dry yet.
Venice isn't dry yet?
You!
by tomorrow you'll deliver a Venice "with a wash"!
Good God!
What kind of a cat is that?
Cat?
That's the lion of St. Mark's.
If you want, he can even wag his tail.
Ede, show him.
You see, Flory, in fact, you owe everything to van Lingen.
Don't bother me with van Lingen, he's really an insolent fellow.
But Flory!
The man is just used to get everything he wants for his money.
He was brought up that way.
He lives that way.
After all, he's always won his case in the end.
And you must admit, he's a very decent and ...
Have you gone crazy!
Flory, listen to me.
Ever since that evening, the man has totally broken down.
He doesn't look after his affairs, snaps at everybody, quarrels with his old mother and his sister
So what!
And the most disagreeable thing is ...
I'm the only one he treats decently, whom he trusts.
I see.
You're his public relations man today.
Don't talk nonsense, Flory.
This is terribly embarrassing for me, I'm telling you.
He hasn't got a clue that we two ...
And it's none of his business!
You should have seen me standing before him today.
I felt so ... so shabby.
But you're crazy.
Flory, you know, he'll hear about it anyway one day, and before he learns it from someone else, I'd rather tell him myself.
Go on, tell him then, but let me just tell you one thing
I love you, and I love my work, and I don't care about Herr van Lingen and all that nonsense.
But Flory, be reasonable!
I'm a woman, and I'm not reasonable!
Silly.
Madame, so delighted that you've come.
Allow me to introduce...
Kapellmeister, our guest from Berlin.
A chair, a chair!
Can I do something for you?
Are you tired?
Yes, I'm a bit tired.
perhaps I shall just "mark".
[not sing with full voice]
Mark it, my dear, do anything you like,
I'm the last servant of this house.
May I have this?
Do remain seated.
# Phoebus proudly in the sun chariot # the nightingale in the green woods
# all the young girls talk # all the young girls talk # of love
# they speak of love, ach
# yes, those are the song's laments # and thus Olympia too shall sing
# yes, those are the song's laments # and thus Olympia too shall sing
There's a gentleman here, he's been waiting for half an hour.
- Herr Faber?
- No, it's not him.
- Who is it?
- I don't know.
Forgive me for intruding here like this.
What is it you wish?
I behaved like an ass the other night.
You can say that aloud.
I'm very sorry about it.
Is that so?
Really.
I'm really terribly sorry.
I myself thought it quite bad of me.
I don't bear you any ill will.
- So you accept my apologies?
- Yes.
And now we're really reconciled, are we?
Yes.
Shake hands?
Wonderful.
Won't you like to sit down?
I'd love to.
- Please.
- Thank you.
Well ... do you enjoy your new work?
Oh yes, I enjoy it very much.
It's supposed to be something wonderful.
The Director and everybody who heard you are delighted.
Is that so?
Yes. it must be a wonderful feeling for you to be acknowledged so suddenly.
Oh yes.
Well, actually I've come for a second reason, too.
I'd like to see you again very much.
No, Herr van Lingen.
You can't see me again.
Not even if I tell you that it means incredibly much to me?
Not even then.
I don't understand this.
You wouldn't get much pleasure from it, anyway.
I have a lot of work these days and must concentrate entirely on my part.
I don't believe you, no, no, I don't believe you, not at all.
The theatre and all that may be quite important, and a such part is a lot of excitement, but...
I don't know, a woman like you can't be satisfied by that.
There must be something else.
There's some man behind it, isn't it?
Excuse me now, Herr van Lingen.
My musical coach will be here any minute and I still have some work to do.
- I've hurt you again, didn't I?
- Adieu, Herr van Lingen.
- So we won't meet again?
- Adieu.
- Good evening, Frau Pohl.
- Good evening, Conductor.
Good evening, Herr Faber.
Won't you like to join us again?
What?
But it isn't Herr Faber.
Oh, I'm sorry, Herr Faber.
I thought you were Herr Faber.
I see.
The way one makes a mistake.
The way one makes a mistake!
Well.
The scene must have been very funny for you, my coming here and apologizing.
I guess the two of you have been laughing a lot behind my back, lately, you and ... my friend Faber, haven't you?
What a disgusting guy.
A terrible person.
Now we'll do the Mirakel scene from the third act.
# You won't sing anymore
# Do you realize what that means at your young age, # to make such a sacrifice?
Good morning, Herr van Lingen!
Sound the beginning of the hunt!
Hallo!
What is it?
Herr Faber, please.
He isn't in.
Then Herr van Lingen, please.
He isn't in either?
Where are the gentlemen?
Hunting.
Van Lingen!
Hallo!
Anything wrong with you?
Go to the devil, you!
What's the matter?
I told you yesterday that I don't have any friends.
I really don't have any.
And you don't seem to deserve them,
Herr van Lingen!
Miss!
Miss!
- Good evening Herr Faber, yes, please?
- Good evening.
Listen carefully.
Before you go home, call a meeting tomorrow, 11 o'clock.
Ask the the heads of the departments, the gentlemen of the bank and of the legal department
I ask the gentlemen to be on time, because I'll be leaving for a longer holiday.
You're travelling?
Yes.
Do you mind?
No.
Excuse me, Herr Faber.
Friedrich, I don't know yet who'll take my place during my absence.
There are a few small matters to take care of.
Here's the list of everything you'll have to do.
Yes, sir.
Don't forget, every day at 12 o'clock ... flowers for the Frau Konsul with a card from Herr van Lingen.
Yes, sir.
Has Herr van Lingen been here?
Yes, for a moment.
He opened a few letters, and left.
Thank you, that's all.
- Goodbye, Herr Faber.
- Goodbye.
Good evening.
To Herr Richard Faber - personally
Municipal theatre row 2, seat 6
- Wednesday 3 Sept. 1930
# No sweet [süße] wooing can conquer my heart
My dear friend, do me the favour and don't sing "sieße", sing "süße".
But Director, I'm singing "sieße".
The right spotlight flickered, the left one didn't look good either.
But we gave everything the machine can give, Director.
Very well, but what's going to happen today?
It'll be like this, Director, you can count on it, like this.
All right, I'll count on it.
I'll show you my gratitude too, you know me, don't you?
You know, there must be light ... when Friedland's stars shine.
[Schiller]
But we can't give more than we have, Director.
Neither can I.
By the way, it is:
"there must be night".
- Miss Bach, it's high time.
- Yes, yes.
Say, how far are they?
The second act starts at once.
Golly!
Bächlein!
[Little brook]
I've reserved two first-class seats for Herr Faber and for Herr van Lingen.
- Next to each other?
- Of course next to each other.
Don't be nervous, sing beautifully, sing resonantly, sing reasonably.
Toi toi toi toi.
Just remain calm, calm, calm.
That's right.
- Stage manager?
- Yes, Director?
- Is the audience in?
- Yes, Director.
Lights out in the audience!
Full lights on the stage!
Take it slow, man, don't load it all at once.
But I have to, man.
The old man said, tonight it should shine like at Friedländer's.
Sit down, there!
Sit down!
Sit down!
Kids, silence!
Toi toi toi!
What's the matter with the transformator?
It's boiling like mad.
No wonder, you've loaded everything.
But the old man wanted it that way.
What shall we do?
Switch the crap.
Yes, you're right.
Iron curtain!
Floriane!
Floriane!
Sprinkler!
Floriane!
Have you gone mad?
Let go of me!
Floriane!
Floriane!
What is it?
What's wrong with you?
You're taking a shower here, while we're burning our fingers because of you!
Floriane!
My God!
Is nobody going to help me?
Hallo!
Hallo!
Yes, I'm coming!
Floriane!
Floriane!
Take her!
Out of the frying pan into the fire!
- Otto!
- Don't talk nonsense, man!
Floriane!
Floriane!
Yes, yes, Herr van Lingen.
With fate's powers no eternal alliance is possible. [Schiller]
It's all very well for you to talk, old friend.
I've lost in the business my monocle.
And I my voice.

- Floriane Bach
What is it?
And Lingen?
He sends you his love.
really?
Well, lobster, caviar
Hamburg spring chicken with Roman salad, old Madeira, champagne. which brand?
Château Parc Clément Pessac.
1922, all right.
What about the gypsies?
They're playing next door.
Shall I lay a third place setting?
No thank you, I'm not staying.
After all, they couldn't ask that of me.

All right.

Hey, Sandy, Put on a straight line, will ya.
Come on, Alec, get off that lard.
What do you think this is?
Cover your exit, will ya?
Come on Alec, get those hatches off.
Come on, let's get to moving.
That's a mighty haul of fish, Captain.
Yeah, the tuna are running outside.
We're ready.
Let it go.
- Hello, Alec.
- Hello, Min.
Hello.
- Hello, sweetie.
- Hello, Min.
- How's everything?
- Fine.
Had a great trip.
- That's fine.
Where's Bill?
- He's over here.
Hello, Bill.
- Hello, Min, how are you?
- Right in the pink.
- Say, Min.
- What?
- I got a surprise for you.
- What is it?
- 6 bottles of vodka.
- Vodka?
You've drunken vodka?
I've drunk everything from bug juice to rotgut.
I got it off a fellow outside the 12 mile limit.
- Ivan Novich.
You know him.
- Oh the Russian.
Yeah.
How much is it gonna set me back?
$10 for the 6 bottles.
- TEN BUCKS?
- Yes.
I'd kill a Russian for ten bucks.
Ten bucks, why?
Why don't you go 50/50?
You'll swill most of it down.
Now ain't that gratitude?
After me boarding with you for years and paying my rent every week.
Well, you ain't sore, are you, Bill?
Yeah.
Well no, I'm not so sore now.
You go up to the hotel.
I'll be up in a minute and we'll crack one of those bottles.
- You old hooliver.
- I'll be right up.
Brush up on your minute tour gulf.
Come on, let's get these fish off of here.
What do you think this is, a holiday, Alec?
- Come on, gang, I'll see you later.
- Okay, Min.
- Hey, where's Nancy?
- She's upstairs.
Weird.
- Hey, Nancy?
- I'm coming.
Why do you always hang around upstairs for?
They're fumigating the bed.
Fumigating the bed again.
Min, a couple things.
That cop was here again.
You can go belly-aching around after all I done for you?
Honestly, I didn't see.
I told them you've always been good to me.
Yeah, now cut out the applesauce.
Just what did you say?
Well, I told them that my mother I left me here when I was a baby.
And that you'd brought me up.
And I helped you with the work.
- That you've always been good to me.
- Oh that's all right.
Did they say anything about taking you away from me?
Yes, he did.
Well?
What did you say?
I said I couldn't stand to be taken away from you.
You ain't lying?
Honest, Min, I ain't.
I swear it.
Yes.
Oh well, go on.
Take that fish in the kitchen.
Hey!
He didn't say nothing about coming back, did he?
I said he didn't say nothing about coming back.
Oh no.
No.
All right, get out of here.
Go on, go on.
Well, Nancy.
Ain't you gonna say hello to me?
What for, Alec?
Any mail for me?
Not a chance.
That blonde forgot about you long ago.
Maybe I could do with a brunette for a change..
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.
Did you miss me?
Who are you kidding?
- Nobody.
- Oh yeah?
Come on, Nancy, don't be stingy.
Let me go.
I've got work to do.
What was he saying to you?
Oh.
He was only kidding.
Alec's like that.
Aw, he didn't mean nothing.
Sticking up for him, huh?
I want to tell you something.
Any time he comes here and he says to you...
Hey Min!
Come on out here.
I'm wait for a shave.
Go on.
Finish your work.
Come on, Min.
Will ya?
Come on, quit your poking around.
I want to get a shave.
Get out here.
Oh yes.
What's eating on you?
Fleas.
Besides that?
Well...
Alec's been making eyes at Nancy.
The way you worry about her, you'd think she's your own kid.
Sometimes I wish she was.
Don't go feeling sorry for yourself.
So you give me a pain in the neck.
Yeah, you ain't so hot yourself.
When I was young, I used to make them sizzle.
Back in the Civil War days, they were not so particular.
What's that about the Civil War days?
Aw, Min!
Did you ever hear the story about the old Civil War veteran?
Yes.
Now pike pike now when I was a kid.
You get out of here!
All ears.
- Say, uh-
- I don't want to hear it now.
Hey handsome, how are you?
Well, how are you?
I'm fine.
Hey, there.
What are you doing up there?
Cut that out!
You don't you watch what you're doing?
Aw, gee, I didn't do it on purpose.
Oh no.
Of course not.
Hey, you ain't so special.
I oughta give you my bucket too.
Yeah, you do and you'll be sorry.
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah!
Any more gab out of you and I'll have a go.
Hey, what's the matter?
What's the problem?
What's wrong?
- He's a liar.
- Who's a liar?
Why?
I just dumped some trash overboard and he said I did it on purpose.
You can't call her no liar.
I won't let you.
She just threw a bucket at me.
I did not.
If you don't like it around here, you get out!
See?
I'm running a decent joint.
I don't go for you boys chasing around here at all.
Get out of here!
Now go.
Min, what's the matter?
He calls her a liar.
He insults me.
I want him off the place.
Calm down.
Listen.
That's old man Cameron's son.
He runs the cannery over there where I work.
I don't give an abalone if he runs the jail.
And he can't park his putt putt under my pylons either.
- Hey, where are you going now?
- None of your business.
Paying my taxes around here.
I ain't gonna have nobody tell me what I'm going to do.
Don't touch that water.
You'll get in trouble!
I pay my taxes.
What are you doing in that boat?
I'll gonna get this bucket.
Get the bucket and come on out!
Come out right now.
I don't want anybody hanging around-
Hey, stop it.
Stop that motor.
Help!
Stop!
Bill!
Bill!
Help!
Bill!
Bill!
You're trying to kill me.
Rats!
I'm dead.
Hey, give us more speed!
Help!
Help!
- Hello, Min.
- Hello, Bill.
How are you feeling now?
Feeling?
I ain't got no feeling.
I'm numb all over.
My neck is broke.
- Your neck?
- Yeah, my neck.
- Let me get my big paws on it.
- Wait a minute.
- I won't hurt you, Min.
- Well be careful.
I'll be careful.
You just hold still.
Let me get a hold of you.
Is that all right now?
Ow, you got your big thing in my spherix!
That's all right?
How is your spine?
My spine.
It's never been better in this life.
- Oh Bill, wait a minute.
- I'm waiting now.
Come on, I'm fine.
- I'm fine, Bill.
- Fix it all right?
Yeah, you'll fix it.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Cut the cards and I'll tell your fortune.
I'm fixed all right.
I had a dream last night.
About me, Min?
No, about a canary flying in the window.
- Oh you did.
- Yes I did.
Look it there.
See all them spades.
I tell you there's nothing but trouble around here.
- Hey Min!
- What is it?
The cops!
The cops?
What do they want?
- They are for me.
- For you?
They'll get your over my dead body.
Min, pull in your horns.
Cops is cops.
Cops or no cops, they're not gonna take the kid away from me.
Bill, I'm scared.
Come out with me.
What do you want?
Groot's my name.
I'm a truant officer.
How long have you had this girl?
Ever since she was six months old.
Where did you get her?
Her mother left her here.
Where is her mother now?
How do I know?
She kicked the bucket.
Reports come in this girl is terribly overworked.
She don't work any harder than anyone else.
That's the gospel truth I don't.
The cook gets up at 4 o'clock.
But I don't get up until 5.
I suppose you finish your work about 9 o'clock at night.
Sure I do.
Sometimes 8:30.
Oh.
Of course.
Or course.
Well, that's why you don't go to school.
I won't go back to school.
I hate those stuck-up kids.
They give me a pain in the neck.
You've been kept from school.
Come on, tell me the truth!
Don't be afraid!
You think I'd tell a lie to a cop?
Shut up and answer this guy as if he was a gentleman.
Yes, ma'am.
A young girl like you needs schooling.
A nicer environment.
Discipline.
You can't get that here.
I do too.
I don't walk a chalk line.
Min wears the life out of me.
Don't you, Min?
That's discipline, ain't it?
It certainly is.
Another complaint is that you've been a party to the selling of liquor.
- You mean booze?
- Yeah.
You think we'd give that bootleg stuff to the gang?
Why we wouldn't give that to Bill!
You've seen it around, haven't you?
Sometimes.
When some of the fellas brings him a flask.
Then he breaks it over his head.
That's just how sore it makes him.
Say, you're not going to take this kid away from me?
I think as much of her as if she was my own kid.
I... who are you?
Perhaps you remember me?
I'm superintendent of Nancy's school.
We were very much interested in her when she attended.
I thought now that she's going back.
You might let her come to our home.
Mrs. Southard will be very kind to her.
Can help a little in the household.
It will be a nice quiet environment in which to study.
I don't want to go.
Now you shut up now.
No, she ain't going.
She's gonna stay right here with me.
Get that?
Right re with me!
Of course, she can go to school though.
I don't mind if she goes to school.
Now you see that she's in school tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.
And if I have more complaints about this place,
I'll see that it's closed up!
Yes, yes.
Gee that was a tight squeeze.
I'm gonna wet my whistle.
That was a swell lie I told about the booze, wasn't it?
It sure was.
I couldn't have done much better myself.
Min, they can't take me from you.
I would just die.
Aw, cut the bull now.
Go on out in the kitchen where you belong.
Go on.
Get out of here.
What does it read?
- 32.65.
- All right.
Hand it over.
Nancy, how about a dance?
Swell.
Yeah, I'll take that too.
Hey!
You get out in the kitchen where you belong!
Go on, get out of here.
Go on!
And Alec Johnson!
You watch your step!
Ohh!
You come out here and I'll sock you in the jaw, Min.
Is that so?
Come on in here.
I'd like to see you try it.
You're a sneak.
A sneaking thief.
That's what you are.
Gee Min, but you're a hellion.
Yeah.
I guess that's why I like you.
Is that so?
A bum.
That's how you are.
So that's where you keep your socks.
You know it ain't safe.
Some dirty skunk might peek through the keyhole some night.
Is that so?
Well, if he does,
I'm ready for him.
You trust me, don't you?
Sure I trust you.
You're too dumb to be anything but honest.
That's the same way I feel about you, Min, too.
Gee, it's hot in here.
Open up a window or something.
No Bill, nobody's gonna get my hard-earned dough from me.
I've been over 40 years saving up them dimes and nickels.
When I get enough, I'm going back to Seattle, where I come from.
And I'm gonna buy myself a sealskin cap.
Mm-hm.
Yes and a new bridge with three gold teeth in them.
- Min!
- What?
There's Alec with his arm around some gal.
- It ain't Nanc is it?
- I think he is.
Don't whistle.
Wait a minute.
Gee, it's swell out here.
You know, I love this old boat.
I used to come here when I was a kid.
I dreamed about going places.
You'll be going places before long.
And you won't be alone either.
Who's gonna take me, you?
You said it.
We'll sneak away, me and you.
And we'll go up to Frisco.
Yeah?
Fat chance I've got of getting anywhere.
Hey you know Nancy, you're a lot prettier out here.
That's gotta stop.
You won't have to work anymore if you come with me.
I know a way you can make a lot of money.
Let me go.
You smell like hot steam.
Well?
What's the idea?
You get in the house!
Go on!
Get!
Bill.
Calm him down.
What's the idea?
Ain't Min asked you a dozen times to let that kid alone?
Gee Min, I didn't do nothing.
Go on.
Get up there.
Go on.
I saw you fooling with Alec?
Oh I didn't do nothing, Min.
I washed dishes and cooked stuff all day long.
Well, I'm crabbing about that.
Girls got to have some fun.
You call that fun?
- He didn't mean nothing by it.
- Hmm.
That's what you think.
I don't see why it ain't right for me to dance and flirt and have a good time like the rest of the girls who come here.
- You don't?
- You don't try to stop them.
You tell them "Go out and dance and have a good time in your joint."
But me.
Well you ain't gonna have a say over me much longer.
I'll be old enough to put makeup on and dance and drink with the gang if I want to.
- Then I'll show you.
- Yeah.
You'll be showing me.
That teacher and the cop was right.
This is no place for a kid like you.
What are you doing?
You're not going to send me away, are you?
You're gonna live with the school teacher.
Don't do it, Min.
I don't want to leave you.
- Now you stop...
- I'm sorry I made you sore.
Stop squawking now.
And go and pack your duds.
I'll be a good kid, I swear it.
Please don't send me away.
No.
I want to stay here with you.
I'm sending you away because I don't want you to make me no trouble.
I don't care nothing about you.
Just me.
Go on now.
You ain't got no time to use.
Now we ain't got no time to lose.
Go on.
- Don't send me away.
- Now you listen to me.
No.
You may think she's no common kid.
Oh no.
Yeah, her father was a doctor in the Northwest someplace.
And her mother brought her on here when he died.
When she drifted in here, she was dying when she come to this place.
Well, that's all there is.
You see she ain't legally mine.
So there won't be no papers to sign or nothing.
But I'm just like your own kid.
You can't send me away.
Why this is a swell joint.
Gee if you can't be happy here, you're dumber than I thought you was.
Well, that's all there is to tell.
I guess I'll beat it.
Min!
Min!
Please!
Go on away.
I got my work to do.
Min, please!
Hello, Nancy, how are you?
Fine, how are you, Captain?
Fine.
Can I fish?
Sure.
Help yourself.
Gee, that's great.
So you got homesick for us, did you?
You're darn right, I did.
That's why I'm back.
Up easy.
Did Min say so?
I don't know.
I stopped in to see her.
They said she was at the grocery.
But she'll let me stay when I explain.
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.
That's a great fish, Nancy.
Aw, gee!
How did I do that?
Oh, up to your old tricks again?
Here's your cap.
What you need is a darn good spanking.
Is that the way you treat a lady?
You're no gentleman!
You big abalone.
What's the matter with you?
Come on in here!
What's the matter with you?
Say.
Say.
What are you doing here?
Did you see what he did to me?
Yes, I did.
And that's what I ought to be doing to you.
What are you doing back here, playing hooky?
I can't stand it any longer, Min.
I come back for good.
You think you come back for good.
You're gonna get right out of here and go right back to school.
I can't go back, Min.
- You can't?
- No I-I-
What have you done?
- Uh...
- Well.
- I hit a girl in the eye.
- Well?
She called me wharf rat.
Why didn't you give her-
That's exactly what I did.
That isn't here or there.
You just go back to Southards where you belong.
Now go on!
Get out of here.
Oh Min, I can't stand it at the Southards any longer.
The evenings are so quiet.
Gee, they don't ever have a fight.
Don't get sore.
It's just like a jail up there.
Well... that's just what you're aiming to do.
Send me to jail.
What do you mean?
I mean just what I say.
If the cops don't find you're not at school, they'll take my license away.
You're just an ungrateful little brat.
That's what you are.
Trying to ruin my business.
Go on back to Southards where you belong.
Go on, on, on.
Go on now.
Oh but let me explain.
I'll explain.
Will you get out of here?
Go on now.
Please.
Give me just one more chance!
I'll give you a chance.
Get out of here.
Go on now!
And I never want to see you here again!
Yeah.
He did?
That's funny.
Hello Min.
Hello, Min.
Hello, Bella Pringle.
What are you doing here?
You know what I'm doing here.
Come on upstairs to my room.
Wait a minute.
How long you been here?
About an hour.
Belle's my old friend of mine from Seattle.
About 14 years since we've seen each other.
Let's drink to old times.
You said it.
How long you gonna be here?
Oh I don't know.
Say.
I thought maybe I'd look over the place.
And get the lay of the land.
Yeah.
Stick around a bit.
Oh get you.
I don't mind, Bill.
Ain't nothing doing around here.
- Naw?
- No.
There's a boat going to Frisco this afternoon.
Yeah?
Who says I was leaving here this afternoon?
Come on, Bill.
Come on.
Show us the bottom of the bottle.
You're like a sieve, ain't you?
Belle, come on upstairs to my room.
Wait a minute.
Will ya?
Wait a minute.
Here's to ya, big boy.
You ain't so bad.
I've seen worse.
Yeah, I've been told that before.
Hey Belle, I've got something to tell you.
Come on upstairs.
Come on.
Pardon me.
What are you doing here?
You know what I'm doing here.
- Where's my kid?
- She's dead.
- You're a liar!
- Who's a liar?
You're a liar.
She died in Fresno five or six years ago.
What she die of?
You know she was a puny kid.
That's right.
- Tough luck for me, ain't it, Min?
- Yeah.
I thought that kid would take care of me in my old age.
It's too bad.
Come on Bella, take off your duds and rest a bit.
You look all in.
- I'm a wreck.
- Yeah.
Ain't it just like a kid?
The more you do for them, the more ungrateful they are.
I know.
There ain't no gratitude in the world.
There ain't nothing.
No there ain't.
That's right.
- Nothing, I'm telling you.
- All right, Belle.
You just rest there a while.
You'll be all right now.
- Min?
- What?
Just one more little drink.
You'll find them in the bureau drawer there.
The last-
I'll be back in a minute.
Hi, baby.
Hello, big boy.
Come on in.
How's chances for a little snort?
I won't be difficult.
Come on.
Sit down.
Make yourself at home.
Here you are, kid.
Ma'll kill you for it.
What's the little thing, boy.
Why don't you turn on something snappy?
That's the way I always feel when I see a swell-looking guy like you.
You mean that?
And how!
Wait, I'll turn on the phonograph.
Make it snappy, baby.
- Oh how do you do?
- How do you do?
I come to see Nancy.
- Won't you sit down?
- No.
I can say what I got to say standing on my feet as well as I can sit-
Min!
You've came for me!
Come for you?
Nothing.
Oh.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
We're so grateful to you for sending Nancy home.
We think she'll be much happier here as time goes on.
Yeah I hope you're right.
- Min, I...
- Will you shut up?
Say, her mother left some money for her with me.
And I got it here and it's a big wad too.
- Really?
- Yes, it's real.
I had intended to keep it myself.
But every once in a while, my conscience goes crazy.
And I have to do the right thing.
Well anyhow... when she was dying, she says to me "Min..."
"when my Nancy grows up to be a girl,
I want you to see that she goes to a young lady's school."
My mother said that?
Will you stop horning in?
When you gonna send her?
Now speak up quick before you get the dough.
I know a very fine school up north.
The Westmoreland School.
A friend of mine is head of it.
That's the ticket.
Here.
You see that see goes quick too.
Because she's never gonna get nothing hanging around here.
Not that I give a hoop.
Min, you've been so kind to me.
Aw.
Can the baloney, will ya?
- Won't you say goodbye?
- Goodbye.
And you see that behave yourself the next joint you go to.
You come on out here.
I want to see you.
I just want to tell you.
Get that kid out of here before 24 hours or I'll take her back.
- But why?
- Never mind why.
You just do it.
All right.
Why you dirty...
What kind of a drunk?
Get out of here!
Hey Bill, wait!
I'll get you for that!
I'll get you someday!
Bill, she's trying to kill me!
Bill, help me.
Min's trying to kill me!
You filthy old wretch you.
You dirty old rotten louse!
Well.
That's what I'll give you.
I'll get you!
You come back!
You ain't mad at me, Min, are you?
No,
I ain't mad at you.
We just had a couple snifters.
And I got to feeling kind of wild.
Can't you take a joke?
You stupid dummkopf!
Don't you talk to me.
Stop your fooling, will you, Min!
Oh now, Min!
Now, now, ho, Min.
No, Min.
No, Min!
There goes my mother's picture!
Will you stop that?
Min, will you stop that!
Stop it, Min.
Stop what?
Come here.
Come here!
Min, you're pulling my pants off.
Now stop that!
Stop this, Min.
Get this thing out of my eye, will you?
Get your hands out of my-
Don't call me a dummy.
Stop that!
I'm warning you.
Stop it, will ya?
Cut it out!
Cheat with me, will ya?
Hey, Min!
Dog gone you anyway!
Will you come here?
Come here.
Come here, you prick.
Come here, you.
Come on out here!
Come on out here and finish this!
Go on away from here, Min.
And let me alone, will ya?
!
What you so quiet for, Min?
You give up?
Give up?
Give up nothing.
You come out!
Aw, stop that, dear.
Stop that, will ya?
Stop it.
Come out here and take your licks like a man.
- Come on now!
- Stop it!
Give me that thing, will ya?
Give me that ax.
Give me the ax before you hurt yourself, Min!
- Give me!
- Give me that.
You'll be sorry!
Dog gone you anyway.
I don't bite my arm!
Stop!
Now stop that, Min!
Min now mad.
Bill, you ain't hurt?
Be ya?
Are you hurt, Bill?
Oh, gee.
You made me so sore.
Bill!
Dear Min,
I'll be home soon.
And I do hope you changed your mind about seeing me.
Last Christmas they told me you had gone away.
And the day I was leaving, I saw you on the wharf.
Bill, she seen me on the wharf.
You couldn't hide that face of yours with a beard.
It'd break my heart if I thought I'd done anything to hurt your feelings.
After all your kindness to me.
Do you realize it's over two years since we've seen each other?
I'm so grown up, you wouldn't know me.
Bill, she's grown up.
Sure, she is.
Why not?
Do remember Dick Cameron?
I'll tell you a secret.
We're coming home on the same boat.
Oh Min, he's wonderful.
I'll tell you all about him if you'll only see me.
- Say hello to Bill for me.
- Hello.
We're coming on the HS Alexandria.
With love and kisses, Nancy.
Bill, when does the Alexandria get in?
It docks in the morning.
The morning.
Oh don't go blubbering around.
Too windy?
Let's get married as soon as we get home.
Dick, I'd love to have Min come to the wedding.
Of course we'll ask her.
But I think she'll won't come.
I do.
If I beg her to.
She doesn't care for you very much, does she?
Oh yes she does.
Then why doesn't she want to see you?
I don't know.
But I'll see her tomorrow.
And I know she'll be happy when I tell her...
What's the excitement?
I'm sorry but gentlemen are not allowed in the ladies' cabins.
Oh.
That's a lie.
There is no gentleman in my stateroom.
Besides, he ain't no gentleman.
Oh, it's snooty time.
We're not good for you.
You remember Dick.
Yes, I'm happy to see you.
How do you do?
Where's my grip?
My valise.
- Hello Bella.
- Hello, old rigamathing.
What are you doing here?
I just thought I'd look the old place over.
Are you coming down to the joint?
No.
Not a chance.
Aw, come on.
Let bygones be bygones.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Min pays.
A nice kid came in this morning.
- She did?
- Sure, come on.
Come on, Bella.
You go right upstairs.
Hey Min.
You ain't gonna give me another sendoff like you done a couple years ago.
Oh no.
Everything's all right now, Bella.
Where is that big bozo?
I don't know where he goes.
Hey, you.
Come on back!
We're all friends again.
Yeah, we're all washed up, Bill.
All right.
Hey, listen you.
You never saw me before in all your life.
I don't even know you.
Hi, you big hippo.
As far as I'm concerned, you just stink.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Aw, Min.
You can't guess who I just saw down at the dock.
She had clean ears and...
What are you laughing, you hyena?
Was I laughing?
Maybe I was thinking about something funny.
Okay, Min.
Hey, Min?
Hey, what?
Where is that hair tonic?
You drank it.
Oh, so I did.
Min, come here a minute.
Aw, what do you want?
The back of my hair needs touching up a bit.
What it needs is a couple of fine tooth combs.
If you find any gray hairs, pull them out.
- Yeah.
- Oww!
If I pulled them all out, you'd be bald as an egg.
A bad egg.
That's me all right.
What's the matter, got the dropsy?
Oh say, Bella.
I got fine tonic down in the barbershop.
I'll bring it right up.
You wait here.
Don't you think you'd better see her alone?
Maybe I had.
I won't be long.
Min, darling.
What are you doing here?
Didn't you get my letter?
Yeah I got your letter.
What of it?
Well, I wanted to tell you about...
If you want to tell me anything, you come on in the barbershop.
Go on.
Well...
Shoot.
Get it off your chest.
Min, I'm going to be married.
To Dick Cameron.
And we want you to come and live with us.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Listen, Min.
We're going to live in Boston.
- In Boston?
- Yes.
He's going to have part of his father's cannerys.
- Oh Min.
- Yeah.
We're going to have a sweet home.
With green terraces and gardens.
And a beautiful orchid room for you.
With windows that look right out on the sea.
And I'd be at home in a trellis in an orchid room.
Dick's going to give you a limousine for a wedding present.
What is lemonzine?
One of those lovely motor cars.
Oh, automobile.
Think of it.
Can't you see us?
You and me... staying in a home with our noses in the air.
Oh it's just like a dream.
A dream...
Say.
Now I want you to get this right under your bonnet.
I ain't gonna never leave this joint.
And I ain't never gonna live on charity.
Oh, Min.
I didn't mean it that way.
You misunderstood me.
Well, understand this then.
You go live your life and please let me live mine!
Charity!
But Min, Dick wants you.
Yeah?
Now you go!
Get out of here!
Ohh.
So it's the snooty girl that I met on the boat, huh?
How do you do, dearie?
Min, you were so long getting that hair tonic
I thought for goodness you were drinking it.
Say, Bella, what do you say you and me open a real bottle just for the sake of old times?
Baby, you're an elk.
That's right.
What's the matter, Nancy?
She never wants to see me again.
What happened?
I tried to tell her what we wanted to do for her.
Oh, Dick!
She just doesn't care anymore.
That's all right, honey.
I do.
We'll forget all about her.
Going down the coast, Bill?
Yeah, going down off Mexico.
The tuna's running down off Magdalena.
How soon you shoving off?
About a half hour.
Gee ain't she a pip?
Yeah.
That's Cameron's boat.
Young Cameron is gonna get married today.
They're going east in it.
Yes, Min was telling me.
She sure is a beaut.
Now cut them three times towards you.
- All right.
- That's it.
Keep your shirt on.
Yeah.
Little nervous today, ain't you?
Oh there you go.
Bellla?
- Yes?
- King of diamonds!
- You're gonna meet a rich guy.
- Ha!
Gee, Min.
You're a pain in the eye to me.
That's over.
Yes, sir, it is.
- Say, Bella.
- Yes?
Come on back here.
You're gonna wear diamonds.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
- Mm-hm.
Say, Min.
Where's a curling iron?
What for?
What do you suppose what for?
To pick my teeth with?
I want to crimp my hair up.
In the top drawer of the bureau there on this side.
All right.
Thinking of taking the afternoon boat to Frisco?
I don't know.
Go on, talk.
I ain't deaf.
I can hear you from here.
Whoa, you're gonna ride in a big car.
Oh a hoist?
Oh no, a swell car.
Yours.
- Mine?
- Mm-hmm.
Gee I tell you when you get this guy, you're gonna be sitting pretty.
- When I get him?
- Yes, it's all here in the cards.
Frisco is the place.
I tell ya.
Yeah, that's a swell line, Min.
But I ain't thinking of getting out of here.
- No?
- No.
- Ain't you?
- No, I ain't.
I kinda like this joint.
I think I'll stick around a while.
Well, I think you're foolish.
It's all here in the cards.
You think so, Min?
Gee, that must be the whistle from the yacht, huh?
That's a fishing boat.
No, it ain't, Min.
I seen it this morning from the porch.
Alex pointed it out to me.
It belongs to the Camerons.
I hear that Cameron guy, that young fella is gonna get married this morning to a girl by the name of Smith.
Oh.
- Ever hear of her?
- Sure.
There's a million Smiths around here.
They say she used to hang around the waterfront.
I have never seen her.
That's a lie, Min!
And you know it.
That's my kid.
What are you talking about, Bella Pringle.
You're crazy.
I ain't so crazy.
You can't make a fool of me no longer, you dirty lying rat!
I don't know what your game is.
But you can't make a sucker out of me no longer.
Now Bella!
You can throw me out of your dirty old joint.
Now I'm gonna get even with you, Min.
For everything you ever done to me.
See?
Bella I...
I
- I don't know what you mean.
What do I mean?
I'll show you what I mean!
I'll nail you on a cross.
You can you dirty little stuck-up brat.
Bella!
I'll teach ya.
You don't know what you're saying.
Oh I don't, huh?
The game is over, darling.
Yes, Bella.
At the end of a long journey.
You're darn right they'll be diamonds around me.
And I'll see that I get them too.
And that she'll give them to me.
Or I'll know the reason why.
Hey.
The dirty little snob.
Turning up her nose against me as if I'm not good enough for her.
You wouldn't hurt the kid.
Aw, say, please now...
Leave me alone, will ya?
A fat chance!
She's a swell kid.
The first break she's ever had.
Break?
I'll give her a break for hiking out on me.
- It wasn't her fault.
- Ha!
She never even knowed she had a mother.
I suppose you told her that the stork brought her.
Well, I told her you was dead.
That's where you're out of luck, you filthy old liar.
I'm gonna show you up.
Both of you.
You wouldn't do that.
It'd kill her.
Say, this is her first chance to be happy and respectable.
Respectable?
Ha ha ha!
Respectable!
So she's gonna live in a swell house on the top of a hill, is she?
And she's gonna have diamonds and servants to wait on her?
And I'm gonna be right there to get my share, believe me.
I'm gonna get those diamonds you seen in my castle.
Or I'll know the reasons why.
He's gonna have a church wedding, huh?
And the mother's gonna be right there in time to kiss the blushing bride.
If they see you at the church...
Aw, dry up, will ya?
You've had your say.
Aw, don't.
Don't look at me like that, Min.
I ain't afraid of ya!
I ain't afraid of any of ya!
If they don't like me, they know what they can do.
They can pay me to get rid of me.
And plenty too.
If they don't do it, I'm gonna yell it from the housetops.
I'm gonna stand on the corner and I'm gonna spit at them!
So good-bye, Min.
I'll point my finger right straight at her.
And tell her who she really is.
And what I think of her.
You know me, Min.
When I call a spade a spade, nobody forgets.
Mm-hmm.
You ain't gonna leave this room.
No?
Who's gonna stop me?
I'm gonna stop ya.
You ain't got the guts to do it.
You got you just where I want you.
Yeah?
Now you listen to me.
You, gutter rat!
You or nobody else is gonna ruin that kid's chances!
No, sir.
I loved her with all the clumsy love that I had.
And I'm gonna tell you something.
She's a swell kid.
Clean, loyal.
Even to an old sea cow like me.
And I'm warning you, Bella.
You ain't gonna leave the room!
I ain't?
No, you ain't.
- You mean that?
- Umm.
Gee!
Min!
Min!
Min.
What did you do that for?
What did you do it for?
That boat of mine is all ready to go to Mexico.
You're going with me.
Min, come on.
Let's go.
Will ya, Min?
Bye!
- Bye!
- Goodbye, Nancy!
Min, let's go, will ya, please?
Let's go, Min.
Bye!
Come on.
What's the matter?
She ain't done nothing.
She knows.
Come on!
Aw, don't get tough with her.

There is information that the Petlyura detachment will go up to the village.
Liaise with the young people who had remained in place.
- It will be done!
- In the morning everybody should gather in the forge!
- In the morning in the forge!
- In the morning in the forge!
The local poor people were trembling:
The Petlyura detachment was approaching.
The moneybags were evacuating their children and property.
- Some young people stay here.
The rest will go to the Red Partisans.
- Listen to the words of our rabbi!
- We know what we do!
Do not teach us!
- If you go to the partisans, then everybody here will suffer for this...
- Come into the synagogue, children!
Only prayer will give you salvation!
- We will pray...
But what about our children?
..
...let them go...
- Do not listen to him, children!

They have their own ways!

Our children are more reasonable than you...
Here they come!
Quiet!
Quiet!
Don't grin, old woman!
Sit down!
Sit!
Don't get up, old woman!
- For what?
- Don't move!

- Today!

As early as today, all of you beggars will be slaughtered!
Waiting...
Waiting...
Waiting...
Quiet!

Quiet!

Waiting...
- How dare you whisper!

Speak up, louder, louder!
Waiting...

my comrades are expecting me...
- Kids!
My children!
Don't leave me!
They've arrived...

- We won't not touch...
the villagers...
- If...
- We agree!

- Never in the world!

Not for anything in the world!
- Set fire to the village from all sides!
- You have - one hour!
- Five brides!
Shall we give them our children?
- Decide, people!
- We will!
- It's not for you to decide!
..
You have evecuated your children!
- Let...

- Decide...
- I beseech you!
For the sake of our children!

The press is requested to please wait here for a few moments
Professor Stangerson, in recognition of your valuable work... the government names you Commander of the Legion of Honor...
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, gentlemen but Professor Stangerson does not like to give interviews
...offer my heartfelt thanks
And absolutely no photos!
No, no, sir!
Who gave you permission?
Let's see who it is!
Ah, Mr. Darzac!
Rouletabille!
Joseph Rouletabille, Assistant Reporter, L'Epoque
Really, sir!
Is this some kind of joke?
Mr. Darzac, we know that you are engaged to Professor Stangerson's daughter!
Your paper is very well informed!
Not at all; your wedding is quite an event!
--- You don't say!
My paper would like any photos of the famous Professor Stangerson's son-in-law!
Father, I'm so happy!
I'm so proud of you!
Recognition at last, Mathilde!
And I owe it to you
Thanks to your brilliant help and devotion
No, Father. --- It's true.
Ah, what will I do without you?
Papa!
Oh, Robert, where have you been?
I went to fend off the reporters.
Your father hates all this publicity.
Congratulations.
Your charms work on everyone
Let's dance, Robert, shall we?
Alright, Papa?
Mademoiselle, could you say a few words regarding your work?
Well, Rouletabille, what did she say?
The scent of the lady in black...
What did he mean by that?
He sure leaves his public hanging!
Robert, you can't be glum when I'm so happy!
Your father hates me.
No, no, Robert.
Oh, I was forgetting!
You spoil me, Robert!
Spoil you?
Yes – the camellias!
They're so beautiful!
I'm sorry, Mathilde, but I didn't send them.
You didn't?
--- No, I wish I had!
What's wrong, Mathilde?
Robert, I must speak to you.
--- Where?
How?
Come, Mathilde, come.
What does that mean, 'The scent of the lady in black'?
Mathilde, what has upset you?
This letter says terrible things!
What does it say?
"The vicarage has not lost its charm, nor the garden its brightness!"
Can it be...?
Mathilde, to keep you, I would commit...
No one has seen Mr. Sainclair yet!
Who's Mr. Sainclair?
News editor at L'Epoque – Rouletabille's boss!
Oh, the most precise man in the world!
I believe that this handkerchief belongs to you, Mademoiselle
Quite so, sir.
Thank you.
You're leaving already?
Yes, my father and I have work to do at our estate at Glandier.
Is it far away?
--- Fifty kilometers away, in the countryside.
We have some work to finish this evening.
Yes, that's true!
It's your last evening with him.
Good night, sir.
Good evening, Mr. Sainclair!
I've come for an interview with Professor Stangerson!
You're too early. --- Too early?
He's still here!
Oh, you're joking!
Actually, I'm two days early.
I've already got my story written on Mlle Stangerson's wedding
Listen: "Glandier's delightful chapel could not hold the throng of friends -"
Mlle Stangerson will not marry Mr. Darzac
You and your jokes!
"...friends of Professor Stangerson, his daughter, and Mr. Robert Darzac the renowned engineer whose brilliant career...'
I repeat:
Mlle Stangerson will not marry Mr. Darzac.
Cursed animal!
Get out!
Get out!
Beware!
Beware!
The Green Man is coming!
Beware!
Beware!
Here comes the Green Man!
Halt!
Hey there - it's me!
Reggie!
Oh, the gamekeeper!
Have you nothing better to do than come here frightening people?
Mr. Darzac had me get his gun ready.
He's coming tomorrow to hunt that demon cat!
You and your tall tales, Mr. Reggie.
You think that he'll be hunting tomorrow?
They're getting married the next day!
They're back
I'm coming!
I'm coming!
Finally!
Look Jacques!
Oh, Sir, it's like a picture-book!
Why are you retiring so early?
Are you sick?
No, Father, I'm fine, really!
Alright, Jacques...
now, what are you looking for?
Nothing, sir, nothing!
Now a storm!
What is it?
Is something wrong?
Oh, no, Father, I'm fine!
It's so nice to be home.
Oh, Jacques, be careful!
It's this thunder, sir!
I'll take you to your room, Mathilde
No, no, father
I'll go alone
- I'm not afraid
Ah, it's you, Marie!
The room is ready.
I've closed the shutters and barred the window
Is there anything else?
No, Marie
You may go
I'll go up to the chateau to change, and then I'll come right back
No, father, be reasonable
You need rest, and it's so late
It's half past eleven!
Do it for me – get some rest!
Have you lost something?
My head, sir. --- Come!
Hurry --- Yes, sir
My God!
Professor, it's midnight!
You must get some rest
Help!
Help!
Mathilde!
It's me!
Open the door, Mathilde, it's me!
He's killed her!
--- I'll go for help!
Help!
--- What's wrong?
Mademoiselle has been killed!
You two, stay here!
Watch the window - the killer can't escape that way
The Professor is guarding the door.
The Yellow Room!
Go up!
Well?
--- The window never budged
Then he can't have escaped
There are only 2 exits:
the window and the door
She's alive!
She's alive!
Oh, Sir!
What about the killer?
I've looked everywhere, I didn't see anyone
Check the window.
She's in pain
He couldn't have escaped by the window;
you see, it's barred from the inside
Not by the door, either – it's locked from the inside
Besides, we never left the door!
Then he must be here!
Maybe under the bed?
At any rate, he had big feet
Look, he wore clogs!
Clogs?
Look, his revolver!
Why, it's Old Jacques' revolver!
It IS my revolver!
He's about to faint!
It's no use, gentlemen, no one is allowed in
Whose orders?
--- The examining judge
Well, your examining judge needs his head examined!
Doesn't matter, Ma'am, we have our orders
This is ridiculous!
We've been stuck for 3 days outside this gate!
No, no, I don't know anything!
Let me pass!
Sir, how is Miss Stangerson?
A bit better.
The fever is going down.
But no one can question her yet.
Chef, can you give me any fresh news on Mademoiselle Stangerson?
Ah, Rouletabille, so you finally made it!
Well, I broke down on the way.
So I've heard.
Pity it wasn't inside.
I'm from L'Epoque – can I go in?
Nobody is allowed in.
Not even me?
--- Who are you?
Joseph Rouletabille!
--- Never heard of you.
You've never heard of Rouletabille?
What do they teach you at the police academy?
Do you know who's handling the case?
Frederic Larsan himself!
Really?
Big Fred himself?
Then we'll get somewhere!
He's a great man
Yes, it's fantastic!
But meanwhile, we're stuck!
Larsan hates journalists!
He's no friend of ours on the inside.
Rouletabille, this is a job for a youngster
I understand, chief
It's the inspector. --- Someone from the police.
We certainly needed to call in this Larsan
What a bore!
From what I've seen already, this business is hopelessly complicated
It sure is, sir.
Inspector
Professor, you can count on me completely.
Thank you, Mr. Larsan.
Mr. Larsan?
--- How do you do?
We are entirely at your service
I don't know if this a crime of passion, but it's passionately exciting!
You've left everything as it was?
Of course.
I've questioned the servants and put their statements in this report
Oh, sorry, small error – here you are
I'll read it later
Professor, could you please show me this "Yellow Room"?
Of course
Would you like me to come?
--- No, you stay
I need to see the Professor alone
But...
--- It's necessary for my inquiries.
Very well – do what you think best.
So it was here that the attack on your poor daughter took place?
Poor thing!
Half strangled and a wound on her forehead!
Quite a problem – how did the attacker get out of a room sealed from the inside?
There isn't even a chimney
True
The attacker left footprints, you see
Very clear.
I'd say he was wearing clogs
Well, well!
Forgive me, Professor, but I have something to ask you:
Exactly where were you at the time of the crime?
In my laboratory.
It was midnight.
Old Jacques was with me.
Good.
And when your daughter screamed – you rushed immediately to the door?
Naturally.
I didn't leave the spot.
And when it was opened, you found the window fastened on the inside.
Exactly.
Well then, the man could only have left by the door.
But... but I've told you – I never left for a moment!
They don't rule each other out
What are you insinuating, Inspector?
Forgive me, but even the most honest man can find himself in a certain situation...
But I deny any such thing!
I deny it!
...I was about to say ...unwittingly complicit
What do you mean?
Do I understand you correctly -
Yes.
It's my duty to suspect everything and everyone.
Gamekeeper
Go on – answer when you're called!
Come along, gamekeeper...
I want to talk to you.
Your full name?
Reggie Stanton, former captain, U.S. Army.
I knew the Stangersons when they lived there
I was flat broke -
That will do.
Now, as to your statement:
You were outside, and you heard a shot;
Next, Mlle Stangerson's scream, then...
Excuse me...
Mlle Stangerson's scream followed by a short silence!
Oh, come now!
– Yes, but we must be accurate
...followed by a short silence
Then another scream and a sound of furniture falling, and finally a third cry
Exactly
Fine, thank you
Instead of thanking him, you should ask him why he was outside the window fully dressed, at half past midnight on the night of the crime!
Reggie, you hear what he says.
How do you respond?
I was cleaning Mr. Darzac's gun
Did you do what I asked?
Yes.
We've established that the night of the crime Mr. Darzac did not come home until early in the morning
Excuse me – exactly 5:00 AM
Silence!
Mr. Larsan --- Yes?
I have a parcel for you
Who brought it?
I didn't know him
Give it to me
What the devil?
--- What's going on?
Listen
Yes, that's funny
There's a ticking clock in this parcel
It's a bomb!
Everyone calm down!
Judge, will you help me open this parcel?
I really can't
Professional duty?
Grandier, give Mr. Larsan a hand
But, but –-
- Oh, come now!
Now, that's odd!
My watch!
Oh, it's yours, eh?
Now, now
Those are Old Jacques' clogs!
--- It's true
Why they are my clogs!
Thank you
I'm pleased to deliver to Mr. Larsan the killer's clogs
Young man, the person who gave you this parcel, is he still outside?
I believe so
Send him up. --– Yes, tell him to come up
There was nothing but this vest
What?
But where has he gone?
That's quite an entrance!
It was the most direct route
You've got a nerve!
I do my best
Don't you know that the chateau is off-limits to reporters?
Quite!
Off-limits!
Yes, that's true!
--- How did you get in?
At the same time you did!
The same time as me!
Did someone let you in?
When you're with Mr. Larsan, you can go anywhere!
Thank you very much
Well now, what are you doing here?
While you were working in here, I poked around outside a bit
I found this big watch which belonged to the butler
They wrapped it in my vest so we couldn't hear it
And these clogs?
The killer's clogs
No.
The killer stole them to throw suspicion on this poor fellow.
Oh, thank you, sir!
And that's why my revolver went missing too!
No
The revolver is a different matter.
We'll see later
Mr. Rouletabille, you seem to have overheard our questioning here
It's not my fault.
Sound rises up the chimney
Yes, and you came down by the chimney, eh?
Why?
I was checking the roof for a secret trap door in the ceiling.
The killer could have used it...
And naturally, there was one!
No.
There wasn't
There wasn't?
No.
But if you like, Mr. Larsan, you could use that route!
Let's get back to the clogs
Where are the footprints of the killer?
This way, Mr. Larsan
This way
Here are the prints.
They go from here straight to the bridge
Look, this is where the killer took off the stolen clogs.
He tossed them here, in this bush, then made off
Look, there are his footprints:
a narrow shoe with rubber heels
Bring me the evidence --- Yes, sir
You enjoy a good mystery, young man?
I like finding out the truth
I would like to uncover it, and publish it for everyone to read!
Be careful where you spatter your ink
What do you mean, Mr. Larsan?
How did you know that Mlle Stangerson's engagement was broken?
That's what you said!
Oh, I didn't know –-
- How then?
I was just bluffing
Bluffing only goes so far
Here is the evidence, Inspector
Lapié, the person I summoned for 7:00;
he should be here by now
I believe so, Inspector
Send him to me here at once --- Yes, sir
Mr. Darzac, do you recognize these shoes as yours?
Absolutely – they are mine
Please wait for me inside
But Mr. Larsan...
I have several points to verify
Robert...is he coming?
He's here – he's been here every day, since he got the news
Why hasn't he come to see me?
Why hasn't he come to see me?
Mathilde?
Her wounds are healing
Good, good
It doesn't take much to be happy in life
Someone is there!
It's you, Mr. Photographer?
Excuse me, Professor
I'd like to know why you are here
I'm here to try to serve the Truth
You have no right to be here!
And we don't share Mr. Larsan's enthusiasm for your presence here which is unwelcome as well as surprising
Yes, surprising!
Mr. Larsan must have his reasons for tolerating me
Yes, and I have none at all.
None!
I would prefer you to just go!
At once!
I quite understand.
Would you like to show me out?
Certainly.
This way
Listen: "The vicarage has not lost its charm" --- What?
"Nor the garden its brightness"
How do you know that?
I'm an investigative reporter
You're one of Larsan's men --– No!
You want to destroy me!
--- I want to save you!
Help me to stay in the chateau tonight
Here?
Tonight?
Impossible
You won't regret it
Come
Mr. Stangerson, will you permit this young man to stay the night?
From what he's told me, I believe he could be very useful
As you wish
Thank you!
Could my boss, Mr. Sainclair, also come in?
He's been standing outside for three days
Go get him –-
- Thank you
You'll have the room opposite Mr. Larsan;
I'll give the orders for it
Thank you
But no photos, alright?
–-
- No, no
Mr. Stangerson, I absolutely must see Mathilde tonight
Impossible!
She's too weak to see you
I know, but...
--– She's too weak to see you!
Just a moment, please, Mr. Darzac
I need to verify a few things.
Will you excuse us?
What is it?
Flowers, for Mademoiselle
Sit down
What does all this mean?
What do you want to "verify" with me?
And who are you?
Frederic Larsan.
That should be enough
I don't care.
Since this outrageous attack I haven't seen Mlle Stangerson.
I wish to see her!
--- No
You know that all this... --- No!
I gave the order that you were not to see her until I'd questioned you
By what right?
Mr. Darzac, calm down please, and answer me
When was the last time you saw Mlle Stangerson?
At the ball, three days ago
Three days ago.
Anywhere else?
Where else would I have seen her?
I don't know...here, perhaps?
Here?
--– Yes!
But I've only just left Paris;
I had no reason to come here
Perhaps you forgot to give her something
A bouquet, for example?
A bouquet?
Yes, a bouquet of camellias
I don't understand --- Don't you?
But who brought them?
I don't know;
I just found them at the gate
Didn't you give Mlle Stangerson the camellias found in the Yellow Room?
No, no, I don't believe so --– You don't believe so?
I mean, no – no, it wasn't me!
Yes, yes, just a moment Thank you, officers
Where were you the night of the crime?
I went for a long walk.
Nowhere in particular
Hard to believe
Mlle Stangerson and I had a discussion during the ball
About what?
--- I don't remember
I'll refresh your memory
We found this at your home
Where did you get that photo?
Never mind.
Wasn't your discussion about this person?
No!
She knows nothing about that affair, which ended a long time ago anyway
Well then, it's simple: if there's no other woman in your life then there's another man in Mlle Stangerson's!
Why, you...
Quiet please!
Yes, you're right.
Come with me
Go to the gate – let in Mr. Sainclair.
A jolly little fat man.
He's my boss
OK --- And I arranged it!
I repeat: there is another man in Mlle Stangerson's life --– No!
A man who sends her flowers --- You're mad!
And you know who it is!
--- No!
No!
If you won't say his name, then I will have to
Oh, enough, enough!
What would be more cruel?
Shall I tell you?
Shall I tell the Professor his daughter had a liaison with...
Not that!
Not that!
If there's no one else in her life, then...
Do the honorable thing, or I will speak!
It's me – only me, no one else
I am the criminal
Arrest me
Finally
Oh, sorry!
What are you doing?
Just taking a little exercise
Well, would you mind sending me two officers, please
Of course, Mr. Larsan
Whatever you say
Hurry!
Mr. Larsan wants two policemen sent up to his room
Where?
--- His room!
--- OK
Ah, Mr. Sainclair!
Hello, my boy!
So, this time I'm just in time, right?
No.
You're early --- What do you mean, early?
You got here early
Mr. Darzac has confessed everything
He is under arrest, and will be brought at once before the Public Prosecutor
So, what do you mean, I got here early?
Everything's all over;
the killer's been arrested
Mr. Darzac has been arrested, not the killer.
It's not quite the same thing
Mr. Darzac has confessed!
--- That doesn't mean a thing
What do you mean?
We'll have some news shortly
Listen to me:
the killer will return to the chateau tonight!
You're a real joker, Rouletabille
He'll come back tonight, and you and I will catch him!
You and I...alone?
No, no, we have to get Mr. Larsan
Not a word to Larsan!
Who should get the glory?
The paper or the police?
Oh, glory is all very well, but it's a bit dangerous
Gentlemen, would you dine with me this evening in my room?
We'd be delighted
Until this evening
You have to warn Mlle Stangerson!
Come on, boss – your room is the first on the left down the hall
Someone brought these flowers
Alright...thank you
Meet me tonight or else calamity will strike...
You know what I mean
Are you feeling better?
Oh, yes, papa – quite well!
Ah, good!
Robert has sent me flowers.
I must thank him
I absolutely must see him
Why 'absolutely'?
I don't know;
I just want to see him
There's no reason why he shouldn't be back tomorrow
Tomorrow
It's the usual wine, sir
Goodnight, my dear
I'm just tired this evening
I hope Mlle Stangerson is feeling better
Yes, she is better this evening.
I hope she can answer questions tomorrow
She's so much better that you're not staying with her tonight?
I'm the one who's not feeling well
What's wrong?
I don't know.
I'm sleepy...
I'm sleepy
You can go, Marie.
No need to stay;
I feel very well
Very well, Mademoiselle
Miss?
--- Yes, sir?
--- You're watching Mlle Stangerson tonight, aren't you?
No.
I think she prefers to be alone
So I'll be in the little room next door
Who is there?
Don't be alarmed - a friend who wants to help
What's your concern with me?
If I told you, you'd laugh
Never mind.
Tell me quickly
Well, you wear a perfume... – the same scent as a lady who was kind to me when I was little
What?
Yes; a lady in black, always in black who came to see me from time to time
So you see, that calls up a great many things very sweet things
But that doesn't explain why you're here
It's to warn you --- Of what?
Mr. Darzac has been arrested
Arrested?
My God, my God!
Yes.
He has confessed that he attacked you
But he's innocent!
I swear it!
I believe you, Mademoiselle There are so many mysteries...
Such as...what?
Such as...
YOU
Me?
Yes, you.
Why have you sent away your maid, your father?
Why?
Quiet!
Oh, you can't possibly understand!
Go – it's useless!
Why you are determined to meet this killer
- YOUR killer?
Quiet!
If you care about me, go away...go away
But where is Rouletabille?
Ah, there you are!
--- Sorry
Where have you been?
I was talking to Mr. Stangerson
He's more cheerful this evening;
his daughter is better
No thank you;
I've had a slight upset stomach this evening
No, thank you, I'll have some red
Here you go, young man.
There's no disputing matters of taste...
I think we'll all sleep well tonight!
--- I hope so
You must be tired, Mr. Larsan --- Oh, I'm used to it
It's a cat --- Obviously
Mr. Larsan, would you allow me to interview you regarding...
That's some cat!
What's wrong with me?
I feel awful
My head is spinning.
It's...
Come and lie down
Listen!
The white wine was drugged!
Someone wanted to get rid of me!
He's sleeping; he should be able to sleep it off
The two of us – not a moment to lose!
Larsan drugged – Mr. Stangerson asleep;
the killer has wasted no time!
Really!
And the two of us will catch him!
I'm not quite up to it.
Maybe someone else might like to take my place...
There's no one!
The servants are under guard.
There's just us two
Well, when you put it like that...
Here, take this --- Is it loaded?
Twelve shots --- But...
Come on!
Come on – I'll show you where to hide
Hide here, behind this curtain
When you see something, turn on this lamp
Pull back the curtain;
the light will fall on that statue
I'll be able to see your signal from my room.
I turn on the light...the curtain...
Just like that
You're going to leave me here?
Don't be afraid.
As soon as there's any fighting I'll come right back
A cat that yowls without opening its mouth
Maybe there's another one --- Maybe
I'd really rather be in bed, you know
Shhh...it's time!
The red wine was drugged too!
The red wine!
The man was in Mlle Stangerson's room!
Quickly!
Quickly!
Patience, for God's sake!
We have to act methodically.
First I want to get a look at him
Wait here – I'm going to climb up
Help!
Help!
The killer!
Help!
Help!
Help!
The killer!
You heard cries?
--- It's Mathilde!
My daughter!
Let go!
You're crazy!
Ah, Mr. Larsan!
--- What did you see?
--- He was here!
This is terrible!
He's vanished into thin air!
I can't explain it
Look!
After him!
I'm going to get my gun
There he is!
There he is!
Shoot!
Shoot!
Careful... watch his head
He's dead
What have you done?
Reggie!
Why?
Why did you kill him?
He wasn't the killer
Did he get away?
Did he get away?
He was with me, in my room
He was my lover!
Mademoiselle, calm yourself...
this is useless...
Gentlemen, this is very strange;
We thought we shot him but our bullets never touched him
He was stabbed through the heart!
It's Mr. Darzac's knife!
Stay where you are!
Hello...yes, Larsan here.
What?
Darzac has escaped?
When?
Three hours ago
You've taken the necessary steps?
Good, thank you.
Mr. Darzac escaped three hours ago
I think that we'll soon find him nearby
You think so?
Silence!
Silence!
There's no doubt...
The murder weapon belonged to Darzac...
He was arrested for the attempt on Mlle Stangerson's life and after his escape he was recaptured near the chateau shortly after the murder
Mr. Darzac did not escape in order to murder a gamekeeper!
He wanted to protect Mlle Stangerson from the attacker he feared would return
In sum: only two people saw the criminal;
The gamekeeper, who is dead and Mlle Stangerson, who remains silent
Mlle Stangerson has recovered enough to go into public the first time
She is here.
We will hear her at once Your witness, Mr. Prosecutor
Bailiff, bring in Mlle Stangerson
RETURNING FRANCE TODAY IMPOSSIBLE ARRIVE TRIAL IN TIME DOCUMENTS FOUND HERE STOP
BEG YOU AT ALL COSTS DO NOT SPEAK BEFORE ARRIVAL.....
ROULETABILLE
Silence!
You may be seated, Mademoiselle
You continue to insist that Mr. Darzac is innocent.
What solid reason do you have for this?
I don't know.
I believe it because it's true.
Robert – Mr. Darzac – is absolutely innocent of the crime he is accused of
He is incapable of killing the gamekeeper.
He would never kill...
we love each other
Love can lead to crime
Besides, Darzac has admitted his guilt!
Mr. Darzac is the most chivalrous man in the world.
He accused himself to save...
To save... who?
I didn't say that, Your Honor!
...I don't know...
I...
If Mr. Darzac isn't the man who attacked you twice and stabbed the gamekeeper...
No, no, it's not him!
Then who is it?
I don't know
But you saw him!
Mademoiselle, I don't know if you fully understand the gravity of the situation
Darzac's life is at stake!
His life!
You could save him
Me?
How?
How?
By telling us the name of your attacker
I don't know...
I can't say
Bailiff, call Mr. Larsan.
No, Mademoiselle, a moment, please
For weeks you have been too ill for Mr. Larsan's interrogation
I would like him to question you on certain points.
Please be seated
Just a moment, Mr. Larsan.
Mlle Stangerson, I entreat you, for the last time;
If you know something, speak now
Mademoiselle, on my soul and conscience I am sure of Mr. Darzac's guilt
But nobody is infallible.
If you know the true identity of the killer I beseech you to state his name
You wish me to state his name?
His name?
I beseech you
Then... the man...is is.......
Let me go!
Let me go!
Silence!
Stop!
Silence!
Guards, remove that person!
Your Honor, allow me to speak on behalf of Joseph Rouletabille.
He has on his own been on the trail of killer
I beg you to ask him if he has brought solid proof of my client's innocence
Yes, I have brought proof!
Your Honor, you cannot now refuse to hear Rouletabille!
Very well.
But I warn you in advance that if he does not present clear facts...
I will have him arrested at once!
Justice will not be mocked!
Thank you, Your Honor
We will hear him.
And above all, be brief --- I will, Your Honor
Any further disturbance, and I will have the courtroom cleared!
Do not be angry, Your Honor
I will begin
I just got back from America with proof that Mr. Darzac is innocent
The evidence shows that Mr. Darzac is the only possible culprit
But what motive would Mr. Darzac have for killing him?
The reasons for the crime are clear
Two days before their wedding Mlle Stangerson refused to marry Darzac
He loved her, and what is more, she is very rich.
Exasperated, he meets her after the ball enters her room while her father is at the chateau
He begs her to change her mind;
she refuses – he grows angry – loses control
The inquiry did not find the accomplice who assisted him but Darzac flees and gets away
Arrested 3 days later, he escapes;
As soon as he is free, he attacks her again
Unfortunately, the gamekeeper, leaving his mistress's room sees Darzac as he is leaving his victim's room
The gamekeeper must be silenced
Darzac beats him to the garden, where he stabs him through the heart
Completely false!
First of all, for the first attack, the killer needed no accomplice
He left peacefully by the door
I've discovered the most amazing thing of all:
There is no mystery of the Yellow Room!
The Yellow Room was hermetically locked and sealed, like a safe
It is therefore impossible that the killer could have escaped from it
Perfectly true
So, since the killer could not have been in the Yellow Room the only explanation is – he wasn't there!
Not bad, not bad!
Sir, I warned you about joking!
I am not joking, Your Honor
I'm saying the killer wasn't in the Yellow Room when he couldn't be there
That is, when the shots were fired and Mlle Stangerson cried for help
When was he there, then?
The night before the crime, probably.
This is no joke, Your Honor
Here's how it happened
The night of the ball, a man, under cover of the fog, crept into the pavillion
He hid himself in the Yellow Room, under a bed, probably
At 11:30, Mlle Stangerson returns home with her father
For several days, she's been uneasy
She received a threatening letter, mysterious flowers but she doesn't want to alarm her father
She hides everything from him
She arms herself with a gun the gamekeeper had taken from Old Jacques
She locks herself in her room
Suddenly, she is attacked – she screams for help, but nobody hears her
Her father is at the chateau;
she is alone
She fights back desperately
The attacker fears someone will come - he lets go and flees
How?
By the door, quite simply
Because at that moment the laboratory is deserted
Remember, it is not yet midnight!
But the cries for help, the shots –
They all happened AFTER midnight
When her father had come back from the chateau
Now, according to you, the crime had already taken place 15 minutes earlier
It's far-fetched!
Your Honor, picture this:
At 11:45, the killer leaves and she faints and falls, bleeding heavily
When she revives, she has a nightmare, a hallucination
She imagines that the killer is still there
Firing the gun, she tries to rise and stumbles against the door
She accidentally locks the bolt, then falls back, senseless which is how her father found her
Bravo!
Young man, you haven't told us the name of the killer!
Wait!
First I have to tell you how I cracked the whole case!
I examined the night of the second attack
The killer drugged Mr. Stangerson, Mr. Larsan and me in order not to be interrupted
Fortunately, Mr. Sainclair woke me in time
The killer managed to get into Mlle Stangerson's room
I ran to the garden and climbed to the window but through the blinds, I couldn't see the man's face
I raced to the hall, saw him as he was leaving his victim's room...
I chased after him, thought I'd caught him and ran straight into Mr. Larsan
That ended the hunt for the killer
Mr. Larsan, very wide awake, hardly seemed to have been drugged
As for the killer...
Gone, as if by magic
That made me suspect...
Who?
Someone so safe from suspicion I began to doubt myself...
I worried about making a fool of myself
Well, you wanted concrete proof.
I went in search of it, and here it is!
Are you telling us the killer's name is in that bag?
You're absolutely sure you want to know the name of the killer?
I do.
So do I
Very well.
It is...
Ballmeyer!
Silence!
Ballmeyer!
The famous international criminal?
You forget one thing, young man;
Ballmeyer has been dead for some time!
Ballmeyer is not dead!
He is hiding beneath the name of a police officer he killed.
Ballmeyer is...
Frederic Larsan!
Order!
Order!
We demand proof of this claim
Proof?
Here is as much as you like – I have a satchel full
Mr. Larsan, could you shed some light on this matter?
You have the floor
Well then...yes!
I am Ballmeyer.
Larsan is dead.
Rouletabille is right – he was smarter than all of you.
But...
But what?
Nothing.
I've taken poison...
In a few moments I'll be out of your reach
Tell us!
I attacked Mathilde Stangerson.
Me!
I alone killed the gamekeeper
Yes, he caught me, the night when I drugged the wine
How could I catch up with him?
I jumped from my window into the garden and I stopped him with one blow.
Why?
What did you have against Mlle Stangerson?
Because there is something you don't know...
Back there... in America...
She... she was........
This hearing is adjourned!
Clear the courtroom!
Oh, what a story, my boy!
In any case, you were absolutely great!
But tell me...do you know what was between Mlle Stangerson and Ballmeyer/Larsan?
She was his wife!
Good God!
Yes.
He knew her in America when she was very young
They married in secret;
She even hid the marriage from her father
When she learned who he was, she wanted a divorce
When the papers announced that Ballmeyer was dead – she thought she was free
But Ballmeyer was alive
The real Larsan whom he'd killed was dead in his place
The poor thing!
How did you figure it all out?
"The vicarage has not lost its charm, nor the garden its brightness"
I overheard those words the night of the ball
Mlle Stangerson quoted them to Darzac from a letter from Larsan
He spoke of a vicarage?
Yes – where they were married long ago
Marvellous!
Careful, here she comes
You have saved me!
Thank you!
Until we meet again
In America!
I even have a copy of the marriage certificate
Everything is clear then!
But one mystery remains
What might that be?
The scent of the lady in black.

DURING THE DAY...
THAT SAME NIGHT IN ANOTHER CORNER OF THE CITY
If she makes it through the night, she'll be out of danger.
You're not too tired from last night, are you?
No,I'm all right.
Hasn't papa returned yet?
He'll come soon, just rest and take it easy.
Please, call papa.
Papa's gone to get some money for medicine, he'll return soon.
Liar!
Call papa!
Hello, Let me speak with doctor Suda, please.
I won't be able to return home tonight.
How is the girl?
She is in critical condition.
I don't know what your situation is, but you must return home tonight.
But what...
I'm poor, nobody has any money to lend me.
I cannot let Michiko die, she must recover.
When Michiko has recovered I will pay it back.
I am a policeman.
Where is your husband?
He left this morning and hasn't returned yet.
I think he has come.
My daughter is in a critical condition, that's the reason why...
I will not bother her.
I can even help crush the ice.
Please, officer, she's young and shouldn't be frightened.
I'm sorry to be a nuisance, but I must do my duty.
I accompanied your husband home.
Come out!
Quickly, escape!
I can't leave my girl.
Our daughter may die from her illness, She needs her father.
We can only wait and let the healing take care of itself.
Until she's well, You won't move from here.
Beloved, don't worry about me, think about Michiko!
Don't move, you mustn't wake the girl.
I think until the doctor arrives, you should rest a little.
I took the money that you hid in your sleeve.
THE NEXT DAY
Fortunately, she's past the critical phase, and is far better now.
Naturally, she still needs your care.
Let's have a last cup of coffee, in token of goodbye.
you thought I was asleep, right.
In fact I slept, but didn't help him escape.
I've decided I no longer want to escape.
When I've paid for my crimes I can be with Michiko, carefree.
Let's leave, before my daughter wakes.

Are you dying, Semion?
Yes, I'm dying, Petro.
Well, die then.
Die, Semion.
And after your death let me know, where you are: in Paradise or in Hell and how you're doing.
Fine, Petro.
If possible, I'll give you notice.
For 75 years he has plowed the soil with oxen...
That's no small achievement!
If I were a People's Commissar, I'd given him the Order of the Banner of Labor.
There are no Orders for oxen, grandfather.
For what then?
I could eat something.
Live well, I'm dying.
Pears he has liked.
Go ahead, read on, friend!
"...
The kulak Belokon sabotages our work, hides the seeds and kills the livestock..."
I'm not giving it away!
I'd rather kill it...!
Now, father, the kulaks are finished.
We're getting machines as well.
Vasili, I think, you're not right in the head...
When we have the machines, we'll take their land away.
I'm saying, you're crazy...
It will work without you.
You don't have to go.
The whole village is laughing already.
It's not the whole village that's laughing, father, just the kulaks and the stupid.
You're saying I'm stupid?
Not stupid, father, you just have grown old.
Oh, the village Komsomol is coming!
Then open the meeting!
These filthy dogs, splendid fellows!
Father!
I'm going!
Semion, where are you now?
Greetings, grandfather Petro!
Grandfather Petro, greetings!
Get lost, devil's brood!
It's moving!
It's moving!
It's moving!
It has stopped!
It has stopped!
It's moving!
It has stopped!
It has stopped!
Write: premises are lacking for collective seeds and livestock, but not wonderful buildings for the kulaks...
It's moving!
It has stopped!
It has stopped!
I hear!
I hear!
I hear!
No water in the cooler.
I hear!
Comrade chairman!
In the city they want to know, if the tractor has arrived.
Comrade chairman, the tractor is standing still!
The tractor has arrived, the whole village witnessed it.
The tractor can't be standing still.
Go!
Go on then!
Go!
It has been accomplished!
The have brought it.
That's the end.
Grandfather Petro is right:
It has been accomplished!
May we prosper with the machines!
Now the kulaks can just mourn their field borders!
Beware, so your mother has nothing to mourn about!
We will see.
We will see.
It's happening, Choma!
Father!
Throw away these crutches!
Throw me up!
I'll pay for it!
Choma!
Vasili has plowed the field with the tractor!
Vasili!
Hey, Iwans!
Hey, Stepans!
Hey, Grizkas!
Have you killed my Vasili?
Choma, you?
I'm asking you:
Have you killed Vasili?
No, uncle, it wasn't me.
There is no God.
And there are no priests either.
I'm asking you...
Just like Vasili died for the new life,
I'm asking you, to bury him according to the new ways...
Neither priests nor church servants beyond the grave...
It have to be our boys and girls themselves...
And they are to sing new songs about the new life!
Good, Uncle Opanas, we'll bury our Vasili ourselves.
Without priests or church servants.
And we'll sing new songs about the new life!
Without a priest!
Good, if there's no God...
And if He exists after all?
God, punish the sinners!
Punish them, God!
It's my Earth!
I won't give it up!
Punish them!
Where is the priest?
He's in there.
Damn the kolkhozy.
Vasili!
Vasili!
The deadly hate of the enemy on poverty took Vasili away from you...
Hey, you have-nots!
It's me!
Beat me up!
I'd rather die, than give myself up!
With the iron horse of Bolshevism
Vasili destroyed thousand year old fields!
I've killed him at night!
At night, when everyone was sleeping!
And he walked on the street...
And danced!
...with his hot blood he wrote the class enemy the death sentence...
And you, Uncle Opanas, mustn't grieve.
Vasili's fame will fly around the entire world like our Bolshevist airplane above!

I could eat something.
Live well, I'm dying.
Pears he has liked.
Go ahead, read on, friend!
"...
The kulak Belokon sabotages our work, hides the seeds and kills the livestock..."
I'm not giving it away!
I'd rather kill it...!
Now, father, the kulaks are finished.
We're getting machines as well.
Vasili, I think, you're not right in the head...
When we have the machines, we'll take their land away.
I'm saying, you're crazy...
It will work without you.
You don't have to go.
The whole village is laughing already.
It's not the whole village that's laughing, father, just the kulaks and the stupid.
You're saying I'm stupid?
Not stupid, father, you just have grown old.
Oh, the village Komsomol is coming!
Then open the meeting!
These filthy dogs, splendid fellows!
Father!
I'm going!
Semion, where are you now?
Greetings, grandfather Petro!
Grandfather Petro, greetings!
Get lost, devil's brood!
It's moving!
It's moving!
It's moving!
It has stopped!
It has stopped!
It's moving!
It has stopped!
It has stopped!
Write: premises are lacking for collective seeds and livestock, but not wonderful buildings for the kulaks...
It's moving!
It has stopped!
It has stopped!
I hear!
I hear!
I hear!
No water in the cooler.
I hear!
Comrade chairman!
In the city they want to know, if the tractor has arrived.
Comrade chairman, the tractor is standing still!
The tractor has arrived, the whole village witnessed it.
The tractor can't be standing still.
Go!
Go on then!
Go!
It has been accomplished!
The have brought it.
That's the end.
Grandfather Petro is right:
It has been accomplished!
May we prosper with the machines!
Now the kulaks can just mourn their field borders!
Beware, so your mother has nothing to mourn about!
We will see.
We will see.
It's happening, Choma!
Father!
Throw away these crutches!
Throw me up!
I'll pay for it!
Choma!
Vasili has plowed the field with the tractor!
Vasili!
Hey, lwans!
Hey, Stepans!
Hey, Grizkas!
Have you killed my Vasili?
Choma, you?
I'm asking you:
Have you killed Vasili?
No, uncle, it wasn't me.
There is no God.
And there are no priests either.
I'm asking you...
Just like Vasili died for the new life,
I'm asking you, to bury him according to the new ways...
Neither priests nor church servants beyond the grave...
It have to be our boys and girls themselves...
And they are to sing new songs about the new life!
Good, Uncle Opanas, we'll bury our Vasili ourselves.
Without priests or church servants.
And we'll sing new songs about the new life!
Without a priest!
Good, if there's no God...
And if He exists after all?
God, punish the sinners!
Punish them, God!
It's my Earth!
I won't give it up!
Punish them!
Where is the priest?
He's in there.
Damn the kolkhozy.
Vasili!
Vasili!
The deadly hate of the enemy on poverty took Vasili away from you...
Hey, you have-nots!
It's me!
Beat me up!
I'd rather die, than give myself up!
With the iron horse of Bolshevism
Vasili destroyed thousand year old fields!
I've killed him at night!
At night, when everyone was sleeping!
And he walked on the street...
And danced!
...with his hot blood he wrote the class enemy the death sentence...
And you, Uncle Opanas, mustn't grieve.
Vasili's fame will fly around the entire world like our Bolshevist airplane above!

Aleksandr Dovzhenko
Are you dying, Semion?
Yes, I'm dying, Petro.
Well, die then.
Die, Semion.
And after your death let me know, where you are: in Paradise or in Hell and how you're doing.
Fine, Petro.
If possible, I'll give you notice.
For 75 years he has plowed the soil with oxen...
That's no small achievement!
If I were a People's Commissar, I'd given him the Order of the Banner of Labor.
There are no Orders for oxen, grandfather.

Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
- Honey, what is the matter?
- My tie.
I brought one home from the store especially for this evening
I put it on my dresser and now it's gone.
Are you sure you put it there?
I put it on my dresser and I can't find it anywhere.
What's the matter with this one?
This fool thing?
Look at it.
This is collegiate.
Larry gave it to me.
Fool has got only one in.
I worked for two hours on this the night before last and I couldn't tie it right to save my life.
Oh, well, it'll turn up in the morning.
I know, my darling, The only thing is the dinner happens to be tonight.
Oh, I could kill the man who made a tie like that.
Did you ever see anything like it?
Well, you see I'm always ready first.
That's right, my darling, that's right, rub it in.
Rub it in, I'll endure it.
- Henry, how's your tie?
- I have it, I think.
I have it now.
Come in.
Hello, sis, how are you?
Wow!
Stand back, boys, stand back.
The line for her is on the right.
You nut.
Fasten this up for me, will you, Larry, I can't reach it.
Sure.
I could never figure out why you gals don't put zippers on these things.
Then all you'd have to do is go... like that and it's done.
Are you coming to the club with us or are you blathering your new cuddle suit?
- I'm going in my roadster.
- What?
I'm bringing Natalie over and I'm gonna take her over in the roadster.
Who are you going with?
With Bob.
Oh, for crying out loud, sis.
The only thing that guy's head is good for is to keep his ears apart.
- Oh, is that so?
- Yes, and that's not all.
- He's got a funny face.
- Well, what's that to you?
It's a matter of family pride, that's all.
I don't want to be known as the man whose sister has no judgment.
A man, did you say?
Listen, you tend to your women, and I'll look after the boyfriends.
And I think I'll tell the girlfriends that when they go out with you they'll need an extra gallon of gas.
Daddy, dear old Daddy,
I need dough-dough, dough-dee-oh.
There now, That's quite all right.
No need to get excited.
Darling, I wasn't excited, just a bit mad.
- Good evening, children.
- Hello, son.
Hello, dear.
Gee, Mom, you're a knockout.
You'll make all those other dames at the shindig tonight look warmed over.
Lying, Larry?
Get out of my way.
Well, Dad, how's the bankroll?
Leave that alone.
You're not broke again, are you?
I gave you $20 the day before yesterday.
Oh, yes, so you did, so you did.
Now that you bring it to my mind I remember the incident quite clearly.
- That's really very nice of you.
- Twenty round silver dollars.
But the little eagles flapped their wings and flew away.
Henry, I don't think you should give him any more money.
- Mother, quiet.
- Laura, you're quite right.
Did you hear what your mother said?
Well, she's quite right.
When I was your age I had to work for my money.
I didn't go out to parties every night.
I had to get up at 4 o'clock in the morning... to deliver papers.
The last time I heard it it was milk.
Milk?
- Well, anyway, I had to get up.
- Oh, you had to get up.
- I had to get up...
- Your folks made you do that.
I had no... folks didn't make me...
I had to get up.
I had to work hard, long, long hours.
- Far into the night.
- Far into... shut up, you idiot!
Oh, Dad, I know life was hard in the Dark Ages.
- Well...
- Well, how about that $20?
Will you take your hands off that, please?
Oh, Larry, leave these alone.
That's my speech.
You'll get it all mixed up.
Ladies and gentlemen,
You've just heard the speech of our mayor, and I'm sure, after listening to him, that you'll all agree with me when I say that the old gray mayor ain't what he used to be.
- I don't think it's funny.
- No?
- No.
It's awfully funny to me.
I don't have as keen a sense of humor as you have.
Oh, no, Dad.
There's a lot of things I'd laugh at that you wouldn't even get a snicker out of.
What do you mean I wouldn't?
Well, Dad, will you give me $20 if I can show you something that'll be funny to me and that you won't laugh at?
You mean something that's funny to you and not funny to me?
Not at all funny to you.
That's all right, well, go ahead.
Good night, Mother.
Good night, Dad.
It's your own fault, dear.
You asked for it.
You have him completely spoiled.
- Nonsense.
- It isn't nonsense, Henry.
Larry is not old enough to have everything his own way.
You give him money every time he asks for it... you just bought him a new car... and you give him no responsibilities.
He's too young to have any responsibilities.
You give him too much freedom.
I tell you it's dangerous.
My darling girl, we've been all over this so many times before.
Larry isn't hurting anybody and... and he isn't doing himself any harm.
Sometimes I think these modern ideas are advocated because they're easier for everyone.
Parents don't have to trouble about their children.
Don't have to bother giving advice and guiding.
Now stop worrying.
He can do no wrong.
Isn't he your son... and mine?
Then there's nothing to worry about.
With a wonderful mother like you.
With a splendid father like you.
Thank you, my darling.
Well I should say not!
You got a lot of nerve.
Did you ever kiss any other fellow?
Uh-hmm.
Did you ever kiss any other girl?
- Uh-hmm.
- No?
No.
Hey you, just what are your intentions towards my little sister?
Why, only the very best.
Well, after the scene I just witnessed, the only square thing you can do for that little girl is marry her.
Oh, mind your own business, Larry!
Go away!
- Hello, Natalie.
- Here, take these.
What's the matter, don't you trust the checkroom girl?
Come on over here., I want to speak to you.
Over there?
Oh, all right.
I know exactly what you're going to say and what you're going to say it for.
What are you always mad at me for, Natalie?
I didn't do anything, did I?
Did I?
Aw.
Natalie, don't be cross.
What's the use of living in this free and incredible era unless you're going to take advantage of it?
What's the matter with you lately?
You don't think you can have a good time unless you have a lot to drink.
You always end up by getting tight and spoiling everything.
You don't call having a couple of drinks getting tight, do you?
Yes, when you can't handle them any better than you do.
Who can't handle them?
You know, Larry, one of these days you're going to have to manage your father's store.
And how do you expect to do it when you never take yourself or anybody else seriously?
Dad isn't worrying, is he?
What are you getting burned up about?
Your father doesn't see you this way.
And besides, it makes me feel badly.
Oh, don't be pre-war, Natalie.
Let's go inside and dance, huh?
And have you step all over my feet?
No, I'm not going to dance anymore.
- Well, what are you going to do?
- I want you to take me home.
Home, why?
In the first place, I'm not having a good time.
And in the second place, you've had too much to drink.
All right, if that's the way you feel about it.
I'll take you home.
I'll take you home, but I'm coming back.
I'll come back and get me another girl.
There's a lot, I can get one of them.
Go ahead.
They're welcome to you.
All right.
Aw, Natalie, I'm not drunk, I can still stand up...
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Now you listen to me, Larry Grayson,
That's enough!
I'm going home and you're not taking me either.
What's the trouble, Larry?
You look kind of downhearted.
- I am downhearted.
- What happened?
Natalie just gave me the air.
Well, if you ask me, this party isn't any too hot.
All the girls can say is no.
I told Bob to take the girls home in my car, you'll have to drive me home, come on.
- Okay, let's go.
- Wait a minute.
I'd like to go to the Sky Rocket.
It's a great place.
I know plenty of girls there and the drinks are only 50c a throw.
What do you say?
- Okay, let's get going.
- Come on, let's go.
Beef it up!
And in conclusion, let me remind you that we have a man with us tonight to whom Ashton holds a tremendous debt.
Mr. Henry Grayson.
You have all heard the splendid speech of our new mayor, and I have only a few words to add.
In order to justify the confidence that people have in us, let us establish what I firmly believe would be a precedent.
Let us not only enforce the laws, but let us also obey them.
In other words, let us set an example.
to the city... and to our children in particular.
An example which they may be proud to follow.
Now, as you all probably know,
I have a... er... we have a son... a son of whom, I am, I think and hope, justly proud.
Pipe down, pipe down!
Doesn't New York seem friendly?
This is the clappiest place in town.
Gambling rooms upstairs and everything.
Why don't we go up and gamble?
Because it costs real money.
- Hello, Felix.
- Hello, Dick.
This is Felix Brown, he runs the place.
Felix, meet Larry Grayson.
- Not Henry Grayson's son?
- Yes, sir.
- Simply grand.
- Glad to have you here.
-Anything you want and conceive.
- Well, uh...
Ah, the giggle water.
Everything's here now.
The waiter remembers me, Felix, everything's okay.
Okay.
Hey, you know what?
He'll give this place a bad name.
What's the woman...
what's her name?
She's pretty, what is her name?
Sally Curtis.
All right, that's it.
She's... she's a gorgeous creature.
I'm gotta know her, I've gotta meet her, that's all.
I gotta do that.
I'm afraid the traffic signal's against you.
Get a load of that large gent sitting over there.
That's Sally's big thrill.
That gent is Joe Hardy.
A tough guy.
Well, he doesn't mean anything to me.
But he means a lot to a bunch of policemen.
And to Sally.
You mean they're married?
The two of them are married?
Married?
Do I have to draw you a diagram?
Well, if they're not married, then there's a chance for me.
Say, what do you think about that little so-and-so trying to break up my number?
Now wait a minute, wait a minute, take it easy.
That little so-and-so is Henry Grayson's son.
Well, what about it?
I don't know, I...
It might be smart for us to be nice to him.
I have an idea that...
I wish you'd get an idea sometime that included just me and you.
Maybe I will.
But don't wait until I'm hard of hearing, will you?
I think I'll go ask Sally for a dance.
No, you won't.
Believe me, I know when the going's good, and we're leaving.
Now listen, I'll tell you what I'm going to do...
I'm going over to apologize to the girl for the way I've acted and I'm gonna wind up by dancing with her.
- Sit down, okay?
- Can't be done, can't be done.
I tell what I'll do, Dick.
I'll bet you your check that Sally dances with me.
- The whole check?
- Check!
Check.
Check.
Not yet.
No, bring it back later and give it to him.
All I want is you make his acquaintance and be nice to him.
Here he comes now.
I'll explain later.
Pardon me.
I came over to apologize to you and tell you how sorry I am for the way I've been acting.
Oh, that's all right.
- Then you're not mad at me?
- No.
Oh...
I want you to meet Miss Diltz.
Miss Diltz, I'm awfully happy to know you.
- And Mr. Graham.
- And Mr. Graham.
- And Mr. Hardy.
- And Mr. Hardy.
This is Larry Grayson, everyone.
How did you know what my name was?
You can't have a famous father and not be known yourself.
I know who you are, too.
- Do you?
- Hm.
- Oh, may I have this dance?
- Sure.
Pardon me, Miss Diltz.
Hey, Larry, come here.
Larry, come here, will you?
Give this to that fellow over there, please.
Hey!
Your friend says to give to you this.
All right.
Will you pardon me, Dick wants to see me about something very important.
Will you pardon me, please, I gotta go... run away for a minute
Pardon me, Miss Diltz.
Mr. Graham.
Mr. Hardy.
What's the meaning... why did you send me a note like that for?
Because I haven't enough money to pay the check.
Let me have $5.
- A lot of good it was betting with you.
- I could've told you that in the first place.
Here, let me have it.
Who do you suppose is behind that Reform Party that just got in?
Henry Grayson, that's who.
You don't think that wooden-faced mayor is going to clean up this town, do you?
Henry Grayson is going to do it.
And from now on we're not going to have a minute of peace.
And if we get into a jam, we won't be able to fix it.
But, if we have Henry Grayson's son with us, we have foolproof insurance.
Now do you understand?
I doubt it.
Listen, I've had enough of this and I think you've had enough to drink.
Come on home.
Go home now...
Just when I'm... when I'm beginning to have a lot of fun you always want to go home.
What's the matter with you?
Larry, I think I ought to take you home.
Are you coming with me?
Oh...
Listen, Dick, you go on and I'll get home all by myself.
I know how to get home, I've been home before.
Now you go on and I'll see you later.
Bye.
That was Sally's last number.
I assure you this has been one swell night.
Everything has been perfect, everybody's been so happy... and smiling and...
Don't you like me?
No.
Here comes Sally.
- All set?
- Hm-hmm.
Nice party.
Well, good night.
Good night, Miss Diltz.
Mr. Graham.
Good night, Mr. Hardy.
Tired of waiting?
What's the matter?
Gee, you're beautiful.
Oh, well, you're not so hard to look at yourself.
Thanks.
Why don't you have one?
No, thanks, I've had plenty.
Besides, there's something I want to talk to you about.
Yes?
It's about Joe.
You aren't engaged to him or anything like that, are you?
Oh, of course not, silly.
What ever put that into your head?
Oh, something Dick said.
You aren't in love with him, are you?
Well, it's really none of your business, but I'll tell you.
You see, Joe's like a brother to me.
Has been for years.
He uh...
He handles all my affairs.
- Honest?
- Honest.
Aw, gee, that's great
There's a chance for me, isn't there?
You know, I'm crazy about you.
I never knew a girl could be so beautiful and... and so soft to touch.
Why, from the first minute I saw you...
I've just been crazy about you.
First I wanted to flirt with you... and kinda date with you, 'cause you were hard to get,
But now I...
I want you different.
How?
Oh, I don't know, I...
I don't know, just uh...
- I don't know.
- Gee, you're funny.
I feel funny too, you're telling me?
I feel funny like anything.
What you need is a drink, darling.
No, thanks, I...
I don't think I'd better have any more of that.
Besides, I think I'll be running along too...
Oh, don't go, it's not late.
Well, no, it isn't uh... it isn't exactly late, but I think I'd better go before it's... well, while it's still early.
I uh...
I'll run along now and uh...
Larry, why are you acting this way?
Well, I don't know...
guess I'm not myself tonight.
Well, I'll...
I'll give you a buzz.
Hello, Larry!
- Hello, Larry.
- Hello, Nat.
We've almost forgotten what you look like.
We haven't seen you in nearly a month.
Well, I've been pretty busy...
I've been spending a lot of time at the store.
I'm on my way there now.
See you later.
Larry...
I'm sorry about the way I acted that night.
- What night?
- You remember.
The night of the Beach Club dance.
You remember how mad I got and... and left you.
Oh, yes, that's right, Natalie.
I'd almost forgotten about it.
Oh, I understand, Larry.
There's another girl, isn't there?
Why no, Natalie, you're imagining things.
There must be someone.
You can't fool me, Larry.
Good-bye.
That is the list of missing articles, Mr. Grayson.
They total over $700.
There's not a doubt that but your son took them.
When I found this out I took the liberty of investigating further.
Mr. Grayson, your son is running around with Joe Hardy's girl, Sally Curtis.
The police have been watching Hardy for some time.
She's the cafe entertainer with a very bad reputation.
You don't mean to say that my boy is...
I don't know how far it's gone, but the thing I can't understand is Hardy's attitude.
He knows this Curtis dame is running around with the boy and doesn't object.
There's something wrong there, so I felt I ought to tell you about it.
Thank you.
You needn't go any further into this matter, I'll...
- I'll handle it myself.
- Very well, sir.
Good-bye, Mr. Grayson.
- Oh, pardon me.
- Perfectly all right, I'm just going.
Hello, Dad.
I had these pictures printed up and they turned out pretty good.
Why, yes...
I don't think you came here only to show me these, did you?
No, Dad, the truth is I'm broke again.
There's $2 between me and starvation.
What do you do with all your money?
I don't know, I just... it just goes, kind of melts away, I guess.
Don't you think you're rather overdoing it, Larry?
You know, $50 a week is a pretty fair allowance for a boy of your age.
Yeah, I know, Dad, but you see, I have a...
Well, a lot of things that...
Don't you want to tell me all about it, son?
Oh, it's nothing, you wouldn't understand.
Why wouldn't I understand?
I was young myself once.
You're the best ever, Dad, that's just it.
Gee... here I am tearing your place to pieces.
Better put it back together again.
You shouldn't have so many papers...
I'm sorry, Larry.
I didn't mean you to see that.
I wanted you to tell me about it yourself.
Dad, I was going to pay for them, really I was.
Then why didn't you charge them to your regular account?
- Oh, I don't know.
- I do.
I know why you didn't put them through in the regular way.
You didn't want me to know about it.
No, no, no, let me finish.
I know all about what you've been doing lately, Larry.
I know all about the people you've been running around with and...
They're not your kind, son.
They're not the right kind...
I knew you were going to say something like that.
I knew you wouldn't understand.
But I do understand.
You're the one who doesn't.
Yes, I do!
You want me to give up Sally.
But I'm not going to do it.
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
I'm not asking you to give up anything yet.
I'm merely trying to show you that these people are making a fool of you.
Joe Hardy is a notorious character.
And this girl Sally that you're so crazy about, why... why, Larry...
Larry, she's been Joe Hardy's mistress for years.
That's a lie, Dad, that's a rotten lie!
You can't talk that way about Sally.
I won't stand for it, not even from you.
I love her.
Oh, so that's it, is it?
Now I've tried to talk this over with you in a sane and sensible manner, but... you won't let me.
I have allowed you your liberty because I thought you were old enough to have it but I find you're not.
You can't handle your own affairs so I'll handle them for you.
But from now on you're going to listen to me and you're going to do as I say.
You'll get no further allowance and you'll go to work in this store like anybody else in my employ.
And you'll stop seeing that girl.
I will not have my son turned into a thief by any dotty little gold-digger.
Dad, you're going to take that back.
You're going to take that back.
Larry, you go home.
I'll finish this with you tonight.
You're going to take that back and I'm not going home until you do.
If you're not home for dinner tonight, you'll need not come home at all.
All right.
All right.
But Larry's never done this before.
He's always telephoned when he wasn't coming home.
I'm afraid there's something wrong.
Oh, I wouldn't worry, Laura, if I were you.
He'll be home all right.
Mother, you might just as well know it now.
Larry took his things and left this afternoon.
Anita!
Henry, did you know anything about this?
I... why yes, Laura, as a matter of fact I did, I...
I was going to tell you about it, only...
Oh, well...
Oh, well, you two argue it out.
I've got a heavy date.
Wait a moment, wait a moment, where are you going?
- To the Beach Club.
- No, my dear, you're not.
You've been out every night this week, Anita.
You're going to stay at home tonight for a change and go to bed.
What's the big idea?
You never bothered about me before.
That's just the point.
I'm going to bother about you now.
You've had altogether too much freedom, Anita.
Both you and Larry.
Anita, your father's right.
Oh, heck!
Did you and Larry have trouble this afternoon?
Yes, plenty of it.
That's why he's not home now.
I'm afraid you must have been too severe with him.
I'm glad you're going to take a different attitude toward the children, but... he must have been terribly upset not to come home this way...
I'm worried about him.
Oh, you needn't be, dear, you needn't be.
He'll come home, Laura, he'll come home all right.
Can you get hold of that collegiate boyfriend of yours tonight?
He's on his way up here now, why?
I need him.
- When did that come?
- This morning.
- Larry?
- Hm-hmm.
Too bad he doesn't spend his money on something we could convert into cash.
I rather like what he gives me.
Tell you the truth, it's nice to get a lot of gifts and attention.
I never knew there were so many things a man could do for a girl he cared about.
Oh, so that's the way you feel about him.
- Am I being balled out?
- Yes.
Honestly, if you only cared half as much as he does.
Well, maybe I do.
Only I don't show it, that's why you love me.
Did it ever occur to you that there's such a thing as being too repressed?
Say, you're not falling for that kid, are you, Sally?
If I were sure it would make you jealous, I'd say yes.
Sally, you didn't go too far?
I only followed instructions, boss.
Why, Joe!
Gee, that's rich.
Surely you're not jealous.
You know I couldn't do a thing like that to you, Joe.
Well, cheer up.
There's a windfall coming that'll give us a trip to Europe and buy you a couple of new fur coats.
Gee, that's good news.
What is the buried treasure?
- At the Sky Rocket.
- The Sky Rocket?
That's the place.
Now listen to me.
Every night at 1:30, when your last number goes on,
Brown goes downstairs to check up on the night's receipt.
There's no one in the office at that time.
On Saturday night, Brown carries an enormous amount of cash to handle the gambling tables.
Now, I want a clear field.
And if you make that last number the snappiest of your entire career
I can't fail.
Oh, I wish you weren't so sure of yourself.
It frightens me.
Suppose something might happen to you.
Not with me.
I'm carrying my protection right along with me.
That's why I want you to have Larry at the Sky Rocket tonight.
Larry?
Why, he wouldn't take part in any robbery.
Well, he's going to be on the outskirts of this one.
And, if anything goes wrong, well, old man Grayson wouldn't let anyone arrest his own son, and... that lets us out, too.
Well, I'm going to beat it before he gets here.
Remember, be nice to him tonight.
Then you can give him the air.
You don't suppose I've enjoyed watching him make love to you, do you?
I didn't know.
Well, now you do.
- Will I see you afterwards?
- Surest thing you know.
Right here.
Hello, Larry.
Hello, Sally.
- What was Joe doing here?
- Joe?
Yes, Joe.
I just passed him in the hall.
Every time I come up here he's either leaving or you're expecting him.
He doesn't mean anything to you, does he, Sally?
If he does, you must tell me.
Just a minute, just a minute!
What right have you to question me?
Well, you told me you didn't care anything about him.
And who told you differently?
Oh, you're not going to play the jealous sweetheart, are you?
Haven't I told you it's you I care about and nobody else?
Yeah, but sometimes I don't quite understand you.
Oh, Sally, I love you.
Your face and your hands.
I tried to forget you at first,
I fought with myself everyday not to come here but I couldn't keep away.
I couldn't work, I couldn't reason...
I couldn't think of anything but you.
Of how sweet you were when I held you in my arms...
You poor kid.
Is that all I am to you, Sally, a kid?
No... of course not.
Well, Sally... would you marry me?
Well, not now, maybe, but someday?
- Marry you?
- Oh, yes.
Oh, I'd do anything if you would, Sally.
I love you, and that would make everything all right, too.
Nobody could say anything against you then.
You're a darling, Larry.
But that's impossible,
Oh, you don't mean that, Sally.
You don't mean... you wouldn't.
I've got to think it over, Larry.
And I've got to go and get dressed now or I'll be late.
Okay.
I'll try and snap out of it and... we'll have a great time tonight.
Yes, sure.
We'll have a great time.
Henry.
I've been thinking this thing over and I can't sleep.
No matter what you say, it's too late for Larry to be out.
If you think he's at that Sky Rocket place, why don't you go and get him?
I?
I don't see why I should humiliate myself by... begging him to come home.
That's just the trouble, Henry.
It may be humiliating, but you as a father owe it to your son to see that he stays away from such places.
Laura, dear, I wish you'd let me handle Larry this time.
I know what I'm doing.
That's just plain stuborness, Henry.
I feel that we must do something.
And if you won't go and get him, I will.
- I'll bring him home myself.
- Why, Laura!
Laura, this is the first time you have ever crossed me.
If you're going to act this way about it, I think it's time I did.
Well...
Well, don't let us quarrel.
If it'll make you any happier,
I'll go.
You go to bed, sweet.
I'll bring him home, all right.
Say, Larry, while Sally's doing her last number, let's go upstairs and try our luck.
I think we can beat that blackjack game tonight.
I'd like to, Joe, but what am I going to use for money?
I'll lend you some.
The new dealer's a good friend of mine.
I don't think we can lose.
All right, I'd like a little luck for a change, let's go.
No, wait.
In a minute.
Okay.
You wait here for a minute.
I'll see if my dealer friend is on.
Fine, Joe.
Look here, Larry.
Ain't that a swell view from that window?
- Yeah.
- Glistening lights and...
Are you looking for someone, Mr. Grayson?
Yes, I er...
I'd like to see the manager at once.
Will you please wait in his office upstairs.
First door to the right.
- I'll find him for you right away.
- In there?
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
Henry Grayson is waiting in your office.
What?
Henry Grayson?
I'll be with you later.
I'm more than pleased, Mr. Grayson.
What can I do for you?
Is my son here?
I think I saw him downstairs.
Will you be good enough to tell him to come here to me at once.
Why, certainly.
I'll put this away first, if you don't mind.
It won't take me a minute.
Wait a minute, Joe.
Don't get rough with the gun play.
I won't tell.
I know you should bump me off, but I'd rather stay alive.
I'll keep my mouth shut.
You know me.
I'm not dumb.
I'm Felix Brown.
I've been in the same racket myself.
Now keep the money and run right along with it.
I won't squawk...
Wait a minute, Larry, Don't go in there, wait a minute.
What happened, Joe?
- Somebody tried to hold up Brown.
Come on, let's beat it before they blame it on us.
Who's shot?
- Who did it?
- I really don't know, I...
I was waiting to see Brown when I... when I heard the shots... and broke open the door and...
Brown's in there, maybe dead.
- Who fired?
- I don't know.
Will somebody notify the police and call a doctor, will you?
Somebody do that...
Oh, gee Dad, you gave me a scare.
Where have you been?
Oh, I've been with Dick.
He and I and a bunch went over to Cloverdale and... we got lost coming home and had to go all the way back.
Dad, I don't feel very good.
Can't we talk about this in the morning?
No, we'll talk about it now.
So you spent the evening at Cloverdale, did you?
You weren't by any chance at the Sky Rocket, were you?
At the Sky Rocket?
Why, no...
I wasn't anywhere near there.
- I've been with Dick...
- Oh, stop it!
I'll have the truth out of you this time if I have to... shake it out of you!
You were at the Sky Rocket!
I saw you there!
It was I...
It was I who broke open the door of Brown's office... as you went out of the window.
My son.
Why did you do it?
You don't think I killed him, do you?
I saw you!
I tell you, I saw you getting out of the window just after Brown was shot.
But I didn't do it.
You can ask Joe.
Joe?
Joe Hardy?
Yes.
He and I were going upstairs to gamble.
He said he had a friend of his who could... who could fix it so I could win.
He went inside to see if everything was all right and... and... and then it happened.
Joe said it was a robbery.
I was so frightened, all I could think of was... getting away.
Dad... you don't think I killed him, do you?
Why should I believe you?
You've done nothing but lie to me lately.
Why should I believe you now?
But Dad, I didn't do it.
I swear I didn't do it.
Dad, I swear it!
I hope I never see my mother again if I'm lying.
Larry, I heard your voice.
You're not scolding him, are you, Henry?
No, I'm not scolding him.
Larry and I were just having a little talk,
Don't ever stay away from home, son.
No matter what happens, you belong here.
And your father and I love you.
I know you do, Mother.
And I'm sorry I made you worry.
- Is everything all right now?
- Yes, everything's fine.
Don't stay up too late.
Come on, son.
You and I are going to straighten this thing out right now.
Other people may have seen you besides myself.
And I'm not going to let anyone fasten this murder upon you.
But Dad, what are you going to do?
Larry, you and I are going to have a little chat with Mr. Joe Hardy.
Come on, son.
The kid's just dumb enough to get picked up.
And if he does, every cop in town will know that we were with him.
Oh, we gotta do something.
Just to think you spent a week figuring this thing out.
It's a good thing you didn't work on it for a month.
Oh, I'm sick and tired of the whole mess.
You called me stupid and you wouldn't listen.
Who's stupid now?
Oh, shut up.
Well, I'm through.
And you know what you can do.
It's a good thing I'm not in on this.
Now wait a minute.
You can't walk out on me like this.
I need you.
If anything happens, you're going to swear that the kid needed money.
Say, you got into this mess without my help, now get out of it.
Use your head.
You can't quit.
You're in this just as much as I am.
You've known about it all along.
You could have prevented it if you wanted to.
How'd you like me to tell that to the judge?
Think it over.
You win, darling.
Now you're talking.
You won't be needing me now, will you, Joe?
No.
Well, I guess I'll blow.
Somebody's at the door.
Yeah.
See who it is.
Well, look who's...
Why, Mr. Grayson.
We were rather expecting you.
Larry has told me what happened at the Sky Rocket tonight.
Now I want to hear your version of it.
- My version of what?
- Quit stalling, Hardy.
You know there was a holdup at the Sky Rocket tonight.
And you know Felix Brown was murdered.
Yes, so I heard.
Poor old Felix.
- Whom do they suspect, Mr. Grayson?
- Now, listen!
You're trying to involve my son.
But that isn't going to work.
I believe you killed Felix Brown... and I'm going to make every effort to prove it.
What are you talking about?
I haven't killed anybody and I'm not trying to involve anybody.
I happened to go upstairs to play blackjack.
I saw Larry hold up Brown.
That's a lie, Dad, I didn't.
Then I heard a couple of shots, I didn't want to be involved so I ducked.
That's all I know.
He's lying, Dad, I was with Eddy, wasn't I, Eddy?
I was with Joe.
We both saw you in Brown's office.
I wasn't in Brown's office, Dad, They're both lying.
Be quiet, Larry, be quiet, I know you're innocent.
You do, do you?
Well, you might as well know the truth.
We both saw Larry kill Brown.
Dad, that isn't true, honest...
Will you be quiet, I don't believe a word of it.
He's just trying to protect himself.
He knows I'm innocent.
You'll have a hard time proving it if Eddy and I have to talk.
Now, Mr. Grayson, you're a pretty smart fellow.
And you have a lot of influence in this town.
Don't you think it would be better if this thing were sort of... hushed up?
I'm going to use my influence to see that the man who murdered Felix Brown gets hanged for it.
If you do, you'll be putting a rope around your own son's neck.
Sally, you know I didn't have anything to do with this.
Let go of me, you tin-plated little sheik.
I know you've been stealing from your father's store for weeks.
You told me this afternoon that you were broke, that you needed money.
Oh, there were plenty of reasons for you to hold up Brown... if anyone wants to look them up.
- But Sally...
- Oh, leave me alone.
Thank heavens I don't have to listen to your lovesick prattle any longer.
Sally, you don't know what you're saying.
Oh, yes I do.
And I'm willing to tell it to the judge if I have to.
Well, Grayson, how about that?
If you turn us in, you'll turn your son in too.
Think that over.
Sally will testify that he's been stealing from your store.
She'll swear that he needed money, and we'll swear that we saw him kill Brown.
Now what are you going to do?
Call the police or keep your mouth shut?
I thought so.
You don't dare call them, you dirty yellow...
Hello?
Hello...
Give me Police Headquarters.
Hello, Mr. Grayson.
Captain, I believe these people are responsible for the shooting of Felix Brown.
Oh, yeah?
Come on.
Wait a minute, you can't arrest us...
Tell that to the jury.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
And the girl.
And Captain...
Take my boy, too.
What do you mean?
Okay, Dad.
Can you proceed now, Mr. Grayson?
You see... they gave me no alternative.
I could not let my boy go free to cover up their guilt, so I had to turn him in too,
and trust that you would find him... innocent.
Oh, you must understand.
Larry is only guilty of being in bad company.
And for that, I am to blame.
None of this would have happened if I had taken the proper care of him.
You see...
I gave him too much liberty... because it was easier for me to... to have him go his own way.
The man Hardy... and the girl lured him on... thinking that I would protect them if... if they involved my boy.
Larry has been wayward, foolish, wild.
but he is not guilty of murder.
That's all.
Your witness.
No questions.
Defense rests.
Your Honor.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
Before I begin,
I wish to express that sympathy which I know you all share... for Mr. Grayson.
Everything that he has said has been inspired by one of the greatest of all emotions, the love of a father for his son.
And for that we can have only the highest respect.
But we must not let our judgment be swayed by our sympathy.
You've heard the defendant protest his innocence.
You've heard the testimony of Joe Hardy.
And you've heard that testimony corroborated by the girl Sally and Eddy Graham.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I do not contend that Larry Grayson fired the shot that killed Felix Brown, but I do contend that he and his companions went to the Sky Rocket with the deliberate intent to rob.
And in the course of that robbery, a man, defending his property, was shot down in cold blood.
And everyone involved in that robbery, is guilty of murder.
We've established by the evidence of the girl Sally that the defendant was in desperate need of funds.
And I maintain that the motive for that atrocious crime...
Order in the Court!
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
We the members of the jury find the defendant guilty of manslaughter and earnestly recommend him to the mercy of the Court.
Order in the Court.
I don't often comment on the trials over which I preside.
But this is one time I am forced to speak... as I am about to pronounce sentence.
Our prisons today are filled with children.
Boys and girls no older than Larry Grayson.
In back of most of them are parents too indulgent to give guidance and advice.
Shirking the responsibilities of parenthood, covering their negligence with a lot of theories of modern education.
Today it is Larry Grayson.
Tomorrow it may be your son.
Yours or anybody's.
You cannot give your children unlimited freedom... and turn them loose with money, without paving the way and furnishing opportunity for temptations which so easily lead to crime.
Drinking parties, bad company are the direct results of this shortsightedness of parents.
And sooner or later something must go wrong.
It is your duty to make your sons' problems your problems.
You modern parents are too apt to maintain that modern youth can take care of itself.
It cannot.
You, Mr. Grayson, have awakened to your responsibility too late.
You've admitted on the witness stand that you, and not your son, should be punished.
You pleaded that your son was guilty only of being in bad company.
The law cannot hold you responsible.
The jury has convicted your son.
But I find you, Mr. Grayson, morally guilty... for his crime.
I only hope that those who have followed this case will heed its warning.
Larry Grayson.
The jury has found you guilty of manslaughter.
It is my duty to sentence you to five years in a penitentiary.
I feel that it is also my duty,
Larry Grayson, to give you and your father another chance.
The jury has recommended you to the mercy of the Court.
And this Court paroles you... in the custody of your father for five years.
Larry, I'm so glad.

One pocketbook between them...
Always empty...
Don't keep doing that, you sound like a seal.

Stop that noise!
If the landlord finds out we've got a dog he'll throw us out.
Now: shh!

This house is under quarantine.
No one can leave here for 2 months.
2 months?
2 months.
This is more than I can stand.

What's the matter?
You're the cause of me being in this deplorable condition!
You've held me back for years and I'm sick of it!
We're packing.
Here's a letter for you.
Dear Sir:
This is to inform you that you are the sole heir to your Uncle's fortune.
Providing you several all connection with Oliver Hardy, whom your Uncle felt is responsible for your deplorable condition.
Your truly, Ritchie Ritchie
Stanley Laurel One Thousand Dollars.
- Good night!
- Good night.
What's that?
A letter.
Who is it from?
A friend.
What's it about?
It's about me.
Is it good news or bad news?
Yes and no.
What do you mean, "yes and no"?
'Tis and it isn't.
"'Tis and it isn't"?
Uh-huh and uh-uh.
Oh!
You're getting on my nerves.
Let me see that letter!
- I will not!
- Why?
- It's private.
- Oh...
Well, if you feel that way about it, that settles it.
I'm not interested in your affairs.
Far be it from me to read your private mail.
With me it's a closed book.
Finis.
Never bring up the matter again.
It's private.
Well, if it's private, it's private.
But what I can't understand is having it private!
Thank goodness it's not in my nature to hold out anything on a pal.
That's one thing they can never say about me, that I ever held anything private from a friend.
No, sirree.
Once a friend always a friend.
It's 50:50 with a Hardy.
But then...
it takes all sorts of people to make a world.
It's all right, don't worry,
I'll never complain.
If it's private, it's private.
¶ You'll be sorry just too late
¶ When our friendship turns to hate
¶ When our friendship turns to hate
¶ You'll be sorry just too late
¶ Doo-roo-ee, doo-doo to hate
¶ You'll be sorry just too late
¶ When our friendship turns to hate
¶ You'll be sorry just too late
¶ You'll be sorry just too late
¶ When our friendship turns to hate
¶ When our friendship turns to hate
¶ You'll be sorry just too late
¶ When our friendship turns to hate... ¶
What?
Me read your letter?
I should say not.
- But Ollie...
- Don't coax me.
No Hardy would ever read anyone's personal, private mail.
Absolutely not.
All right.
Give me that letter!
Oh... holding out on me, huh?
'Twas ever thus.
Oh!
So we've come into a fortune, have we?
Providing you several all connection with Oliver Hardy...
Now I know why you didn't want me to read it.
I'm sorry for everything I said.
And I thought all the time it was you holding me back.
Isn't it funny?
We never see ourselves as others see us.
Well, you better be going.
What's going to become of you?
Oh, don't worry about me, I'll be all right.
Goodbye.
Bye.
And good luck.
You're not gonna strip me of everything, are you?
It's gonna be lonesome enough without you taking the dog.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
My pal!
And to think, you're giving it all up for me.
For you?
!
I didn't want to leave Laughing Gravy.

[Bell Dings]
Hi.
Uh, I have an appointment with Emily Charlton?
- Andrea Sachs?
- Yes.
Great.
Human Resources certainly has an odd sense of humor.
Follow me.
Okay, so I was Miranda's second assistant... but her first assistant recently got promoted, and so now I'm the first.
- Oh, and you're replacing yourself.
- Well, I am trying.
Miranda sacked the last two girls after only a few weeks.
We need to find someone who can survive here.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Of course.
Who's Miranda?
Oh, my God.
I will pretend you did not just ask me that.
She's the editor in chief of Runway, not to mention a legend.
You work a year for her, and you can get a job at any magazine you want.
A million girls would kill for this job.
It sounds like a great opportunity.
I'd love to be considered.
[Giggling]
Andrea, Runway is a fashion magazine... so an interest in fashion is crucial.
What makes you think I'm not interested in fashion?
- [Cellphone Ringing]
- Oh, my God.
No!
No!
No!
What's wrong?
She's on her way.
Tell everyone!
She's not supposed to be here until 9:00.
Her driver just text messaged, and her facialist ruptured a disk.
- God, these people!
- [Whistles, Whispers] Who's that?
That I can't even talk about.
All right, everyone!
Gird your loins!
- [Excited Chattering]
- Did somebody eat an onion bagel?
[Exhales, Sniffs]
[Bell Dings]
Sorry, Miranda.
[Bell Dings]
Move it!
Ooh!
I don't understand why it's so difficult to confirm an appointment.
I know.
I'm so sorry, Miranda.
I actually did confirm last night.
Details of your incompetence do not interest me.
Tell Simone I'm not going to approve that girl that she sent me for the Brazilian layout.
I asked for clean, athletic, smiling.
She sent me dirty, tired and paunchy.
And R.S.V.P. yes to the Michael Kors party.
I want the driver to drop me off at 9:30 and pick me up at 9:45 sharp.
- [Whispers] 9:45 sharp.
- Call Natalie at Glorious Foods, tell her no for the 40th time.
No, I don't want dacquoise.
I want tortes filled with warm rhubarb compote.
Then call my ex-husband and remind him the parent-teacher conference is at Dalton tonight.
Then call my husband, ask him to meet me for dinner at that place I went to with Massimo.
Tell Richard I saw the pictures that he sent for that feature on the female paratroopers... and they're all so deeply unattractive.
Is it impossible to find a lovely, slender female paratrooper?
- No.
- Am I reaching for the stars here?
Not really.
Also, I need to see all the things that Nigel has pulled for Gwyneth's second cover try.
I wonder if she's lost any of that weight yet.
Who's that?
Nobody.
Um, uh-
Human Resources sent her up about the new assistant job, and I was preinterviewing her.
But she's hopeless and totally wrong for it.
Clearly I'm going to have to do that myself because the last two you sent me... were completely inadequate.
So send her in.
That's all.
Right.
- She wants to see you.
- Oh!
She does?
Move!
- This is foul.
Don't let her see it.
Go!
- That's-
[Sighs]
Who are you?
Uh, my name is Andy Sachs.
I recently graduated from Northwestern University.
And what are you doing here?
[Clears Throat]
Well, I think I could do a good job as your assistant.
And, um-
Yeah, I came to New York to be a journalist and sent letters out everywhere... and then finally got a call from Elias-Clarke... and met with Sherry up at Human Resources.
Basically, it's this or Auto Universe.
- So you don't read Runway?
- Uh, no.
And before today, you had never heard of me.
No.
And you have no style or sense of fashion.
Well, um, I think that depends on what you're-
No, no.
That wasn't a question.
Um, I was editor in chief of the Daily Northwestern.
I also, um, won a national competition for college journalists... with my series on the janitors' union, which exposed the exploitation-
That's all.
[Scoffs]
Yeah.
You know, okay.
You're right.
I don't fit in here.
I am not skinny or glamorous... and I don't know that much about fashion.
But I'm smart.
I learn fast and I will work very hard.
I got the exclusive on the Cavalli for Gwyneth... but the problem is, with that huge feathered headdress that she's wearing... she looks like she's working the main stage at the Golden Nugget.
Thank you for your time.
Who is that sad little person?
Are we doing a before-and-after piece I don't know about?
Brown and Law, please?
Thank you.
- Andrea.
- Hmm?
Wait.
You got a job at a fashion magazine?
- Mm-hmm.
- What was it, a phone interview?
- [Woman] Wow.
- Ow!
Don't be a jerk.
Miranda Priestly is famous for being unpredictable.
Okay, Doug.
How is it that you know who she is and I didn't?
- I'm actually a girl.
- Oh!
- That would explain so much.
- [Doug] Look, seriously.
Miranda Priestly is a huge deal.
I bet a million girls would kill for that job.
Yeah, great.
The thing is I'm not one of them.
[Woman] Look, you gotta start somewhere, right?
I mean, look at this dump Nate works in.
I mean, come on.
Paper napkins?
Hello.
Yeah.
And Lily, she works at that gallery doing, uh, you know-
Oh, I'm sorry.
What exactly is it that you do anyway?
Well, lucky for me, I already have my dream job.
[With Lily] You're a corporate research analyst!
- Oh, you're right.
My job sucks.
- No!
- It sucks.
I don't
- It's boring.
- It's all right.
Breathe.
- I'm trying.
- Here.
Take a drink.
- I will have a drink.
I will have a drink.
- Ah, yes.
- I'd like to propose a toast.
To jobs that pay the rent.
- To jobs that pay the rent.
[Lily] Jobs that pay the rent.
Oh, baby.
You should see the way these girls at Runway dress.
I don't have a thing to wear to work.
Come on.
You're gonna be answering phones and getting coffee.
You need a ball gown for that?
I think I might.
Well, I happen to think you look great always.
Aww!
I think you're full of it.
[Giggling]
- Hey.
Come on.
Let's go home.
- Yeah.
I can think of something we can do that doesn't require any clothing.
- Really?
- Mmm.
- [Phone Ringing] - ## [Woman Singing]
Hello?
Andrea, Miranda decided to kill the autumn jacket story for September... and she is pulling up the Sedona shoot from October.
You need to come into the office right this second and pick up her coffee order on the way.
- Now?
- Now, get a pen and write this down.
- Now?
- Now, get a pen and write this down.
I want one no-foam skimmed latte with an extra shot... and three drip coffees with room for milk.
- Searing hot.
And I mean hot.
- [Line Clicks]
- ## [Continues] - [Cellphone Ringing]
Hello?
- [Emily] Where are you?
- Oh, I'm almost there.
Yeah.
Shoot!
Oh!
## [Ends]
Is there some reason that my coffee isn't here?
Has she died or something?
No. [Whispers] God.
Oh.
Bloody time.
- I hope you know that this is a very difficult job-
- Mm-hmm.
for which you are totally wrong.
And if you mess up, my head is on the chopping block.
Now, hang that up.
Don't just fling it anywhere.
Okay.
First of all, you and I answer the phones.
The phone must be answered every single time it rings.
Calls roll to voice mail, and she gets very upset.
If I'm not here-Andrea, Andrea- you are chained to that desk.
- Well, what if I need to-
- What?
No.
One time an assistant left the desk because she sliced her hand open with a letter opener... and Miranda missed Lagerfeld... just before he boarded a 17-hour flight to Australia.
She now works at TVGuide.
- Man the desk at all times.
Got it.
- [Phone Rings]
- Uh-
- Miranda Priestly's office.
No, she's not available.
- Who is it?
- [Mouthing Words]
Yes, I will tell her you called... yet again.
- [Bell Chimes]
- Right.
Remember, you and I have totally different jobs.
I mean, you get coffee- [Scoffs] and you run errands.
Yet I am in charge of her schedule... her appointments and her expenses.
And, um, most importantly, um...
I get to go with her to Paris for Fashion Week in the fall.
I get to wear couture.
I go to all the shows and all the parties.
I meet all of the designers.
It's divine.
Okay.
Now, stay here.
I'm going to the art department to give them the Book.
- The-
- This is the Book.
Now, it is a mock-up of everything... in the current issue.
And we deliver it to Miranda's apartment every night, and she retu-
Don't touch it.
She returns it to us in the morning with her notes.
Now, the second assistant is supposed to do this... but Miranda is very private and she does not like strangers in her house.
So until she decides that you are not a total psycho...
I get the lovely task of waiting around for the Book.
- [Phone Rings]
- Oh, Emily?
What do I do-
- Deal with it.
- [Rings]
[Sighs]
[Rings]
Hello.
Mrs. Priestly's office.
Hmm.
That's what I meant.
Miranda Priestly's office.
[Groans]
Um, you know, she is in a meeting.
Can I please take a message?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Can you please spell Gabbana?
- [Line Clicks, Dial Tone Hums]
- Hello?
I guess not.
I guessed an eight and a half.
Um, uh, that's very nice of you... but I don't think I need these.
Miranda hired me.
She knows what I look like.
- Do you?
- [Chuckles]
Emily.
Emily?
She means you.
- We just cut on the bias.
- [Miranda] That's not what I asked you.
I couldn't have been clearer.
There you are, Emily.
- How many times do I have to scream your name?
- Actually, it's Andy.
My name is Andy.
Andrea, but, uh, everybody calls me Andy.
[Chuckles] I need 10 or 15 skirts from Calvin Klein.
- What kind of skirts do you-
- Please bore someone else with your questions.
And make sure we have Pier 59 at 8:00 A.M. tomorrow.
Remind Jocelyn I need to see a few of those satchels that Marc is doing in the pony.
And then tell Simone I'll take Jackie if Maggie isn't available.
- Did Demarchelier confirm?
- D-Did D-Demarchel-
Demarchelier.
Did he
- Get him on the phone.
Uh, o- okay.
- And, Emily?
- Yes?
That's all.
It's just the cavalier disregard for clear directions-
[Chattering Continues]
Do you have Demarchelier?
Uh, Demarchelier.
- [Groans] Leave it.
- Do you have-
I have Miranda Priestly calling.
I have Patrick!
Uh, no, she called me in there and-and then she asked me about Pier 59.
And there was something about Simone, Frankie, someone else.
And, um, she needs skirts from Calvin Klein.
And, uh, there was something about a pony.
- Did she say which skirts?
- No.
No.
- Did she say what kind?
Color, shape, fabric?
- I tried to ask her.
You may never ask Miranda anything.
Right.
I will deal with all of this, and you will go to Calvin Klein.
Eh
- Me?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you have some prior commitment?
Some hideous skirt convention you have to go to?
Uh-
- [Cellphone Rings]
- Miranda?
- Are you there?
- I'm about to walk in.
I'll call you as soon as-
[Line Clicks]
- [Cellphone Rings] - [Horn Honks]
- Hello?
Hi.
- [Emily] While you're out...
Miranda needs you to go to Hermès to pick up 25 scarves we ordered for her.
- Okay.
- Cassidy forgot her homework at Dalton.
Pick that up.
Miranda went out to meet with Meisel, and she will want more Starbucks when she gets back.
- Hot Starbucks.
- Can you just repeat that first [Dial Tone Hums]
- Hello?
Oh, my God.
What took you so long?
I have to pee!
What?
You haven't peed since I left?
No, I haven't.
I've been manning the desk, haven't I?
I'm bursting.
Oh, hi.
- [Snaps Fingers]
- You do coat.
Do the coat!
Okay.
Now, be prepared.
The run-through is at 12:30.
People are panicking, so the phone is going to be ringing off the hook.
The ru-The run-through.
Right.
Yes.
Editors bring in options for the shoot, and Miranda chooses.
She chooses every single thing in every single issue.
Run-throughs are a huge deal.
I don't know why you don't know that, Andrea.
- [Woman] Okay.
Are you ready?
- [Emily] Oh, hi, hi.
Right.
Well, after the loo, Serena and I are going to lunch.
- This is her- the new me.
- Hi.
- Told you.
- I thought you were kidding.
No, quite serious, yeah.
I get 20 minutes for lunch, and you get 15.
- When I come back, you can go.
- Okay.
[Serena] What exactly is she wearing?
[Giggling] Her grandmother's skirt.
## [Man Singing In French]
Hmm.
Corn chowder.
That's an interesting choice.
You do know that cellulite is one of the main ingredients in corn chowder.
## [Man Singing In French Continues]
So none of the girls here eat anything?
Not since two became the new four and zero became the new two.
- Well, I'm a six.
- Which is the new 14.
Oh.
Shoot.
Oh, never mind.
I'm sure you have plenty more polyblend where that came from.
- [Cash Register Clicking]
- Okay.
You think my clothes are hideous.
I get it.
But, you know, I'm not going to be in fashion forever... so I don't see the point of changing everything about myself just because I have this job.
Yes, that's true.
That's really what this multibillion-dollar industry is all about anyway, isn't it?
- Inner beauty.
- [Cellphone Rings]
Hello.
Right.
Come on.
- Miranda's pushed the run-through up a half an hour.
- Mmm!
- She's always 15 minutes early.
- Which means?
- You're already late.
Come.
- Shoot!
Excuse me.
- [Bell Dings]
- Mr. Ravitz.
Nigel.
- Issue going well?
- Oh, yes.
Our best September ever.
Great.
Heard Miranda killed autumn jackets and pulled up the Sedona shoot.
What's that costing me?
About 300,000.
Must have been some lousy jackets.
- Irv Ravitz.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
This is Andy Sachs, Miranda's new assistant.
Congratulations, young lady.
A million girls would kill for that job.
Bye-bye.
- Hmm?
- Chairman of Elias-Clarke, Irv Ravitz.
You know what they say?
Tiny man, huge ego.
No.
And I've seen all this before.
Theyskens is trying to reinvent the drop waist, so actually it's-
- Where are all the other dresses?
- We have some right here.
- Stand, watch and listen.
- And I think it can be very interesting-
No.
No, I just- It's just baffling to me.
Why is it so impossible to put together a decent run-through?
You people have had hours and hours to prepare.
It's just so confusing to me.
Where are the advertisers?
- We have some pieces from Banana Republic.
- We need more, don't we?
- Oh.
This is-This might be- What do you think of-
- Yeah.
Well, you know me.
Give me a full ballerina skirt and a hint of saloon and I'm on board.
- But do you think it's too much like-
- Like the Lacroix from July?
I thought that, but no, not with the right accessories.
It should work.
Where are the belts for this dre- Why is no one ready?
Here.
It's a tough call.
- They're so different.
- [Miranda] Hmm.
[Snorts, Chuckles]
Something funny?
No.
No, no.
Nothing's-
You know, it's just that both those belts look exactly the same to me.
You know, I'm still learning about this stuff and, uh-
"This... stuff"?
Oh.
Okay.
I see.
You think this has nothing to do with you.
You go to your closet... and you select
- I don't know- that lumpy blue sweater, for instance... because you're trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously... to care about what you put on your back.
But what you don't know is that that sweater is not just blue.
It's not turquoise.
It's not lapis.
It's actually cerulean.
And you're also blithely unaware of the fact... that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns.
And then I think it was Yves Saint Laurent- wasn't it- who showed cerulean military jackets?
- I think we need a jacket here.
- Mmm.
And then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers.
And then it, uh, filtered down through the department stores... and then trickled on down into some tragic Casual Corner... and then trickled on down into some tragic Casual Corner... where you, no doubt, fished it out of some clearance bin.
However, that blue represents millions of dollars... and countless jobs... and it's sort of comical how you think that you've made a choice... that exempts you from the fashion industry... when, in fact... you're wearing a sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room... from a pile of stuff.
So then I said, "No, I couldn't see the difference... between the two absolutely identical belts"... and you should have seen the look she gave me!
I thought the flesh was gonna melt off her face.
- [Chuckles]
- It's not funny.
She's not happy unless everyone around her is panicked, nauseous or suicidal.
And the Clackers just worship her.
- The who?
- They call them Clackers.
The sound that their stilettos make in the marble lobby.
It's like, "Clack, clack, clack. clack, clack."
[Groans] And they all act like they're curing cancer or something.
[Chuckling] The amount of time and energy... that these people spend on these insignificant, minute details, and for what?
So that tomorrow they can spend another $300,000 reshooting something... that was probably fine to begin with... to sell people things they don't need!
God!
- I'm not even hungry anymore.
- What?
- That is why those girls are so skinny.
- Oh.
No, no, no.
Give me that.
There's, like, eight dollars of Jarlsberg in there.
[Sighs] You know what?
I just have to stick it out for a year.
One year.
And then I can do what I came to New York to do.
But I can't let Miranda get to me.
I won't.
Easy there, tiger.
- Oh, good morning, Miranda.
- Get me Isaac.
I don't see my breakfast here.
Are my eggs here?
Where are my eggs?
Excuse me!
Pick up the Polaroids from the lingerie shoot.
Have the brakes checked on my car.
- [Truck Horn Honking] - [Gasps]
Where's that piece of paper I had in my hand yesterday morning?
The girls need new surfboards or boogie boards or something for spring break.
- Hello.
- The twins also need flip-flops.
- Ow!
- Oh, my gosh!
Pick up my shoes from Blahnik, and then go get Patricia.
- Who's that?
- Good girl!
Good girl!
Good girl!
Get me that little table that I liked at that store on Madison.
Get us a reservation for dinner tonight at that place that got the good review.
- Get me Isaac.
- Thirty-six thank-you notes delivered today.
- Where is everyone?
- Why is no one working?
[Miranda's Voice Overlapping]
Get me Demarchelier.
I have Miranda Priestly calling for- Okay.
I have Patrick.
[Sighs] Thank God it's Friday, right?
At least Miranda will be in Miami, so we don't have to be on call this weekend.
You know, my dad's coming in from Ohio.
Yeah, we're gonna go out to dinner, maybe see Chicago.
You doing anything fun this weekend?
Yes.
## [Piano]
[Andy] Yeah, Nate said it was great.
He actually
- He applied here, but they wanted someone with more experience.
- Here.
- Huh?
What's this?
I don't want you to get behind on your rent.
- Dad, how did you-
- It's-
I'm gonna kill Mom.
[Chuckles]
Dad, thank you.
Mm-hmm.
- It's really good to see you.
- You too, honey.
So, you want to start grilling me now... or should we wait till after dinner?
I thought I'd let you at least enjoy the bread basket first.
No, no, no.
It's okay.
Go right ahead.
We're just a little worried, honey.
We get e-mails from you at your office at 2:00 A.M.
Your pay is terrible.
You don't get to write anything.
Hey, that's not fair.
I wrote those e-mails.
I'm just trying to understand why someone who got accepted to Stanford Law... turns it down to be a journalist, and now you're not even doing that.
Dad, you have to trust me.
Being Miranda's assistant opens a lot of doors.
Emily is going to Paris with Miranda in a few months... and she's gonna meet editors and writers from every important magazine.
And in a year, that could be me.
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.
Dad, I swear, this is my break.
- This is my- my chance.
- [Cellphone Ringing]
This is my boss.
- I'm sorry, Dad.
I have to take this.
- Take it.
Take it.
- Hello.
Miranda?
- My flight has been canceled.
It's some absurd weather problem.
I need to get home tonight.
The twins have a recital tomorrow morning at school.
- What?
- At school!
- Absolutely.
Let me see what I can do.
- Good.
Hi.
Um, I know this is totally last minute... but I was hoping that you could maybe get a flight for my boss... from Miami to New York tonight?
Uh [Dad] It's right here.
Thank you.
- [Andy] Yeah, any kind of jet.
- From Miami to New York.
- Thank you.
- Yup, I need it tonight.
I need it-
- Ow!
- I thought you were going out the other-
- Sweetie!
No.
- It's over here, honey.
- Tonight.
Hi.
I'm trying to get a flight tonight- for tonight- from Miami to New York.
Yes, I know there's a hurricane.
Nothing is flying out?
What do you mean, nothing is flying out?
It's for Miranda Priestly, and I know that she's a client of yours.
Yes.
Yes, hi.
I need a jet tonight from Miami to New York.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Hold on.
Hello?
Miranda, hi.
I'm trying to get you a flight, but no one is flying out because of the weather.
Please.
It's just- I don't know- drizzling.
- [Thunderclap]
- Someone must be getting out.
Call Donatella.
Get her jet.
Call everybody else that we know that has a jet.
Irv?
Call every
- This is your responsibi- This is your job.
Get me home.
Oh, my God!
She's going to murder me.
What does she want you to do, call the National Guard and have her airlifted out of there?
Of course not.
Could I do that?
Come on.
Come on.
The girls' recital was absolutely wonderful.
They played Rachmaninoff.
Everyone loved it.
Everyone except me... because, sadly, I was not there.
Miranda, I'm so sorry.
Do you know why I hired you?
I always hire the same girl- stylish, slender, of course... worships the magazine.
But so often, they turn out to be-
I don't know- disappointing and, um... stupid.
So you, with that impressive résumé... and the big speech about your so-called work ethic-
I, um
- I thought you would be different.
I said to myself, go ahead.
Take a chance.
Hire the smart, fat girl.
[Clears Throat] I had hope.
My God.
I live on it.
Anyway, you ended up disappointing me more than, um- more than any of the other silly girls.
Um, I really did everything I could think of.
- Uh-
- That's all.
Excuse me!
Where do you think you're going?
She hates me, Nigel.
And that's my problem because-
Oh, wait.
No, it's not my problem.
I don't know what else I can do because if I do something right, it's unacknowledged.
She doesn't even say thank you.
But if I do something wrong, she is vicious.
- So quit.
- What?
- Quit.
- Quit?
I can get another girl to take your job in five minutes- one who really wants it.
No, I don't want to quit.
That's not fair.
But, you know, I'm just saying that I would just like a little credit... for the fact that I'm killing myself trying.
Andy, be serious.
You are not trying.
- You are whining.
- I-
What is it that you want me to say to you, huh?
Do you want me to say, "Poor you.
Miranda's picking on you.
Poor you.
Poor Andy"?
Hmm?
Wake up, six.
She's just doing her job.
Don't you know that you are working at the place... that published some of the greatest artists of the century?
Halston, Lagerfeld, de la Renta.
And what they did, what they created... was greater than art because you live your life in it.
Well, not you, obviously, but some people.
You think this is just a magazine, hmm?
This is not just a magazine.
This is a shining beacon of hope for- oh, I don't know- let's say a young boy growing up in Rhode Island with six brothers... pretending to go to soccer practice when he was really going to sewing class... and reading Runway under the covers at night with a flashlight.
You have no idea how many legends have walked these halls.
And what's worse, you don't care.
Because this place, where so many people would die to work... you only deign to work.
And you want to know why she doesn't kiss you on the forehead... and give you a gold star on your homework at the end of the day.
Wake up, sweetheart.
[Sighs]
- Okay.
So I'm screwing it up.
- Mmm.
I don't want to.
I just wish that I knew what I could do to-
- [Sighs] Nigel?
- Hmm?
Nigel, Nigel.
No.
I don't know what you expect me to do.
There's nothing in this whole closet that'll fit a size six.
I can guarantee you.
These are all sample sizes- two and four.
- All right.
We're doing this for you.
And-
- A poncho?
You'll take what I give you and you'll like it.
- We're doing this Dolce for you.
- Hmm!
And shoes.
- Jimmy Choo's.
- Hmm.
- Manolo Blahnik.
- Wow.
Nancy Gonzalez.
Love that.
Okay, Narciso Rodriguez.
This we love.
- Uh, it might fit.
It might.
- What?
Okay.
Now, Chanel.
You're in desperate need of Chanel.
Darling, shall we?
We have to get to the beauty department, and God knows how long that's going to take.
[Groans]
I mean, I have no idea why Miranda hired her.
Me neither.
The other day, we were in the beauty department.
She held up the Shu Uemura eyelash curler and said, "What is this?"
[Laughing]
I just knew from the moment I saw her... she was going to be a complete and utter disas-
- [Phone Rings]
- Miranda Priestly's office.
No, actually, she's not available, but I'll leave word.
Okay, thanks.
Bye.
[Clears Throat]
How did- [Grunts]
- Are you wearing the-
- The Chanel boots?
Yeah, I am.
You look good.
- Oh, God.
- What?
- She does.
- Oh, shut up, Serena.
- See you guys tomorrow.
- Good night, man.
Take it easy.
Take care of that finger, huh?
So, what do you think?
Uh, I think we better get out of here... before my girlfriend sees me.

- The gowns are fabulous.
Mm-hmm.
We're gonna use the burgundy.
- Gotta find- - ## [Ends]
So we spent a whole semester on potatoes alone.
You take the fry and squeeze it.
- See how firm that is?
- Hey.
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.
There was a crisis in the accessories department.
- I needed to find a python headband.
- Python's hot right now.
I have exciting presents for all of you.
Are you ready?
- What is that?
- It's a Bang Olufsen phone.
Charlie Rose sent it to Miranda for her birthday.
I looked it up on line.
It's $1,100.
- What?
- Wow!
And I have some products.
Mason Pearson hairbrushes.
- A little Clinique.
- Ooh!
- Oh, damn it.
I love your job.
- Oh!
One more.
- A little thing.
- [Gasps]
- Do you want it?
You want
- Oh.
- Gimme!
Gimme, gimme, gimme!
- I think she likes it.
- Oh, my God!
This is the new Marc Jacobs!
This is sold out everywhere.
Where did you get this?
Miranda didn't want it, so-
No, no, no, no, no.
This bag is, like, $1,900.
I cannot take this from you.
- [Cackles]
- Yeah, you can.
- Why do women need so many bags?
- Shut up.
You have one.
You put all your junk in it, and that's it.
You're done.
Fashion is not about utility.
An accessory is merely a piece of iconography... used to express individual identity.
- Oh!
And it's pretty.
- That too.
Yeah.
But the thing is, it turns out there is more to Runway than just fancy purses.
Look, here's an essay by Jay McInerney, a piece by Joan Didion.
Even an interview with Christiane Amanpour.
- Looks like someone's been drinking the Kool-Aid.
- What do you [Cellphone Ringing]
- I got it.
It's-Yup, the Dragon Lady.
- Oh, Miranda?
- Let me talk to her.
- I need that.
- I'll tell her to get her own scrambled eggs.
Lily, no, no, no!
Put that thing up!
I was gonna answer it!
It's gonna make- Give me the... phone.
[Beeps]
- [Sputters]
- Hi, Miranda.
- Ooh.
Shh.
- Absolutely.
- Shh!
- Uh-huh.
I'm leaving right now.
You know, you guys didn't have to be such assholes.
[Rings]
## [Electronica]
## [Woman Singing]
Um, excuse me.
I'm looking for James Holt.
Um, that's him right there.
- Oh.
Thanks.
- No problem.
- I put my stuff out there, and I pray they improve.
- Really?
- Excuse me.
- Hi.
I'm Andy.
I'm picking up for Miranda Priestly.
Oh, yes.
You must be the new Emily.
- [Chuckling]
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, let me see that bag.
Very, very nice.
- Ah.
Distressed, studded leather, pieced by hand, finished with a metallic fringe.
[Clicks Tongue] Very nice, indeed.
Who made that fantastic thing?
You.
Hmm.
Duh.
This way.
Uh, here we go.
It's a sketch of Miranda's dress for the benefit.
Also the centerpiece of my spring collection.
Top secret stuff.
- I'll guard it with my life.
- Please do.
Come on.
You're working for Miranda Priestly now.
You must be in desperate need of hard liquor.
Excuse us, girls.
She'll have the punch.
[Clears Throat]
It's deadly.
Have fun.
## [Man Singing]
- He's right, you know.
- Hmm?
The punch.
I drank it at James' last party.
I woke up in Hoboken wearing nothing but a poncho and a cowboy hat.
- ## [Continues]
- Ah.
Well.
- Wise.
- [Chuckling]
- Uh, hi.
- Christian Thompson.
Christian Thompson?
You're kidding.
No, you're-You write for, like, every magazine I love.
I actually
- I reviewed your collection of essays for my college newspaper.
Did you mention my good looks and my killer charm?
- No, but-
- What do you do?
Oh.
Well, I want to work for somewhere like The New Yorker or Vanity Fair.
- I am a writer too.
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.
- I should read your stuff.
Why don't you send it over?
Yeah?
That would be-Thank you.
That would be great. [Giggling]
But actually, right now, I'm working as Miranda Priestly's assistant.
Oh, you're kidding.
Well, that's too bad.
That's-Whoa.
You'll never survive Miranda.
- Excuse me?
- Well, you seem nice, smart.
You can't do that job.
Gotta go.
Okay.
Well, it was very, very nice to meet you, Miranda girl.
Emily?
Call James Holt's office.
Tell them I want to move the preview up to today at 12:30.
Tell everybody else.
Be ready to leave in half an hour.
But we're not expected until Tuesday.
Did she say why?
Yes.
Yeah, she explained every detail of her decision making.
And then we brushed each other's hair and gabbed about American Idol.
I see your point.
- [Andy] What's a preview anyway?
- Good morning, Miranda.
[Nigel] Miranda insists upon seeing all the designers' collections... before they show them.
- Great to see you.
- Hello, James.
- [Andy] And she tells them what she thinks?
- [Nigel] In her way.
Uh, this season really began for me with a meditation... on the intersection between East and West.
[Nigel] There's a scale.
One nod is good.
Two nods is very good.
There's only been one actual smile on record, and that was Tom Ford in 2001.
An obi belt.
[Nigel] She doesn't like it, she shakes her head.
This is the dress that we have designed specifically and exclusively for you.
[Nigel] Then, of course, there's the pursing of the lips.
[Andy] Which means?
[Nigel] Catastrophe.
[Whispers] Just, uh-Just go.
- I just don't understand.
I'm appalled.
- It's absurd.
Appalled.
- You deal with it.
- I'll talk to him.
So because she pursed her lips, he's gonna change his entire collection?
You still don't get it, do you?
Her opinion is the only one that matters.
- Call my husband and confirm dinner.
- At Pastis?
Done.
And I'll need a change of clothes.
Well, I've already messengered your outfit over to the shoot.
Fine.
And, Andrea, I would like you to deliver the Book to my home tonight.
- Have Emily give you the key.
- Mm-hmm.
- Guard this with your life.
- Of course.
You know, if I can deliver the Book, that means I must have done something right.
I'm not a psycho.
Oh, and, you know, she called me Andrea?
I mean, she didn't call me Emily, which is
- Isn't that great?
Yeah, whoopee.
Right.
Now, it's very important that you do exactly what I'm about to tell you.
Oh.
Okay.
[Emily] The Book is assembled by 10:00, 10:30... and you must wait around for it until then.
You will be delivering Miranda's dry cleaning with the Book.
Now, the car will take you straight to Miranda's townhouse.
You let yourself in.
Andrea.
You do not talk to anyone.
Do not look at anyone.
This is of the utmost importance.
You must be invisible.
- Do you understand?
- Uh-huh.
You open the door and you walk across the foyer.
You hang the dry cleaning in the closet across from the staircase.
- Uh-
- And you leave the Book on the table with the flowers.
[Panting]
- Shit!
- [Girl] It's that door to the left.
Okay.
[Whispers] Thank you.
- You can give the Book to us.
- Shh.
Which-Which table?
- It's okay.
Come on up.
- No, I can't.
I can't.
- What?
It's okay.
- Come on.
- Yeah, come on.
It's okay.
- Please stop talking.
Or you can bring the Book upstairs.
Emily does it all the time.
She does?
Right.
She does, all the time.
Yeah?
Okay.
[Giggling]
[Miranda] What did you expect me to do, walk out in the middle of a cover shoot?
[Man] I rushed out of an investment committee meeting... and I sat there waiting for you for almost an hour.
I told you the cellphones didn't work.
Nobody could get a signal out.
[Man] I knew what everyone in that restaurant was thinking- there he is, waiting for her again.
- Okay, okay!
Okay, okay.
- Oh, no.
Shh!
It really wasn't that big a deal.
I promise.
The twins said hello, so I said hello back.
- Then I went up the stairs to give her the Book and-
- You went upstairs?
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you just climb into bed with her and ask for a bedtime story?
Okay, I made a mistake.
I know.
Andrea, you don't understand.
If you get fired, that might jeopardize Paris for me.
If that happens, I will search every Blimpie's in the tristate area until I track you down.
She's gonna fire me?
I don't know.
She's not happy.
[Miranda] Andrea?
[Snaps Fingers]
Miranda, about last night, I-
I need the new Harry Potter book for the twins.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll go down to Barnes Noble right now.
Did you fall down and smack your little head on the pavement?
Not that I can recall.
We have all the published Harry Potter books.
The twins want to know what happens next.
You want the unpublished manuscript?
We know everyone in publishing.
It shouldn't be a problem, should it?
And you can do anything, right?
[Cellphone Rings]
Yes, Bobbsey.
I know, baby.
Mommy's working very hard to get it for you.
She doesn't get it.
I could call frickin' J.K. Rowling herself.
I'm not gonna get a copy of that book.
My girls are leaving on the train for their grandmother's at 4:00... so the book better be here no later than 3:00.
- Of course!
- And I would like my steak here in 15 minutes.
No problem!
[Panting]
Okay.
I have four hours to get the impossible manuscript.
Smith Wollensky's doesn't open until 11:30.
How am I gonna get the steak?
Okay.
I will be back in 15 minutes.
- Wish me luck!
- No.
Shan't.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
I've been on hold.
It's for Miranda Priestly.
It's very important.
Yes, I know it's impossible to get... but, well, I was wondering if you could make the impossible possible... if that's at all possible.
[Laughing]
Yes, I'm calling about the Harry Potter manuscript.
Uh, no.
Unpublished.
Not a chance?
Tell her that it's for Miranda Priestly.
'Cause I think it makes a difference.
Let me call you back.
You probably don't remember me.
We met at James Holt's party.
I'm Miranda Priestly's assistant.
The Harry Potter manuscript?
Oh, you're kidding.
Uh, sorry to ask, but I'm desperate.
Just tell her it can't be done.
You'll have to come up with a Plan "B."
Well, this is Miranda Priestly we're talking about.
There is no Plan "B." There's only Plan "A."
Is she back?
Am I fired?
I rarely say this to people who aren't me... but you have got to calm down.
Bloody hell!
Coat, bag.
What's that?
Oh, I don't want that.
I'm having lunch with Irv.
I'll be back at 3:00.
I'd like my Starbucks waiting.
Oh, and if you don't have that Harry Potter book by then... don't even bother coming back.
[Phone Rings]
Hello.
Quit?
Are you sure?
I failed.
She's gonna fire me anyway.
- I might as well beat her to the punch.
- Wow.
Andy, good for you.
Congratulations.
You're free.
- Yeah.
Well, listen, I'll call you later.
- Okay.
- [Line Clicks, Phone Rings]
- Hello.
I'm brilliant.
No, really.
- Monuments should be erected in my honor.
- You didn't.
Oh, yes.
A friend of a friend does the cover art... and she happens to have the manuscript.
Oh, no, 'cause that would mean that I actually did something right.
[Chuckles] It's just
- Oh!
The thing is, Christian, I was just-
Look, you want this thing, you better hurry.
I'll meet you at the St. Regis.
- Excuse me.
- [Horn Honks]
- Welcome to the St. Regis.
May I assist you with anything?
- Oh.
Yes.
- Uh, I'm meeting someone at the King Cole Bar.
- Right this way.
Hi.
- You have one hour.
- Thank you.
One copy.
What are my twins gonna do with that?
Share?
Oh, no, I made two copies... and had them covered, reset and bound so that they wouldn't look like manuscripts.
This is an extra copy to have on file.
You know, just in case.
Well, where are these fabulous copies?
I don't see them anywhere.
[Whistle Blows]
[Andy] They're with the twins, on the train on the way to Grandma's.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Mm-mmm.
That's all.
Okay.
[Door Opens]
- Hey.
- Hey.
I went to Dean Deluca.
Man, they charge, like, five dollars a strawberry there.
But I figure since you quit your job... we should celebrate.
- Listen, Nate.
- Wait a minute.
You quit your job, but you're still working on the twins' science project?
Well, that's big of you.
Okay, after we talked, I realized... it doesn't make sense throwing away all those months of hard work.
I just had a moment of weakness, that's all.
Yeah, well, either that, or your job sucks and your boss is a wacko.
All right.
Whatever.
It's your job.
Nate.
Come on.
I'm still the same person I was.
I still want the same things.
Okay?
- Mm-hmm.
- I promise.
Same Andy, better clothes.
- [Giggles]
- I like the old clothes.
Really?
Well, what about these necklaces?
Do you like them?
No?
And this dress, it's new.
Eh.
Well, there is one other thing that's new... that I thought you might like.
But, uh-What about this?
You don't like it.
I should better do-
No, no, no, no.
## [Woman Singing]
## [Ends]
Is this number two look?
This is number two?
- Hi.
- Hi.
All right.
Turn around for me, darling.
Oh, I get it.
I get it.
I get it.
The piece is called "urban jungle," right?
Yes, the modern woman unleashes the animal within to take on the big city.
[Growls] Good.
Go.
[Sighs] Sometimes I can't believe I talk about this crap all day.
- Bobby, come here.
Let me see.
- Oh, thank you.
- Make sure Miranda gets these as soon as possible.
- Mm-hmm.
And tell her I switched in the Dior for the Rocha.
- Oh, great.
Can't wait.
- Excuse me.
- Can we adjust the attitude?
- I'm sorry.
- Don't make me feed you to one of the models.
- I'm sorry.
It's a busy day.
My personal life is hanging by a thread, that's all.
Join the club.
That's what happens when you start doing well at work, darling.
Let me know when your whole life goes up in smoke.
That means it's time for a promotion.
No.
All right, February, back of the issue.
Did anybody speak with Salma's people yet?
Yes, but she'd rather do a summer cover because she has a movie coming out.
No.
Also, I'm pulling the Toobin piece on the Supreme Court women- woman.
And I need to see a new draft on that piece... about shopping for a plastic surgeon- It's dull.
And this layout for the Winter Wonderland spread.
Not wonderful yet.
Oh, okay.
I-I'll look at it.
What about Testino?
Where are we on that?
Zac Posen's doing some very sculptural suits.
So I suggested that, uh, Testino shoot them at the Noguchi Garden.
Perfect.
Thank God somebody came to work today.
What about accessories for April?
One thought I had was enamel.
Um, bangles, pendants, earrings.
No.
We did that two years ago.
What else?
Um, well, they're showing a lot of florals right now, so I was thinking-
Florals?
For spring?
Groundbreaking.
But we thought about shooting them in an industrial space.
We thought the contrast between the femininity of the florals... and the more raw, rough-hewn background would create this wonderful tension between-
- No.
- Which?
- No.
- Which?
- [Emily Coughing]
- No.
[Coughing Continues]
Does anybody else have anything I can possibly use?
Antibacterial wipes perhaps?
[Groans]
- How's the cold doing?
- Like death warmed up actually.
[Sniffles] Oh, God.
It's the benefit tonight.
I've been looking forward to it for months.
I refuse to be sick.
I'm wearing Valentino, for crying out loud.
Right.
Well, everybody will be leaving soon to get ready... so I suggest you go and drop Miranda's Fendi bag off at the showroom... and then I suppose you can just go home.
Yeah?
Oh, well, that is great.
Perfect actually.
I need to get to Magnolia Bakery before it closes.
It's Nate's birthday tonight.
So we're, uh, having a little party for him.
Yeah, I'm hearing this, and I wanna hear this.
Bye.
I love my job.
I love my job.
I love my job.
[Chattering]
[Cellphone Rings]
Hello?
Before the benefit tonight, I need to make sure... that you're both fully prepped on the guest list.
But I thought that only the first assistant went to the benefit.
Only when the first assistant hasn't decided to become... an incubus of viral plague.
You'll come and help Emily.
- That's all.
- Right.
These are all of the guests.
Miranda invites everyone.
We have to make sure that they all think she knows exactly who they are.
And I've been studying for weeks.
I have to learn all these by tonight?
No, don't be silly, Andrea.
These too.
Look, you better just start without me, okay?
I'll get there as soon as I can.
Andy, come on, it's his birth-
Okay, but hurry.
Oh, please, believe me, I will.
This is the last thing that I wanna-
Ooh, I love that.
Uh, I'll call you the second I'm leaving, okay?
- Will that fit me?
- Oh, yeah.
A little Crisco and some fishing line, and we're in business.
[Sarcastic Chuckle]
## [Woman Singing]
Well, nothing really.
I mean, this is-
I mean, really, this is the social event of the season.
## [Continues]
Oh, oh, my God.
Andy, you look so chic.
Oh, thanks, Em.
You look so thin.
- Do I?
- Yeah.
Oh, it's for Paris.
I'm on this new diet.
It's very effective.
Well, I don't eat anything.
And then when I feel like I'm about to faint, I eat a cube of cheese.
- Well, it's definitely working.
- I know.
I'm just one stomach flu away from my goal weight.
## [Man Singing]
## [Ends]
That's John Folger, the new artistic director of the Chelsea Rep.
- John, thanks for coming.
- Hey there.
- [John] Oh, thank you.
It's always nice seeing you.
- Stop fidgeting.
I'm sorry.
I'm so late.
Just deal with it.
You have to be here.
Emily, come here.
Isn't that Jacqueline Follet from French Runway?
Oh, my God, and Miranda hates her.
She was supposed to arrive after Miranda left.
- I didn't
- Oh.
- Yeah.
- Miranda, fabulous event as always.
- You brought Jacqueline.
- Surprise.
- Quelle surprise.
Oh, wonderful.
We're so happy you were able to come to our little gathering.
Of course.
I plan my whole year around this.
Well, we're so grateful that you do.
- Ciao.
- Have you gotten my note?
Yes, I did.
We'll discuss it on Wednesday.
- Yes, I agree.
No business tonight.
- Not tonight.
- Enjoy.
- [Sniffles]
Em.
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.
Oh, um
- Oh, my God.
I just can't remember what his name is.
I just saw his name this morning on the list.
It's
- Oh, I know this.
It's something to do with-
Wait, he was- he was part of the- Oh, God, I know this.
Um-
It's Ambassador Franklin, and that's the woman that he left his wife for, Rebecca.
- Rebecca.
Ambassador.
- Miranda.
- You look fabulous.
- Oh, very kind.
- Thank you.
- [Chattering Continues]
- Look at you.
- Hello.
You're-You're a vision.
- Oh. [Scoffs]
- Thank God I saved your job.
[Stammers, Chuckles] You know, I figured out a few things on my own too.
Turns out, I'm not as nice as you thought.
I hope not.
Well, if it weren't for the stupid boyfriend...
I'd have to whisk you away right here and now.
- Do you actually say things like that to people?
- Evidently.
[Giggles] Well, I gotta go.
Are you sure?
'Cause my editor for New York Magazine is inside... and, you know, I could introduce you two.
- You sent over your stuff for me to look at?
Remember?
- Yeah.
All right, I gotta admit, I only read a couple.
It was a very large packet you sent.
- Yeah.
- But what I did read wasn't half bad.
And, you know, I think- I think you have a talent, Andy.
He should meet you.
Why don't you come in?
Just for one drink.
Um, okay, yeah.
I guess I could for one-
No, I can't.
I'm sorry, but I have to go.
All right.
Give my best to the boyfriend.
Roy, I'm sorry.
Can you go any faster?
I'm sure Nate will understand.
Yeah.
[TV, Indistinct]
Hey.
Happy birthday.
Nate, I'm so sorry.
I kept trying to leave, but there was a lot going on.
And, you know, I didn't have a choice.
Don't worry about it.
[Grunts] I'm gonna go to bed.
Can we at least talk about this?
You look really pretty.
[Miranda] Andrea?
- Do you have the Book?
- Oh.
Uh-
Mm.
Paris is the most important week of my entire year.
I need the best possible team with me.
That no longer includes Emily.
Wait.
You want me to-
No, Miranda.
[Exhales] Emily would die.
Her whole life is about Paris.
She hasn't eaten in weeks.
I-I can't... do that.
Miranda, I can't.
If you don't go, I'll assume you're not serious about your future... at Runway or any other publication.
The decision's yours.
That's all.

[Clears Throat]
Andrea, don't forget to tell Emily.
Do it now.
- [Line Ringing]
- Don't pick up.
- Don't pick up.
Don't pick up.
Don't pick-
- Hi.
- Emily.
- Hi, hi.
Sorry I'm late.
It's just Miranda wanted some scarves from Hermès.
And she did tell me yesterday, but I forgot like an idiot.
And so I freaked out, of course.
Emily, Emily, I-I need to talk to you.
I called Martine at home, and she opened the shop early.
Whoa!
I'm sorry.
She opened the shop early for me, so I got them, which is great.
Okay.
Um, Emily, wh-when you come in... there's something I have to talk to you about.
- Well, I hope it's not another Miranda problem.
- Not exactly.
Well, good, because I've got so much to deal with before I go.
I swear to God [Gasps] - [Horn Honks, Tires Skid]
- [Clamoring] - [Woman] Oh, my God!
Emily?
[Woman On P.A., Indistinct]
[Elevator Bell Dings]
I don't care if she was gonna fire you or beat you with a red-hot poker!
You should have said no.
Emily, I didn't have a choice.
- Oh.
Please.
- You know how she is.
- That is a pathetic excuse.
- [Door Opens]
Thanks.
Do you know what really just... gets me about this whole thing... is that, you know, you're the one who said you don't really care about this stuff.
And you don't really care about fashion.
You just wanna be a journalist.
What a pile of bollocks!
Emily, I know you're mad.
I don't blame you.
Face it, you sold your soul the day you put on that first pair of Jimmy Choo's.
I saw it.
And you know what really just kills me about this whole thing... is the clothes that you're gonna get.
I mean, you don't deserve them.
You eat carbs, for Christ's sake.
God, it's so unfair!
- Emily.
- Just go.
- Emily, I-
- I said go!
[Sighs]
- [Doug] You are going to Paris for the couture shows?
- [Andy] Mm-hmm.
- That's the coolest fashion event of the year.
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, who are you going to see, Galliano?
- Yeah.
- And Lagerfeld and Nicholas Ghesquiere.
- Yep.
- Yes.
Okay, now you're scaring me.
- [Chuckles]
- Hey.
- Hey.
- This show is amazing.
I am so proud of you.
- [Lily] Thank you.
Okay, start with the photos in the back and work your way forward.
That is the way I designed it.
It is brilliant.
- You will love it.
- Of course.
And you, I have somebody I want you to meet, okay?
Ooh, art and sex.
Lead the way.
- See you later.
- Okay.

- Hey.
Hey, Miranda girl.
- Hi.
- I was just thinking about you.
Oh, come on.
- It's true.
- No.
I'm profiling Gaultier for Interview and, uh, making my Paris plans.
I found myself wondering if, uh, you were gonna be there.
Well, actually, um, I am going.
Great.
I'm staying in a fantastic little hotel in the Seventh... right across the street from the falafel restaurant that will change your life.
[Chuckles] I'm sorry.
I'll be too busy working.
You'll have to find someone else's life to change.
Well, that's just it.
I'm beginning to wonder if I can.
Lily.
Lily, he's just a guy I know from work.
- Yeah, that looked like work.
- Look, you're making a big deal out of-
You know, the Andy I know is madly in love with Nate... is always five minutes early... and thinks, I don't know, Club Monaco is couture.
For the last 16 years, I've known everything about that Andy.
But this person?
This "glamazon" who skulks around in corners... with some random hot fashion guy?
I don't get her.
- Lily.
- Have fun in Paris.
You going to Paris?
Uh, yeah.
It just happened.
I thought Paris was a big deal for Emily or-
Great.
Now you're gonna give me a hard time too?
Hey, Andy.
Andy!
- Andy, what the hell is wrong with you?
- I-I didn't have a choice, okay?
- Miranda asked me, and I couldn't say no.
- I know.
That's your answer for everything lately, "I didn't have a choice."
- Like this job was forced on you.
- Nate, I get it, okay?
Like you don't make these decisions yourself.
You're mad because I work late all the time and I missed your birthday party.
- And I'm sorry.
- Oh, come on.
What am I, four?
You-You hate Runway and Miranda.
And you think fashion is stupid.
You've made that clear.
Andy, I make port wine reductions all day.
I'm not exactly in the Peace Corps.
You know, I wouldn't care if you were out there pole dancing all night... as long as you did it with a little integrity.
You used to say this was just a job.
You used to make fun of the Runway girls.
What happened?
Now you've become one of them.
- That's absurd.
- That's okay.
That's fine.
Just own up to it.
And then we can stop pretending like we have anything in common anymore.
- You don't mean that, do you?
- No, I do.
Well... maybe this trip is coming at a good time.
Maybe we should take a break.
Nate?
[Cellphone Ringing]
I'm sorry.
Just... one second?
You know, in case you were wondering... the person whose calls you always take, that's the relationship you're in.
I hope you two are very happy together.
[Cellphone Continues Ringing]
Hello, Miranda.
## [Man Singing]

[Chattering]
Pardon.
Miranda.
- [Speaking Italian]
- Maestro.
Mmm.
How are you?
So glad to see you.
Thank you for coming.
- You like the collection?
- Absolutely.
I think it's the best in years.
- This is very important for me.
Very, very important.
- I'm very happy for you.
- This is my new Emily.
- Hello.
How do you do?
- I'm good.
Pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.
You love the show?
- Miranda.
This way!
- [Clamoring]
Miranda.
Nigel.
Fashion's great gatekeepers.
Miranda, what is Runway's position on French fashion versus American fashion?
- I've been thinking-
- Oh.
- You still owe me for Harry Potter.
- Oh, do I?
- Of course you do.
Are you working tonight?
- Oh!
- No, actually Miranda has a dinner.
- Great, you're free.
Oh, but there is the problem of le boyfriend.
Wait, don't tell me.
The boyfriend non plus?
Je suis très, très desolé.
Oh, you're so full of it.
You're not desolé at all.
No, not even a little.
What time should I pick you up?
- Uh-
- I'll call you.
Yeah.
Oh.
Oh, there you are.
[Clears Throat]
We need to go over the seating, uh, chart for the luncheon.
Okay.
Um, yeah, sure.
I have it right here.
By all means, move at a glacial pace.
You know how that thrills me.
Okay.
So... first of all, we need to move Snoop Dogg to my table.
But your table's full.
Stephen isn't coming.
Oh, Stephen is-
So I don't need to fetch Stephen from the airport tomorrow?
Well, if you speak to him and he decides to rethink the divorce... then, yes, fetch away.
You're very fetching, so go fetch.
And then when we get back to New York, we need to contact, um...
Leslie to see what she can do to minimize the press... on all this.
Another divorce... splashed across page six.
I can just imagine what they're gonna write about me.
The Dragon Lady, career-obsessed.
Snow Queen drives away another Mr. Priestly.
Rupert Murdoch should cut me a check... for all the papers I sell for him.
Anyway, I don't-
I don't really care what anybody writes about me.
But my- my girls, I just-
It's just so unfair to the girls.
It's just... another disappointment... another letdown, another father... figure-
[Chuckles] gone.
Anyway, the point is- [Clears Throat]
The point is- [Sighs]
The point is we really need to figure out where to place Donatella... because she's barely speaking to anyone.
I'm so sorry, Miranda.
If you want me to cancel your evening, I can.
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would we do that?
Um, is-
Is there anything else I can do?
Your job.
That's all.
[Knocking]
Hi.
I need Miranda's itinerary for tomorrow.
- Okay.
Come on in.
- All right?
Thanks.
- Who put that together for you?
- This?
Oh, it's just- it's just something I threw on.
Turn around.
Let me see.
Turn.
- Mm.
Incroyable.
- Yeah?
- It's really just
- No, it's
- No, gorgeous.
- Yeah?
Okay, good.
Really.
I think that my work here is done.
Oh.
We're going to celebrate.
I'm going to get some champagne.
Okay.
What are we toasting?
We are toasting, my dear, to the dream job.
The one that a million girls wanted.
Which I got months ago.
I'm not talking about you.
Mm-hmm.
- James Holt-
- Yeah.
Massimo Corteleoni... is investing in James's company and taking it global.
- Mm-hmm.
- Bags, shoes, fragrances- the works.
And James needs a partner.
And that partner would be me.
- Does Miranda-
- No, no, Miranda knows, because-
- Oh.
- Oh, she put me up for it.
God, no.
Can you imagine?
But
- But
- But you're leaving.
- Mm-hmm.
- I can't imagine Runway without you.
I know, I know, but I'm so excited though.
This is the first time in 18 years I'm going to be able to call the shots in my own life.
Oh, my God!
I'm going to be able to come to Paris and actually see Paris.
Well, congratulations.
- Huh?
Oh.
- Nigel, you deserve it.
You bet your size-six ass.
[Guffaws]
- Four.
- Really?
- [Glasses Clink]
- Cheers.
- Cheers to you.
- To us.
- Let me see that.
- [Giggles]
## [Woman Singing In French]
Okay, I just wanna say that yes, there are things Miranda does that I don't agree with, but-
- Come on.
You hate her.
Just admit it to me.
- No.
She's a
- She's a notorious sadist... and not- not in a good way.
Okay, she's tough, but if Miranda were a man... no one would notice anything about her, except how great she is at her job.
[Chuckles] I'm sorry.
I can't-
- I can't believe this.
You're defending her?
- Yeah.
The wide-eyed girl peddling her earnest newspaper stories?
You, my friend, are crossing over to the dark side.
I resent that.
- You shouldn't.
It's sexy.
- Sexy?
- Really?
- Really.
So do you- do you know where we're going?
- 'Cause I'm lost.
- Yeah.
Yeah, don't worry.
I know this city like the back of my hand.
It's my favorite place in the whole world.
You know, Gertrude Stein once said...
"America is my country, and Paris is my hometown."
- [Laughs]
- It's true.
What do you do?
Do you just write stuff like that down... and then file it away to use on us girls?
- I'm Christian Thompson.
That's my way.
- That's your way.
Right.
I work freelance.
I have a lot of free time on my hands.
You know, I never understood... why everyone was so crazy about Paris... but... it is so beautiful.
[Giggles]
Mm.
I-I can't.
I'm sorry.
I can't.
You know, Nate and I just split up a couple days ago, and I can't.
Ooh.
I've had too much wine.
And my hearing-vision- judgment's impaired.
No, I barely know you.
I'm in a strange city.
I... am out of excuses.
Thank God.
[Groans]
[Gasps]
Yes.
Oh, shoot.
[Door Opens]
Bonjour, madame.
Uh, what the hell is this?
What does it look like?
It's a mock-up.
Yeah.
Of?
Of what American Runway will look like when Jacqueline Follet is the new editor in chief.
Wh-They're replacing Miranda?
Yeah.
And she's bringing me in to run all the editorial content.
You're really surprised?
Jacqueline's a lot younger than Miranda.
She has a fresher take on things.
Not to mention American Runway's one of the most expensive books in the business.
Jacqueline does the same thing for a lot less money.
And Irv- Irv's a businessman, you know.
Miranda will be devastated.
Her whole life is about Runway.
He can't do that to her.
It's done.
Irv's gonna tell Miranda after the party for James.
And she has no idea?
She's a big girl.
She'll be fine.
Shi
- I have to go.
Andy.
Andy, it's done.
Baby, it's done.
I'm not your baby.
- [Phone Ringing]
- Allo.
Oh!
Oh!
Thank God you're there.
- [Sighs] Excuse me?
- I need to talk to you right away.
It's about Jacqueline Follet.
Shit!
Oh, shit!
Shit, shit, shit!
- Yes.
- Mr. Ravitz, I'm so sorry to bother you.
I was wondering-
Have you completely lost your mind?
- I need to talk to you.
- Do not disturb me again.
But, um, it's just for one
- Miranda!
[Horn Honks]
Miranda.
Miranda.
Wait, I need to talk to you.
Irv is making Jacqueline Follet the editor in chief of Runway.
Christian Thompson told me he's gonna work for her.
Irv is going to tell you today.
I thought maybe if I told you, that you could fix it.
Do I smell freesias?
What?
No.
I-I specifically told them-
If I see freesias anywhere...
I will be very disappointed.
For 72 years, Runway has been more than a magazine.
It has been a beacon of elegance and grace.
Miranda Priestly is the finest possible guardian of that beacon... setting a standard that inspires people across the globe.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Miranda Priestly.
Thank you, my dear friend.
Bonjour.
[Chuckles]
Thank you very much for coming today... to help celebrate our dear friend, James Holt.
But before I talk to you about James... and his many accomplishments...
I would like first to share some news with you.
Um, as many of you know... uh, recently Massimo Corteleoni... has agreed to finance the expansion of the James Holt label... transforming the work of this visionary artist... into a global brand, which is really an exciting enterprise.
Runway and James Holt share many things in common... chief among them, a commitment to excellence.
And so, it should come as no surprise that when the time came... for James to choose the new president of James Holt International... he chose from within the Runway family.
And it's my great happiness today... to announce to you all that that person... is my friend and longtime esteemed colleague...
Jacqueline Follet.
Thank you.
Merci.
And now to the main event... our celebration of James Holt.
We at Runway are very proud to have been-
When the time is right, she'll pay me back.
You sure about that?
No.
But I hope for the best.
I have to.
[Clamoring]
You thought I didn't know.
I've known what was happening for quite some time.
It just took me a little while to find a suitable alternative for Jacqueline.
And that James Holtjob was so absurdly overpaid... that, of course, she jumped at it.
So I just had to tell Irv that Jacqueline was unavailable.
The truth is, there is no one that can do what I do... including her.
Any of the other choices would have found that job impossible... and the magazine would have suffered.
[Sighs] Especially because of the list.
The list of designers, photographers... editors, writers, models, all of whom were found by me, nurtured by me... and have promised me they will follow me... whenever and if ever I choose to leave Runway.
[Chuckles]
So he reconsidered.
But I was very, very impressed... by how intently you tried to warn me.
I never thought I would say this, Andrea... but I really-
I see a great deal of myself in you.
You can see beyond what people want and what they need... and you can choose for yourself.
I don't think I'm like that.
I-
I couldn't do what you did to Nigel, Miranda.
I couldn't do something like that.
Mm.
You already did.
To Emily.
That's not what I-
No, that was- that was different.
I didn't have a choice.
Oh, no, you chose.
You chose to get ahead.
You want this life, those choices are necessary.
But what if this isn't what I want?
I mean, what if I don't wanna live the way you live?
Don't be ridiculous, Andrea.
Everybody wants this.
Everybody wants to be us.
[Clamoring]
## [Woman Vocalizing]
## [Vocalizing Continues]
[Cellphone Ringing]
## [Vocalizing Continues]
I have to be at work in 20 minutes.
What's up?
Well, I just-
I wanted to say that you were right about everything.
That...
I turned my back on my friends and my family... and everything I believed in... and- and for what?
For shoes and shirts and jackets and belts.
Nate.
I'm sorry.
I- [Clears Throat]
I flew up to Boston while you were gone.
I interviewed at the Oak Room.
And?
And you're looking at their new sous-chef.
- I'm moving up there in a couple weeks.
- That's great.
Congratulations.
I don't know what I'm gonna do without those late-night grilled cheeses, but-
I'm pretty sure they have bread in Boston.
May even have Jarlsberg.
We might be able to figure something out.
You think?
Yeah.
So, what about you?
I mean, what are you gonna do now?
Actually, I, uh- I have a job interview today.
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
That's what you're wearing?
Shut up.
I like this.
- Andy, Greg Hill.
- Hello.
Come on.
These clips are excellent.
This thing on the janitors' union, that's exactly what we do here.
My only question is, Runway?
My only question is, Runway?
You were there for less than a year.
What the hell kind of a blip is that?
Learned a lot.
In the end though, I kind of screwed it up.
I called over there for a reference, left word with some snooty girl.
Next thing you know, I got a fax from Miranda Priestly herself... saying that of all the assistants she's ever had... you were, by far, her biggest disappointment.
And, if I don't hire you, I am an idiot.
You must have done something right.
- [Beeping] - [Phone Ringing]
Miranda Priestly's office.
Hey, Emily, it's Andy.
Don't hang up.
I have a favor to ask you.
You have a favor to ask of me?
Yeah.
The thing is, I have all these clothes from Paris... and I don't have anyplace to wear them... so I was wondering if you could take them off my hands.
Well, I don't know.
It's a huge imposition.
And I'll have to get them taken in.
I mean, they'll drown me.
But I suppose I could help you out.
I will have Roy pick them up this afternoon.
Thanks, Em.
I appreciate it.
Good luck.
You have some very large shoes to fill.
I hope you know that.
I don't understand why it is so challenging... to get my car when I ask for it.
[Chuckles]
Go.
Good luck.
Hi.
Uh, I have an appointment with Emily Charlton?
- Andrea Sachs?
- Yes.
Great.
Human Resources certainly has an odd sense of humor.
Follow me.
Okay, so I was Miranda's second assistant... but her first assistant recently got promoted, and so now I'm the first.
- Oh, and you're replacing yourself.
- Well, I am trying.
Miranda sacked the last two girls after only a few weeks.
We need to find someone who can survive here.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Of course.
Who's Miranda?
Oh, my God.
I will pretend you did not just ask me that.
She's the editor in chief of Runway, not to mention a legend.
You work a year for her, and you can get a job at any magazine you want.
A million girls would kill for this job.
It sounds like a great opportunity.
I'd love to be considered.
Andrea, Runway is a fashion magazine... so an interest in fashion is crucial.
What makes you think I'm not interested in fashion?
Oh, my God.
No!
No!
No!
What's wrong?
She's on her way.
Tell everyone!
She's not supposed to be here until 9:00.
Her driver just text messaged, and her facialist ruptured a disk.
- God, these people!
- Who's that?
That I can't even talk about.
All right, everyone!
Gird your loins!
Did somebody eat an onion bagel?
Sorry, Miranda.
Move it!
Ooh!
I don't understand why it's so difficult to confirm an appointment.
I know.
I'm so sorry, Miranda.
I actually did confirm last night.
Details of your incompetence do not interest me.
Tell Simone I'm not going to approve that girl that she sent me for the Brazilian layout.
I asked for clean, athletic, smiling.
She sent me dirty, tired and paunchy.
And R.S.V.P. yes to the Michael Kors party.
I want the driver to drop me off at 9:30 and pick me up at 9:45 sharp.
- 9:45 sharp.
- Call Natalie at Glorious Foods, tell her no for the 40th time.
No, I don't want dacquoise.
I want tortes filled with warm rhubarb compote.
Then call my ex-husband and remind him the parent-teacher conference is at Dalton tonight.
Then call my husband, ask him to meet me for dinner at that place I went to with Massimo.
Tell Richard I saw the pictures that he sent for that feature on the female paratroopers... and they're all so deeply unattractive.
Is it impossible to find a lovely, slender female paratrooper?
- No.
- Am I reaching for the stars here?
Not really.
Also, I need to see all the things that Nigel has pulled for Gwyneth's second cover try.
I wonder if she's lost any of that weight yet.
Who's that?
Nobody.
Um, uh-
Human Resources sent her up about the new assistant job, and I was preinterviewing her.
But she's hopeless and totally wrong for it.
Clearly I'm going to have to do that myself because the last two you sent me... were completely inadequate.
So send her in.
That's all.
Right.
- She wants to see you.
- Oh!
She does?
Move!
- This is foul.
Don't let her see it.
Go!
- That's-
Who are you?
Uh, my name is Andy Sachs.
I recently graduated from Northwestern University.
And what are you doing here?
Well, I think I could do a good job as your assistant.
And, um-
Yeah, I came to New York to be a journalist and sent letters out everywhere... and then finally got a call from Elias-Clarke... and met with Sherry up at Human Resources.
Basically, it's this or Auto Universe.
- So you don't read Runway?
- Uh, no.
And before today, you had never heard of me.
No.
And you have no style or sense of fashion.
Well, um, I think that depends on what you're-
No, no.
That wasn't a question.
Um, I was editor in chief of the Daily Northwestern.
I also, um, won a national competition for college journalists... with my series on the janitors' union, which exposed the exploitation-
That's all.
Yeah.
You know, okay.
You're right.
I don't fit in here.
I am not skinny or glamorous... and I don't know that much about fashion.
But I'm smart.
I learn fast and I will work very hard.
I got the exclusive on the Cavalli for Gwyneth... but the problem is, with that huge feathered headdress that she's wearing... she looks like she's working the main stage at the Golden Nugget.
Thank you for your time.
Who is that sad little person?
Are we doing a before-and-after piece I don't know about?
Brown and Law, please?
Thank you.
- Andrea.
- Hmm?
Wait.
You got a job at a fashion magazine?
- Mm-hmm.
- What was it, a phone interview?
- Wow.
- Ow!
Don't be a jerk.
Miranda Priestly is famous for being unpredictable.
Okay, Doug.
How is it that you know who she is and I didn't?
- I'm actually a girl.
- Oh!
- That would explain so much.
- Look, seriously.
Miranda Priestly is a huge deal.
I bet a million girls would kill for that job.
Yeah, great.
The thing is I'm not one of them.
Look, you gotta start somewhere, right?
I mean, look at this dump Nate works in.
I mean, come on.
Paper napkins?
Hello.
Yeah.
And Lily, she works at that gallery doing, uh, you know-
Oh, I'm sorry.
What exactly is it that you do anyway?
Well, lucky for me, I already have my dream job.
You're a corporate research analyst!
- Oh, you're right.
My job sucks.
- No!
- It sucks.
I don't
- It's boring.
- It's all right.
Breathe.
- I'm trying.
- Here.
Take a drink.
- I will have a drink.
I will have a drink.
- Ah, yes.
- I'd like to propose a toast.
To jobs that pay the rent.
- To jobs that pay the rent.
Jobs that pay the rent.
Oh, baby.
You should see the way these girls at Runway dress.
I don't have a thing to wear to work.
Come on.
You're gonna be answering phones and getting coffee.
You need a ball gown for that?
I think I might.
Well, I happen to think you look great always.
Aww!
I think you're full of it.
- Hey.
Come on.
Let's go home.
- Yeah.
I can think of something we can do that doesn't require any clothing.
- Really?
- Mmm.
Hello?
Andrea, Miranda decided to kill the autumn jacket story for September... and she is pulling up the Sedona shoot from October.
You need to come into the office right this second and pick up her coffee order on the way.
- Now?
- Now, get a pen and write this down.
I want one no-foam skimmed latte with an extra shot... and three drip coffees with room for milk.
Searing hot.
And I mean hot.
Hello?
- Where are you?
- Oh, I'm almost there.
Yeah.
Shoot!
Oh!
Is there some reason that my coffee isn't here?
Has she died or something?
No.
God.
Oh.
Bloody time.
- I hope you know that this is a very difficult job-
- Mm-hmm.
for which you are totally wrong.
And if you mess up, my head is on the chopping block.
Now, hang that up.
Don't just fling it anywhere.
Okay.
First of all, you and I answer the phones.
The phone must be answered every single time it rings.
Calls roll to voice mail, and she gets very upset.
If I'm not here-Andrea, Andrea- you are chained to that desk.
- Well, what if I need to-
- What?
No.
One time an assistant left the desk because she sliced her hand open with a letter opener... and Miranda missed Lagerfeld... just before he boarded a 17-hour flight to Australia.
She now works at TVGuide.
Man the desk at all times.
Got it.
- Uh-
- Miranda Priestly's office.
No, she's not available.
Who is it?
Yes, I will tell her you called... yet again.
- Right.
Remember, you and I have totally different jobs.
I mean, you get coffee- and you run errands.
Yet I am in charge of her schedule... her appointments and her expenses.
And, um, most importantly, um...
I get to go with her to Paris for Fashion Week in the fall.
I get to wear couture.
I go to all the shows and all the parties.
I meet all of the designers.
It's divine.
Okay.
Now, stay here.
I'm going to the art department to give them the Book.
- The-
- This is the Book.
Now, it is a mock-up of everything... in the current issue.
And we deliver it to Miranda's apartment every night, and she retu-
Don't touch it.
She returns it to us in the morning with her notes.
Now, the second assistant is supposed to do this... but Miranda is very private and she does not like strangers in her house.
So until she decides that you are not a total psycho...
I get the lovely task of waiting around for the Book.
Oh, Emily?
What do I do-
Deal with it.
Hello.
Mrs. Priestly's office.
Hmm.
That's what I meant.
Miranda Priestly's office.
Um, you know, she is in a meeting.
Can I please take a message?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Can you please spell Gabbana?
Hello?
I guess not.
I guessed an eight and a half.
Um, uh, that's very nice of you... but I don't think I need these.
Miranda hired me.
She knows what I look like.
Do you?
Emily.
Emily?
She means you.
- We just cut on the bias.
- That's not what I asked you.
I couldn't have been clearer.
There you are, Emily.
- How many times do I have to scream your name?
- Actually, it's Andy.
My name is Andy.
Andrea, but, uh, everybody calls me Andy.
I need 10 or 15 skirts from Calvin Klein.
- What kind of skirts do you-
- Please bore someone else with your questions.
And make sure we have Pier 59 at 8:00 A.M. tomorrow.
Remind Jocelyn I need to see a few of those satchels that Marc is doing in the pony.
And then tell Simone I'll take Jackie if Maggie isn't available.
- Did Demarchelier confirm?
- D-Did D-Demarchel-
Demarchelier.
Did he
- Get him on the phone.
Uh, o- okay.
- And, Emily?
- Yes?
That's all.
It's just the cavalier disregard for clear directions-
Do you have Demarchelier?
Uh, Demarchelier.
- Leave it.
- Do you have-
I have Miranda Priestly calling.
I have Patrick!
Uh, no, she called me in there and-and then she asked me about Pier 59.
And there was something about Simone, Frankie, someone else.
And, um, she needs skirts from Calvin Klein.
And, uh, there was something about a pony.
- Did she say which skirts?
- No.
No.
- Did she say what kind?
Color, shape, fabric?
- I tried to ask her.
You may never ask Miranda anything.
Right.
I will deal with all of this, and you will go to Calvin Klein.
Eh
- Me?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you have some prior commitment?
Some hideous skirt convention you have to go to?
Uh-
Miranda?
- Are you there?
- I'm about to walk in.
I'll call you as soon as-
- Hello?
Hi.
- While you're out...
Miranda needs you to go to Hermès to pick up 25 scarves we ordered for her.
- Okay.
- Cassidy forgot her homework at Dalton.
Pick that up.
Miranda went out to meet with Meisel, and she will want more Starbucks when she gets back.
- Hot Starbucks.
- Can you just repeat that first-
Hello?
Oh, my God.
What took you so long?
I have to pee!
What?
You haven't peed since I left?
No, I haven't.
I've been manning the desk, haven't I?
I'm bursting.
Oh, hi.
You do coat.
Do the coat!
Okay.
Now, be prepared.
The run-through is at 12:30.
People are panicking, so the phone is going to be ringing off the hook.
The ru-The run-through.
Right.
Yes.
Editors bring in options for the shoot, and Miranda chooses.
She chooses every single thing in every single issue.
Run-throughs are a huge deal.
I don't know why you don't know that, Andrea.
- Okay.
Are you ready?
- Oh, hi, hi.
Right.
Well, after the loo, Serena and I are going to lunch.
- This is her- the new me.
- Hi.
- Told you.
- I thought you were kidding.
No, quite serious, yeah.
I get 20 minutes for lunch, and you get 15.
- When I come back, you can go.
- Okay.
What exactly is she wearing?
Her grandmother's skirt.
Hmm.
Corn chowder.
That's an interesting choice.
You do know that cellulite is one of the main ingredients in corn chowder.
So none of the girls here eat anything?
Not since two became the new four and zero became the new two.
- Well, I'm a six.
- Which is the new 14.
Oh.
Shoot.
Oh, never mind.
I'm sure you have plenty more polyblend where that came from.
Okay.
You think my clothes are hideous.
I get it.
But, you know, I'm not going to be in fashion forever... so I don't see the point of changing everything about myself just because I have this job.
Yes, that's true.
That's really what this multibillion-dollar industry is all about anyway, isn't it?
Inner beauty.
Hello.
Right.
Come on.
- Miranda's pushed the run-through up a half an hour.
- Mmm!
- She's always 15 minutes early.
- Which means?
- You're already late.
Come.
- Shoot!
Excuse me.
Mr. Ravitz.
Nigel.
- Issue going well?
- Oh, yes.
Our best September ever.
Great.
Heard Miranda killed autumn jackets and pulled up the Sedona shoot.
What's that costing me?
About 300,000.
Must have been some lousy jackets.
- Irv Ravitz.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
This is Andy Sachs, Miranda's new assistant.
Congratulations, young lady.
A million girls would kill for that job.
Bye-bye.
- Hmm?
- Chairman of Elias-Clarke, Irv Ravitz.
You know what they say?
Tiny man, huge ego.
No.
And I've seen all this before.
Theyskens is trying to reinvent the drop waist, so actually it's-
- Where are all the other dresses?
- We have some right here.
- Stand, watch and listen.
- And I think it can be very interesting-
No.
No, I just- It's just baffling to me.
Why is it so impossible to put together a decent run-through?
You people have had hours and hours to prepare.
It's just so confusing to me.
Where are the advertisers?
- We have some pieces from Banana Republic.
- We need more, don't we?
- Oh.
This is-This might be- What do you think of-
- Yeah.
Well, you know me.
Give me a full ballerina skirt and a hint of saloon and I'm on board.
- But do you think it's too much like-
- Like the Lacroix from July?
I thought that, but no, not with the right accessories.
It should work.
Where are the belts for this dre- Why is no one ready?
Here.
It's a tough call.
- They're so different.
- Hmm.
Something funny?
No.
No, no.
Nothing's-
You know, it's just that both those belts look exactly the same to me.
You know, I'm still learning about this stuff and, uh-
"This... stuff"?
Oh.
Okay.
I see.
You think this has nothing to do with you.
You go to your closet... and you select
- I don't know- that lumpy blue sweater, for instance... because you're trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously... to care about what you put on your back.
But what you don't know is that that sweater is not just blue.
It's not turquoise.
It's not lapis.
It's actually cerulean.
And you're also blithely unaware of the fact... that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns.
And then I think it was Yves Saint Laurent- wasn't it- who showed cerulean military jackets?
- I think we need a jacket here.
- Mmm.
And then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers.
And then it, uh, filtered down through the department stores... and then trickled on down into some tragic Casual Corner... where you, no doubt, fished it out of some clearance bin.
However, that blue represents millions of dollars... and countless jobs... and it's sort of comical how you think that you've made a choice... that exempts you from the fashion industry... when, in fact... you're wearing a sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room... from a pile of stuff.
So then I said, "No, I couldn't see the difference... between the two absolutely identical belts"... and you should have seen the look she gave me!
I thought the flesh was gonna melt off her face.
It's not funny.
She's not happy unless everyone around her is panicked, nauseous or suicidal.
And the Clackers just worship her.
- The who?
- They call them Clackers.
The sound that their stilettos make in the marble lobby.
It's like, "Clack, clack, clack. clack, clack. "
And they all act like they're curing cancer or something.
The amount of time and energy... that these people spend on these insignificant, minute details, and for what?
So that tomorrow they can spend another $300,000 reshooting something... that was probably fine to begin with... to sell people things they don't need!
God!
- I'm not even hungry anymore.
- What?
- That is why those girls are so skinny.
- Oh.
No, no, no.
Give me that.
There's, like, eight dollars of Jarlsberg in there.
You know what?
I just have to stick it out for a year.
One year.
And then I can do what I came to New York to do.
But I can't let Miranda get to me.
I won't.
Easy there, tiger.
- Oh, good morning, Miranda.
- Get me Isaac.
I don't see my breakfast here.
Are my eggs here?
Where are my eggs?
Excuse me!
Pick up the Polaroids from the lingerie shoot.
Have the brakes checked on my car.
Where's that piece of paper I had in my hand yesterday morning?
The girls need new surfboards or boogie boards or something for spring break.
- Hello.
- The twins also need flip-flops.
- Ow!
- Oh, my gosh!
Pick up my shoes from Blahnik, and then go get Patricia.
- Who's that?
- Good girl!
Good girl!
Good girl!
Get me that little table that I liked at that store on Madison.
Get us a reservation for dinner tonight at that place that got the good review.
- Get me Isaac.
- Thirty-six thank-you notes delivered today.
- Where is everyone?
- Why is no one working?
Get me Demarchelier.
I have Miranda Priestly calling for- Okay.
I have Patrick.
Thank God it's Friday, right?
At least Miranda will be in Miami, so we don't have to be on call this weekend.
You know, my dad's coming in from Ohio.
Yeah, we're gonna go out to dinner, maybe see Chicago.
You doing anything fun this weekend?
Yes.
Yeah, Nate said it was great.
He actually
- He applied here, but they wanted someone with more experience.
- Here.
- Huh?
What's this?
I don't want you to get behind on your rent.
- Dad, how did you-
- It's-
I'm gonna kill Mom.
Dad, thank you.
Mm-hmm.
- It's really good to see you.
- You too, honey.
So, you want to start grilling me now... or should we wait till after dinner?
I thought I'd let you at least enjoy the bread basket first.
No, no, no.
It's okay.
Go right ahead.
We're just a little worried, honey.
We get e-mails from you at your office at 2:00 A.M.
Your pay is terrible.
You don't get to write anything.
Hey, that's not fair.
I wrote those e-mails.
I'm just trying to understand why someone who got accepted to Stanford Law... turns it down to be a journalist, and now you're not even doing that.
Dad, you have to trust me.
Being Miranda's assistant opens a lot of doors.
Emily is going to Paris with Miranda in a few months... and she's gonna meet editors and writers from every important magazine.
And in a year, that could be me.
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.
Dad, I swear, this is my break.
This is my- my chance.
This is my boss.
- I'm sorry, Dad.
I have to take this.
- Take it.
Take it.
- Hello.
Miranda?
- My flight has been canceled.
It's some absurd weather problem.
I need to get home tonight.
The twins have a recital tomorrow morning at school.
- What?
- At school!
- Absolutely.
Let me see what I can do.
- Good.
Hi.
Um, I know this is totally last minute... but I was hoping that you could maybe get a flight for my boss... from Miami to New York tonight?
Uh-
- It's right here.
Thank you.
- Yeah, any kind of jet.
- From Miami to New York.
- Thank you.
- Yup, I need it tonight.
I need it-
- Ow!
- I thought you were going out the other-
- Sweetie!
No.
- It's over here, honey.
- Tonight.
Hi.
I'm trying to get a flight tonight- for tonight- from Miami to New York.
Yes, I know there's a hurricane.
Nothing is flying out?
What do you mean, nothing is flying out?
It's for Miranda Priestly, and I know that she's a client of yours.
Yes.
Yes, hi.
I need a jet tonight from Miami to New York.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Hold on.
Hello?
Miranda, hi.
I'm trying to get you a flight, but no one is flying out because of the weather.
Please.
It's just- I don't know- drizzling.
Someone must be getting out.
Call Donatella.
Get her jet.
Call everybody else that we know that has a jet.
Irv?
Call every
- This is your responsibi- This is your job.
Get me home.
Oh, my God!
She's going to murder me.
What does she want you to do, call the National Guard and have her airlifted out of there?
Of course not.
Could I do that?
Come on.
Come on.
The girls' recital was absolutely wonderful.
They played Rachmaninoff.
Everyone loved it.
Everyone except me... because, sadly, I was not there.
Miranda, I'm so sorry.
Do you know why I hired you?
I always hire the same girl- stylish, slender, of course... worships the magazine.
But so often, they turn out to be-
I don't know- disappointing and, um... stupid.
So you, with that impressive résumé... and the big speech about your so-called work ethic-
I, um
- I thought you would be different.
I said to myself, go ahead.
Take a chance.
Hire the smart, fat girl.
I had hope.
My God.
I live on it.
Anyway, you ended up disappointing me more than, um- more than any of the other silly girls.
Um, I really did everything I could think of.
- Uh-
- That's all.
Excuse me!
Where do you think you're going?
She hates me, Nigel.
And that's my problem because-
Oh, wait.
No, it's not my problem.
I don't know what else I can do because if I do something right, it's unacknowledged.
She doesn't even say thank you.
But if I do something wrong, she is vicious.
- So quit.
- What?
- Quit.
- Quit?
I can get another girl to take your job in five minutes- one who really wants it.
No, I don't want to quit.
That's not fair.
But, you know, I'm just saying that I would just like a little credit... for the fact that I'm killing myself trying.
Andy, be serious.
You are not trying.
- You are whining.
- I-
What is it that you want me to say to you, huh?
Do you want me to say, "Poor you.
Miranda's picking on you.
Poor you.
Poor Andy"?
Hmm?
Wake up, six.
She's just doing her job.
Don't you know that you are working at the place... that published some of the greatest artists of the century?
Halston, Lagerfeld, de la Renta.
And what they did, what they created... was greater than art because you live your life in it.
Well, not you, obviously, but some people.
You think this is just a magazine, hmm?
This is not just a magazine.
This is a shining beacon of hope for- oh, I don't know- let's say a young boy growing up in Rhode Island with six brothers... pretending to go to soccer practice when he was really going to sewing class... and reading Runway under the covers at night with a flashlight.
You have no idea how many legends have walked these halls.
And what's worse, you don't care.
Because this place, where so many people would die to work... you only deign to work.
And you want to know why she doesn't kiss you on the forehead... and give you a gold star on your homework at the end of the day.
Wake up, sweetheart.
- Okay.
So I'm screwing it up.
- Mmm.
I don't want to.
I just wish that I knew what I could do to-
- Nigel?
- Hmm?
Nigel, Nigel.
No.
I don't know what you expect me to do.
There's nothing in this whole closet that'll fit a size six.
I can guarantee you.
These are all sample sizes- two and four.
- All right.
We're doing this for you.
And-
- A poncho?
You'll take what I give you and you'll like it.
- We're doing this Dolce for you.
- Hmm!
And shoes.
- Jimmy Choo's.
- Hmm.
- Manolo Blahnik.
- Wow.
Nancy Gonzalez.
Love that.
Okay, Narciso Rodriguez.
This we love.
- Uh, it might fit.
It might.
- What?
Okay.
Now, Chanel.
You're in desperate need of Chanel.
Darling, shall we?
We have to get to the beauty department, and God knows how long that's going to take.
I mean, I have no idea why Miranda hired her.
Me neither.
The other day, we were in the beauty department.
She held up the Shu Uemura eyelash curler and said, "What is this?"
I just knew from the moment I saw her... she was going to be a complete and utter disas-
Miranda Priestly's office.
No, actually, she's not available, but I'll leave word.
Okay, thanks.
Bye.
How did-
- Are you wearing the-
- The Chanel boots?
Yeah, I am.
You look good.
- Oh, God.
- What?
- She does.
- Oh, shut up, Serena.
- See you guys tomorrow.
- Good night, man.
Take it easy.
Take care of that finger, huh?
So, what do you think?
Uh, I think we better get out of here... before my girlfriend sees me.
The gowns are fabulous.
Mm-hmm.
We're gonna use the burgundy.
Gotta find-
So we spent a whole semester on potatoes alone.
You take the fry and squeeze it.
- See how firm that is?
- Hey.
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.
There was a crisis in the accessories department.
- I needed to find a python headband.
- Python's hot right now.
I have exciting presents for all of you.
Are you ready?
- What is that?
- It's a Bang Olufsen phone.
Charlie Rose sent it to Miranda for her birthday.
I looked it up on line.
It's $1,100.
- What?
- Wow!
And I have some products.
Mason Pearson hairbrushes.
- A little Clinique.
- Ooh!
- Oh, damn it.
I love your job.
- Oh!
One more.
A little thing.
- Do you want it?
You want
- Oh.
- Gimme!
Gimme, gimme, gimme!
- I think she likes it.
- Oh, my God!
This is the new Marc Jacobs!
This is sold out everywhere.
Where did you get this?
Miranda didn't want it, so-
No, no, no, no, no.
This bag is, like, $1,900.
I cannot take this from you.
Yeah, you can.
- Why do women need so many bags?
- Shut up.
You have one.
You put all your junk in it, and that's it.
You're done.
Fashion is not about utility.
An accessory is merely a piece of iconography... used to express individual identity.
- Oh!
And it's pretty.
- That too.
Yeah.
But the thing is, it turns out there is more to Runway than just fancy purses.
Look, here's an essay by Jay Mclnerney, a piece by Joan Didion.
Even an interview with Christiane Amanpour.
- Looks like someone's been drinking the Kool-Aid.
- What do you-
I got it.
It's-Yup, the Dragon Lady.
- Oh, Miranda?
- Let me talk to her.
- I need that.
- I'll tell her to get her own scrambled eggs.
Lily, no, no, no!
Put that thing up!
I was gonna answer it!
It's gonna make- Give me the... phone.
Hi, Miranda.
- Ooh.
Shh.
- Absolutely.
- Shh!
- Uh-huh.
I'm leaving right now.
You know, you guys didn't have to be such assholes.
Um, excuse me.
I'm looking for James Holt.
Um, that's him right there.
- Oh.
Thanks.
- No problem.
- I put my stuff out there, and I pray they improve.
- Really?
- Excuse me.
- Hi.
I'm Andy.
I'm picking up for Miranda Priestly.
Oh, yes.
You must be the new Emily.
Nice to meet you.
- Oh, let me see that bag.
Very, very nice.
- Ah.
Distressed, studded leather, pieced by hand, finished with a metallic fringe.
Very nice, indeed.
Who made that fantastic thing?
You.
Hmm.
Duh.
This way.
Uh, here we go.
It's a sketch of Miranda's dress for the benefit.
Also the centerpiece of my spring collection.
Top secret stuff.
- I'll guard it with my life.
- Please do.
Come on.
You're working for Miranda Priestly now.
You must be in desperate need of hard liquor.
Excuse us, girls.
She'll have the punch.
It's deadly.
Have fun.
- He's right, you know.
- Hmm?
The punch.
I drank it at James' last party.
I woke up in Hoboken wearing nothing but a poncho and a cowboy hat.
Ah.
Well.
Wise.
- Uh, hi.
- Christian Thompson.
Christian Thompson?
You're kidding.
No, you're-You write for, like, every magazine I love.
I actually
- I reviewed your collection of essays for my college newspaper.
Did you mention my good looks and my killer charm?
- No, but-
- What do you do?
Oh.
Well, I want to work for somewhere like The New Yorker or Vanity Fair.
- I am a writer too.
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.
- I should read your stuff.
Why don't you send it over?
Yeah?
That would be-Thank you.
That would be great.
But actually, right now, I'm working as Miranda Priestly's assistant.
Oh, you're kidding.
Well, that's too bad.
That's-Whoa.
You'll never survive Miranda.
- Excuse me?
- Well, you seem nice, smart.
You can't do that job.
Gotta go.
Okay.
Well, it was very, very nice to meet you, Miranda girl.
Emily?
Call James Holt's office.
Tell them I want to move the preview up to today at 12:30.
Tell everybody else.
Be ready to leave in half an hour.
But we're not expected until Tuesday.
Did she say why?
Yes.
Yeah, she explained every detail of her decision making.
And then we brushed each other's hair and gabbed about American Idol.
I see your point.
- What's a preview anyway?
- Good morning, Miranda.
Miranda insists upon seeing all the designers' collections... before they show them.
- Great to see you.
- Hello, James.
- And she tells them what she thinks?
- In her way.
Uh, this season really began for me with a meditation... on the intersection between East and West.
There's a scale.
One nod is good.
Two nods is very good.
There's only been one actual smile on record, and that was Tom Ford in 2001.
An obi belt.
She doesn't like it, she shakes her head.
This is the dress that we have designed specifically and exclusively for you.
Then, of course, there's the pursing of the lips.
Which means?
Catastrophe.
Just, uh-Just go.
- I just don't understand.
I'm appalled.
- It's absurd.
Appalled.
- You deal with it.
- I'll talk to him.
So because she pursed her lips, he's gonna change his entire collection?
You still don't get it, do you?
Her opinion is the only one that matters.
- Call my husband and confirm dinner.
- At Pastis?
Done.
And I'll need a change of clothes.
Well, I've already messengered your outfit over to the shoot.
Fine.
And, Andrea, I would like you to deliver the Book to my home tonight.
- Have Emily give you the key.
- Mm-hmm.
- Guard this with your life.
- Of course.
You know, if I can deliver the Book, that means I must have done something right.
I'm not a psycho.
Oh, and, you know, she called me Andrea?
I mean, she didn't call me Emily, which is
- Isn't that great?
Yeah, whoopee.
Right.
Now, it's very important that you do exactly what I'm about to tell you.
Oh.
Okay.
The Book is assembled by 10:00, 10:30... and you must wait around for it until then.
You will be delivering Miranda's dry cleaning with the Book.
Now, the car will take you straight to Miranda's townhouse.
You let yourself in.
Andrea.
You do not talk to anyone.
Do not look at anyone.
This is of the utmost importance.
You must be invisible.
- Do you understand?
- Uh-huh.
You open the door and you walk across the foyer.
You hang the dry cleaning in the closet across from the staircase.
- Uh-
- And you leave the Book on the table with the flowers.
- Shit!
- It's that door to the left.
Okay.
Thank you.
- You can give the Book to us.
- Shh.
Which-Which table?
- It's okay.
Come on up.
- No, I can't.
I can't.
- What?
It's okay.
- Come on.
- Yeah, come on.
It's okay.
- Please stop talking.
Or you can bring the Book upstairs.
Emily does it all the time.
She does?
Right.
She does, all the time.
Yeah?
Okay.
What did you expect me to do, walk out in the middle of a cover shoot?
I rushed out of an investment committee meeting... and I sat there waiting for you for almost an hour.
I told you the cellphones didn't work.
Nobody could get a signal out.
I knew what everyone in that restaurant was thinking- there he is, waiting for her again.
- Okay, okay!
Okay, okay.
- Oh, no.
Shh!
It really wasn't that big a deal.
I promise.
The twins said hello, so I said hello back.
- Then I went up the stairs to give her the Book and-
- You went upstairs?
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you just climb into bed with her and ask for a bedtime story?
Okay, I made a mistake.
I know.
Andrea, you don't understand.
If you get fired, that might jeopardize Paris for me.
If that happens, I will search every Blimpie's in the tristate area until I track you down.
She's gonna fire me?
I don't know.
She's not happy.
Andrea?
Miranda, about last night, I-
I need the new Harry Potter book for the twins.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll go down to Barnes Noble right now.
Did you fall down and smack your little head on the pavement?
Not that I can recall.
We have all the published Harry Potter books.
The twins want to know what happens next.
You want the unpublished manuscript?
We know everyone in publishing.
It shouldn't be a problem, should it?
And you can do anything, right?
Yes, Bobbsey.
I know, baby.
Mommy's working very hard to get it for you.
She doesn't get it.
I could call frickin' J.K. Rowling herself.
I'm not gonna get a copy of that book.
My girls are leaving on the train for their grandmother's at 4:00... so the book better be here no later than 3:00.
- Of course!
- And I would like my steak here in 15 minutes.
No problem!
Okay.
I have four hours to get the impossible manuscript.
Smith Wollensky's doesn't open until 11:30.
How am I gonna get the steak?
Okay.
I will be back in 15 minutes.
- Wish me luck!
- No.
Shan't.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
I've been on hold.
It's for Miranda Priestly.
It's very important.
Yes, I know it's impossible to get... but, well, I was wondering if you could make the impossible possible... if that's at all possible.
Yes, I'm calling about the Harry Potter manuscript.
Uh, no.
Unpublished.
Not a chance?
Tell her that it's for Miranda Priestly.
'Cause I think it makes a difference.
Let me call you back.
You probably don't remember me.
We met at James Holt's party.
I'm Miranda Priestly's assistant.
The Harry Potter manuscript?
Oh, you're kidding.
Uh, sorry to ask, but I'm desperate.
Just tell her it can't be done.
You'll have to come up with a Plan "B."
Well, this is Miranda Priestly we're talking about.
There is no Plan "B." There's only Plan "A."
Is she back?
Am I fired?
I rarely say this to people who aren't me... but you have got to calm down.
Bloody hell!
Coat, bag.
What's that?
Oh, I don't want that.
I'm having lunch with Irv.
I'll be back at 3:00.
I'd like my Starbucks waiting.
Oh, and if you don't have that Harry Potter book by then... don't even bother coming back.
Hello.
Quit?
Are you sure?
I failed.
She's gonna fire me anyway.
- I might as well beat her to the punch.
- Wow.
Andy, good for you.
Congratulations.
You're free.
- Yeah.
Well, listen, I'll call you later.
- Okay.
Hello.
I'm brilliant.
No, really.
- Monuments should be erected in my honor.
- You didn't.
Oh, yes.
A friend of a friend does the cover art... and she happens to have the manuscript.
Oh, no, 'cause that would mean that I actually did something right.
It's just
- Oh!
The thing is, Christian, I was just-
Look, you want this thing, you better hurry.
I'll meet you at the St. Regis.
Excuse me.
- Welcome to the St. Regis.
May I assist you with anything?
- Oh.
Yes.
- Uh, I'm meeting someone at the King Cole Bar.
- Right this way.
Hi.
- You have one hour.
- Thank you.
One copy.
What are my twins gonna do with that?
Share?
Oh, no, I made two copies... and had them covered, reset and bound so that they wouldn't look like manuscripts.
This is an extra copy to have on file.
You know, just in case.
Well, where are these fabulous copies?
I don't see them anywhere.
They're with the twins, on the train on the way to Grandma's.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Mm-mmm.
That's all.
Okay.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I went to Dean Deluca.
Man, they charge, like, five dollars a strawberry there.
But I figure since you quit your job... we should celebrate.
- Listen, Nate.
- Wait a minute.
You quit your job, but you're still working on the twins' science project?
Well, that's big of you.
Okay, after we talked, I realized... it doesn't make sense throwing away all those months of hard work.
I just had a moment of weakness, that's all.
Yeah, well, either that, or your job sucks and your boss is a wacko.
All right.
Whatever.
It's your job.
Nate.
Come on.
I'm still the same person I was.
I still want the same things.
Okay?
- Mm-hmm.
- I promise.
Same Andy, better clothes.
I like the old clothes.
Really?
Well, what about these necklaces?
Do you like them?
No?
And this dress, it's new.
Eh.
Well, there is one other thing that's new... that I thought you might like.
But, uh-What about this?
You don't like it.
I should better do-
No, no, no, no.
Is this number two look?
This is number two?
- Hi.
- Hi.
All right.
Turn around for me, darling.
Oh, I get it.
I get it.
I get it.
The piece is called "urban jungle," right?
Yes, the modern woman unleashes the animal within to take on the big city.
Good.
Go.
Sometimes I can't believe I talk about this crap all day.
- Bobby, come here.
Let me see.
- Oh, thank you.
- Make sure Miranda gets these as soon as possible.
- Mm-hmm.
And tell her I switched in the Dior for the Rocha.
- Oh, great.
Can't wait.
- Excuse me.
- Can we adjust the attitude?
- I'm sorry.
- Don't make me feed you to one of the models.
- I'm sorry.
It's a busy day.
My personal life is hanging by a thread, that's all.
Join the club.
That's what happens when you start doing well at work, darling.
Let me know when your whole life goes up in smoke.
That means it's time for a promotion.
No.
All right, February, back of the issue.
Did anybody speak with Salma's people yet?
Yes, but she'd rather do a summer cover because she has a movie coming out.
No.
Also, I'm pulling the Toobin piece on the Supreme Court women- woman.
And I need to see a new draft on that piece... about shopping for a plastic surgeon- It's dull.
And this layout for the Winter Wonderland spread.
Not wonderful yet.
Oh, okay.
I-I'll look at it.
What about Testino?
Where are we on that?
Zac Posen's doing some very sculptural suits.
So I suggested that, uh, Testino shoot them at the Noguchi Garden.
Perfect.
Thank God somebody came to work today.
What about accessories for April?
One thought I had was enamel.
Um, bangles, pendants, earrings.
No.
We did that two years ago.
What else?
Um, well, they're showing a lot of florals right now, so I was thinking-
Florals?
For spring?
Groundbreaking.
But we thought about shooting them in an industrial space.
We thought the contrast between the femininity of the florals... and the more raw, rough-hewn background would create this wonderful tension between-
- No.
- Which?
No.
Does anybody else have anything I can possibly use?
Antibacterial wipes perhaps?
- How's the cold doing?
- Like death warmed up actually.
Oh, God.
It's the benefit tonight.
I've been looking forward to it for months.
I refuse to be sick.
I'm wearing Valentino, for crying out loud.
Right.
Well, everybody will be leaving soon to get ready... so I suggest you go and drop Miranda's Fendi bag off at the showroom... and then I suppose you can just go home.
Yeah?
Oh, well, that is great.
Perfect actually.
I need to get to Magnolia Bakery before it closes.
It's Nate's birthday tonight.
So we're, uh, having a little party for him.
Yeah, I'm hearing this, and I wanna hear this.
Bye.
I love my job.
I love my job.
I love my job.
Hello?
Before the benefit tonight, I need to make sure... that you're both fully prepped on the guest list.
But I thought that only the first assistant went to the benefit.
Only when the first assistant hasn't decided to become... an incubus of viral plague.
You'll come and help Emily.
- That's all.
- Right.
These are all of the guests.
Miranda invites everyone.
We have to make sure that they all think she knows exactly who they are.
And I've been studying for weeks.
I have to learn all these by tonight?
No, don't be silly, Andrea.
These too.
Look, you better just start without me, okay?
I'll get there as soon as I can.
Andy, come on, it's his birth-
Okay, but hurry.
Oh, please, believe me, I will.
This is the last thing that I wanna-
Ooh, I love that.
Uh, I'll call you the second I'm leaving, okay?
- Will that fit me?
- Oh, yeah.
A little Crisco and some fishing line, and we're in business.
Well, nothing really.
I mean, this is-
I mean, really, this is the social event of the season.
Oh, oh, my God.
Andy, you look so chic.
Oh, thanks, Em.
You look so thin.
- Do I?
- Yeah.
Oh, it's for Paris.
I'm on this new diet.
It's very effective.
Well, I don't eat anything.
And then when I feel like I'm about to faint, I eat a cube of cheese.
- Well, it's definitely working.
- I know.
I'm just one stomach flu away from my goal weight.
That's John Folger, the new artistic director of the Chelsea Rep.
- John, thanks for coming.
- Hey there.
- Oh, thank you.
It's always nice seeing you.
- Stop fidgeting.
I'm sorry.
I'm so late.
Just deal with it.
You have to be here.
Emily, come here.
Isn't that Jacqueline Follet from French Runway?
Oh, my God, and Miranda hates her.
She was supposed to arrive after Miranda left.
- I didn't
- Oh.
- Yeah.
- Miranda, fabulous event as always.
- You brought Jacqueline.
- Surprise.
- Quelle surprise.
Oh, wonderful.
We're so happy you were able to come to our little gathering.
Of course.
I plan my whole year around this.
Well, we're so grateful that you do.
- Ciao.
- Have you gotten my note?
Yes, I did.
We'll discuss it on Wednesday.
- Yes, I agree.
No business tonight.
- Not tonight.
Enjoy.
Em.
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.
Oh, um
- Oh, my God.
I just can't remember what his name is.
I just saw his name this morning on the list.
It's
- Oh, I know this.
It's something to do with-
Wait, he was- he was part of the- Oh, God, I know this.
Um-
It's Ambassador Franklin, and that's the woman that he left his wife for, Rebecca.
- Rebecca.
Ambassador.
- Miranda.
- You look fabulous.
- Oh, very kind.
Thank you.
- Look at you.
- Hello.
You're-You're a vision.
- Oh.
- Thank God I saved your job.
You know, I figured out a few things on my own too.
Turns out, I'm not as nice as you thought.
I hope not.
Well, if it weren't for the stupid boyfriend...
I'd have to whisk you away right here and now.
- Do you actually say things like that to people?
- Evidently.
Well, I gotta go.
Are you sure?
'Cause my editor for New York Magazine is inside... and, you know, I could introduce you two.
- You sent over your stuff for me to look at?
Remember?
- Yeah.
All right, I gotta admit, I only read a couple.
It was a very large packet you sent.
- Yeah.
- But what I did read wasn't half bad.
And, you know, I think- I think you have a talent, Andy.
He should meet you.
Why don't you come in?
Just for one drink.
Um, okay, yeah.
I guess I could for one-
No, I can't.
I'm sorry, but I have to go.
All right.
Give my best to the boyfriend.
Roy, I'm sorry.
Can you go any faster?
I'm sure Nate will understand.
Yeah.
Hey.
Happy birthday.
Nate, I'm so sorry.
I kept trying to leave, but there was a lot going on.
And, you know, I didn't have a choice.
Don't worry about it.
I'm gonna go to bed.
Can we at least talk about this?
You look really pretty.
Andrea?
- Do you have the Book?
- Oh.
Uh-
Mm.
Paris is the most important week of my entire year.
I need the best possible team with me.
That no longer includes Emily.
Wait.
You want me to-
No, Miranda.
Emily would die.
Her whole life is about Paris.
She hasn't eaten in weeks.
I
- I can't... do that.
Miranda, I can't.
If you don't go, I'll assume you're not serious about your future... at Runway or any other publication.
The decision's yours.
That's all.
Hey, Andy.
- Hey.
- You coming to bed anytime soon?
Uh, yeah.
Five minutes, okay?
Andrea, don't forget to tell Emily.
Do it now.
Don't pick up.
- Don't pick up.
Don't pick up.
Don't pick-
- Hi.
- Emily.
- Hi, hi.
Sorry I'm late.
It's just Miranda wanted some scarves from Hermès.
And she did tell me yesterday, but I forgot like an idiot.
And so I freaked out, of course.
Emily, Emily, I-I need to talk to you.
I called Martine at home, and she opened the shop early.
Whoa!
I'm sorry.
She opened the shop early for me, so I got them, which is great.
Okay.
Um, Emily, wh-when you come in... there's something I have to talk to you about.
- Well, I hope it's not another Miranda problem.
- Not exactly.
Well, good, because I've got so much to deal with before I go.
I swear to God-
Oh, my God!
Emily?
I don't care if she was gonna fire you or beat you with a red-hot poker!
You should have said no.
Emily, I didn't have a choice.
- Oh.
Please.
- You know how she is.
That is a pathetic excuse.
Thanks.
Do you know what really just... gets me about this whole thing... is that, you know, you're the one who said you don't really care about this stuff.
And you don't really care about fashion.
You just wanna be a journalist.
What a pile of bollocks!
Emily, I know you're mad.
I don't blame you.
Face it, you sold your soul the day you put on that first pair of Jimmy Choo's.
I saw it.
And you know what really just kills me about this whole thing... is the clothes that you're gonna get.
I mean, you don't deserve them.
You eat carbs, for Christ's sake.
God, it's so unfair!
- Emily.
- Just go.
- Emily, I-
- I said go!
- You are going to Paris for the couture shows?
- Mm-hmm.
- That's the coolest fashion event of the year.
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, who are you going to see, Galliano?
- Yeah.
- And Lagerfeld and Nicholas Ghesquiere.
- Yep.
Yes.
Okay, now you're scaring me.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- This show is amazing.
I am so proud of you.
- Thank you.
Okay, start with the photos in the back and work your way forward.
That is the way I designed it.
It is brilliant.
- You will love it.
- Of course.
And you, I have somebody I want you to meet, okay?
Ooh, art and sex.
Lead the way.
- See you later.
- Okay.
Hey.
Hey, Miranda girl.
- Hi.
- I was just thinking about you.
Oh, come on.
- It's true.
- No.
I'm profiling Gaultier for Interview and, uh, making my Paris plans.
I found myself wondering if, uh, you were gonna be there.
Well, actually, um, I am going.
Great.
I'm staying in a fantastic little hotel in the Seventh... right across the street from the falafel restaurant that will change your life.
I'm sorry.
I'll be too busy working.
You'll have to find someone else's life to change.
Well, that's just it.
I'm beginning to wonder if I can.
Lily.
Lily, he's just a guy I know from work.
- Yeah, that looked like work.
- Look, you're making a big deal out of-
You know, the Andy I know is madly in love with Nate... is always five minutes early... and thinks, I don't know, Club Monaco is couture.
For the last 16 years, I've known everything about that Andy.
But this person?
This "glamazon" who skulks around in corners... with some random hot fashion guy?
I don't get her.
- Lily.
- Have fun in Paris.
You going to Paris?
Uh, yeah.
It just happened.
I thought Paris was a big deal for Emily or-
Great.
Now you're gonna give me a hard time too?
Hey, Andy.
Andy!
- Andy, what the hell is wrong with you?
- I-I didn't have a choice, okay?
- Miranda asked me, and I couldn't say no.
- I know.
That's your answer for everything lately, "I didn't have a choice. "
- Like this job was forced on you.
- Nate, I get it, okay?
Like you don't make these decisions yourself.
You're mad because I work late all the time and I missed your birthday party.
- And I'm sorry.
- Oh, come on.
What am I, four?
You-You hate Runway and Miranda.
And you think fashion is stupid.
You've made that clear.
Andy, I make port wine reductions all day.
I'm not exactly in the Peace Corps.
You know, I wouldn't care if you were out there pole dancing all night... as long as you did it with a little integrity.
You used to say this was just a job.
You used to make fun of the Runway girls.
What happened?
Now you've become one of them.
- That's absurd.
- That's okay.
That's fine.
Just own up to it.
And then we can stop pretending like we have anything in common anymore.
- You don't mean that, do you?
- No, I do.
Well... maybe this trip is coming at a good time.
Maybe we should take a break.
Nate?
I'm sorry.
Just... one second?
You know, in case you were wondering... the person whose calls you always take, that's the relationship you're in.
I hope you two are very happy together.
Hello, Miranda.
Pardon.
Miranda.
Maestro.
Mmm.
How are you?
So glad to see you.
Thank you for coming.
- You like the collection?
- Absolutely.
I think it's the best in years.
- This is very important for me.
Very, very important.
- I'm very happy for you.
- This is my new Emily.
- Hello.
How do you do?
- I'm good.
Pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.
You love the show?
Miranda.
This way!
Miranda.
Nigel.
Fashion's great gatekeepers.
Miranda, what is Runway's position on French fashion versus American fashion?
- I've been thinking-
- Oh.
- You still owe me for Harry Potter.
- Oh, do I?
- Of course you do.
Are you working tonight?
- Oh!
- No, actually Miranda has a dinner.
- Great, you're free.
Oh, but there is the problem of le boyfriend.
Wait, don't tell me.
The boyfriend non plus?
Je suis très, très desolé.
Oh, you're so full of it.
You're not desolé at all.
No, not even a little.
What time should I pick you up?
- Uh-
- I'll call you.
Yeah.
Oh.
Oh, there you are.
We need to go over the seating, uh, chart for the luncheon.
Okay.
Um, yeah, sure.
I have it right here.
By all means, move at a glacial pace.
You know how that thrills me.
Okay.
So... first of all, we need to move Snoop Dogg to my table.
But your table's full.
Stephen isn't coming.
Oh, Stephen is-
So I don't need to fetch Stephen from the airport tomorrow?
Well, if you speak to him and he decides to rethink the divorce... then, yes, fetch away.
You're very fetching, so go fetch.
And then when we get back to New York, we need to contact, um...
Leslie to see what she can do to minimize the press... on all this.
Another divorce... splashed across page six.
I can just imagine what they're gonna write about me.
The Dragon Lady, career-obsessed.
Snow Queen drives away another Mr. Priestly.
Rupert Murdoch should cut me a check... for all the papers I sell for him.
Anyway, I don't-
I don't really care what anybody writes about me.
But my- my girls, I just-
It's just so unfair to the girls.
It's just... another disappointment... another letdown, another father... figure- gone.
Anyway, the point is-
The point is-
The point is we really need to figure out where to place Donatella... because she's barely speaking to anyone.
I'm so sorry, Miranda.
If you want me to cancel your evening, I can.
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would we do that?
Um, is-
Is there anything else I can do?
Your job.
That's all.
Hi.
I need Miranda's itinerary for tomorrow.
- Okay.
Come on in.
- All right?
Thanks.
- Who put that together for you?
- This?
Oh, it's just- it's just something I threw on.
Turn around.
Let me see.
Turn.
- Mm.
Incroyable.
- Yeah?
- It's really just
- No, it's
- No, gorgeous.
- Yeah?
Okay, good.
Really.
I think that my work here is done.
Oh.
We're going to celebrate.
I'm going to get some champagne.
Okay.
What are we toasting?
We are toasting, my dear, to the dream job.
The one that a million girls wanted.
Which I got months ago.
I'm not talking about you.
Mm-hmm.
- James Holt-
- Yeah.
Massimo Corteleoni... is investing in James's company and taking it global.
- Mm-hmm.
- Bags, shoes, fragrances- the works.
And James needs a partner.
And that partner would be me.
- Does Miranda-
- No, no, Miranda knows, because-
- Oh.
- Oh, she put me up for it.
God, no.
Can you imagine?
But
- But
- But you're leaving.
- Mm-hmm.
- I can't imagine Runway without you.
I know, I know, but I'm so excited though.
This is the first time in 18 years I'm going to be able to call the shots in my own life.
Oh, my God!
I'm going to be able to come to Paris and actually see Paris.
Well, congratulations.
- Huh?
Oh.
- Nigel, you deserve it.
You bet your size-six ass.
- Four.
- Really?
Cheers.
- Cheers to you.
- To us.
Let me see that.
Okay, I just wanna say that yes, there are things Miranda does that I don't agree with, but-
- Come on.
You hate her.
Just admit it to me.
- No.
She's a
- She's a notorious sadist... and not- not in a good way.
Okay, she's tough, but if Miranda were a man... no one would notice anything about her, except how great she is at her job.
I'm sorry.
I can't-
- I can't believe this.
You're defending her?
- Yeah.
The wide-eyed girl peddling her earnest newspaper stories?
You, my friend, are crossing over to the dark side.
I resent that.
- You shouldn't.
It's sexy.
- Sexy?
- Really?
- Really.
So do you- do you know where we're going?
- 'Cause I'm lost.
- Yeah.
Yeah, don't worry.
I know this city like the back of my hand.
It's my favorite place in the whole world.
You know, Gertrude Stein once said...
"America is my country, and Paris is my hometown. "
It's true.
What do you do?
Do you just write stuff like that down... and then file it away to use on us girls?
- I'm Christian Thompson.
That's my way.
- That's your way.
Right.
I work freelance.
I have a lot of free time on my hands.
You know, I never understood... why everyone was so crazy about Paris... but... it is so beautiful.
Mm.
I-I can't.
I'm sorry.
I can't.
You know, Nate and I just split up a couple days ago, and I can't.
Ooh.
I've had too much wine.
And my hearing-vision- judgment's impaired.
No, I barely know you.
I'm in a strange city.
I... am out of excuses.
Thank God.
Yes.
Oh, shoot.
Bonjour, madame.
Uh, what the hell is this?
What does it look like?
It's a mock-up.
Yeah.
Of?
Of what American Runway will look like when Jacqueline Follet is the new editor in chief.
Wh-They're replacing Miranda?
Yeah.
And she's bringing me in to run all the editorial content.
You're really surprised?
Jacqueline's a lot younger than Miranda.
She has a fresher take on things.
Not to mention American Runway's one of the most expensive books in the business.
Jacqueline does the same thing for a lot less money.
And Irv- Irv's a businessman, you know.
Miranda will be devastated.
Her whole life is about Runway.
He can't do that to her.
It's done.
Irv's gonna tell Miranda after the party for James.
And she has no idea?
She's a big girl.
She'll be fine.
Shi
- I have to go.
Andy.
Andy, it's done.
Baby, it's done.
I'm not your baby.
Allo.
Oh!
Oh!
Thank God you're there.
- Excuse me?
- I need to talk to you right away.
It's about Jacqueline Follet.
Shit!
Oh, shit!
Shit, shit, shit!
- Yes.
- Mr. Ravitz, I'm so sorry to bother you.
I was wondering-
Have you completely lost your mind?
- I need to talk to you.
- Do not disturb me again.
But, um, it's just for one
- Miranda!
Miranda.
Miranda.
Wait, I need to talk to you.
Irv is making Jacqueline Follet the editor in chief of Runway.
Christian Thompson told me he's gonna work for her.
Irv is going to tell you today.
I thought maybe if I told you, that you could fix it.
Do I smell freesias?
What?
No.
I
- I specifically told them-
If I see freesias anywhere...
I will be very disappointed.
For 72 years, Runway has been more than a magazine.
It has been a beacon of elegance and grace.
Miranda Priestly is the finest possible guardian of that beacon... setting a standard that inspires people across the globe.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Miranda Priestly.
Thank you, my dear friend.
Bonjour.
Thank you very much for coming today... to help celebrate our dear friend, James Holt.
But before I talk to you about James... and his many accomplishments...
I would like first to share some news with you.
Um, as many of you know... uh, recently Massimo Corteleoni... has agreed to finance the expansion of the James Holt label... transforming the work of this visionary artist... into a global brand, which is really an exciting enterprise.
Runway and James Holt share many things in common... chief among them, a commitment to excellence.
And so, it should come as no surprise that when the time came... for James to choose the new president of James Holt International... he chose from within the Runway family.
And it's my great happiness today... to announce to you all that that person... is my friend and longtime esteemed colleague...
Jacqueline Follet.
Thank you.
Merci.
And now to the main event... our celebration of James Holt.
We at Runway are very proud to have been-
When the time is right, she'll pay me back.
You sure about that?
No.
But I hope for the best.
I have to.
You thought I didn't know.
I've known what was happening for quite some time.
It just took me a little while to find a suitable alternative for Jacqueline.
And that James Holtjob was so absurdly overpaid... that, of course, she jumped at it.
So I just had to tell Irv that Jacqueline was unavailable.
The truth is, there is no one that can do what I do... including her.
Any of the other choices would have found that job impossible... and the magazine would have suffered.
Especially because of the list.
The list of designers, photographers... editors, writers, models, all of whom were found by me, nurtured by me... and have promised me they will follow me... whenever and if ever I choose to leave Runway.
So he reconsidered.
But I was very, very impressed... by how intently you tried to warn me.
I never thought I would say this, Andrea... but I really-
I see a great deal of myself in you.
You can see beyond what people want and what they need... and you can choose for yourself.
I don't think I'm like that.
I-
I couldn't do what you did to Nigel, Miranda.
I couldn't do something like that.
Mm.
You already did.
To Emily.
That's not what I-
No, that was- that was different.
I didn't have a choice.
Oh, no, you chose.
You chose to get ahead.
You want this life, those choices are necessary.
But what if this isn't what I want?
I mean, what if I don't wanna live the way you live?
Don't be ridiculous, Andrea.
Everybody wants this.
Everybody wants to be us.
I have to be at work in 20 minutes.
What's up?
Well, I just-
I wanted to say that you were right about everything.
That...
I turned my back on my friends and my family... and everything I believed in... and- and for what?
For shoes and shirts and jackets and belts.
Nate.
I'm sorry.
I-
I flew up to Boston while you were gone.
I interviewed at the Oak Room.
And?
And you're looking at their new sous-chef.
- I'm moving up there in a couple weeks.
- That's great.
Congratulations.
I don't know what I'm gonna do without those late-night grilled cheeses, but-
I'm pretty sure they have bread in Boston.
May even have Jarlsberg.
We might be able to figure something out.
You think?
Yeah.
So, what about you?
I mean, what are you gonna do now?
Actually, I, uh- I have a job interview today.
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
That's what you're wearing?
Shut up.
I like this.
- Andy, Greg Hill.
- Hello.
Come on.
These clips are excellent.
This thing on the janitors' union, that's exactly what we do here.
My only question is, Runway?
You were there for less than a year.
What the hell kind of a blip is that?
Learned a lot.
In the end though, I kind of screwed it up.
I called over there for a reference, left word with some snooty girl.
Next thing you know, I got a fax from Miranda Priestly herself... saying that of all the assistants she's ever had... you were, by far, her biggest disappointment.
And, if I don't hire you, I am an idiot.
You must have done something right.
Miranda Priestly's office.
Hey, Emily, it's Andy.
Don't hang up.
I have a favor to ask you.
You have a favor to ask of me?
Yeah.
The thing is, I have all these clothes from Paris... and I don't have anyplace to wear them... so I was wondering if you could take them off my hands.
Well, I don't know.
It's a huge imposition.
And I'll have to get them taken in.
I mean, they'll drown me.
But I suppose I could help you out.
I will have Roy pick them up this afternoon.
Thanks, Em.
I appreciate it.
Good luck.
You have some very large shoes to fill.
I hope you know that.
I don't understand why it is so challenging... to get my car when I ask for it.
Go.
The Song is Over
Ladies and Gentlemen, may I ask for your kind attention, please!
Ladies and Gentlemen, I raise my glass!
You will say that's not unusual, because I raise it every day, and rather often, too, but when I raise it now, then I raise it not without feeling uplifted.
Because once again we are celebrating our dear, venerated Tilla Morland.
We are celebrating her victory today, her triumph, her success.
Because what would the theatre be without her art, without her charm, in a word, without Tilla Morland?
Because today's premiere was a landmark was a landmark on the road of her stage successes.
I raise my glass in the hope that I'll soon raise it again on such a landmark... such an occasion.
Cheers, Tilla!
Normally those three birds always sit with us at the bar.
But when the Morland is here, they are carousing over there.
Who are those gentlemen?
They are the Morland's "Three Magi".
Who is the one with the two pearls in his waistcoat.
The rich manufacturer's son Toenli.
Her future lover.
And the one with one waistcoat pearl?
The music editor Teschner.
Her current one.
And the one without a pearl?
A baron.
He's lost all his money.
Her former lover.
And now, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Tilla Morland will give you the great pleasure to perform for you once more the song from the third act of today's show.
You're crazy, Baron.
I have no intention to sing.
Oh, Tilla my dear, please sing.
Look, the crowd is eager for it.
Sit down and be quiet!
I won't sing.
You have to sing.
If you won't sing, I'll sing, because singing there must be!
# Adieu, my little Guards officer...
He doesn't sing beautifully.
- But loud.
# Farewell, my little Guards officer...
Madame, I beg you to sing, otherwise he'll never stop.
Tilla, I fear you'll have to bail us out.
# And one day, with much ado, # an ensign entered the Guards # an ensign young, imprudent, and slender, # on his cap the golden cockade.
# And the mother stood before her son, # and she took his hands, # and she gave him a small locket # and said to her boy:
# Adieu, my little Guards officer, adieu, # adieu, and don't forget me, and don't forget me.
# Adieu, my little Guards officer, adieu, # adieu, and may chance be with you, and may chance be with you!
# Stand upright, bolt upright, # and go laughing into the sunny day, whatever may happen.
# If you have a sorrowful countenance, away with it, tralalalala,
# Let gloom belong to others!
# Adieu, my little Guards officer, adieu, # adieu, and don't forget me, and don't forget me.
# And one day, at 9 o'clock in the morning, # when he awoke from his dreams, # the whole company was assembled on the main square # and they were waiting since a quarter to 8.
# From blue eyes, so deep and beautiful # he received a surprised expression.
# He said:
Darling, I have to leave!
# And she replied, still half asleep:
# Adieu, my little Guards officer, adieu, # adieu, and don't forget me, and don't forget me.
# Adieu, my little Guards officer, adieu, # adieu, and may chance be with you, and may chance be with you!
# Stand upright, bolt upright, # and go laughing into the sunny day, whatever may happen.
# If you have a sorrowful countenance, away with it, tralalala,
# Let gloom belong to others!
# Adieu, my little Guards officer, # adieu, adieu, and don't forget me, and don't forget me.
# And one day, everything was over, # the armistice was announced at last, # all the soldiers were sent home, # to get a newjob for themselves.
# The old Guardsmen stood tired and pale # around their field-marshal,
# the last tattoo was sounded, # and the field-marshal said quietly:
# Adieu, my little Guards officer, adieu, # adieu, and don't forget me, and don't forget me.
Waiter, the bill!
Pardon, Tilla, but...
You're powerless in a case like that.
Such a lout!
A lout?
A barbarian!
A barbarian?
He's a Barbarossa!
A thousand apologies, Madame!
This is terribly embarassing.
Especially tonight, after the premiere, it's appalling...
But my dear Director, why get excited?
Please, take me home.
Oh, Tilla, you don't want to leave...
Because of such an... anarchist!
Don't do this to us, little Tilla, now that it's getting nice and comfy here!
I want to go home.
I have too much self-respect to let myself be insulted in public.
Madame, a thousand apologies.
I'm terribly embarassed by what has happened.
And we don't even know who that man is!
A thousand kisses, with love Your Ulli.
And you call yourselves my friends!
And when for once I ask you to do me a favour, you all fail!
I really don't know why you came here at all!
Have you found him?
No!
So what do you want this early in the morning?
We wanted to calm you down, Tilla.
Calm me down?
But I am quite calm!
Tilla, we tried everything.
Nobody knows who that guy was.
I walked through all the streets.
Suddenly I saw him, but it wasrt he.
I made a tour of all the bars the whole night, because I thought I might find him there.
That's another good excuse for drinking, Baron.
But Tilla.
Speaking of drinking...
Cheers!
Perhaps we will find out something now.
Hello, Tilla Morland speaking.
Hello?
Tilla, is it you?
This is Emmy.
I just arrived at the theatre for the rehearsal and heard about yesterday's incident.
How embarassing!
How terrible!
If that happened to me, I would die of shame.
Of course.
My best friend already knows about it.
It's Emmy.
Emmy.
If she knows about it, the whole town will hear it within five minutes.
I hope the newspapers won't hear about it.
What?
I?
How can you say such a thing!
But no, I won't breathe a word.
To noone, my word of honour.
Great word of honour!
Sure.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Tilla!
Hello?
Get me the operator again.
Yes, 4576, please.
Yes, is that the 'Little Journal'?
I'd like to talk to Dr. Fischer from the theatre column.
This is Emmy Stein from the New Operetta Theatre.
Hello?
Dr. Fischer?
Yes?
Good morning!
Tell me, have you already heard the news?
Do you know what happened last night in the Carlton bar?
I'd only like to know why that man left.
Perhaps he didn't like your speech, Baron.
My speech?
Why my speech?
Then he wouldn't have left during the song.
Perhaps he didn't like the music.
- Very true.
But why the music of all things?
The talk of a publisher.
Of course he won't hear a word against his music.
Listen Tilla, no one ever left because of music from my publishing house.
Nor because of my performance.
But nobody said that.
In any case...
In any case you're innocent again.
Of course, only I am to blame.
But he never said that!
You'd better be quiet, Baron.
If you hadrt asked me to sing, all this wouldn't have happened.
Of course, only I am to blame.
Of course you are, who else?
Of course, who else.
Well, Madame, it's possible that a man has to... step outside for a moment.
You dare mention such a thing to my face, you...
You suckling!
Do you want to step outside as well, perhaps?
If only you too had left, no one would have kept you.
You may all leave now, all of you!
Tilla, please be sensible!
Because of such a bagatelle, Tilla.
What?
You call that a bagatelle!
If someone insults me in public?
That is a bagatelle?
I've had enough of you!
I don't want to see you again!
Adieu, Gentlemen!
- Suckling!
Because of my music!
But there must have been something he didn't like.
I don't want to see any of you three again!
They behaved horridly.
And what will Madame do without the three gentlemen?
Herr Teschner managed all affairs with the theatre and the grammophone company.
Then someone else will take care of them!
And Herr Toenli managed all your financial affairs.
Invoices, taxes, fees...
Someone will be found for that, too.
And who will be found whom you can shout at like the Baron?
I'll shout at someone else.
Yes, but at whom?
I'll engage a private secretary.
He can take care of my affairs.
I'll pay him.
And I'll shout at him as much as I like.
I don't need favours from my friends anymore.
A private secretary?
He'll only steal your cigarettes and drink your cognac.
Not a bad idea at all, a private secretary...
I could have used someone like that long since.
I'll place an advertisement.
Private secretary wanted for lady artist
Interviews at the New Operetta Theatre on the 21st at 11 a.m.
Good morning, Gentlemen.
I thank you, Gentlemen.
But I must inform you that the post of private secretary has already been taken.
Perhaps another time.
You stay here!
#...
Guards officer, adieu, adieu.
# And don't forget me, and don't forget me.
You apply for the post?
Yes, Madame.
What's your name?
- Ulrich Weidenau.
What are your abilities?
Everything a secretary has to be capable of, Madame.
You are... engaged.
Thank you, Madame.
You are the man I need.
Why, Madame?
Because you found someone I have been searching for for the last three days.
Is that so?
I have been searching for the man with the worst manners in the world.
Do you know who I have in mind?
Yes, Madame.
And who is that man with the worst manners in the world?
I, Madame.
Indeed!
You!
You and nobody else!
Would you like to explain to me now... why you asked for the bill in the middle of the song that night?
But one has to pay the bill before leaving, Madame.
Yes, but why did you leave?
Didrt you like my voice, my dress, my hairstyle?
I found your hairstyle adorable.
And my dress?
- Wonderful.
And my voice?
- Enchanting.
But what was the reason you left, then?
The song.
The song you were singing, Madame.
The song?
The song about the little Guards officer.
You know, Madame, the melody was very nice.
But the lyrics...
Please try to imagine, someone really once was such a Guards officer and has gone through the same troubles as the one in your song.
And now all this is the theme of a song... performed in nightclubs, for the amusement of others.
So, you once were such a...
Guards officer, yes.
And now everything is over.
It's even a good thing that it's over, with the uniforms, flags and so on.
We went bankrupt, so to speak.
But have you ever heard a song about a bankrupt banker?
No.
- So you see.
But everyone is singing about us.
And you know, if you listen to something like that about the past, and the old days, and even if you don't think about it anymore a hundred times, it does hurt a little.
And that's why I left.
Are you still very angry with me, Madame?
Well, I must say this is the only reason I would never have thought of.
Perhaps you would have been forever cross with me due to that little song.
What kind of songs should I sing then, so that you don't run off again?
Funny ones, modern ones, with syncopes for dancing.
For example something like this!
# If I could lie like Münchhausen, # or if I could fly like Eckener, # or if I could write poetry like Roda Roda # or if I were as flexible and pliant as a bayadere, # if I were as popular with women as Liedtke,
# or if I could broadcast like Alfred Braun:
# Yes, if the little word 'if' did not exist, # dududu dududu
# I would already be a millionaire.
# Dududu dududu
# Every day I could draw money, # a thousand francs from the bank, # and live like the Shah of Persia, # all my life long.
# Yes, if the little word 'if' did not exist # diddledida dida dada dada
# I would already be a millionaire.
# Shshsh shshsh
# Then for you there would be only one man, and noone else,
# Yes, if the little word 'if' did not exist, yes, if.
For example something like this, Madame.
Bravo, bravo, you are a perfect chansonnier!
What else can you do?
At your service:
Dancing, singing, typing, stenography,
English and French, horse-riding, chauffeuring, card tricks and fishing.
Well, you won't have much opportunity for that with me.
That's regrettable, Ma...
So it's a deal!
You'll stay with me.
What about the fee?
We won't need an arbitrator, Madame.
- We'll talk about it later.
Listen, the first thing you have to do is to arrange a tea party this afternoon at my apartment.
I expect 15 guests at 5 o'clock sharp.
All right, Madame, everything will be arranged at 5 o'clock sharp.
The hazelnut cake is like a poem!
The sandwiches are fabulous today.
And the coffee?
- Like in Vienna at Dehmel's.
Yes, excellent.
- Wonderful.
I think everything today is so... exquisite.
For the first time there is Bols!
I don't usually drink, but...
I will have a swig of it.
7-8-9-10-11-12-13?
Heavens, we are 13 at the table?
Well, I'm leaving at once.
- But why 13?
I invited 14, haven't I?
Under no circumstances will I stay here as the 13th, I'm leaving!
Stay, stay, we shall be 14 right now.
Where's Herr Weidenau?
In the kitchen, he shows the cook how to prepare an "ox-muzzle salad".
Please tell him to come.
- Yes, Madame.
Herr Weidenau?
- In the kitchen?
Ox-muzzle salad?
Who is that man after all?
An old acquaintance.
Keep on playing.
Today he won't bite.
Allow me to introduce...
Herr Weidenau, my private secretary.
What can I do for you, Madame?
I'd like you to have tea with us.
Because we are 13 at the table!
It would have been a pleasure anyhow.
Pardon.
- Don't mention it, Miss.
Since when do you have a private secretary?
Since today.
Do you mind?
I just find it a little strange, a single lady and a private secretary...
So you're jealous?
- That's ridiculous.
I only think that a lady secretary would have been sufficient, if you absolutely...
Speaking of 'if':
Won't you play some dance music for us?
With pleasure, Madame.
Give us the song you sang this morning, it was excellent.
Sing?
- Yes.
As you like.
# Thousand words speak of glamour and power,
# Thousand words whisper of happiness and splendor.
# And if thousand words spoke to you of the most beautiful things,
# And if thousand words could name you everything that is nice,
# There is one word that destroys all dreams.
# Have you heard that word before?
# Yes, if the little word 'if' did not exist, # dududu dududu
# I would already be a millionaire.
# Dududu dudu
# Every day I could draw money, # a thousand francs from the bank, # and live like the Shah of Persia # my whole life long.
# Yes, if the little word 'if' did not exist, # shshshsh shsh
# I would already be a millionaire.
# Then for you there would be only one, and noone else,
# Yes, if the little word 'if' did not exist, yes, if.
Bravo, bravo!
Once again!
A dance!
And ladies' choice!
Will you dance with me?
With pleasure, Madame.
I'm very satisfied with you.
- Thank you, Madame.
You make excellent coffee.
Yes, I learned it from an aunt of mine, aunt Hanne.
And the hazelnut cake, it was heavenly.
I learned that from another aunt, aunt Lore.
And the rolls, how sophisticated you made them!
I learned to make them from aunt Hannelore.
And you're quite a dancer!
From which aunt did you learn that?
I think it must have rather been a cousin?
I hope you will always stay like this.
Besides, yourjob won't be too taxing.
I'm at your service, Madame.
Only...
- Yes?
I only ask for one thing.
What is it?
I'd like to have have my evenings off, between 8.15 and 10.15.
So don't you want to come to the theatre to see me perform?
Allow me to have these two hours for myself, Madame.
The other gentlemen always come to the theatre.
But they are in love with you, Madame.
Indeed.
Of course you can dispose of your time any way you like, Herr...
Weidenau.
Has your private secretary again not turned up to see the show?
How should I know whether he has turned up or not?
I was just asking...
Say, since when do you buy your perfume at Fleuron?
At Fleuron?
I never buy anything there.
What makes you think so?
Well, I saw your private secretary buy perfume there.
I thought it was for you.
No, it wasrt for me.
Well, then he must have bought it for another lady, right?
What did you say?
I didn't said anything!
Too bad.
Say, Tilla, where is your private secretary during the performance?
Don't ask silly questions!
How should I know where he is?
Ah, good evening, Sir.
- Good evening, Anna!
Is Madame very angry because I'm late?
Not at all, she's only afraid that the soup might get cold.
Oh, I couldn't come earlier.
Come in.
But it would be so nice...
No, no, no, really not!
- But Tilla, dear...
I'll stay at home.
- But why?
I won't go out tonight.
We just would have dropped in at the Carlton.
Yes, to have a bite.
- And a drink.
I've had some supper prepared for me here, I'll stay at home.
I'd like to talk to you about the new play.
Weidenau will take care of that.
I'd like to talk over the bank affairs, Madame.
Weidenau has already finished that matter.
Yes, I think Weidenau has finished us all off already.
Then all we can do is wish you a good night.
Goodbye, until tomorrow!
- Goodbye, Madame!
Good night, my little one, go for a stroll and have fun!
Madame, we will go for a stroll, but we won't have fun.
Good night!
Good night, Baron dear.
Do I also have to leave, Tilla?
Yes, Baron dear.
Be a good boy and have a nice sleep.
I'm neither a good boy nor will I have a nice sleep.
I don't sleep nicely anymore.
But why, Baron dear?
As long as you're not happy, I can't sleep.
But who says I'm not happy?
- My inner voice.
Tell your inner voice that it mustrt talk so much, and go to sleep.
Good night.
Madame?
I'm not hungry, you needrt serve anything.
But Madame...
- You can go, I don't want anything.
I only wanted to say that...
- Go, and leave me alone!
Why aren't you in the Carlton bar yet?
Well...
Why am I not in the Carlton bar, indeed?
I'll go there.
Well, what are you doing here?
Good evening, Madame!
Beg your pardon, I didn't think you'd come home so soon.
But what do you want with that old marionette theatre?
It was quite dusty and broken, and so I wanted to repair it.
Now, in the middle of the night?
- Well, I rarely have the time by day.
So what do you want to do with it?
I thought that if I am to entertain you or your guests again... there should be some variation, you can't sing all the time like in a sound film.
But do you know how to play with marionettes?
An old puppeteer taught me in Salzburg.
Excellent, you must show me!
With pleasure, only I'm not sure if I still can do it.
Let's have a dress rehearsal!
With pleasure, but I'm...
Well, go ahead, go ahead!
For once I'll sit in the audience and watch the others perform.
Seat no. 1, orchestra stalls, front row.
You're welcome, Madame, just one moment.
Five minutes intermission, then the show will start at once!
Ten.
Twelve.
Baron!
You win!
Well?
Well, we're ready, Madame.
This is the big spotlight, it will be placed here.
The play can begin.
Three strokes of the gong!
Enter the Prologus!
Ladies and Gentlemen of the audience!
Today, a guest performance of the Court Theatre of Kickeritz-Potschen upon Potschen.
Tonight: "Prince Kuno and the Postmaster's Daughter",
Great costume opera in several acts and one tableau.
Main characters:
The Prince, a "Knödel" tenor (with nasal voice).
Lieschen, coloratura soprano.
The Minister, a whispering baritone.
The Postmaster, a bass with a stammer.
Scene of the action:
A meadow with daisies.
Time:
In May.
We ask for your kind attention!
The orchestra is assembled.
Before the curtain rises, grand overture.
The curtain opens.
The meadow lies in the sunlight, centre stage a linden tree with hearts carved into its bark.
Cowbells chiming, the prince enters singing.
# Here I am, it's the familiar spot.
# I have been away for full nine full moons.
# I love Lieschen, the Postmaster's child, # she's a child like children are, # she is quite a lot to me, #just like what the yolk is to the egg # or what the salt is to the radishes,
# for me that is, yes, for me that is # my Postmaster's Lieschen.
# My prince!
# So there you are, honourable prince!
# You are the Imperial Count of Peppermint.
# I knew you would be drawn to this linden tree, # by the yearning for the Postmaster's child.
# But Prince, consider your princely duties,
# A prince is not allowed to love, # a prince must do without!
# All right then, I'll do without!
# So be it.
# I'll hurry to the capital with lightning speed,
# There she comes, how beautiful is her beloved face!
# She still has a lisp, but only when she's speaking.
# I am Lieschen, the Postmaster's child,
# I have a carefree mind, like chaff in the wind.
# I am in love with a rather distinguished gentleman, # for nine months now he's been away from me.
# I never did hear his love whisperings, # my Bruno, my Bruno, # there he is, there he is, there he is!
# I am struck by the moonshine, I often groaned like a wood cock,
# So now you will never part from me?
# She doesn't suspect anything, I have to confess everything to her.
# Bruno, you're suddenly so pale and green!
# Do you perhaps want an aspirin?
# Listen to the tidings:
I am not your Bruno!
# I am the hereditary prince, I am Prince Kuno!
# You are the hereditary prince of Titipo, # then I would be a princess!
# Holladriho holladriho...
# Oh Lieschen, a prince who wants to be a real prince # can never woo a commoner.
# You abandon me?
You would dare?
# What will my father, the Postmaster, say?
# My P-p-p-prince, I heard e-e-e-everything, # will you allow me three words now?
# Perhaps you would like to sing, it's more comfortable.
# St-st-stammering is more pleasant when you are singing.
# Listen to my confession, trust me blindly:
# Lieschen isn't my child!
# She's not your child?
What do you say there, man?
# Just listen to me quietly for a moment.
# It was about 18 years ago, on the 31st February to be precise,
# I was sitting in my po-po-postmaster's office.
# Gypsies came down the road, carrying the brats they had robbed with them:
# A new-born child in napkins.
# I caught the rascals, all nine of them, and bust in their heads.
# The last one confessed to me with his skull cracking # that the child had been stolen from the prince's palace.
# You, girl, you are that child in napkins.
# How?
What?
You are the princess Karafindel?
# Then everything isn't so bad.
# We will get married legally.
# My work is done, # now I can die.
# The postmaster will not leave a single heir behind.
# And when one day I shall lie under rose hedges, # then the whole world... # won't wake me anymore.
Bravo, bravo, that was marvellous!
Really excellent!
You really liked the show, Madame?
Superb!
But tell me, why must the postmaster's daughter become a princess at the end?
Every good postmaster's daughter becomes a princess at the end... so that she gets her prince.
Must they always get each other in the end?
They don't have to, no, but the audience likes it much better.
And it's much nicer... when two in love get each other in the end, isn't it, Madame?
Well... if you think so, you Prince Kuno...
Is there a postmaster's daughter somewhere that you're in love with, and a linden tree with hearts carved into its bark?
And...
I just wanted to tell you...
I don't like it when a gentleman wears such a collar.
In the future, wear shirts cut in the modern fashion, whith the collar attached.
Collar and shirt in one piece,
Herr Weidenau.
Yes, of course, Madame, if you wish...
Yes, it is my wish!
By the way, it's quite late...
- I'm leaving, Madame.
So, goodbye.
Tomorrow, 11 o'clock sharp!
Good night.
- Good night.
She's cancelled her performance.
She said she needs a few nights off.
To repose.
In the old days, she used to perform 200 times in a row.
That was her repose.
That was in the old days.
Well, let's go to the golf course.
Well then, let's start.
Allright, let's play golf.
The dressmaker told me that Tilla hasn't ordered a new gown for eight days.
I'm telling you she's ill, she's really ill.
Poor Tilla!
Well then, let's go to the golf course.
Well then, let's start.
Allright, let's play golf.
Madame...
What is it?
It's 11 o'clock.
Who is it?
It's me, Weidenau.
Good morning, Madame.
What do you want so early?
I was to wake you at 11.
Were you?
You always come at such inconvenient hours.
Don't disturb me.
Because I'm not...
I still have a...
I beg your pardon, Madame...
I didn't realize, of course.
Pardon!
Madame...
I didn't realize, of course.
Pardon!
Pardon!
Madame!
Hello.
Tell Herr Weidenau to come here.
Farewell, darling, farewell...
Let go of my hand.
Let go, my...
What did you say?
What was it?
Farewell.
But let go of me!
Farewell.
But let go of me!
Oh!
Excuse me.
I didn't know you were here already.
Don't mention it, Madame.
Well... why have I called you?
Ah yes...
I want to dictate a letter.
Take it down in shorthand.
Very well, Madame.
Let me take it.
Perhaps it's a private call.
Hello.
Shipping offices Peschke?
I'd like to speak to Herr Peschke himself.
This is Jellinek.
Yes, darling!
It's me.
One moment please.
I'm not alone.
Please wait outside.
Very well.
Madame.
But you're only gone for five minutes and already you long for me!
You sweet boy!
Miss... couldn't you give me your 'phone address'?
If I'm happy?
And how!
You!
You!
Yes, Madame?
You Herr Private Secretary!
Yes please, Madame?
What can I do for you?
Yes I do!
What is it, Madame?
What is it you wish, Madame?
Madame here, Madame there...
It's getting on my nerves!
Yes, but how should I address you, Madame?
You shouldn't address me at all!
You should leave me alone!
And not torture me!
Good gracious!
But you're totally beside yourself!
What is it?
Dearest...
Madame...
You see.
That way you said it nicely.
And you must always say "Madame" to me that way.
Good morning!
But that's sweet of you, Baron dear... that you've come to see me.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
Not at all, Baron.
Not at all.
Ah, Baron, how are you?
- Thank you.
What are the others doing?
But you're all totally neglecting me!
Listen to me, I want to go out tonight.
Dancing, singing, being gay... drinking champagne, being among other people, listening to music...
So you're really in love, huh?
I?
In love?
But you must be mad, Baron!
With whom should I be in love?
With the little Guards officer.
I swear, I'm not in love, really I'm not.
Is that so?
Well, if you swear... then your infatuation must be overwhelming, my dear child.
And if I were in love?
What if?
Then you are very foolish to be.
Why?
Because your little Guards officer has another woman.
What?
I've watched him a bit, spied on him a little.
Here.
Feldstraße 18, 3rd floor, left.
What does that mean?
It means there's another lady.
What kind of a lady?
The lady between 8.15 and 10.15.
Between 8.15 and 10.15?
Havert you noticed that your private secretary is always absent between 8.15 and 10.15?
He spends his time with this lady, Feldstr. 18, 3rd floor, left.
Now I know what you mean!
The lady in Feldstr. 18, 3rd floor, left.
But of course!
You knew about her!
Of course I did.
His English teacher, he visits her daily.
But he speaks English fluently.
Or his French teacher...
But his French is better than Poincaré's!
Some teacher then, Chinese or Bulgarian, how should I know!
Besides, my private secretary can do whatever he wants between 8.15 and 10.15.
And tomorrow, and with whom he wants.
With whom he wants...
I wouldn't have thought that she's that much in love with him.
Jerome Toenli is pleased to invite you to his home tonight
#Once people had time for love, # they were writing spring romances, # but if today's boys and girls are in love # they don't talk a lot, they dance # love is a heavenly power
# that's what they used to say in the earlier days # we don't think much about heaven # today's people just say:
# Love is like a sound film # with lots of changes in the course of action, # first an 'oh' and an 'ah', then a big quarrel, # and gradually one becomes weak again.
# Love is like a sound film # the main characters are the two of us # first a sweet caress, then the inevitable # a little song with greeting and a kiss at the end.

Good evening, Weidenau.
Good evening, Herr Teschner.
Well, did you bring Tilla with you?
No, I thought Madame was already here.
No, Tilla hasn't come yet.
That is strange.
Madame asked me to be here at 8.15.
And told me to be punctual.
She expressly asked me not to fetch her.
She'll just be a bit late.
This happens sometimes with a beautiful woman.
- That's possible.
In fact it's a great honour for us... to have the private secretary join us between 8.15 and 10.15.
Why?
On other nights you're always invisible at that hour, you...
As you can see, I can also be visible at this hour.
I really don't know where Madame might be...
Good evening.
Is Madame at home?
Who shall I say is...
Just tell her, I've come because of Herr Weidenau.
Please come in.
One moment.
Madame will be here in a minute.
Please be seated.
- Thank you.
Herr Weidenau isn't in?
No, he's invited tonight.
But on other nights he's always here?
Yes, each night he has supper with Madame.
Between 8.15 and 10.15.
I see.
And then he leaves?
Yes.
But not for long.
At midnight he's back again.
What?
He comes back?
At night?
- He does.
- And spends the night here?
But of course he does!
That's his bedroom.
And where does Madame sleep?
- Right next door.
Right next door?
She always waits for the gentlemars return, else she can't fall asleep.
Is that so?
Madame...
Good evening.
I've come for my Ulli's shirts?
Yes I know.
Greetings, Madame.
Mrs. Schmidt has recommended you to me.
Yes I know, come with me, we'll see to it at once.
Because we have to alter all the shirts.
Ulli has set his mind to it.
The boy's totally crazy these days.
Because he's in love, you know.
And probably somebody told him that it's more elegant if the collars are attached to the shirt.
And that's why we have to alter everything.
Let the boy have his will.
At my time, things like that werert done.
If a gentlemen had taken a lady out without wearing a starched collar... she would have given him some look!
But what can one do?
The modern times...
Well, come here, Madame.
Listen to me carefully!
Look here, you cut off a strip from the bottom, four fingers wide.
You won't notice it at the bottom...
And you'll sew that to the collar.
And try to do it nicely, will you... so that my Ulli will be pleased.
Herr Waldenau is your son, Madame?
No way!
Ulli?
My son?
What is he?
But he's my grandson!
- You're his...
- Grandmother.
But of course.
And now that he's found a steady job he's made me come from Vienna at once.
The poor guy.
Because he thought he'd feel lonely in the strange city.
But I had hardly arrived... when he fell in love.
And who do you think he's in love with?
With the lady who employs him.
He fell madly in love with her.
And with my Ulli that means something!
Because he used to ignore all women.
Really?
And what's most interesting... he doesn't dare to tell her.
She doesn't know anything about his love.
Did you ever hear such a thing!
She doesn't know!
But why doesn't he tell her?
But he's not going to tell her!
You don't know my Ulli!
He knows his duties, he knows how to behave.
She's his boss, he's the employee.
That's final.
He puts professional duties above everything.
So that's why?
Of course!
And I keep telling him, you silly boy, I'm telling him, if you love her, you can be her employee a thousand times, you simply have to tell her!
Of course!
- You see!
But you know, my Ulli, he's a gentleman of the old school.
For him a woman either means everything... or only an adventure.
And just for an adventure, this woman is too good for him.
Well...
Here are the shirts, dear lady.
12, 13, 14
That's it, 14 shirts.
But say... how much do you charge for the alterations per shirt?
45 pfennigs, if it's not too expensive, Madame?
45 pfennigs?
That's reasonable.
Yes, that's reasonable.
And I'll give you his drawers, too, they need mending anyway.
One moment.
Here are the drawers.
And the next time you come I'll give you his socks to darn.
That boy can make holes, I'm telling you!
Once worn, and ruined already!
Westend 8586.
Is Madame still at home?
Good evening.
Excuse me, do you know if Frau von Treuberg lives here?
Are you the seamstress, perhaps?
Yes, Frau Schmidt recommended me.
This is excellent!
Because I was about to bring you the clothes anyway.
Everything's in here, drawers, the young gentlemars shirts...
Now listen carefully.
You cut off a strip down here, about four fingers width... at the bottom you don't notice it anyway... and you stitch it to the collar seam.
But do it nicely, so that my Ulli will be pleased.
But where to?
Yes...
You don't know?
Thank you.
What's the hurry?
I was going to...
- Look for Tilla?
But don't be so impatient!
She'll be here any moment.
- But I...
Just wait here.
I'd like to speak to you alone for a minute.
As you wish.
Sit down, dear Weidenau.
I'd like to talk to you about Tilla's new part.
Pardon.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
The choice of her new part is very important to Tilla right now.
Why now?
Tilla is at the peak of her career.
An artist has to be very careful at that moment.
And especially the two of us,
I as her publisher and you as her... advisor, must prevent her from making mistakes, isn't that so?
Yes of course.
I've picked a very interesting part for Tilla:
In the play, Tilla plays an artist who hurries from success to success, is adored by the public and celebrated, and one day she falls in love with some poor devil.
Of course, passionate love between the two... till the man suddenly realizes that it wouldn't be good for this woman if that love lasted forever.
She's an artist, she needs luxury, riches, success, all sorts of things the man can't offer her.
You understand that, don't you, Herr Weidenau?
She's an artist like...
like... like Tilla, and he a poor devil like... like...
- Like me.
Yes.
In short:
The young man realizes that this affair will lead to nothing, because such affairs never lead to anything.
And since he realizes that despite all his love he would always only be his wife's husband,
he leaves of his own accord,
While it doesn't hurt too much yet.
Listen.
This is the show's central song, the farewell song.
# Don't ask why I'm leaving, # don't ask why, # whatever may happen # don't ask why.
# I can only tell you
# I love you.
# I wanted to give you the most beautiful thing in life.
# Don't ask me that one question, don't ask why, # don't ask why I'm crying, # don't ask why.
# We are parting, # tomorrow another man will kiss you,
# then you won't ask anymore
# "why".
# The song is over, # the song you sang for me, # at its last notes
# I was yearning for you.
# The song is over, # the melody faded away, # nothing remained of the music, # only an echo of love.
# The roses I brought you # are now withered splendour of flowers.
# The song is over.
# Don't ask why I'm leaving, # don't ask why, # whatever may happen, # don't ask why.
# I can only tell you
# I love you
# I wanted to give you the most beautiful thing in life # don't ask me that one question, don't ask why # don't ask why I'm crying, # don't ask why.
# We are parting, # tomorrow another man will kiss you,
# then you won't ask anymore
# "why?"
How do you like the play?
Herr Weidenau?
I think it's... strange... that you're telling this to me right this moment.
Why?
After all you're Tilla's...
- Private secretary!
But nothing else.
And for that reason,
I must ask you not to tell me the plot of plays
I am supposed to take as example.
It's quite unnessecary.
The characters in your new play, the lady artist and the young man, bear no resemblance to...
Frau Tilla and... the young man you're alluding to.
So you've understood me.
Yes I have.
But even without your friendly admonition
I would have known my duty.
I'd like to...
I'm leaving.
Well?
What have you got to tell me?
I don't know what you mean, Madame.
Is that so?
You really don't know?
Yes, the grammophone recordings, they will take place the day after tomorrow.
And?
The fashion drawings have been ordered from Paris.
And?
The pictures for the magazine will be ready tomorrow.
- And?
And?
Apart from that, I really don't know, Madame.
Is that so?
Apart from that, you have nothing else to tell me?
I see.
Then I am going to tell you something!
Or even better, take a letter!
- Very well, Madame.
Write:
Headline:
Beloved!
What I didn't know before,
I know now.
I know that you love me.
That you love...
I know that your sense of duty has kept you from showing me your real feelings.
Your coldness no longer fools me.
Your reticience doesn't drive me mad anymore.
I know that you love me.
And this makes me happy.
Did you write "happy"?
"Happy", comma.
Write: "very happy!"
Write: "incredibly happy!"
Write: "immeasurably happy!"
Did you write "immeasurably"?
"Lmmeasurably".
Be wise at last, and take me in your arms.
I cannot throw myself at you!
I am a woman.
Don't you see that you, the man, must conquer me?
Write it down, write it all down!
I love you!
I love you!
Come, and finally kiss me!
And to whom shall I address this letter, Madame?
To whom?
To...
Jerome Toenli.
# Don't ask why I'm leaving, # don't ask why,
# whatever may happen, # don't ask why.
# I can tell you now
# I love you
# I wanted to give you the most beautiful thing in life
# We are parting, # tomorrow another man will kiss you,
# then you won't ask anymore:
# "Why?"
# Love is like a sound film # with lots of changes in the course of action, # first an 'ooh' and an 'ah', then a big quarrel, # and gradually one becomes weak again.
# Love is like a sound film...
# Adieu my litte Guards officer, # adieu, adieu... #... the main characters are the two of us, # first a sweet caress, then the inevitable, # a little song with greeting and a kiss at the...
# Adieu!
#
- And don't forget me, # and don't forget me.
# Adieu my little Guard's officer...
I am to deliver this to you at once.
Beloved!
What I didn't know before,
I know now.
I know that you love me.
That you love me?
Listen, listen.
She loves me!
- So what?
She loves me!
Listen, she loves me!
Ah, she's gone.
Listen, she loves me!
Baron, she loves me!
She loves me!
She loves me!
She loves me!
I must speak to Madame at once!
But she's still asleep.
- I must see her!
Herr Weidenau!
Herr Weidenau!
She cannot live without me.
She loves me!
She loves me.
I've got it in writing from her.
I've got it in black and white.
Where's my black on white?
Ah, here it is.
Listen:
Beloved!
...you love me your coldness...
I see, "your coldness doesn't fool me".
Here: "take me in your arms at last".
In your arms!
"You, you, the man, with whom..."
with "you, the man" she meant me.
Congratulations.
Herr Weidenau,
I swear it:
If I had known that she loves me that much
I'd have said "yes" at once.
Yes, yes and... yes yes yes.
Please read.
"Conquer me"...
You're an enviable man now.
Why?
You're getting a woman many other men have tried to woo in vain.
But she's getting ME in return.
I'd like to ask you for something.
- Already granted!
Make Tilla happy.
As happy as she deserves.
You must put her on a pedestal and read each of her wishes from her lips, and take care of her, wrap a scarf around her neck each evening, and drive her home after the show in a closed car,
so that she doesn't catch cold, and prevent her from reading detective novels in bed at night, or she'll have bad dreams.
You must be good to her, you must care for her, you must put her on a pedestal,
You must never let her go out alone in the evening and never let her dance with another man.
Believe me, I know what it means when a woman dances with another man.
Listen to me, only you are to dance with her!
But I can't dance at all!
You can't dance either?
Come on, I'll teach you.
Come on.
- Bravo!
Is this all right, Herr Weidenau?
- Beautiful.
Please, don't let me disturb you!
I only wanted to...
- I beg your pardon, it's my fault.
I only showed Herr Toenli a few dancing steps
I see.
Dancing steps.
Would you please leave me alone with Herr Toenli?
Of course, Madame.
Herr Weidenau,
Herr Weidenau, stay here.
Herr Weidenau!
Herr Weidenau!
Herr Weidenau!
He's gone.
Well, now we're engaged.
Yes.
Give me a kiss.
I take the liberty.
But yes, I'm telling you, engaged!
Really engaged!
Of course.
They'll leave tonight to see his parents.
Yes, I have to make another call.
Operator, another call, quick.
Yes, 4576.
Yes, "Little Journal"?
Dr. Fischer?
Yes.
Herr Doctor, just imagine, Tilla got engaged.
What?
With whom?
With Toenli!
Just imagine her luck, he has heaps of money and is a fool on top of it.
Yes, that's right.
Good-bye
Operator, another call.
Be quick about it, I've already told you...
The porters will be here any moment
Herr Toenli will be here with his car in a few minutes
Where is Madame?
She's changing her clothes.
So that would be all.
When Madame has left and you perhaps feel a longing for our phone number:
I'm always available.
It's all right.
# Stand upright, bolt upright, and go laughing into the sunnny day.
# Whatever may happen.
# Adieu, # adieu
# my little Guards officer.
May I say farewell now, Madame?
Is it really better that it has turned out like this?
I think so, Madame.
For both of us?
I would surely have been a disappointment for you later.
And all this because of a few more dresses the other man can give me.
Yes, Madame!
You have a very low opinion of my love.
You're a woman.
An artist.
You need luxury, riches, the theatre, successes.
You wouldn't feel at ease in another world.
What about you?
I?
I'd surely have become very unappy if I hadrt been able to give you all this.
Well then, adieu.
My little...
Guards officer.
Cheers, Baron.
Good evening.
Good evening.
- Good evening.
Is she gone?
Yes.
Did she say anything?
She sends everyone her best wishes.
Thank you.
Who are those gentlemen?
Those three?
Tilla Morland's former lovers.
# Don't ask me that one question, # don't ask why,
# don't ask why I'm crying, # don't ask why.
# We are parting,
# Tomorrow another man will kiss you,
# then you won't ask anymore.

The almighty God loves me so much
That He has given you to me.
The almighty God loves me so much
That He has given you to me.
Miklós has saved György's life two times while they were escaping from the bleak and burly Siberia and because of it he became a sincere friend of Miklós's.
György, we're at home !
A better and more beautiful life begins for us!
Here lies JANKA VASS Sorrow has killed her when she's lost his only son.
I'm looking for the parish priest.
Miklós, so you're alive ?
!
Katinka, he is the teacher, he's taught you too.
My Lajos, so you don't recognize me?
The master has came home, young master's at home!
We've already mourned you, my dear master.
Where are you?
Look, young master's came home!
Bring some wine, call the gypsy!
Because of the youngness and peachyness of Katinka the friendship has weakened.
György!
Come On!
Wine is from "must", from liquor of grape, and grape is from God's love.
If the master has got faith in God, he will be lucky.
Play the song:
"There's no other girl in the village..."
Katinka, I love you.
I can't live without you.
Be my wife!
Katinka has promised me her heart.
Mr. teacher, György's grateful to you for his life and so am I for my happiness.
Katinka and I are in love.
I would like to propose to her.
"The good friend has died.
He's gonna marry..."
Long live the young couple!
Gipsy, play that sad one:
"He will mourn his never returning bachelor years"
There's only one girl in the whole world
She's my dear, my only one

Gentlemen, let's go to the pool!
Look Rudi, I'm gonna sink that snooty brown-haired guy!
Gyuri, is that you?
Don't you recognize me?
We know each other for a long time, my estate at Bogárháza is next to his own.
Don't you remember?
We've played together when we were children.
You've always called me Ella.
[A children's song for a rounddance-like game]
Why are you afraid to kiss me?
We're alone here!
Gyuri, you've promised you'll escort me!
Go home Katinka, I'll be back in a week!
I've invited some our friends from the city to your nameday.
Gyuri, can't you see that you are killing Katinka with your actions?
I love Ella but I'm gonna marry Katinka.
I'm sorry now that I've saved your life.
You're a mean miscreant!
I love her and if she wants it too I'm gonna marry her.
Katinka, don't be sad about Gyuri.
He just doesn't deserve it.
I love you for a long time now, be my wife!
If you are satisfied with the fact that I'm gonna be a good and faithful wife I'm gonna marry you.
With time I'll forget György.
That peasant in love has made you a model of virtue.
You really know how to behave!
I haven't had to beg for a kiss before for such a long time!
Oh my dear!
Forgive me Katinka, I can't live without you!
You haven't returned my love György, I've already forgot you.
Katinka, forgive me for our love's sake!
It's too late...
We've already had our engagement...
With Miklós...
First he's saved my life and now he's taken it away.
The lovelorn György drinks to forget.
I've went out to the vineyard in the dark.
I've hugged a stick in the dark.
I've hugged a stick, I've thought it was Kató
But it was only a long-shafted stick.
I've hugged a stick, I've thought it was Kató

Next day when I went to the vineyard
I've found Kató there in the dark
I've hugged Kató, she hasn't said even a word.
She's just said in the end:
"It was so good!"
Next morning
I'm not happy that you're riding for a fall, but if you really want to...
There's only one girl in the whole world

Tanner Shoes.
We must live up to our slogan.
"The World Walks on Tanner Shoes."
Now, you're my manager down here... and you've got to put this store over.
And furthermore, don't talk back to me.
But I didn't say anything.
I was only thinking...
Don't even think back to me!
I won't have it!
You're here to sell shoes, not to think.
And if I don't see some results... when I get back here on my next trip, you're fired.
Now, do you understand me?
You're fired!
Give me a match.
Never mind, I'll light it myself.
Thank you, come again soon.
There you are.
Sets your foot off beautifully.
Now, that's the, uh, 4A... or what we call "the perfect model."
What is it?
Oh, why, Madam!
The leather, uh... uh...
The leather in the Tanner Shoe... is made from the hides of contented cows.
Now, I think they're very becoming.
What do you think?
I think you'd better cut out this tomfoolery.
Go up front and help trim that window.
Yes, sir.
I...
I was just practicing to be a salesman, Mr. Endicott.
You'll never make a salesman.
Salesmanship is 98% personality... and that's something you haven't got.
Oh, yes I have.
Look.
Ah!
That's not personality, that's stupidity.
Get up front and help Williams trim that window.
Yes, sir.
It looks very nice.
Yes, it looks smart, too.
You know, it's a 4A... for what we call "the perfect foot."
Notice how snug it fits?
And I have a new sport model I'd like to show you.
I'd like very much to see it.
Will you pardon me a minute?
I'd like you to show me something... in a white Deauville, please.
- Yes, will you be seated?
- Thank you.
I'll have a man wait on you right away.
Where's the other leg?
I'm gonna get it.
I'll be right back.
- Pardon me.
- Why, of course.
Why...
Now, what in the world is the matter, Madam?
I never was so insulted in my life!
I think that left foot's a little tight.
- Haven't you a larger size?
- Uh, no, I haven't.
But I can have it stretched for you... and make it very comfortable.
All right, and while that's being done... will you show me that sport shoe there?
Surely.
Boy!
Stretch this shoe.
Does that feel all right?
- Yes.
- Hey.
Just let me lace it up for you.
Well, I think it's a little tight.
A little tight?
Just let me take it off and stretch it for you.
There, how's that?
That's all right.
I like that shoe very much.
That shoe he's stretching looked very serviceable.
I doubt, Madam, if you'll ever be able to wear it out.
Here, you may leave fifteen minutes early... and deliver these on your way home.
Yes, sir.
- How does that feel?
- That feels fine.
I thought it would.
You know, Madam, your instep is much too beautiful... to be spoiled by a short-vamped shoe.
- Oh, do you really think so?
- I certainly do.
Now, that feels very well in there, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.
- And it's comfortable?
Madam, your instep is much too beautiful... to be spoiled by a sh...
Yes, ma'am.
Always, yes, ma'am.
Never!
Would you get me a glass of water?
Yes, ma'am.
Oh!
Oh!
You... you idiot!
Oh, of all the dumb tricks!
Look at me!
You... you...
Henry, did you put my music in the car?
Yes, Miss.
It's right on the back seat.
Oh, I have it.
Here it is.
Say, pansy.
Yeah?
He ain't got no right bustin' into my car... that way, either.
Anyway, I think he did it on purpose.
Get back in the car, Henry.
Don't pay any attention to this big brute.
Say, lady, this is a private scrap.
I'll pull that guy out of the car and...
Here, here.
What do you mean by using that tone of voice... to this young lady?
Why, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Besides, you have no right... leaving your car parked here in other people's way.
Now, listen, if this happens again...
I'm going to see to it personally.
Why don't you get a shave?
It's too bad that this had to happen, Miss.
If he annoys you again, you just let me know.
Thank you very much.
Oh, oh, the pleasure's really all mine.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
- Oh.
- Oh.
Oh, I-I'll get it.
I don't know how I can ever thank you, Mister...
- Harold.
- Mr. Harold.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Oh.
Uh, now, let that be a lesson to you.
Listen, Kramer, you're an incompetent idiot.
You haven't got any more backbone than a steamed clam.
Now, you get busy and get some results... or you're discharged, understand me?
D-i-s... you're fired!
Get me that number back again.
I know, I know.
Hello?
Hello.
Is this you, Kramer?
Did I call you an idiot?
I did.
OK.
Mr. Tanner, is there something wrong?
Something?
Everything.
If the rest of the people I have working for me... were half as efficient as you are...
I'd be happy as a schoolboy.
There's no such thing as a perfect man.
Oh, Mr. Tanner, I think you're mistaken.
There is.
- There is what?
- A perfect man.
Have you been holding out on me, young lady?
I met him this afternoon.
She is beautiful.
You know, Mr. Carson... I...
I've always dreamed of meeting the one girl.
Today I...
I went around the corner, and there she was.
You've got it bad, haven't you, my son?
Say, are you gonna talk about that girl all night... or are you going to thread my needle for me?
Huh?
Oh, I almost forgot.
I'll get it right away, Mr. Carson.
When are you gonna see her again?
Never, I guess.
She's rich, got a big car.
Besides, what chance have I with eighteen a week?
You'll soon be making more money than that.
You're going to be a salesman in a very little while.
Yeah.
A salesman.
A lot of good that'll do.
You know, Mr. Carson... up till today, I thought being a salesman was something great.
Gee, a girl that comes from a family like that, why... she wouldn't give a salesman a second look.
Oh, but you are not always going to be a salesman.
Keep driving on, and then perhaps... you will come to be manager of the store.
Who knows?
In a very little while... you may be president of the company.
Gee.
Oh, but that's liable to take two or three months.
There's got to be a shortcut somewhere.
Now, then, if I could only meet her on her own level.
Hmm.
And I'm going to do it, too.
Stick to it, my son.
That's it... sticking.
That's the only way.
I wish only I had stuck.
Sticking to it, huh?
And now, gentlemen, we come to the subject of leather.
Very few people realize what leather really is... and what it means to mankind.
Where would we be without leather?
I ask you.
It's leather that turns the wheels of our industries!
It's leather in the time of war... furnishes our horses with harness to pull the cannons... to conquer our enemies!
And then, where would Napoleon have been... without leather to make a saddle?
He'd have been riding bareback!
And then think!
Think of shoes!
Without them, we would be uncivilized.
Barefoot like tea garoni.
Could we walk through snow and slush barefoot?
Could we walk through the desert barefoot?
No!
A thousand times no!
Fine.
That's the way you should've talked... at the American Club two months ago.
Huh.
That was splendid.
Yes, I...
I know, Mr. Carson, it's... it's all right.
I can do it here in the room... but, I don't know, when I get out with important people... gee, I...
I...
I get all goose pimples.
Gee, I open my mouth, and nothing comes out.
Oh, well, I guess you didn't want the girl... as much as you thought you did.
Oh, yes, but I do!
Now you listen to me!
You go to the Embassy Club tonight and speak right up!
When you meet those big businessmen... use your correspondence courses!
Impress them!
You look the part.
Act it!
Sell yourself!
I'll do it!
I will!
Now, nothing's gonna stop me this time!
I hope that's a mistake.
That's a very unfriendly knock.
Shh.
It's Ferguson, the dress suit man.
I think he's after payment on his suit.
Oh.
Gee, if I pay him now, I won't have any money for tonight.
Shh!
Now what am I gonna do?
Out the window, down the fire escape.
Great!
Great!
Your hat!
- Say, son...
- Hmm?
Have you got that guest card that I found?
Yes, I got it.
Don't forget.
Stick to it!
Yeah, I will.
- Good evening, Mr. Fleming.
- Good evening.
Good evening, sir.
Are you a member?
Oh, uh, son, have you seen Charlie?
- Charlie?
- Yes.
- Who is Charlie?
- What?
You don't know Charlie?
- No, sir.
- Well, he walks like this.
I beg your pardon.
What's the name?
Uh, Jones.
Which Mr. Jones?
Why, the Mr. Jones.
Uh, have you a telegram for Mr. Jones?
Yes, sir.
Charge is 75 cents.
Wrong Jones.
Uh, keep this handy.
I may be leaving suddenly.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Your Honor, I have been drinking.
But only a little one, I...
Oh, pardon me.
- You forgot something.
- Something?
Everything.
Oh... you saved my life.
Yeah.
I'm going to do something for you.
Anything you want, you just tell me.
That's all right.
Oh, whoa, so you wanna rassle?
Oh, no, no, no!
Please, now.
This is hardly the place for that.
Well, listen, I know a nice little place out here, come on.
A great little...
I really, I've got someplace else I've got...
Oh, come on, now, and I'll buy you a little drink.
No, really, I never drink.
Well, what do you do, dip your bread in it?
Come on.
What business are you in?
Oh, uh, uh, I'm in the, uh, the leather business.
Leather!
Oh, that's what they make cows out of, ain't it?
Heh.
Why, certainly not.
That's where the leather comes from.
They make a lot of things out of it.
They make shoes and...
Shoes.
That reminds me, I know a chap you must meet.
Wait a minute.
He's a big shoe and slipper man from the States.
Do you a lot of good.
I have his card here someplace, now...
Will you look at that?
Lady Pillsbury.
Oh!
Lady Pillsbury?
That big bum.
She was way out in front, and Mexican Pete nosed her out.
Oh, I see.
Lady Pillsbury's a racehorse.
What did you think she was, a mockingbird?
No, no, uh...
Yes, I met her last night.
Really?
To me, Lady Pillsbury... is one of the most charming women I have ever met.
Oh, do tell me more about her.
Yes, do tell us.
Just a minute, just a minute.
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
This is Mr. Edgar Cowhide, a big leather fellow.
- Why, pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.
Say, you guys should sort of get together.
Oh, Charlie, you wait here.
I'm going out and get a glass of bromo suss... bromo suss...
A cup of tea.
I'll be back.
Yes, uh...
Yes, quite a droll fellow, huh?
We were just speaking of Lady Pillsbury.
Oh, really?
Hmm.
Yes, she is really very remarkable.
Well, she was, but not anymore.
Do you know her?
Yes, yes, oh, I know her well, heh.
Slim legs, brown body, and a white spot on the head.
Oh, my!
You know, she shouldn't be allowed in public.
All out of condition.
Fat, flabby...
the old oat burner.
Are you speaking of the Lady Pillsbury?
Yes, positively.
And listen, take a tip from me and lay off of this baby.
Heh, why, she should be pulling a milk wagon.
Well, I shall report that to the...
I'm awfully sorry.
I'm sure it's been overlooked.
I'll ask him about it in the morning... and let you know immediately.
Yes, thank you very much.
Good-bye.
Oh!
Why, hello!
Hello.
I...
I...
I didn't think you'd remember me.
And I thought you had forgotten all about me.
Oh, no, my gracious, I couldn't...
Gee, every time I see a truck driver, I think of you.
What?
Oh, well, uh, you see, what I mean is, heh... if it hadn't been for that particular truck driver... well, I might not have ever met you.
Oh, that's different.
Yes.
That seems a long time ago, too.
Must be all of six months.
Six months, three weeks, and two days.
- Well!
- Oh...
Well, I'm glad you did remember, anyway.
Uh, yes.
Gee, but you don't know what glad really means.
I never thought a boy like you... would give a girl like me a second thought.
A...
A boy like me?
Yes.
You have so many things to think about... golf, bridge, tennis, so many things.
Oh, yes, well, I, uh...
I do think of them from time to time.
Of course, I suppose you go in for golf and tennis a lot.
Oh, no, I haven't the time.
Oh.
Oh, well, I understand.
I love an athlete.
You do?
Uh-huh.
Oh.
What's his name?
Oh, no!
I mean I admire the athletic type.
Like yourself.
Like me?
- Yes.
- Oh.
I bet you're a corker at polo.
Oh, well...
I, uh...
I never bet.
Oh!
