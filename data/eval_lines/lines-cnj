Don't say that, sir.
Why don't you stay for a beer?
You know the kid?
Son of a local restaurant.
Counselor eats there every clay.
Heck.
Then just forget about it and move on.
But he's not the kind to get in trouble.
It's a communist case.
Communist?
Stay out of it, no matter what.
It's being handled directly by the boys upstairs.
That's not good.
Sure.
Just one moment.
Honey, it's Mr. PARK.
It's me.
I know.
I'll be there soon.
Ma'am!
Is that you?
What are you doing out here?
You're a lawyer, right'?
Yes.
Jin-woo!
What happened to Jin-woo?
That came last night.
It's a notice of trial.
He's in prison and his trial is...
In two days?
I went to the prison to see him, but they wouldn't let me.
They said it's against the law.
That's absurd!
Guardians have full visitation rights.
Then...
Can I see him if I go with you?
Counselor!
How are you, ma'am?
Counselor SONG.
The chairman sent a car for you downstairs.
I need your help.
You know that Jin-woo isn't a communist.
Please go and tell them that he's not a communist.
Help me this once.
I'll serve you for the rest of my life if you help me.
The car is waiting, Counselor.
Can't you see me talking with the counselor?
Ma'am.
I have this important meeting, but we can go afterwards.
Iran around like a lunatic looking for my son.
I even looked through the morgue.
Please.
I need your help.
I have no one else to turn to.
I'm begging you.
I'm so sorry about what I said before.
I was out of line.
Please forgive me.
Ma'am...
I promise to go with you later, but I can't cancel this.
Come help her, Miss MOON.
My Jin-woo...
Jin-woo isn't a communist.
He's not...
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Counselor!
Sir!
Jin-woo isn't a communist!
Did you see today's paper'?
It's the Budokryun case.
Jin-woo got mixed up in it.
- The Budokryun case?
- Yes.
You knew about it?
I didn't want you to worry about it.
Now you tell me?
I was going to...
Gentlemen.
Get up.
He's here.
This way, Father.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Do you know where this is?
Street number 16-3.
Mrs. PARK!
Is anyone home?
Ma'am.
Counselor!
It's really you!
Please forgive me for earlier.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
There's no need.
She has her visitation rights!
Is this prison somehow above the Constitution?
The Constitution?
The public visiting room is in repairs.
Then we'll use the private visiting room.
Is that under repair too?
Because I'll sue you if it isn't!
He's throwing a fit and threatened to sue us!
Just him and the mother.
The mother?
He wasn't sent by Counselor KIM.
Seems the mother brought him.
What's his name?
"Tax law specialist, SONG Woo-seek."
"We take care of you and your interests."
Right away, sir.
Down the hall to the left.
Let's go.
Jin-woo!
What happened?
It's me, Jin-woo.
Your mother and me!
Jin-woo?
Look at me!
Jin-woo!
They treat me well.
I confessed my crimes.
I'm guilty.
I'll be good now.
I'll be good...
Mom!
Mom!
Mom...
What's wrong?
Are you hurt?
What's this?
- Why are you hurt?
- Who did this to you?
This is unauthorized...
Get your hands off!
- Jin-woo!
- What are these bruises?
You filthy crook!
You did this!
You did this to my son, goddamn bastards!
It was you!
You filthy bastards!
Did they beat you, Jin-woo?
How dare you!
You crooks!
Filthy bastard!
What's this?
Just grab her!
Jin-woo!
Let go of my son!
- Mom!
- Jin-woo!
- Jin-woo!
- Mom!
Jin-woo!
- Mom!
- Jin-woo!
Jin-woo!
Mrs. PARK!
Ma'am!
Call an ambulance!
Wake up!
Ma'am!
They're scared it'll look suspicious if they appoint counsel.
They dropped a name.
PARK Byung-ho.
PARK Byung-ho?
I'll talk to him.
He'll only cut down the sentence.
They convict people with no crime.
What good is a trial?
PARK might be our solution.
What is this Budokryun case?
What are the charges?
Reading subversive literature with seditious content.
Praising anti-governmental groups.
These are what they call "subversive literature".
That's their excuse at first.
Then they design a specific crime through interrogation.
Why does the news mention
North Korea and communist orders?
His name is Jin-woo?
Yes.
Does he seem like a communist?
He's...
How is this possible?
This isn't supposed to happen!
No, it's not.
I'll do it.
I'll take this case.
SONG.
You've been up all night.
Go get some sleep.
We'll talk.
You shouldn't decide such things on sudden impulse.
Then why did you suddenly come looking for me?
I was in a hurry.
I needed to postpone the trial while
I found the proper lawyer.
I am a proper lawyer.
Look, SONG.
- I'm not putting you down.
- I told you.
I'm representing Jin-woo.
If you give up midway...
I will never give up.
Here for a trial?
What brings you here?
Coverage.
Some fixed case called Budokryun.
Sent here to play puppet.
Budokryun?
Let me know if you need anything.
For what?
I'm representing that case.
- You?
- Yes.
Tired of making money now?
Don't tell me.
You're going into politics?
That's not it.
You go write the article.
Yes, sir.
I'm sick of playing puppet.
All right.
Jesus.
I need a drink.
Let's go get drunk.
Yoon-taek.
Let's go.
Counselor PARK!
How have you been?
I'll be fine if you don't cause me trouble.
What are your plans for this case?
I don't have any plans.
I'm just an anvil.
You're the hammer.
If you don't slam me, we'll all be fine.
Let's cut the talk and head inside.
We haven't met.
Don't you see these?
There you are.
- Good morning, sir.
- It's been a while.
- I spoke with the chief prosecutor.
- I see.
Well...
Let's keep it simple, gentlemen.
I never expected to see you in these courts, SONG.
What a surprise.
I thought we'd say hello.
Lots of reporters have come to cover this high-profile case.
Be discreet with your statements.
I'll see you all in court.
Counselor SONG.
I hear you got an offer from Haedong Constructions.
Why are you defending commies at such a critical time?
Excuse me?
Is there a relative involved?
Tell me who it is.
I'll go easy on him.
- Goodness...
- Ki-woong'.!
Tae-jun!
Honorable Judge PARK presiding.
All rise!
Be seated!
Court is now in session for criminal case 1-81 violation of...
Objection.
Counselor.
The trial hasn't even begun.
Precisely.
Precisely why I'm objecting.
Well?
If it fails to be appropriate, you'll be held accountable for obstruction of justice.
Article 280 of the penal code prohibits the physical restraint of defendants.
I ask for the immediate removal of the ropes and handcuffs.
It also states that defendants must be seated "at the head of the court".
This is how trials are held in...
Article 26, clause 4 of the Constitution states
"innocent until proven guilty".
This trial has not yet begun!
I will not tolerate customs treating the defendants as criminals.
The abuse of public authority!
Isn't that what we're here to determine?
Your Honor.
Prosecution may state the charges.
Since March 8th of 1981, these defendants including PARK Jin-woo held thirteen illegal gatherings disguised as a book club.
Contrary to the pretense of a book club, the defendants studied works of subversive literature.
They praised Communist beliefs and antinational propaganda.
They organized a secret revolt to do the biddings of the North.
These are their signed confessions revealing all of these atrocities.
I will now quote part of PARK Jin-woo's confession.
"Vietnam has not collapsed, but reunited under a Socialist system."
"South Korea must follow in suit."
"The goal for now is to overthrow the current fascist regime,"
"but we must liberate the peninsula through a socialist revolution."
We present these statements as evidence before the court.
Defendant!
Did you personally write these statements?
They are the result of torture...
I didn't ask you!
I'm asking the defendant!
Defendant!
Answer with a yes or no.
Yes, you wrote it.
No, you didn't.
Yes.
And you signed it yourself?
Yes or no.
Yes.
The court accepts it as evidence.
This is your first National Security Law case?
Yes.
I was forced to prosecute public safety cases back in the day.
National Security cases are about one thing.
- What?
- Negotiation of penalties!
Not guilty or innocent!
And you meddled with the judge!
Counselor.
Do you believe these kids did anything wrong?
- That's...
- He has bruises all over him.
What good is a confession if they forced it from him through torture?
According to the law?
They'd all be innocent for insufficient evidence.
Our very President would be convicted, according to the law.
For military insurrection!
Aren't we here to uphold the law?
I'm not here to teach you about justice!
If you want to finish this, just do as I tell you.
I'll take care of it.
Your duty is to assist me!
I don't think so.
I may not have much experience, but I know Jin-woo is innocent.
I just have to prove it, and that's my duty.
SONG!
He's out of his damn mind!
Attorney SONG Woo-seok's office.
It's the British Consulate.
The embassy sent a reply.
- What should I say'?
- I'll go right now.
He'll be heading over now.
All right.
You should go home.
Counselor SONG!
Where have you been all clay?
- You drank again?
- Sure did.
I met the Haedong people to seal our deal!
I got us a nice...
Going somewhere?
- I'm representing Jin-woo.
- Jin-woo?
PARK Jin-woo?
Absolutely not.
Never!
I already went to trial.
Just forget about it.
I promise.
I'll find a better pork stew place.
And we'll go every day.
It won't interfere with Haedong.
SONG!
Life is all about timing, and there's a superhighway in front of you.
Why are you hitting the brakes, when you should be speeding?
For my kids.
So they can live in a world free of this nonsense.
It'll be a better world for your son, too.
Don't worry about him.
I'm sending him abroad.
I'm not done talking.
I'm doing Jin-woo's trial.
Counselor SONG!
Your name and affiliation.
UM Tae-nam.
Domestic and Foreign Policy Institute.
What are you duties?
Evaluating subversive literature.
"What is History?
Was written by E.H. Carr, a historian and a communist."
"This book justifies communist beliefs and serves as a threat to readers."
"It may inseminate such views in a reader."
"Should any person study this text,"
"they are showing interest in learning communist theory."
Is this the evaluation issued by your institute?
- That is correct.
- Prosecution rests.
Begin the cross-examination.
Where is this institute?
Where is it located?
Yongsan, Seoul.
What's the address?
I'm not sure.
You don't know the address?
Is that illegal?
Counselor.
I don't know the court address either.
Don't delay this trial with irrelevant questions.
Do a proper cross-examination.
I can tell you the address.
32-16 Yejang-dong, Seoul.
Is that right?
- I don't...
- Then how about this?
Isn't that where the ANSP office is?
The location of ANSP is classified!
Counsel is currently revealing matters of national security.
Counsel thanks prosecution for confirming the location.
If the boys upstairs tell you it's a communist book, do you even read it before the evaluation?
Counsel is reaching a conclusion based on speculation.
I wouldn't have to, if the witness had done his job.
You wrote that E.H. Carr is a communist living in the USSR.
He lived there for years...
So he's a Soviet commie?
I bet my life on it.
No need for that.
He did live in the Soviet Union, but why?
Why did he live there when he wasn't Russian?
E.H. Carr was a diplomat from Britain, our ally in the War.
He was the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union.
Counsel cannot prove these claims.
Can you prove it, Counselor?
This is a telegram sent by the British Embassy.
"Edward Hallett Carr was born in London and educated at Cambridge."
"A respected historian and diplomat of the United Kingdom."
"What is History?
Is not a text which advocates communist beliefs."
"We encourage more readers in Korea to study this text."
"Foreign and Commonwealth Office."
This nation fought by our side...
You're saying they're communists just to convict these students?
This morning, I bought the subversive books these defendants read.
These books can be found in any bookstore.
Even recommended by Seoul National University.
Does that make our nation's top university a corrupt school?
Your Honor.
Prosecutor KANG.
Didn't you both graduate from this corrupt university?
This trial is full of nonsense, like this fake evaluation.
Their book club is nothing more than a book club.
Students with little money sharing their books.
They study it together and teach others.
We should be applauding them.
These defendants are not defendants at all!
They're victims of unjust and cruel public authority.
Get me the Haedong files.
They said it's hopeless.
Hitting boulders with eggs.
Boulders will break into dust, but eggs will hatch.
Didn't you tell me that?
Are you gonna sit around and let them break you?
Huh?
Can you remember where they tortured you?
Their faces and names?
Called each other Director CHA, Manager YOON.
Director CHA?
Where did they keep you?
It was an old building.
Some kind of motel.
Motel?
You remember where?
They had my eyes covered...
- But I heard foghorns.
- Stop here.
I could hear trains nearby.
There was a van parked outside for clays.
Just stay down!
Or we'll break you.
- Mr. LEE!
- Yes, sir.
Bring him over here.
Get up.
You little bastard.
According to what you wrote, you deserve a medal.
You kids studied together and taught other kids.
Look up at me.
Jin-woo.
Yes.
Do we look like bad guys?
No, sir.
What do you believe in, Jin-woo?
Believe?
I don't...
- I don't...
- It's an easy question.
The thoughts that you keep close to your heart.
What are they?
Existentialism?
Did existentialism sound right'?
Mother fucker.
Grab him.
Wait!
I was wrong!
I made a mistake!
Existentialism?
You goddamn commie!
What in the hell?
I'm a lawyer!
You thought you could waltz in here?
Wait.
Goddamn bastard.
Tax specialist attorney?
SONG Woo-seek.
I'm PARK...
PARK Jin-woo's lawyer.
A commie counsel.
The law seem like bullshit to you?
Breaking and entering, and obstruction of justice!
You little...
Attention!
Mr. Lawyer.
You think the War is over?
It's called an armistice.
This is just intermission.
But for some reason, everyone thinks the War is over.
You know why?
Because of men like me.
We risk our lives to catch these filthy commies, so people like you can go to sleep at night!
Go home and think about it.
How grateful you are to men like me.
How you can serve your country!
Counsel may begin examination.
Defendant.
Jin-woo.
How much did you weigh before they took you?
Sixty-four kilograms.
And now?
I don't know.
These prison records say fifty-three kilograms.
You lost over ten kilos in two months.
Didn't the police feed you?
Sometimes they did.
Sometimes they didn't.
When didn't they feed you, and for what reason?
I threw up what I ate after they tortured me.
Since then, they didn't feed me on days I got tortured.
Quiet down.
I'll do anything you want.
Jin-woo.
Now...
You remember who mentioned reunification and all that?
I remember.
I remember everything.
Ready to write down the truth again?
Yes.
But if I write those lies that I make up...
What happens to him?
Lies?
Mother fucker.
Who told you to lie?
Who told you that?
I told you to write down the truth!
The goddamn truth!
Hold him down!
Your Honor!
These students aren't the ones that should be on trial!
It's the detective who beat and tortured them!
It's the corrupt prosecution and our military regime.
Counsel is threatening governmental authority!
I'm warning you.
Speak with discretion!
Your Honor.
The defendant's mother...
She searched the city for months for her missing son.
She even...
She...
She ran to the morgue with a heavy heart.
Why did she look through the unidentified bodies?
Because the police kidnapped the defendants to torture them.
Prosecution may begin.
I'm not finished!
Don't create a scene, or I'll throw you out!
What was the worst thing you experienced there?
Resentment.
All those lies...
If I make up lies on a statement, it would come back to me with more lies on it.
March 8th!
He says you did this.
Why didn't you write it?
I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't know, sir.
So...
Do you know now?
Yes, I know.
I know very well now.
Read it.
May 15th...
And?
Anything else?
More?
Your memories are different.
- This is your last chance.
- Yes, sir.
Dates, times, and names.
- Get it all right.
- Yes, sir.
Begin.
We took the train to Seoul on May 15th.
Took a bus from Seoul Station.
Got off at the last stop.
We met Mr. KIM and went to Kaebong-dong.
Mr. KIM called for a revolution to overthrow the government,
and you and I nodded.
When we arrived, the workers were gathered to welcome us.
So you and I educated them to raise their awareness.
We read subversive literature.
Shouted protest slogans.
Mr. KIM gave us some money the next day, and on the train back to Busan...
We stopped at Daejeon and had some noodles.
Those noodles were so good.
The cherry blossoms were in bloom...
We said they smelled so pretty...
Ki-woong.
Jin-woo.
Don't cry.
You did nothing wrong.
' Ki-Woong! " Don't cry!
It's okay!
Punish the torturer!
- Punish the torturer!
- Release the defendants!
Release them!
Bailiff!
Quiet!
Banish the military regime!
Quiet!
Clear the courtroom!
Take the defendants!
Defense rests with this examination.
These confessions were forced through violence and torture.
They cannot and must not be used as evidence!
Defense calls for CHA Dong-young to testify before the court.
He'!
-
Is this really necessary?
I'll extenuate the circumstances.
Negotiate the sentences.
Prosecutor?
Then I'll negotiate with the...
Counselor PARK!
And Your Honor.
This trial is about revealing the manipulation of public authority, and CHA Dong-young is the key.
He must testify!
I will.
Prosecution accepts.
Fine.
The court accepts the witness.
- Yes.
- The Budokryun case.
Leave it there.
I'll see you there.
Leave it.
We can buy the tax administration at these prices.
But why do you think we insist on hiring you?
I'm starting to wonder.
This may sound strange, but I want to clean up this nation more than anyone.
Democracy was what I envied most while studying in the U.S.
But these people took power through a military coup.
Do you think they'll just agree to
American democracy?
You can't get through to them.
They must be driven out.
Civil movements.
Democratization.
It's accomplished by bourgeoisie, middle-class citizens.
But for a civil revolution to happen in this country, the national income must be three times higher.
Our people aren't ready yet.
Counselor SONG.
My father received a call today.
He told me to fire you and find another lawyer, but I insisted.
If you sign this, you'll work exclusively for us.
If you continue with that case, we'll just have to say...
We never met you.
Thank you for your courtesy.
I mean it.
But say that you met me.
Just tell them you couldn't work with a nut like me.
I have a trial to prepare for.
Just one thing.
I only recently realized it, but I can't agree to the notion that poor citizens cannot have justice.
Oh well.
But remember this.
You turned down the chance of a lifetime today.
Don't regret it.
- That's the car!
- Where?
- Is it him?
- That's the bastard!
You communist crook!
Go back home, commie!
You filthy lawyer!
Take it off.
Your shirt, you idiot!
The court is full!
You can't do this!
Why can't we go in?
There aren't any seats left.
What's going on here?
There are no seats left.
No seats?
Don't worry.
It's half empty!
- Da-woon!
- Dae-jun!
Dae-jun!
Let us in!
I solemnly affirm, that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
CHA Dong-young-
Defense may begin.
Your name and affiliation.
CHA Dong-young, Busan Central Police.
Witness!
Did you lawfully arrest the suspects?
I did.
Did you show them a warrant?
Counsel doesn't seem to know much about the law.
Nation Security cases are dealt rather differently.
We apprehend suspects first.
Warrants come afterwards.
Should I come back after you do some studying?
Go home and study!
Were the families notified of their arrests?
We tried, but some people weren't home...
You illegally held them in custody
- for two months?
- Counselor!
I told you to study National Security Law.
National Security cases allow up to fifty days of legal detainment.
Answer the question!
And mind your tone in this courtroom!
You only have the forged confessions?
Defense is leading the witness.
Counselor!
The only evidence you have are their confessions?
Sneaky commies like them never leave evidence.
What evidence can there be for crimes of thought?
National Security cases focus on confessions.
National Security again.
Confessions alone are insufficient to convict a suspect.
Is National Security Law above all our legal foundations?
Don't ask me.
I only do what the law says.
How do you decide that this concerns national security?
I've done it for thirteen years.
I can spot a National Security case just by looking at them.
Really?
Then tell me...
If I root for Ali instead of Foreman, did I violate National Security?
According to your interpretation,
I'm guilty if KIM ll-sung roots for Ali.
Defense has ridiculed the law and idolized the North Korean leader.
A few students gathered for a book club.
How did you decide that they violated National Security Law?
On what grounds?
I don't decide it.
The nation does.
The nation?
What is this nation that you speak of'?
You call yourself a lawyer, not knowing what a nation is?
I know all too well.
Constitution Article 1, clause 2!
Sovereignty lies with the people.
All authority is granted by the people!
The people are the nation!
A nation you oppressed with no legal grounds, under premises of national security!
Those soldiers who took hold of the government by force!
They are your nation!
Shut your mouth!
Counsel is threatening the witness!
- Witness.
- Counselor!
Didn't you torture the suspects for their confessions?
- No.
- Witness is committing perjury!
I didn't torture them!
Will you keep denying what these pictures show?
Those were self-inflicted.
Self-inflicted?
Cut this bullshit and speak the truth.
You think you're a patriot?
Far from it.
You're nothing but a parasite feeding off an innocent nation!
Speak the truth.
That's real patriotism!
Shut your trap, commie!
Get out of here!
This is no examination!
Defense is threatening him!
One more time and I'll have you removed!
Remove those planted reprobates for obstruction first!
Prosecution proceed.
I'm not finished!
I'll do this all night!
Speak the truth.
Admit that you tortured them to confess.
Bailiff!
Remove users of profanity!
- Remove counsel!
- Admit it!
Prosecution proceed.
Did you use torture'?
- No.
- Prosecution rests.
He's giving false testimony!
- Final trial will be in two clays.
- Your Honor!
This is perjury!
Your Honor!
Your Honor!
It's all over now!
Did you expect an apology out of him?
Am I the only one here'?
What were you doing?
Praying through the trial?
You are the only attorney.
You've already done everything as you please.
What can I do?
You wrecked this trial yourself.
Counselor!
They accused us of tax evasion...
You should both go home.
Take a few days off.
I'll clean this up.
Like hell.
It'll take you ages.
Stop crying and sweep the floors.
- Daddy!
- My troublemakers.
I got a perfect score.
Didn't I do well?
What's my reward?
A perfect score, of course.
You look upset.
What's wrong?
I got a phone call.
A call?
What did they say?
Not much.
Just some things about Gun-woo.
Tell me.
They knew which class he's in, who his teacher is.
Then they hung up.
Dear.
Couldn't you quit this case?
I didn't order.
Someone else did.
Sent you this note, too.
Who?
I don't know.
Hey, kid!
Huh?
Did you eat yet?
I need good reporters and foreign press at tomorrow's trial.
Lieutenant YOON visited me.
The medic from the interrogations.
A witness that will flip this case.
They won't accept him.
I'll tell the judge that I plan to hold a press conference.
That's why I need the foreign press.
Help me out.
Defense requests Lieutenant YOON Sung-du as witness.
SONG.
Today is the last trial.
Stop this nonsense and move.
He witnessed the entire event.
Fine!
Dismissed!
You suddenly spring this on me on the day of the trial.
And in front of my house, to top it off?
Then I'll hold a press conference to announce your dismissal.
Reporters from Mainichi, AP, and ZDF are all there.
I'll state that this dismissal only proves the manipulation of this trial.
Counselor!
SONG!
The last trial
Defense calls Lieutenant YOON to the stand.
Prosecution was not consulted.
We do not accept.
The court accepts the witness.
You can't accept a witness we didn't know about.
I have my reasons.
You'll be fine.
Go on.
Your name and affiliation?
YOON Sung-flu.
Medical officer of the ROK Army.
Why did you work with police detectives'?
I was assigned to an anti-communism investigation.
What were your duties?
First aid and emergency treatment.
They needed treatment in interrogations?
Were they tortured?
- Defense is leading the...
- Yes!
They were tortured.
Did you witness the torture?
I witnessed it.
Who tortured whom?
Inspector CHA Dong-young and his detectives.
They tortured the victims of this Budokryun case.
Order in the court!
Through what methods were they tortured?
Assault.
Waterboarding.
Electrical torture.
Chicken?
Barring.
Days of sleep deprivation.
All possible means.
The truth is finally revealed.
We have a clear incident, a witness, and a testimony.
This is a trial on the violation of human rights!
Not national security.
As with defendant PARK Jin-woo, all defendants of this case plead "not guilty".
Stop springing so many surprises.
I'm sorry, sir.
It all happened so quickly.
I meant that I failed, and you succeeded.
I must've let you down.
Of course not.
Prosecution may cross-examine.
I said to cross-examine!
One moment, Your Honor.
Prosecution will proceed.
Witness.
You're currently serving as a medical officer?
Yes.
Did you come here from the camp, or another location?
I'm currently on leave.
They let you take vacations without permission?
Witness left his post six days ago and still hasn't returned.
He is currently an AWOL soldier.
That's not true!
I applied for leave!
Prosecution is threatening him with irrelevant information!
Your Honor.
MP's are standing by outside to arrest the witness.
This is blackmail and slander by manipulation of his status!
Defense must have fallen for this declaration of conscience,
but he's nothing more than a corrupt AWOL soldier, mocking the court with false testimony!
Prosecution will charge him with perjury-
Recess is due for military law.
No!
You can't!
Protect the witness!
We must protect him!
Stenographer.
Strike the testimony.
Court will adjourn for military law and resume in two hours.
Strike the testimony?
The witness risked everything to reveal the truth!
- Call off the recess!
- Bailiff!
- You can't adjourn!
- Remove counsel!
What is this trial for?
What happened to our rule of law?
- You call this nonsense a trial?
- Drag him out!
Lieutenant!
Lieutenant YOON!
Lieutenant!
You can't hide the truth forever!
Are you so terrified?
Counselor.
You did your best.
Get some food in you, for my sake.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Don't apologize.
I'm truly grateful.
He's right here.
Come in.
The judge insisted on their release on parole in two years.
Prosecution agreed on terms that we don't file for appeal.
Jin-woo was sentenced to three, but will be out in two years.
You are currently illegally occupying this street.
We are all responsible for permitting injustice!
We are obligated to fight, because we stand alive today!
We must fight for democracy!
Citizens united!
We stand 'm memory of PARK long-chem'.!
This is not illegal!
Stand united!
Keep your ground!
Stand united!
Keep your ground!
We must stand united!
Stay strong!
Stand united!
Keep your ground!
Stay strong!
Citizens!
Citizens!
Stay strong!
Citizens!
A service could initiate disorder as in past instances.
Memorial services are about honoring the deceased.
Essentially calm and quiet.
If such things pose a threat, it only shows the growing fear of people using violence against it.
But you're an attorney.
Haven't you crossed the line by violating positive law?
It's because I'm an attorney.
Attorneys must lead the people in such unjust, unlawful times.
That's the true duty of an attorney.
All rise!
Be seated.
Prosecution.
State your charges.
The defendant has planned and lead various illegal gatherings, and extensively violated the law on assembly and demonstration.
Defense.
Your opening statement.
Your Honor.
Many members of counsel are sitting in the gallery.
We cannot confirm their attendance.
In order to confirm counsel's attendance today, we ask that you call the names of these members of counsel.
These are all...
Yes.
The reason for our request.
I will now call out the names.

The Attorney
This stop is Bumin-dong.
In 1978, Busan
Counselor!
- How have you been?
- You!
What brings you here?
I was in the neighborhood.
I see.
- Should I come back later?
- Say hello.
SONG Woo-seek.
He's a judge in Daejeon.
Is that so?
This is attorney LEE Heung-ki.
SONG Woo-seek.
LEE Heung-KL.
How do you like being a judge?
I didn't.
So I resigned.
Resign?
They even put it on the news when you were appointed.
I thought you were serious about it.
All that media coverage for no reason?
They were only mocking me for being a high school graduate.
I'm looking to make money.
You don't need a degree to make money, right'?
The founder of Hyundai only finished grade school.
You won't get many privileges with such a short term.
I don't care about things like that.
I want to work down here in Busan.
Sir.
I have a brilliant plan.
What is it'?
It's absolutely brilliant.
But the thing is...
I'll need an office at least, but I'm broke.
Lend me some money.
It's all about real estate registration.
The profit margin is unbelieveable!
While lawyers run around courtrooms, notaries rake in the money with just a few stamps.
Can lawyers do it?
That's the best part.
Real estate is booming nationwide.
There's too much work for notaries to handle alone, so they changed the law and lawyers can do it too.
Call an attorney for real estate!
I'll be home soon.
Have to go.
Good night, sir.
Good evening!
Call an attorney for real estate...
You bastard!
Which club are you from?
No, I'm a lawyer.
Attorney at law, SONG Woo-seek.
The law is a phone call away.
- Hey!
- Even real estate...
What's going on here?
Call an attorney!
Good night.
Attorney?
Who was that?
I guess lawyers aren't all high and mighty.
- Real estate specialist...
- it's me.
Right.
Did you have lunch?
Not yet.
It'll take time for business to get going.
- Don't worry so much.
- I've got a client.
I have to go.
Chinese delivery.
Enjoy.
Where are the pickles?
We don't deliver single orders...
Just say that you forgot them.
- Don't forget them again.
- Yes, sir.
Goddamn pickles.
Is this...
Welcome!
I'll be right back with your pickles.
Thirty percent?
Do they take us for chumps?
We're the ones putting food on their table.
But they think they put the food on ours.
- Why so serious?
- Broker wants higher fees.
Did you hear about that fool named SONG?
Hands out business cards like some salesman.
I heard.
But what for?
I heard he does real estate registration.
Registration?
What an idiot!
How low can you go?
Isn't that what notaries do?
Can lawyers do it?
Lawyers can.
The law recently changed.
Someone should talk sense into him.
Where did he get his degree?
He only finished high school.
High school?
Well, that explains it.
The poor idiot just doesn't know any better.
Talk about a rotten apple spoiling the barrel.
A high school graduate signing real estate...
There you are, sir.
You're all early.
Don't get up.
You're here!
Did you all meet?
Hello.
I'm the idiot that's been handing out business cards.
High school graduate, SONG Woo-seek.
Real estate registration isn't too bad of a business, since I don't send brokers a monthly check.
Enjoy, gentlemen.
I have to get going.
What happened?
One noodle and a fried rice.
Yes, sir.
- Who ordered the coffee?
- Over there.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, but there's a wait.
Counselor KIM sent me here.
Should I come back later?
It's nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.
Business is booming, as you can see.
Must have your hands full with angry notaries.
They already called with complaints, but I'm not breaking any laws.
Shall we get started, then?
Started on what?
Work.
But we just met.
I only dropped by for Counselor KIM's sake.
I heard your salary was three hundred.
Five hundred a month.
What will it be?
You're awfully impatient, aren't you?
That's hot!
You two can go now.
Line up here and give me your paperwork everyone!
That's it.
Give them to me.
Don't push.
- Take mine!
- Hold on!
I'm home.
I couldn't even find the time to take a piss!
Count up how much we made today.
You're still awake!
Let me pee first.
Don't just throw it all into a sack.
What a mess.
That feels good.
It's not flushing again!
Just pour some water.
Sheesh.
How many more times do we have to tell the landlord?
It's no use.
We're on high ground.
You happy'?
About what?
I'm happy making all these sacks of money.
Aren't you?
Of course I am.
Is there anything you wanted to do?
We suddenly have all this money...
I don't know what to do with it.
Right?
That's what happens to people when they have money.
You think of countless things to buy when you're broke.
Butit'sdifferentwhenyou'rerich.
That's true.
Those little rats.
- They're at it again.
- Sheesh!
You're making a mess!
Damn it.
They're even louder recently.
Go to sleep.
It's late.
- My goodness.
- I'm sure they understood.
Meow.
You try it, then.
Meow.
Forget it.
It sounds nothing like it.
He'!
-
Let's move to an apartment.
There's no mice there!
And water gushing out!
No newspapers.
It's not newspapers.
I'm a lawyer.
Good afternoon.
SONG Woo-seek, attorney at law.
- Attorney?
- Yes, ma'am.
"Real estate specialist".
- What is this about?
- Well...
May I come inside for a moment?
Your husband is home.
No, he's some lawyer.
And we're not done yet.
Have a seat.
So what is this about?
They grow these domestically now.
Oh my!
These are pineapples!
This is too much...
But what brings you here?
- I want to buy this house.
- Pardon?
But it's not for sale.
That's right.
Apartment 803 is on the market.
You came to the wrong house.
This is the tenth floor.
Isn't it nice here?
Great view of the ocean.
Lots of sunlight.
And sturdy framework.
Whoever built it did good work.
Look here!
Our house isn't for sale!
I want to buy this apartment.
I'll give you $25,000 for it.
The place downstairs costs
You'll make $5,000 if you move downstairs.
What will it be?
Mrs. LEE.
I'll buy the rest tomorrow.
Okay.
Would you care for some cold juice, sir?
Sounds great.
Bye now.
Say... ls there some reason for buying this particular house?
Well...
Why don't you finish your makeup first?
My goodness!
on my!
How em harassing!
7 years ago
Thank you.
The baby born today.
Which room is it?
Excuse me?
The mother's name is JANG Su-kyung.
- Room 202.
- 202?
Two...
Gosh...
You're here, ma'am.
There's my smart son-in-law.
You look exhausted from all that studying.
Don't mind the fees.
I took care of it.
What?
You shouldn't have.
I can pay it.
Just go on in.
You must've been startled.
He's impatient like his father.
Why do you look all miserable?
- Want some more?
- I'm fine.
I almost forgot.
Pay me for last month if you can.
I have to pay the butcher later.
Thank you, ma'am.
It was delicious.
Thank you.
- Come again.
- Good night.
I need my books back.
You like it?
It's our new home.
My goodness gracious.
Someone scribbled on here.
We should replaster it.
Oh my.
Gun-woo.
You're old enough to read now.
What does that say?
"Never give up."
I wrote it the day you were born.
You did?
Son.
I built this house.
Isn't it nice?
Isn't it nice?
You really built it, Dad?
Of course.
I built it so we could all live here together.
One brick after another.
Should we eat out?
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Is it good?
Sure.
Good night.
- What is it, honey?
- Huh?
I have a debt to settle.
A debt?
Nothing.
Eat up.
Can I get you anything?
Do you remember me?
Ma'am.
You don't remember me?
My memory isn't what it used to be.
I ran out without paying the bill seven years ago.
Oh!
You were studying to become a lawyer.
Remember, Mom'?
You called him a crook, perfect for being a lawyer.
Remember?
YOU!
Are you really that twit?
Did you pass?
I did.
I'm an attorney now.
Really?
I was a judge in Daejeon.
Now an attorney here.
Say hello.
This is my wife.
Nice to meet you.
You too.
My goodness.
A wife and two children.
The poor flimsy thing came back as a man.
Ma'am.
Please forgive me.
I should've come sooner, but I've finally come to pay my dues.
Put that away.
I've long forgotten about that.
Don't make me into a real crook now.
I said to put that away.
Seeing you this successful is payment enough.
But ma'am...
Come now!
This isn't enough for seven years.
Huh?
Old debts are settled by face, not money.
It means you better come back often!
To heck with it.
Your meal is free today, too!
Gosh, ma'am.
Would you let me hug you?
Ma'am...
Thank you so much.
Why let a good meal sit bad all these years?
My goodness.
Thank you.
Number 28 is next.
Who didn't get coffee?
Here you go.
You should add more chives.
Right.
That's good.
Yangjeong.
Dongrae district.
Yangjeong.
Central Busan.
Let's take a break.
I told you it needs more chives.
What's wrong?
- Not feeling well?
- I'm fine.
- I'll be back.
- Take care.
- Excuse me.
- How old are you?
Seven!
I bet you're excited to move.
Like a cat pissing in the sky!
It's chilly.
- Where are you going?
- Not this again.
It's perfect weather for some good stew.
Let's get you a balanced diet.
How about some seafood?
With a little soju.
What?
You'll drink yourself silly like last time.
- Come on!
- That smell!
You like rice wine so much, but did you know this?
They use blowfish to wipe...
I put in extra meat today.
Wow.
What about mine?
Anyway, blowfish skin is so toxic...
When will we say goodbye, little piggie?
Come on, SONG.
Why are you so picky about food?
You need a balanced diet.
It's time we changed our menu.
Let's set up a better office and a secretary.
It doesn't look good...
Call girls serving coffee?
Then let's do it right.
We'll renovate the office.
Get us a nice secretary.
As for the menu, we'll keep eating here.
Watch the sides!
This way.
Put it where people can see it.
Have a cold drink.
Here you go.
Nice and cold.
What about me?
You're hardly working.
I have a bad back.
And SONG is overdoing it.
We didn't pay good money to haul things ourselves.
SONG!
You can speak English?
Huh?
It's all in English!
What is this, sir?
Those orchids could use some water, Miss MOON.
Okay!
They're dry as a bone!
Would you read these if they were in Korean?
It's purely for show.
May as well be in English.
There you go.
Put these right in the middle.
I know you love me...
- Hurry and get dressed!
- Who is it?
Our neighbor is coming to ask about taxes.
- Goodness.
- Is that so?
Wipe your face a little.
I'm letting her in.
The penalties are higher than the original deduction.
It's a bit much.
Exactly!
Let's try this.
- Thank you, Mr. SONG.
- It's nothing.
- Take care.
- You too.
Good night.
Bye.
Damn it.
It's over.
- What?
- I'm impressed.
Shucks.
That's hardly impressive.
- Are the kids asleep?
- Come now.
It was impressive, but earnings are short these clays.
Are you hiding it from me?
Of course not.
All those badmouthing lawyers are doing real estate too now.
Less work means less money.
Why hire a secretary if there's less work?
I hear she's awfully pretty.
Well...
I guess she's not too hard on the eyes...
I really wasn't keen on hiring anyone, but Mr. PARK insisted so much, with all those call girls...
What are call girls doing in your office?
Well...
I don't...
Why were they?
We had to serve out coffee.
We were short of hands...
All those times you told me not to come.
And that was why.
Come on.
Forget it.
Are the kids asleep?
Forget it.
Stop it.
- I said, stop it.
- I thought you were impressed.
Stop it.
Mr. PARK.
I've been thinking.
Why don't we change our range of practice?
I'd say it's about time.
All the lawyers are doing registration these days.
Look how empty it is.
Did you have something in mind?
Why don't we do taxes?
Taxes?
Taxes are good.
But you need to know about accounting as much as law.
I learned it all back in high school.
No lawyer around does books like I can.
Really?
I can bring in all the tax cases.
I even thought of a great slogan.
"We take care of you and your interests."
Tax law specialist, SONG Woo-seek.
That's perfect!
This is why I love you, SONG.
- Sound good?
- Absolutely.
Mr. SONG!
Mr. PARK!
Come quick!
What's all the ruckus?
Come quick!
What are all those people?
Down with SONG Woo-seek!
Down with lawyers!
I'm SONG Woo-seok.
What is this about?
You call that a question?
All the lawyers are in real estate because of you!
Say we're switching to taxes and they'll go.
They shouldn't come here making a scene.
Stop blocking my office!
Sue me if I'm at fault!
Or I'll sue for interference!
- What did he just say?
- He's impossible.
Down with SONG Woo-seek!
Down with lawyers!
Down with SONG Woo-seek!
Wait!
What do we do?
Jesus.
What's going on?
Are you all right?
What's happening?
In 1981
Inspector CHA Dong-young.
This medal is for your achievements in national security.
President CHUN Doo-hwan.
You played a big role in this case.
You did well.
Thank you, sir.
- Superintendent General.
- Yes.
I need a favor.
Inspector CHA.
I need him to do a case in Busan.
Sure.
If the country needs his services, who am I to say no?
- Which prosecutor do you have in mind?
- Right.
We put KANG Hyung-chul on the case already.
He's studying the files as we speak.
- Inspector.
- Yes, sir.
We can't have an incident like
Kwangju again.
That's how you serve your country.
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
- Good night.
- Take care.
Wait.
I almost forgot.
- Thanks for lending them.
- No problem.
Mrs. PARK!
- Thank you for the meal.
- Come back soon.
Good night.
See you tomorrow.
That's it for tonight.
Hurry UP!
We were about to close.
But it's so early.
Say hello, Jin-woo.
These are my classmates.
I became alumni president.
That's great.
But we were closing.
I brought them all this way... isn't she pretty?
She sure is!
I dragged them all here to show you off.
Bring us some soju.
Pork stews all around.
Sit down, boys.
- This is good.
- Thank you.
I meant to go to reunions, but it wasn't easy getting my practice going.
They're all from big-name universities.
All high and mighty.
Won't make room for a high school graduate like me.
But I'm still kicking because I'm just that good.
Right you are.
Now I'm at the top.
I've got a hotshot lawyer friend, thanks to you.
- Let's drink to that!
- Cheers!
Look.
You boys come to me if you ever have legal problems.
- It's on the house.
- You mean it?
Alumni president's honors.
I'll make some trouble, then.
Don't say that.
Let's drink.
Crowds cheered on as the President and the First Lady waved.
Celebrating the birth of a great nation under a great leader.
The Central Distric Court sentenced the group of socialist radicals...
- Turn that down!
- Students from Seoul National University...
What kind of corrupt law is that?
A flawed government and its absurd law enforcement...
What's wrong with sentencing criminals for violating the law?
Their parents didn't send them to college to do protests.
What's wrong with putting those idiots away?
Hey!
You believe this rubbish?
The media is the last thing you can trust now.
Sheesh!
What should we believe, if not the media?
What?
The gossip of old women in hair parlors?
It's been long since all the honest reporters were fired.
Making money is fine and all, but pay some attention to the world.
Goddamn lawyers.
Then why are you still a high and mighty reporter?
According to what you're saying, you weren't fired because you kept feeding lies.
Hey!
Like a coward!
I kept my damn mouth shut like a coward!
That's why I wasn't fired.
At least I'm not running blind with my eyes wide open!
Where are you going?
We were just getting started.
Don't get upset over a stupid argument!
- Sit back down.
- Come on.
Yoon4aek.
You're one heck of a smart man, but much too biased.
Why do you find fault in everything?
The real problem is these smart kids protesting all the time!
Instead of studying to find a logical solution to things.
They're doing that bullshit to get out of studying!
What?
Have you ever stopped to think why they're protesting?
What are all those smart kids doing that for?
Because they're sick of studying?
Snap out of it, you idiot!
You think it's fine and dandy, since you're successful?
Look here.
I never went to college, but those spoiled idiots don't seem too smart to me.
They think they can change the world with a few protests?
That's not the world I live in!
Change the world?
Bullshit.
Grab him!
You know something?
That's lack of pride.
Are you that ashamed of yourself?
You bastard!
- Cut it out!
- Stop it!
Just drop it!
Ow...
Gibbering fool.
A high and mighty lawyer fighting like children.
Hang on.
That needs an ointment.
I'm all right.
To hell you are.
You don't protest, right'?
You'll be damned if you do, when your mother works this hard.
Pay attention when an adult is talking to you.
This corrupt system should be damned.
What did you say?
Come over here.
I have to clean up this mess.
If protesting could change the world,
I would've clone it ages ago.
You think the world is that soft?
You can throw dozens of eggs, but it can't hurt a boulder.
As weak as eggs are, they're still living things.
Boulders will break into dust, but eggs will hatch with life.
Ever hear that saying?
What about eggs now?
Are you giving me lip for the mess I made?
Is that what it is?
I'll pay for it all.
Here.
That's for the food and drinks.
That's for the broken table.
That's for the broken plates.
And that's for you to take a girl out on a date.
That's enough.
Say thank you when an adult gives you money.
People will call you a bastard with that kind of attitude!
What did you say?
Ma'am...
This isn't nearly enough!
Go get the salt.
- I didn't mean...
- Mom.
You learn these manners from your father?
You think money solves everything, you drunken nitwit?
Get me the salt!
I didn't mean it, ma'am.
Come on, sir.
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- Just go home.
Hold on a minute.
- Get out of my sight!
- Calm down, Mom.
You drunken fool!
He's just drunk.
I didn't mean to...
Good afternoon.
I'm CHA Dong-young.
I'm KANG Hyung-chul.
Your reputation precedes you, Inspector CHA.
- You're too kind.
- Here.
I did some digging around to cook something up, but I couldn't find much.
It's up to you now to wrap things up.
Our country would be damned if they were real commies.
My father was a high grade detective, and he used to say...
"If I have to chase after criminals, it's already over."
"Detectives like me don't arrest.
We prevent."
Sounds like a fine man.
How is he?
He was slaughtered in the Korean War.
Lieutenant YOON Sung-du!
Come here.
Why are you in uniform?
I didn't receive orders otherwise.
I was only told to report here.
Wear civilian clothing from now on.
You'll be known as Manager YOON here.
What are my duties here, sir?
Aren't you a medic'?
You'll save lives.
"L asked Asako where to put the shoes."
"She gazed at me with eyes of wonder,"
"then told me I needn't take my shoes off."
"Then sudden"...
"Then suddenly, she brought me the umbrella I had left behind."
- "I still recall the umbrella"...
- Hey!
Tell us about your first love.
I haven't had one yet.
Then you want me to be your "Asako"?
"L sometimes thought of Asako."
"If she had married"...
Can we help you?
PARK Jin-woo.
Pusan Engineering College.
Your mother sells pork stew?
Run for it!
Get over here.
You heard me!
Run away, Jin-woo!
Hurry!
Shut your trap, communist bitch!
Quick!
There's one out the window.
Run, Jin-woo!
Why are you doing this?
Jin-woo?
Manager YOON!
Hurry UP!
Come on!
Let's get dinner.
Anything but seafood.
Just stay down.
How about mill noodles?
What's that?
A type of cold noodles.
- Is it any good?
- Not bad.
The IV takes time to finish.
Let him sleep for the day.
Let's order in.
What for?
Let's try some mill noodles.
National Security Law and martial law?
That's how they got those book clubs in Seoul.
Now they're using the same strategy on these kids.
We'll talk when you get back.
How have you been, sir?
Not too great.
But I hear you're doing well.
The most successful lawyer
Successful?
I'm just working hard.
Heard you bought a fancy yacht.
Fancy?
Is that what they say?
Sheesh.
The country hick made money and lost his mind, eh?
Is something wrong, sir?
Seems so.
I'm rather busy today.
Let's make it quick.
Sure.
You know those Seoul law firms?
Law firm?
I thought I'd start one myself.
Building a sturdy system, if you will.
But no one will sign on just for me.
So I thought I could ask you to join me.
Didn't you hear about my license suspension?
Of course I heard.
I'll bring in the money until the suspension is lifted.
SONG.
I appreciate the offer, but we're on two different paths.
We breathe different air.
See different worlds.
Don't be disappointed.
You'll find someone better.
There you are.
I'm preoccupied today, but we'll talk.
All right, sir.
Oh!
Come by the pier sometime.
We'll do a few laps and get some food.
They busted the night school?
How many were arrested?
Nine in total.
She's been running around town looking for her son.
It's been over a month now.
They want us to take the case, so they can lock us up.
We need a lawyer they won't suspect.
Someone we can get through to.
One they won't suspect...
You can't tax them on all these dishonored bills and bonds.
It's nothing but a deliberate attempt to bankrupt them.
Shall we go to court, then?
That's more like it.
They'll send you a new bill.
Great.
- You saved us again.
- It's our pleasure.
Thank you.
You'll have the papers tomorrow.
Have a nice day.
Thank you.
Take care!
Gosh.
Get me something to drink.
Again?
Welcome.
Wait a second.
Excuse me.
I'm LEE Chang-jun.
Haedong Constructions.
Have a nice day.
SONG!
This is it!
You'll be going national with a case like this!
Don't get your hopes up.
Too late for that.
Haedong Constructions is top class.
One of the best ten companies in the country.
And he's the son that inherits it.
I thought they'd go to a big law firm in Seoul.
But it means they think you're even better.
Have I told you that I love you?
Mr. PARK.
You have connections with the police.
Sure.
Then see if there are any cases concerning PARK Jin-woo.
PARK Jin-woo?
The pork stew lady's son'?
He's been missing for over a month.
I think something happened.
I'll look into it.
Where are you going?
We should celebrate.
I'm feeling all anxious...
I'll just go for a lap.
They called it a luxury yacht that sailed the Pacific.
Counselor KIM.
You sound disappointed.
It's a dinghy used for racing.
Racing?
I'm looking to enter the Olympics.
They're announcing the host city of the '88 Olympics soon.
If it turns out to be Seoul, the yacht races will be held here.
An athlete needs to own a yacht in order to compete.
So I thought I'd try it.
There aren't any Korean athletes who own a yacht.
Is that so?
I know what these Busan lawyers are saying about me.
A money-hungry idiot with no education.
But I've made enough money.
Now I want to serve my country.
Olympic athlete, SONG Woo-seek!
Sailing is my only joy these days.
SONG.
Yes?
Can you take on a case for me?
I've got a big case coming up, but anything for you.
What case is it?
It's...
National Security Law.
National security?
Gosh.
How many lawyers did you meet before me?
Quite a few.
I'm just a greedy tax attorney, sir.
Right.
I'll see you around.
Sorry for the hassle.
Don't say that, sir.
Why don't you stay for a beer?
You know the kid?
Son of a local restaurant.
Counselor eats there every clay.
Heck.
Then just forget about it and move on.
But he's not the kind to get in trouble.
It's a communist case.
Communist?
Stay out of it, no matter what.
It's being handled directly by the boys upstairs.
That's not good.
Sure.
Just one moment.
Honey, it's Mr. PARK.
It's me.
I know.
I'll be there soon.
Ma'am!
Is that you?
What are you doing out here?
You're a lawyer, right'?
Yes.
Jin-woo!
What happened to Jin-woo?
That came last night.
It's a notice of trial.
He's in prison and his trial is...
In two days?
I went to the prison to see him, but they wouldn't let me.
They said it's against the law.
That's absurd!
Guardians have full visitation rights.
Then...
Can I see him if I go with you?
Counselor!
How are you, ma'am?
Counselor SONG.
The chairman sent a car for you downstairs.
I need your help.
You know that Jin-woo isn't a communist.
Please go and tell them that he's not a communist.
Help me this once.
I'll serve you for the rest of my life if you help me.
The car is waiting, Counselor.
Can't you see me talking with the counselor?
Ma'am.
I have this important meeting, but we can go afterwards.
Iran around like a lunatic looking for my son.
I even looked through the morgue.
Please.
I need your help.
I have no one else to turn to.
I'm begging you.
I'm so sorry about what I said before.
I was out of line.
Please forgive me.
Ma'am...
I promise to go with you later, but I can't cancel this.
Come help her, Miss MOON.
My Jin-woo...
Jin-woo isn't a communist.
He's not...
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Counselor!
Sir!
Jin-woo isn't a communist!
Did you see today's paper'?
It's the Budokryun case.
Jin-woo got mixed up in it.
- The Budokryun case?
- Yes.
You knew about it?
I didn't want you to worry about it.
Now you tell me?
I was going to...
Gentlemen.
Get up.
He's here.
This way, Father.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Do you know where this is?
Street number 16-3.
Mrs. PARK!
Is anyone home?
Ma'am.
Counselor!
It's really you!
Please forgive me for earlier.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
There's no need.
She has her visitation rights!
Is this prison somehow above the Constitution?
The Constitution?
The public visiting room is in repairs.
Then we'll use the private visiting room.
Is that under repair too?
Because I'll sue you if it isn't!
He's throwing a fit and threatened to sue us!
Just him and the mother.
The mother?
He wasn't sent by Counselor KIM.
Seems the mother brought him.
What's his name?
"Tax law specialist, SONG Woo-seek."
"We take care of you and your interests."
Right away, sir.
Down the hall to the left.
Let's go.
Jin-woo!
What happened?
It's me, Jin-woo.
Your mother and me!
Jin-woo?
Look at me!
Jin-woo!
They treat me well.
I confessed my crimes.
I'm guilty.
I'll be good now.
I'll be good...
Mom!
Mom!
Mom...
What's wrong?
Are you hurt?
What's this?
- Why are you hurt?
- Who did this to you?
This is unauthorized...
Get your hands off!
- Jin-woo!
- What are these bruises?
You filthy crook!
You did this!
You did this to my son, goddamn bastards!
It was you!
You filthy bastards!
Did they beat you, Jin-woo?
How dare you!
You crooks!
Filthy bastard!
What's this?
Just grab her!
Jin-woo!
Let go of my son!
- Mom!
- Jin-woo!
- Jin-woo!
- Mom!
Jin-woo!
- Mom!
- Jin-woo!
Jin-woo!
Mrs. PARK!
Ma'am!
Call an ambulance!
Wake up!
Ma'am!
They're scared it'll look suspicious if they appoint counsel.
They dropped a name.
PARK Byung-ho.
PARK Byung-ho?
I'll talk to him.
He'll only cut down the sentence.
They convict people with no crime.
What good is a trial?
PARK might be our solution.
What is this Budokryun case?
What are the charges?
Reading subversive literature with seditious content.
Praising anti-governmental groups.
These are what they call "subversive literature".
That's their excuse at first.
Then they design a specific crime through interrogation.
Why does the news mention
North Korea and communist orders?
His name is Jin-woo?
Yes.
Does he seem like a communist?
He's...
How is this possible?
This isn't supposed to happen!
No, it's not.
I'll do it.
I'll take this case.
SONG.
You've been up all night.
Go get some sleep.
We'll talk.
You shouldn't decide such things on sudden impulse.
Then why did you suddenly come looking for me?
I was in a hurry.
I needed to postpone the trial while
I found the proper lawyer.
I am a proper lawyer.
Look, SONG.
- I'm not putting you down.
- I told you.
I'm representing Jin-woo.
If you give up midway...
I will never give up.
Here for a trial?
What brings you here?
Coverage.
Some fixed case called Budokryun.
Sent here to play puppet.
Budokryun?
Let me know if you need anything.
For what?
I'm representing that case.
- You?
- Yes.
Tired of making money now?
Don't tell me.
You're going into politics?
That's not it.
You go write the article.
Yes, sir.
I'm sick of playing puppet.
All right.
Jesus.
I need a drink.
Let's go get drunk.
Yoon-taek.
Let's go.
Counselor PARK!
How have you been?
I'll be fine if you don't cause me trouble.
What are your plans for this case?
I don't have any plans.
I'm just an anvil.
You're the hammer.
If you don't slam me, we'll all be fine.
Let's cut the talk and head inside.
We haven't met.
Don't you see these?
There you are.
- Good morning, sir.
- It's been a while.
- I spoke with the chief prosecutor.
- I see.
Well...
Let's keep it simple, gentlemen.
I never expected to see you in these courts, SONG.
What a surprise.
I thought we'd say hello.
Lots of reporters have come to cover this high-profile case.
Be discreet with your statements.
I'll see you all in court.
Counselor SONG.
I hear you got an offer from Haedong Constructions.
Why are you defending commies at such a critical time?
Excuse me?
Is there a relative involved?
Tell me who it is.
I'll go easy on him.
- Goodness...
- Ki-woong'.!
Tae-jun!
Honorable Judge PARK presiding.
All rise!
Be seated!
Court is now in session for criminal case 1-81 violation of...
Objection.
Counselor.
The trial hasn't even begun.
Precisely.
Precisely why I'm objecting.
Well?
If it fails to be appropriate, you'll be held accountable for obstruction of justice.
Article 280 of the penal code prohibits the physical restraint of defendants.
I ask for the immediate removal of the ropes and handcuffs.
It also states that defendants must be seated "at the head of the court".
This is how trials are held in...
Article 26, clause 4 of the Constitution states
"innocent until proven guilty".
This trial has not yet begun!
I will not tolerate customs treating the defendants as criminals.
The abuse of public authority!
Isn't that what we're here to determine?
Your Honor.
Prosecution may state the charges.
Since March 8th of 1981, these defendants including PARK Jin-woo held thirteen illegal gatherings disguised as a book club.
Contrary to the pretense of a book club, the defendants studied works of subversive literature.
They praised Communist beliefs and antinational propaganda.
They organized a secret revolt to do the biddings of the North.
These are their signed confessions revealing all of these atrocities.
I will now quote part of PARK Jin-woo's confession.
"Vietnam has not collapsed, but reunited under a Socialist system."
"South Korea must follow in suit."
"The goal for now is to overthrow the current fascist regime,"
"but we must liberate the peninsula through a socialist revolution."
We present these statements as evidence before the court.
Defendant!
Did you personally write these statements?
They are the result of torture...
I didn't ask you!
I'm asking the defendant!
Defendant!
Answer with a yes or no.
Yes, you wrote it.
No, you didn't.
Yes.
And you signed it yourself?
Yes or no.
Yes.
The court accepts it as evidence.
This is your first National Security Law case?
Yes.
I was forced to prosecute public safety cases back in the day.
National Security cases are about one thing.
- What?
- Negotiation of penalties!
Not guilty or innocent!
And you meddled with the judge!
Counselor.
Do you believe these kids did anything wrong?
- That's...
- He has bruises all over him.
What good is a confession if they forced it from him through torture?
According to the law?
They'd all be innocent for insufficient evidence.
Our very President would be convicted, according to the law.
For military insurrection!
Aren't we here to uphold the law?
I'm not here to teach you about justice!
If you want to finish this, just do as I tell you.
I'll take care of it.
Your duty is to assist me!
I don't think so.
I may not have much experience, but I know Jin-woo is innocent.
I just have to prove it, and that's my duty.
SONG!
He's out of his damn mind!
Attorney SONG Woo-seok's office.
It's the British Consulate.
The embassy sent a reply.
- What should I say'?
- I'll go right now.
He'll be heading over now.
All right.
You should go home.
Counselor SONG!
Where have you been all clay?
- You drank again?
- Sure did.
I met the Haedong people to seal our deal!
I got us a nice...
Going somewhere?
- I'm representing Jin-woo.
- Jin-woo?
PARK Jin-woo?
Absolutely not.
Never!
I already went to trial.
Just forget about it.
I promise.
I'll find a better pork stew place.
And we'll go every day.
It won't interfere with Haedong.
SONG!
Life is all about timing, and there's a superhighway in front of you.
Why are you hitting the brakes, when you should be speeding?
For my kids.
So they can live in a world free of this nonsense.
It'll be a better world for your son, too.
Don't worry about him.
I'm sending him abroad.
I'm not done talking.
I'm doing Jin-woo's trial.
Counselor SONG!
Your name and affiliation.
UM Tae-nam.
Domestic and Foreign Policy Institute.
What are you duties?
Evaluating subversive literature.
"What is History?
was written by E.H. Carr, a historian and a communist."
"This book justifies communist beliefs and serves as a threat to readers."
"It may inseminate such views in a reader."
"Should any person study this text,"
"they are showing interest in learning communist theory."
Is this the evaluation issued by your institute?
- That is correct.
- Prosecution rests.
Begin the cross-examination.
Where is this institute?
Where is it located?
Yongsan, Seoul.
What's the address?
I'm not sure.
You don't know the address?
Is that illegal?
Counselor.
I don't know the court address either.
Don't delay this trial with irrelevant questions.
Do a proper cross-examination.
I can tell you the address.
32-16 Yejang-dong, Seoul.
Is that right?
- I don't...
- Then how about this?
Isn't that where the ANSP office is?
The location of ANSP is classified!
Counsel is currently revealing matters of national security.
Counsel thanks prosecution for confirming the location.
If the boys upstairs tell you it's a communist book, do you even read it before the evaluation?
Counsel is reaching a conclusion based on speculation.
I wouldn't have to, if the witness had done his job.
You wrote that E.H. Carr is a communist living in the USSR.
He lived there for years...
So he's a Soviet commie?
I bet my life on it.
No need for that.
He did live in the Soviet Union, but why?
Why did he live there when he wasn't Russian?
E.H. Carr was a diplomat from Britain, our ally in the War.
He was the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union.
Counsel cannot prove these claims.
Can you prove it, Counselor?
This is a telegram sent by the British Embassy.
"Edward Hallett Carr was born in London and educated at Cambridge."
"A respected historian and diplomat of the United Kingdom."
"What is History?
is not a text which advocates communist beliefs."
"We encourage more readers in Korea to study this text."
"Foreign and Commonwealth Office."
This nation fought by our side...
You're saying they're communists just to convict these students?
This morning,
I bought the subversive books these defendants read.
These books can be found in any bookstore.
Even recommended by Seoul National University.
Does that make our nation's top university a corrupt school?
Your Honor.
Prosecutor KANG.
Didn't you both graduate from this corrupt university?
This trial is full of nonsense, like this fake evaluation.
Their book club is nothing more than a book club.
Students with little money sharing their books.
They study it together and teach others.
We should be applauding them.
These defendants are not defendants at all!
They're victims of unjust and cruel public authority.
Get me the Haedong files.
They said it's hopeless.
Hitting boulders with eggs.
Boulders will break into dust, but eggs will hatch.
Didn't you tell me that?
Are you gonna sit around and let them break you?
Huh?
Can you remember where they tortured you?
Their faces and names?
Called each other Director CHA, Manager YOON.
Director CHA?
Where did they keep you?
It was an old building.
Some kind of motel.
Motel?
You remember where?
They had my eyes covered...
- But I heard foghorns.
- Stop here.
I could hear trains nearby.
There was a van parked outside for clays.
Just stay down!
Or we'll break you.
- Mr. LEE!
- Yes, sir.
Bring him over here.
Get up.
You little bastard.
According to what you wrote, you deserve a medal.
You kids studied together and taught other kids.
Look up at me.
Jin-woo.
Yes.
Do we look like bad guys?
No, sir.
What do you believe in, Jin-woo?
Believe?
I don't...
- I don't...
- it's an easy question.
The thoughts that you keep close to your heart.
What are they?
Existentialism?
Did existentialism sound right'?
Mother fucker.
Grab him.
Wait!
I was wrong!
I made a mistake!
Existentialism?
You goddamn commie!
What in the hell?
I'm a lawyer!
You thought you could waltz in here?
Wait.
Goddamn bastard.
Tax specialist attorney?
SONG Woo-seek.
I'm PARK...
PARK Jin-woo's lawyer.
A commie counsel.
The law seem like bullshit to you?
Breaking and entering, and obstruction of justice!
You little...
Attention!
Mr. Lawyer.
You think the War is over?
It's called an armistice.
This is just intermission.
But for some reason, everyone thinks the War is over.
You know why?
Because of men like me.
We risk our lives to catch these filthy commies, so people like you can go to sleep at night!
Go home and think about it.
How grateful you are to men like me.
How you can serve your country!
Counsel may begin examination.
Defendant.
Jin-woo.
How much did you weigh before they took you?
Sixty-four kilograms.
And now?
I don't know.
These prison records say fifty-three kilograms.
You lost over ten kilos in two months.
Didn't the police feed you?
Sometimes they did.
Sometimes they didn't.
When didn't they feed you, and for what reason?
I threw up what I ate after they tortured me.
Since then, they didn't feed me on days I got tortured.
Quiet down.
I'll do anything you want.
Jin-woo.
Now...
You remember who mentioned reunification and all that?
I remember.
I remember everything.
Ready to write down the truth again?
Yes.
But if I write those lies that I make up...
What happens to him?
Lies?
Mother fucker.
Who told you to lie?
Who told you that?
I told you to write down the truth!
The goddamn truth!
Hold him down!
Your Honor!
These students aren't the ones that should be on trial!
It's the detective who beat and tortured them!
It's the corrupt prosecution and our military regime.
Counsel is threatening governmental authority!
I'm warning you.
Speak with discretion!
Your Honor.
The defendant's mother...
She searched the city for months for her missing son.
She even...
She...
She ran to the morgue with a heavy heart.
Why did she look through the unidentified bodies?
Because the police kidnapped the defendants to torture them.
Prosecution may begin.
I'm not finished!
Don't create a scene, or I'll throw you out!
What was the worst thing you experienced there?
Resentment.
All those lies...
If I make up lies on a statement, it would come back to me with more lies on it.
March 8th!
He says you did this.
Why didn't you write it?
I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't know, sir.
So...
Do you know now?
Yes, I know.
I know very well now.
Read it.
May 15th...
And?
Anything else?
More?
Your memories are different.
- This is your last chance.
- Yes, sir.
Dates, times, and names.
- Get it all right.
- Yes, sir.
Begin.
We took the train to Seoul on May 15th.
Took a bus from Seoul Station.
Got off at the last stop.
We met Mr. KIM and went to Kaebong-dong.
Mr. KIM called for a revolution to overthrow the government,
and you and I nodded.
When we arrived, the workers were gathered to welcome us.
So you and I educated them to raise their awareness.
We read subversive literature.
Shouted protest slogans.
Mr. KIM gave us some money the next day, and on the train back to Busan...
We stopped at Daejeon and had some noodles.
Those noodles were so good.
The cherry blossoms were in bloom...
We said they smelled so pretty...
Ki-woong.
Jin-woo.
Don't cry.
You did nothing wrong.
' Ki-Woong!
" Don't cry!
It's okay!
Punish the torturer!
- Punish the torturer!
- Release the defendants!
Release them!
Bailiff!
Quiet!
Banish the military regime!
Quiet!
Clear the courtroom!
Take the defendants!
Defense rests with this examination.
These confessions were forced through violence and torture.
They cannot and must not be used as evidence!
Defense calls for CHA Dong-young to testify before the court.
He'!
-
Is this really necessary?
I'll extenuate the circumstances.
Negotiate the sentences.
Prosecutor?
Then I'll negotiate with the...
Counselor PARK!
And Your Honor.
This trial is about revealing the manipulation of public authority, and CHA Dong-young is the key.
He must testify!
I will.
Prosecution accepts.
Fine.
The court accepts the witness.
- Yes.
- The Budokryun case.
Leave it there.
I'll see you there.
Leave it.
We can buy the tax administration at these prices.
But why do you think we insist on hiring you?
I'm starting to wonder.
This may sound strange, but I want to clean up this nation more than anyone.
Democracy was what I envied most while studying in the U.S.
But these people took power through a military coup.
Do you think they'll just agree to
American democracy?
You can't get through to them.
They must be driven out.
Civil movements.
Democratization.
It's accomplished by bourgeoisie, middle-class citizens.
But for a civil revolution to happen in this country, the national income must be three times higher.
Our people aren't ready yet.
Counselor SONG.
My father received a call today.
He told me to fire you and find another lawyer, but I insisted.
If you sign this, you'll work exclusively for us.
If you continue with that case, we'll just have to say...
We never met you.
Thank you for your courtesy.
I mean it.
But say that you met me.
Just tell them you couldn't work with a nut like me.
I have a trial to prepare for.
Just one thing.
I only recently realized it, but I can't agree to the notion that poor citizens cannot have justice.
Oh well.
But remember this.
You turned down the chance of a lifetime today.
Don't regret it.
- That's the car!
- Where?
- Is it him?
- That's the bastard!
You communist crook!
Go back home, commie!
You filthy lawyer!
Take it off.
Your shirt, you idiot!
The court is full!
You can't do this!
Why can't we go in?
There aren't any seats left.
What's going on here?
There are no seats left.
No seats?
Don't worry.
It's half empty!
- Da-woon!
- Dae-jun!
Dae-jun!
Let us in!
I solemnly affirm, that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
CHA Dong-young-
Defense may begin.
Your name and affiliation.
CHA Dong-young, Busan Central Police.
Witness!
Did you lawfully arrest the suspects?
I did.
Did you show them a warrant?
Counsel doesn't seem to know much about the law.
Nation Security cases are dealt rather differently.
We apprehend suspects first.
Warrants come afterwards.
Should I come back after you do some studying?
Go home and study!
Were the families notified of their arrests?
We tried, but some people weren't home...
You illegally held them in custody
- for two months?
- Counselor!
I told you to study National Security Law.
National Security cases allow up to fifty days of legal detainment.
Answer the question!
And mind your tone in this courtroom!
You only have the forged confessions?
Defense is leading the witness.
Counselor!
The only evidence you have are their confessions?
Sneaky commies like them never leave evidence.
What evidence can there be for crimes of thought?
National Security cases focus on confessions.
National Security again.
Confessions alone are insufficient to convict a suspect.
Is National Security Law above all our legal foundations?
Don't ask me.
I only do what the law says.
How do you decide that this concerns national security?
I've done it for thirteen years.
I can spot a National Security case just by looking at them.
Really?
Then tell me...
If I root for Ali instead of Foreman, did I violate National Security?
According to your interpretation,
I'm guilty if KIM ll-sung roots for Ali.
Defense has ridiculed the law and idolized the North Korean leader.
A few students gathered for a book club.
How did you decide that they violated National Security Law?
On what grounds?
I don't decide it.
The nation does.
The nation?
What is this nation that you speak of'?
You call yourself a lawyer, not knowing what a nation is?
I know all too well.
Constitution Article 1, clause 2!
Sovereignty lies with the people.
All authority is granted by the people!
The people are the nation!
A nation you oppressed with no legal grounds, under premises of national security!
Those soldiers who took hold of the government by force!
They are your nation!
Shut your mouth!
Counsel is threatening the witness!
- Witness.
- Counselor!
Didn't you torture the suspects for their confessions?
- No.
- Witness is committing perjury!
I didn't torture them!
Will you keep denying what these pictures show?
Those were self-inflicted.
Self-inflicted?
Cut this bullshit and speak the truth.
You think you're a patriot?
Far from it.
You're nothing but a parasite feeding off an innocent nation!
Speak the truth.
That's real patriotism!
Shut your trap, commie!
Get out of here!
This is no examination!
Defense is threatening him!
One more time and I'll have you removed!
Remove those planted reprobates for obstruction first!
Prosecution proceed.
I'm not finished!
I'll do this all night!
Speak the truth.
Admit that you tortured them to confess.
Bailiff!
Remove users of profanity!
- Remove counsel!
- Admit it!
Prosecution proceed.
Did you use torture'?
- No.
- Prosecution rests.
He's giving false testimony!
- Final trial will be in two clays.
- Your Honor!
This is perjury!
Your Honor!
Your Honor!
It's all over now!
Did you expect an apology out of him?
Am I the only one here'?
What were you doing?
Praying through the trial?
You are the only attorney.
You've already done everything as you please.
What can I do?
You wrecked this trial yourself.
Counselor!
They accused us of tax evasion...
You should both go home.
Take a few days off.
I'll clean this up.
Like hell.
It'll take you ages.
Stop crying and sweep the floors.
- Daddy!
- My troublemakers.
I got a perfect score.
Didn't I do well?
What's my reward?
A perfect score, of course.
You look upset.
What's wrong?
I got a phone call.
A call?
What did they say?
Not much.
Just some things about Gun-woo.
Tell me.
They knew which class he's in, who his teacher is.
Then they hung up.
Dear.
Couldn't you quit this case?
I didn't order.
Someone else did.
Sent you this note, too.
Who?
I don't know.
Hey, kid!
Huh?
Did you eat yet?
I need good reporters and foreign press at tomorrow's trial.
Lieutenant YOON visited me.
The medic from the interrogations.
A witness that will flip this case.
They won't accept him.
I'll tell the judge that I plan to hold a press conference.
That's why I need the foreign press.
Help me out.
Defense requests Lieutenant YOON Sung-du as witness.
SONG.
Today is the last trial.
Stop this nonsense and move.
He witnessed the entire event.
Fine!
Dismissed!
You suddenly spring this on me on the day of the trial.
And in front of my house, to top it off?
Then I'll hold a press conference to announce your dismissal.
Reporters from Mainichi, AP, and ZDF are all there.
I'll state that this dismissal only proves the manipulation of this trial.
Counselor!
SONG!
The last trial
Defense calls Lieutenant YOON to the stand.
Prosecution was not consulted.
We do not accept.
The court accepts the witness.
You can't accept a witness we didn't know about.
I have my reasons.
You'll be fine.
Go on.
Your name and affiliation?
YOON Sung-flu.
Medical officer of the ROK Army.
Why did you work with police detectives'?
I was assigned to an anti-communism investigation.
What were your duties?
First aid and emergency treatment.
They needed treatment in interrogations?
Were they tortured?
- Defense is leading the...
- Yes!
They were tortured.
Did you witness the torture?
I witnessed it.
Who tortured whom?
Inspector CHA Dong-young and his detectives.
They tortured the victims of this Budokryun case.
Order in the court!
Through what methods were they tortured?
Assault.
Waterboarding.
Electrical torture.
Chicken?
barring.
Days of sleep deprivation.
All possible means.
The truth is finally revealed.
We have a clear incident, a witness, and a testimony.
This is a trial on the violation of human rights!
Not national security.
As with defendant PARK Jin-woo, all defendants of this case plead "not guilty".
Stop springing so many surprises.
I'm sorry, sir.
It all happened so quickly.
I meant that I failed, and you succeeded.
I must've let you down.
Of course not.
Prosecution may cross-examine.
I said to cross-examine!
One moment, Your Honor.
Prosecution will proceed.
Witness.
You're currently serving as a medical officer?
Yes.
Did you come here from the camp, or another location?
I'm currently on leave.
They let you take vacations without permission?
Witness left his post six days ago and still hasn't returned.
He is currently an AWOL soldier.
That's not true!
I applied for leave!
Prosecution is threatening him with irrelevant information!
Your Honor.
MP's are standing by outside to arrest the witness.
This is blackmail and slander by manipulation of his status!
Defense must have fallen for this declaration of conscience,
but he's nothing more than a corrupt AWOL soldier, mocking the court with false testimony!
Prosecution will charge him with perjury-
Recess is due for military law.
No!
You can't!
Protect the witness!
We must protect him!
Stenographer.
Strike the testimony.
Court will adjourn for military law and resume in two hours.
Strike the testimony?
The witness risked everything to reveal the truth!
- Call off the recess!
- Bailiff!
- You can't adjourn!
- Remove counsel!
What is this trial for?
What happened to our rule of law?
- You call this nonsense a trial?
- Drag him out!
Lieutenant!
Lieutenant YOON!
Lieutenant!
You can't hide the truth forever!
Are you so terrified?
Counselor.
You did your best.
Get some food in you, for my sake.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Don't apologize.
I'm truly grateful.
He's right here.
Come in.
The judge insisted on their release on parole in two years.
Prosecution agreed on terms that we don't file for appeal.
Jin-woo was sentenced to three, but will be out in two years.
You are currently illegally occupying this street.
We are all responsible for permitting injustice!
We are obligated to fight, because we stand alive today!
We must fight for democracy!
Citizens united!
We stand 'm memory of PARK long-chem'.!
This is not illegal!
Stand united!
Keep your ground!
Stand united!
Keep your ground!
We must stand united!
Stay strong!
Stand united!
Keep your ground!
Stay strong!
Citizens!
Citizens!
Stay strong!
Citizens!
A service could initiate disorder as in past instances.
Memorial services are about honoring the deceased.
Essentially calm and quiet.
If such things pose a threat, it only shows the growing fear of people using violence against it.
But you're an attorney.
Haven't you crossed the line by violating positive law?
It's because I'm an attorney.
Attorneys must lead the people in such unjust, unlawful times.
That's the true duty of an attorney.
All rise!
Be seated.
Prosecution.
State your charges.
The defendant has planned and lead various illegal gatherings, and extensively violated the law on assembly and demonstration.
Defense.
Your opening statement.
Your Honor.
Many members of counsel are sitting in the gallery.
We cannot confirm their attendance.
In order to confirm counsel's attendance today, we ask that you call the names of these members of counsel.
These are all...
Yes.
The reason for our request.
I will now call out the names.

Hey, Sebbe!
- I'm going to get wasted.
- You said that yesterday!
Hey, what's up?
When are you going to play, Sebbe?
It's been ages.
- Isn't it time you got a gig?
- Yeah, yeah, I will.
- You have to work hard to succeed.
- Stop nagging!
- Excuse me, there are two of you?
- Yes.
He doesn't mean us.
- Wait 'til I get my record deal.
- Your dad's money'll run out one day!
Pay for your own booze!
I should be on the list.
Mia Ekström!
I don't have anyone by that name.
Guest list only tonight.
- Let's go somewhere else.
- Please, I hear Stureplan is great!
- And I'm going home tomorrow!
- Excuse me...
- They put me on the list yesterday.
- I'm busy!
Try again later.
- Hi
- Hi
But your colleague promised me... and my friends!
- What, you're together?
- Yes!
Why wouldn't you believe that?
- How many in your group?
- Uh... six.
- Okay then.
Welcome.
- What happened, Mia?
- What a weird girl!
- Sebbe, help me out here.
Oskar's paying!
The first round, anyway.
- Jesus!
Watch your step, hippo!
- Excuse me?
!
Just ignore him, honey.
We all do.
- Why are you so slow?
- I can't hear you!
Nice voice.
Nice tits.
'Code GRANDMA.
Bring breakfast!
'
I understand, sweetheart, but you need to remember, grandma had a good, long life.
- Hi.
- Zup.
She's in a better place now.
Yeah, mom...
I'll try to pull myself together.
I'll come over later.
I need to get the door now.
Hi...
Grandma...
What?
She was Norway's most famous tap dancer, a pioneer in the genre.
And for her to die... falling down a staircase...
In Stavanger!
- Three flights!
- Wow, that's terrible.
Maybe I should go now...
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thanks.
- Too much?
- Un poquito.
That bald record producer was here yesterday looking at the blue blazer.
Hammarsten?
Did you play my demo?
Uh, no, sorry.
He wasn't here long.
We didn't have his size.
- Shit!
I always miss him.
- Didn't they want to sign you once?
I thought so...
But they signed some "Idol" loser with the same "look".
What bullshit.
Have you seen anyone who looks like me on "Idol"?
I suppose I should send in my demo.
Keep in touch.
Hammarsten is awesome;
he's worked with everyone.
Hey, why don't you unpack today's delivery?
If his size came in, you can call him!
Sounds fun.
I, uh, put on your demo.
- And he left his card.
- No way!
What the?
Wh?
- What did he...
Should I?
- Just call him.
- Now?
!
- Yeah.
Yeah!
I need my brows shaped, too.
- Welcome!
Can I take your coat?
- No thanks, I just saw my son there.
Sebastian!
- Hi!
- Hi, Mom.
Oh, you're soaking!
Heading home?
- No, to the cemetery.
- It's the 20th already?
Yes.
He would have been 27 today.
I can wait if you want to come.
No, I have a lot going on tonight, I won't have time.
- Okay.
Were you off today?
- No, I worked...
And I talked to a music producer who heard my demo!
What did he say?
Have you bought clothes again!
Honey, it's no wonder your paycheck doesn't last.
Really!
He said he'll call later this week and his label may want to sign me.
- I think it'll happen this time!
- Well, that's good, I guess.
- I've got to go now.
- Can't you tell Dad?
- About what?
- The record label!
- Tell him yourself.
- He'll just go on about that job.
- Can't you just let him call...
- No, Mom, it's not going to happen.
- You can't be a store clerk forever!
- I'm not a store clerk!
I'm getting a record contract!
Stop worrying about me.
I never worry about you.
People like you always get by.
- "People like me"?
- Talk to you later!
- What do you think?
- It sounds good.
- But?
- Are you planning on working today?
Can you pass me the labels behind you?
Thanks...
- The head office still bugging you?
- No.
- I'm getting promoted.
- Yeah?
To what?
Purchaser for Scandinavia.
I'll work at the head office.
- And attend all the European shows!
- Only the European ones?
I'm kidding!
That's great!
Why didn't you tell me?
Sweet!
- When do you start?
- In June.
That's totally awesome.
You deserve it.
And I'll be stuck here in the storeroom.
Look, I'm sorry, but I can't work here.
I just feel...
- I can't take it!
- Seriously, you don't "work" much.
You mostly just surf on your iPhone.
You haven't worked a full day...
Quiet!
Hang on, hang on...
Sebastian.
Hi!
I'm great, thanks.
No, I'm not busy.
I'm actually off work today.
Sure, I'm in the neighborhood anyway.
Great, see you later.
Bye.
- YES!
The record company!
- What did they say?
- To be there in a half hour!
- Hey!
Sebbe!
- The jacket?
- Dock my pay or something.
Hi, I'm Jens Hammarsten.
I mean, I'm here to see him.
I'm Sebastian Silverberg.
One moment, please.
I have a Sebastian Silverberg here.
Okay.
- Around the corner, 4th on the left.
- Fourth door.
Thanks.
- Let's keep in touch, Sebbe.
Later.
- Bye, uh, later!
- Are you coming?
We're freezing!
- Go in!
I'm on my way.
- Look, is Pelle there?
- What do you want with him?
Enough with your Norwegian accent!
Give me Pelle!
We're going in.
I'm going to the bar.
Sebbe!
Hello?
Hello?
He's not there!
- Hello?
- Yes!
Congrats!
- A contract, that's sweet, man!
- I know.
It's incredible.
And it's about time!
- Is it a done deal?
Have you signed?
- I need a lawyer to check it first.
- I wondered if you could help me?
- Of course!
Hey, I see a taxi.
Tonight's going to be awesome!
Hello?
Hello?
Can someone help me?
Hello!
?
Can someone help me?
!
Hello!
?
Hello!
?
Can you see the light?
No.
- Now?
- No.
- Now?
- No.
- And now?
- No.
- Does your head hurt?
- Yes, back here.
- The back of your head?
- Yeah... or sort of everywhere.
Let me take a look at the other eye.
Do you see the light now?
No!
I don't see any fucking light!
What the hell is wrong?
!
Stop crying, Mom!
What's wrong?
!
Don't touch me!
Your son had an aneurysm.
The fall caused it to burst, and the bleeding damaged the visual cortex.
It was a time bomb, just waiting to go off.
But he will be able to see again, right?
- He will get his sight back?
- I'm sorry.
It's highly unlikely that it will return naturally.
The good news is that Sebastian is being treated, so he's in no danger.
- So what do we do now?
- We wait.
- Wait?
For what?
- To see if his condition changes.
And seek new treatments.
There's progress all the time in this field.
We'll keep searching.
We can't just do nothing.
I refuse to accept this!
You heard the doctor, his condition may change.
It's pretty cozy in here.
For a while.
- Have you heard from Hammarsten?
- No, that's over.
What?
Why?
I don't know.
I got a letter "on behalf of Jens Hammarsten."
- He didn't even call me himself.
- What a fucking fake.
But you're a singer.
You don't need to see to be a star.
Look at Ray Charles, or Stevie Wonder, or...
- Youssou N'dour.
- What do you mean, Youssou N'dour?
The guy who sings "Seven Seconds Away."
- He's not blind.
- He's not?
We're going out tonight.
Want to come?
Oh come on!
You going to drag me around like a seeing-eye dog?
I'm stuck here!
My parents got me an assistant to help me with my "daily life."
- What daily life?
I have no life.
- Of course you do!
Come on, Sebbe!
Come out with us tonight.
I'll look after you.
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
Cheers!
The best way to get over a girl is to "get over" another girl.
- Did you get that Sebbe?
- Why don't you sing something?
- What?
- Cheers!
Erik!
Erik!
Erik!
Sorry.
Sorry, sorry!
Erik!
Erik!
Erik!
Erik!
- Fucking drunk.
Get out of here!
- You OK?
- He's not drunk, he's blind!
- Sure he is...
What are you laughing at?
You think this is funny?
Get me a cab.
Get me a cab!
- At Gmail?
...dot com, yes.
- What's your password?
- Donkeyballs84.
No, there's nothing interesting here.
- Invitations to night clubs...
- Delete.
And you've got mail from Oskar af Ström-de Luca and Pelle Borg.
- They wonder why you never call.
- Delete those too.
Straight ahead, straight...
You know the way.
You're a meter from the couch.
Watch out for the rug.
Cool!
This is some place you've got.
- Are you bringing the guitar?
- No.
- The amp?
- No.
- You collect watches?
- Nah, I just like them.
You can tell a lot from a person's watch.
Mine came free with a tank of gas.
That says a lot about me, doesn't it?
I can help you post them on eBay if you like.
They'd be worth a lot.
- Why would I sell my watches?
- Oh, uh...
I thought that now...
You want some coffee?
I'll go to 7-Eleven.
Yeah.
I'll be back soon.
- Good morning!
- Hello.
Hi.
I brought my guitar.
I thought maybe we could jam.
- Shall we play?
- Nah, I thought I'd get dressed.
- I think it would be good for you.
- I don't feel like it.
You don't have to see the strings.
It's in your muscle memory.
I have a friend who works at the music school.
He has this group, they're called...
"Everyone Can" - they're special needs kids.
I've heard them play.
They're wicked!
The keyboardist is deaf.
It's wild - how does he do it?
So I asked if they had an opening for you, because I thought...
Okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry!
Okay, take it easy.
Easy!
Okay, take it easy.
Sebastian!
Open up!
Your dad and I want to help, you know that.
But you have to help us to help you.
- What do you want?
- Is that so hard to understand?
I don't want a fucking personal assistant!
Condescending jackasses who push you around.
Or worse, some fat old lady to wipe my ass and comb my hair.
- Sebastian, that's enough.
- What do you want us to do?
You have no idea how hard we're working to help you!
Not to mention the apartment I'm paying for.
- Which is empty and you won't let...
- It's always about money with you!
It's not about money!
I'd give everything we own to make you well.
But we're lost here.
What do you want from us?
I want my fucking sight back!
My life back!
Can you do that?
No, you can't!
So there's not much you can do.
- Hello.
- Hi, I'm Mia.
- Come in.
- Thanks
It was a nice walk from the station.
I think spring is finally here.
Yes, it's nice.
- Have you come a long way?
- No, I live in the Hornstull area.
So, Mia, can you tell me about yourself?
I'm 24, I live in Hornstull, as I said...
I work three or four evenings a week in the home help services.
- Here you are.
- Thanks.
And on weekends I work at Åhléns department store.
Well, it's every other week, so I can work the other weekends with...
Sebastian.
- Which department?
- Gloves and hosiery.
I can get you a 25% discount if you come while I'm working.
Not that you look like you need a discount on hosiery.
- Do you have any formal training?
- No.
I don't know what I want to do yet, so I'm just working and saving up.
Saving is good.
What the hell is this?
Have you invested in stocks or bonds or what?
A bank account.
- I see.
What's your interest rate?
- Göran!
What?
As I said on the phone,
Sebastian lost his eyesight in an accident three months ago, and it's taking time for him to adapt.
Since the accident he's been very angry.
We want to find someone who doesn't irritate him as much as the others.
Do you understand?
I can't make any promises.
I mean, I've never worked with blind people before.
Did I spit on you?
Don't worry.
Why don't you go out and introduce yourself!
- Now?
- Yes.
Take the cookies.
What is it!
?
I said you don't have to come here all the time.
Call my cell or just shout from the kitchen.
I'll hear you.
Hi, I'm Mia.
Your mom told me to come and introduce myself.
She did?
She gave me some cookies.
Want some?
No, I don't eat fast carbs.
- You're not going to offer to help?
- Well, I assumed you'd ask.
Cool, a Patek Aquanaut!
Oh, you have a Panerai too!
Two, actually.
You like watches?
Yeah.
My grandpa had a watch store in the old town.
He worked there till he died in April '94.
The same day as Kurt Cobain.
Not that they had anything in common.
Except heroin addiction, of course.
Grandpa used to say you can tell a lot from a person's watch.
He said that?
But he never wore one.
He didn't want to be judged that way.
- Clearing out CDs?
- Looking for a song.
- I don't remember the name or artist.
- That could take time.
How about I read the names and make "definitely not" and "maybe" piles?
Then you just have to listen to the maybes.
- Okay
So, what have you got?
- Could it be Robbie Williams?
- No.
- Per Gessle?
- No, it's not Swedish.
That makes things easier.
Engelbert Humperdinck?
You have eclectic taste.
No, it's not Engelbert.
- Oh, Backstreet Boys?
- No, they...
- I've got a Backstreet Boys CD?
- You sound worried!
I'm just kidding, you don't.
Or maybe you do?
No, not Backstreet Boys.
- What are you sighing over?
- Pictures of America.
- I'm saving for a road trip.
- Cool.
I'm going to fly to LA, buy a car and start driving.
When I get to New York I'll sell the car and fly back to Sweden.
- The Grand Canyon looks enormous.
- It is pretty big.
- Have you been to America?
- Yeah.
- When?
- A few times.
New York with the guys.
Disneyland, Disneyworld.
We went to the Grand Canyon when I was 8-9.
You had just turned 8.
Sebastian screamed for three straight hours.
We were taking a donkey ride and Sebastian wanted ice cream.
We told him there was no ice cream in the Grand Canyon, but he kept on.
Finally the guide had us turn back, saying the donkeys couldn't take it.
"Donkey get nervous!"
Yeah, yeah, donkey get nervous.
Donkeys are very neurotic animals.
- Aren't they?
- It's common knowledge...
- Why don't you two go out?
- We are out.
- Okay...
See you later.
- Bye!
Is that bastard back?
- Get it off!
Get it off!
- It's gone now, calm down.
I fucking hate fucking wasps!
The woman grabs the man's buttock.
- Want some popcorn?
- No thanks.
He touches her left breast.
And two more!
And lateral!
- And five more!
- Stop that, I'm counting!
That's great, keep going!
I'll get it.
Silverberg.
Hi, thanks for calling me back.
It's about my son, Sebastian Silverberg...
- To the elevator?
- No, first left before the elevator.
Welcome home.
So I'm starting my new job on Monday.
Friday is my last day in the store!
Yes!
The new catalogue is here and the collection looks sweet.
- Who's this?
You have a brother?
- We miss you buddy.
Call me ASAP.
Hey, Sebbe, it's Oskar.
Me and Pelle just passed that Brazilian model who tried to go down on you, in the toilet at East, and we just had to call you.
We miss you like hell.
Call us!
Added you on facebook in January but you haven't confirmed my request yet...
- A bit 80s with an answering machine?
- Nice if you don't feel like talking.
I bet.
I guess it fits the American Psycho look you're going for here.
- Were those your friends?
- Yeah.
- Close friends?
- Sort of.
I found a CD with a hot picture of you on the cover.
Can I put it on?
- If you must.
- I must!
Oh my god!
I'm blown away.
Your voice is amazing!
I don't know what to say, you're gifted!
The lyrics sucked, but feel my goosebumps!
- The lyrics?
- Feel!
- What about the lyrics?
- It's like a 90s boy band song.
- Such a great voice!
- Thanks.
- Who wrote your songs?
- I did.
Oh...
Well, maybe I didn't really get the lyrics.
What's it about?
Um, well, it's, you know...
You're walking down the street, you see a girl.
She's hot.
You think okay.
You know.
She's dressed hot.
You think okay...
Sort of...
You have to dare to put yourself out there when you write.
Let yourself be vulnerable.
Dare to show your feelings!
Without feelings the words are empty.
Write about heartbreak, about rejection.
It has to be personal, specific, from the heart, like Coldplay, or David Gray.
Or Paolo Nutini!
- Cut that out!
- You have to feel... the magical pain of life!
- What romantic bullshit.
Magical pain?
Come on!
What?
You never had your heart broken?
Been rejected?
Never been in love?
- Ached for someone?
- No, not really.
What have you been doing all your life?
I'll tell you some other time.
Can I ask you something?
Are you a one-piece girl or a bikini babe?
- I sunbathe naked on private jetties.
- Oh yeah?
You liar!
NOW you dare all of a sudden!
Here come two super-skinny chicks with pouty lips.
One has a big-eared rat on a string.
Oh wow.
Two very elegant businessmen right behind you.
- Not bad.
But something is wrong.
- What?
One of them walks funny.
I bet he's just had a sack and crack wax.
Oh, he's itchy.
He may have lost some skin.
- More, more!
- We have a cougar, could be Russian.
With a real Playboy bunny body.
Oops, her heel is stuck in the grate.
She's struggling, she's about to fall
- And someone comes to the rescue.
You're crazy.
You're making this up!
- No, I swear!
- Playboy bunny body...
- Do I have something in my teeth?
- No.
When will you learn to trust me?
I won't let you go around with food on your face or your fly open.
- You might not notice.
- I notice most things.
- You're so vain!
- I just don't want stuff in my teeth.
- Ice cream?
- Ice cream...
That sounds good.
The bench is here.
Hi!
Excuse me, have I seen you somewhere before?
- I don't think I've seen you before.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah...
- But I'm sure...
- Where do you hang out?
- Where don't I hang out?
- Maybe it was at the terrace at F12?
- F12, maybe!
- By the way, I'm Sebastian.
- Lisa.
Nice to meet you.
- What are you doing tonight?
- I'll probably go out.
- Maybe we can meet up?
- Wow, pushy!
Why don't you put your number on my phone?
Write: "Lisa with the pretty hair."
- You have a lot of Lisas?
- There's Lisa with the ugly hair too.
There.
Your phone.
Oh!
I keep it in my back pocket.
Actually the other one.
Thanks.
- See you.
- I'll be in touch.
Here's your ice cream.
Who was that?
- You saw her?
Was she hot?
- You don't know her?
- What was she doing?
- Nothing.
Was she hot?
She was a typical...
She was average height.
Thin - not creepy thin, but a fairly straight figure.
She had a friendly face, thick eyebrows, natural brown hair and hazel eyes.
What's so funny?
You were so observant!
Doesn't sound like anything for me anyway.
- Why not?
- Just doesn't sound like any fun.
So, what do you look like then?
Looks are important to you, aren't they?
They're important to everyone.
Those who deny it are either lying or ugly.
In which case they're not in a position to be picky.
- Come on, what do you look like?
- How do you think I look?
In my head you're... fit, with fine features, perfect taste in clothes... and I'm thinking blonde with blue eyes.
Like a shorter version of Cameron Diaz.
Am I close?
- Pretty much...
- I'm so good at that!
Here comes a wasp!
What!
Is it on me?
Take my ice cream!
Take it!
- I shouldn't have had any ice cream!
- It's gone now.
- Do you like TV talent shows?
- Not a fan, why?
There's a new one coming this fall and I thought you should audition.
- Forget it!
- Why not?
Sebastian Silverberg, the Blind Singer?
It'd be like that armless guitarist on YouTube.
Forget it!
- How are the road trip plans going?
- Fine.
The saving is slow.
You're so cheap, it ought to go quickly.
- I'll get there eventually.
- Of course you will.
That's good!
But how about "All alone - where are you" instead?
- That would work.
- Okay, then go into...
The bridge, followed by the new chorus.
From the top.
Good!
- I ought to be getting home.
- What time is it?
- 1:30.
- That's practically breakfast time.
There's no point in going home before breakfast.
- And we have 15 verses to write.
- Okay, let's do that.
Send in your audition demos to our new talent show, Star Struck!
Sebbe...
I may have accidentally sent your demo to the show...
- Accidentally?
- Don't be mad - you're so good!
Especially since I've been helping with the lyrics!
- I'm not doing it.
- Just see if you get an audition!
I'm not going on one of those shows.
- A bad attitude doesn't suit you.
- But everything else does!
Stop it!
That drives me crazy!
What's that?
I can't hear you through a mouthful of chips.
Sebastian!
- It's your parents.
- Open up, throw us the key!
- Call the police.
- Sebastian!
Fantastic news!
- What?
- They've decided to operate!
- What?
- They want you there tomorrow!
- I'm going to have?
- Yes!
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
- I can't find my toothbrush.
- I'll try to find it.
I thought you could hold on to my watch.
- Can I put it in my bag?
- As long as you don't scratch it!
I need to tell you something...
Hi there.
It's time for a little sedative.
Ah, nice.
What did you want to say?
Oh, nothing.
- I should go now.
- Okay.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Mia?
- See you soon.
- See you.
Mia?
Sebastian!
Mia had to go.
She'll be back tomorrow.
- You look beautiful, Mom!
- Oh, darling!
- Everything's all right now.
- You look good, too, Dad!
Hi, it's Mia Hi, Sebbe!
Hi!
Hi, Sebastian...
It's me, Mia!
Hi, Sebbe, it's me!
Hi, Sebastian, it's me, Mia!
"You're borderline", she says.
I said, "Finish your course before you start diagnosing people."
It's impolite, just because you're studying psychology.
Hi...
- I can come back later.
- No, no, come in!
- So this is Mia?
- This is her.
- I guess I don't look like...
- Don't worry about it.
- Erik, Mia
- Mia, Erik.
- I brought you some chocolates.
- Hey there.
- Hi, I'm Mia.
- How are you?
How do you feel?
- Well...
Everything's brighter and more colorful.
Dad looks fatter and Mom looks older.
Don't tell them I said that!
I heard you get to go home on Wednesday.
What will you do first?
I'm going to go back to my old life.
Like it was before the accident.
- Hi!
- Hey!
Great to see you!
Cheers!
Hi, Sebastian, it's Mia.
Sorry you couldn't meet me yesterday.
I'm working all week, but maybe we can go for a walk on Friday?
- Everything all right?
- I'm fine.
- How are the road trip plans going?
- Great.
In fact...
- I'm sorry.
Can I take this?
- Sure.
Hey!
Lobster!
Yeah, great.
I was wondering if it's okay if I bring three friends?
Great!
No, just put them under my name.
Okay, see you later.
Bye.
- Sorry.
- It's okay.
- Sebbe!
Hi!
- Hi!
Jessica.
- You remember Kristina?
- Of course.
- Erik told us what happened.
- It must have been awful!
Yeah, it was... difficult, but I've moved on.
Sorry, this is Mia, an old friend.
- This is Jessica and Kristina.
- Are you going out tonight?
- Yeah.
- Sweet, maybe we'll see you.
- I'm sure we will.
- Nice girls.
- Yeah.
- Want to get some ice cream?
- I don't really have time.
- Have you written any music lately?
- No, I haven't felt like it.
- Don't give up!
You're so talented.
- I know.
Is that really the kind of girls you like hanging out with?
- What's wrong with them?
- I just thought you'd be...
That I'd be... what?
Honestly, Mia, you don't know me.
You knew me when I was a different person.
I'm grateful for your help.
- But you have no idea who I am now.
- How can you say that?
Are you mad that I don't look like that?
- I don't care what you look like.
- Okay...
- But it is weird that you lied.
- Well, I knew you liked Barbie dolls.
- That says more about you than me.
- What do you mean by that?
You lied about your looks and you liked me better when I was helpless.
Now that I can see, you suddenly have a problem with me.
I just wonder what happened to you.
We laughed at stupid girls like that.
No, I laughed at you laughing at "stupid girls like that".
- You're obsessed with them.
Drop it.
- You drop it!
What's your problem?
!
When will you dare to take a chance?
Go for your dream - you're so close!
Get a life!
Find a handicapped boyfriend if it turns you on.
- Seriously?
- Yes, seriously.
I just want you to succeed because you're so good.
Because I care.
- Thanks.
That's great.
- What do you mean "great"?
- You'd rather be with one of those...
- Go on, what?
- You know what I mean!
- Yes, I would.
Totally.
- You're a blind idiot!
- Nope, I'm not blind.
- Then open your eyes!
- Have a nice life.
You too!
- It's all I have.
- You have Maria and the kids.
This is the only hobby I have.
I don't have anything else.
Hi, are you looking for anything special?
'Hi awake?
'
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
You know what?
This isn't a very nice way to treat people.
- It's fucking immature.
- I'm going to my grandma's funeral!
Yeah, yeah.
Your grandma dies often, doesn't she?
You don't even remember sleeping with me before.
Incredible.
Bye.
Say hello to grandma!
I thought she'd take a hint, but she calls me crying, says she broke up with her boyfriend for me, and I was like, why?
Women.
Why are they so emotional?
So much drama!
- Sebbe?
- Huh?
- Don't you get tired of this shit?
- What shit?
I can't be bothered.
I'm going home.
- Who's going home?
- Sebbe, apparently.
- Come on, Sebbe!
You've changed.
- Cool it.
Don't be so emotional.
- So much drama!
- Yeah, yeah.
- Take care.
- Sebbe!
Don't be so boring!
- Buy your own drinks, Oskar!
- You suck!
Loser!
Sebbe?
Oh!
Excuse me?
- Do you ever see Mia?
- No, not for a while.
Such a nice girl.
Pretty and sweet and ambitious.
- You're not in touch at all?
- We don't hang in the same circles.
But you two seemed so close.
We didn't have much choice.
She was here yesterday with a letter for you.
In the drawer.
- Is this it?
Nothing else?
- No, that's all.
Thanks.
Can you tell us something about yourself that's not on the form?
Like what?
Something that makes you different, or special?
Let's try an easier question.
When did you decide to become an artist?
I remember it was on my brother Theo's eighth birthday.
When all the kids had gone home,
Theo and I went upstairs to play with his presents.
He'd gotten a Millennium Falcon space ship, plus all the Star Wars action figures, and I was super jealous.
We were playing and MTV was on.
And it was Tracy Chapman with the live version of Fast Car.
And I remember we both just stopped playing, all at once, and looked at the TV.
I saw how fascinated he was.
I was only six, but I thought to myself, "This is what I'm going to do with my life."
I begged Mom to buy me a guitar, and she did.
Then...
Theo got sick that summer.
He died six months later.
So he never got to see... that I kept practicing.
Apart from Theo, music is the only thing I've ever loved.
- You have one new message.
- Hi, Mia, it's Sebastian!
I guess you're working.
I just wanted to say I auditioned for Star Struck today and I made it.
I'll be on TV on Saturday, live.
So I just want to thank you for sending in my demo and everything.
Oh, I have another call.
I miss...
Take care, and thanks a million again.
Bye.
Hi, Mom!
No, not much.
I'm going to be on TV on Saturday.
It's almost time for the show you've been waiting for all summer.
Sweden's biggest talent show...
It's extremely important that you're on time.
- Nervous?
- Nah...
I'm sure it's going to go great!
Screaming psychos, alcoholic mothers, cut-up junkies...
All of them come before me!
Our next talent is a guitarist and singer.
All the way from Östermalm...
- Are you married?
- No, but I'm banging your wife.
She's unclean!
That you'll want to hang with.
A big hand for Sebastian Silverberg!
- Quiet, quiet, Sebastian's on!
- Come on, son!
That was Sebastian's twist on Robyn's Hang with Me.
- Over to you, Josefin.
- What can I say?
You were awesome!
Thanks.
- Lars?
- Powerful.
Very good!
I just hope people vote for your voice, not your good looks!
- He was wonderful!
- Wasn't he!
To vote for Sebastian Silverberg, dial 08-205080.
- Did you call from both phones?
- Yes, I have both!
Every vote counts!
The next act is from Piteå:
Marie Stråhle and her dogs Mini and Bobo!
Dancing dogs may have been entertaining before TV and X-boxes...
- Watch it!
- Look where you're going!
No freak show act will win.
Forget them.
- So the acrobat girls?
- They're out.
- But their acrobatic skills could...
- They're at least 40!
- Sebbe!
We voted for you!
- We want you to win!
- Can we have your autograph?
- What are your names?
Whoa...
Johanna, Elin, Irma?
Stand straight!
Thank you, dear.
- So that's your friend?
- More an acquaintance.
He must be the most handsome man I've ever seen!
Unfortunately, he thinks so too.
- I say no.
- That's a no.
- That was embarrassing.
- And I'd like to say no.
I hope you vote for this group!
That was great!
- Sure, I can sing at your place.
- Oh, please do!
I have a flight to LA via London on the 19th.
- It leaves at 6: 15 AM, is that OK?
- I'll check.
- Is it okay?
- Oh, I just...
I... no...
You know what, I don't think I'm ready to book yet.
- What do you think?
- I think you should go!
Yes, you're right.
Book it!
One, two, three, four and one, two, three.
- Together, and "Baby" and...
- I'm sorry... this doesn't feel...
The steps, "Baby"...
I can't even see the camera!
It's okay, honey, that's why we rehearse with the cameraman.
You do your thing and let him work on staying out of the way.
From the top!
With his unique version of the Marina and the Diamonds song,
Sebastian Silverberg with I Am Not a Robot!
Those are his parents!
They're so sweet!
Tell me when you see his friends.
- Has he stopped calling?
- No, he's called a few times.
- What did he say?
- I haven't answered.
Quiet!
- He's a partier - is he hung over?
- No, that's not it.
Keep it going!
My god...
Good work!
As usual, we start with the judges.
Lars, over to you!
- Are you still in the running?
- Just barely.
- Tell me when you see my hand.
- Now.
- I'll call the doctor.
We'll go...
- I've already seen him.
They're doing all they can.
- Sebastian!
- Sebastian, can I get a picture?
What happened last week, Sebastian?
Do you feel ready for tomorrow?
That was fine.
- How is Sebastian's vision?
- He says it comes and goes.
- Will he tell the truth?
- I don't know.
He doesn't want it to come out until after the final.
He's afraid it will affect the voting.
- How are you?
- I'm okay.
It's harder for Göran.
It's hard to see his son hurting, after...
- Sebastian told me about Theo.
- He did?
He hardly ever talks about him.
It's great that he's begun to open up.
You've done wonders for him!
Shit!
Accept it, you're useless.
You'll never beat my high score.
That was a great melody.
Nice lyrics.
- Is it about anyone special?
- You, of course!
Gimme that.
- Can you see well enough to play?
- Well enough to beat you!
Hi, it's Sebastian.
Leave a message after the sound.
Hello, this is Walter Bergman from the evening news.
We've learned that you're losing your sight after a brain hemorrhage.
The story will be on the front page.
Call me if you have any comments.
My number is 08...
Hi Sebastian, this is Stina from Gossip magazine.
Would you...
Hello.
- Hello, hi... how are you?
- Fine.
- I didn't expect you to answer.
- I know...
Look, I know I owe you a massive apology for the last time we met.
I acted like a total ass.
I'm really, really sorry.
- Hmm, so how are you?
- Pretty good.
I...
I'm okay.
Can you believe the record label wants me back!
- Really?
Will you sign with them?
- Nah.
I think I'll wait for an indie label that lets me write my own stuff.
Aren't you going to sing any of your own songs on the show?
I could, but I don't know.
Time has just flown by and...
- Not everyone is as brave as you.
- Brave?
I don't know about that.
- Do you want to come tonight?
- To the final?
- Well, I'm leaving in the morning...
- Yeah?
Wow!
- To America?
...and I'm still packing, so...
I can ask them to reserve a seat for you in case you change your mind.
Okay...
I'll let you go now.
I hope your road trip is awesome.
- That it's everything you hoped.
- Thanks.
- Well, bon voyage.
- Bye.
"Bon voyage"?
After ten exciting weeks following ten unique talents, hand-picked from thousands of applicants, it's time for the final.
- 30 minutes, Sebastian.
- Sure...
- Do you need anything?
- No, I'm fine.
Wait - there is something I could use some help with.
I will!
Maybe not right when I land, but after a few days.
Hi, Mom.
Yeah, he told me.
Can I call you back?
- What are you doing here?
I had to see you.
I didn't want you to leave without a proper goodbye.
Well...
Bye then.
I have to finish packing.
So I can go "get a life", right?
- And you need to get back!
- But...
I'm so sorry for how I treated you.
Seeing you after the operation... reminded me of the accident and how terrible I felt then.
I mean... when I got to know you in all that time we spent together,
You made me feel things...
You know, things I'd never felt before.
Like... before I met you, I felt like a Swatch on the inside, but like a Patek Philippe on the outside.
- You're talking about watches now?
- I mean...
My lyrics!
You know how they were, but you made me feel the opposite.
More like Coldplay than Lady Gaga, you know?
You made me feel...
You make me feel like...
Instead of:
That's what I wanted to say.
And also...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Come on, let's go to the final.
- Screw the final.
Hello and welcome to the grand final!
A big hand for the hip hop dance group Rhythmic Soul Crew.
- Shit...
- Where the hell have you been?
!
Take a seat in the front there.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
- God, I'm still in my pajamas!
- You're so embarrassing!
Go!
Let's hear it for the gravity-defying dancers of Rhythmic Soul Crew!
It's time to introduce the man who's made big headlines this week.
Let's give a big hand for Sebastian Silverberg!
- Hi, Sebastian.
- Hi.
I love you, Sebbe!
- How are you?
- I have major butterflies right now!
I'll bet.
Before you perform, I thought I'd give you the chance to comment on all the rumors circulating the past few weeks.
Okay, uh...
It's true, I'm losing my sight.
My journey hasn't been all that easy this past year.
But I guess, even if...
even if you face tough times, you just have to take a chance and try your best.
That's what helps you write interesting lyrics, right?
It gives me great pleasure to present, for the first time with one of his own songs, Sebastian Silverberg!
I'd like to dedicate this song to those who are starting new journeys.
And tonight I can see.
Tonight I can see everything.
Hey, Sebbe!
- I'm going to get wasted.
- You said that yesterday!
Hey, what's up?
When are you going to play, Sebbe?
It's been ages.
- Isn't it time you got a gig?
- Yeah, yeah, I will.
- You have to work hard to succeed.
- Stop nagging!
- Excuse me, there are two of you?
- Yes.
He doesn't mean us.
- Wait 'til I get my record deal.
- Your dad's money'll run out one day!
Pay for your own booze!
I should be on the list.
Mia Ekström!
I don't have anyone by that name.
Guest list only tonight.
- Let's go somewhere else.
- Please, I hear Stureplan is great!
- And I'm going home tomorrow!
- Excuse me...
- They put me on the list yesterday.
- I'm busy!
Try again later.
- Hi
- Hi
But your colleague promised me... and my friends!
- What, you're together?
- Yes!
Why wouldn't you believe that?
- How many in your group?
- Uh... six.
- Okay then.
Welcome.
- What happened, Mia?
- What a weird girl!
- Sebbe, help me out here.
Oskar's paying!
The first round, anyway.
- Jesus!
Watch your step, hippo!
- Excuse me?
!
Just ignore him, honey.
We all do.
- Why are you so slow?
- I can't hear you!
Nice voice.
Nice tits.
'Code GRANDMA.
Bring breakfast!
'
I understand, sweetheart, but you need to remember, grandma had a good, long life.
- Hi.
- Zup.
She's in a better place now.
Yeah, mom...
I'll try to pull myself together.
I'll come over later.
I need to get the door now.
Hi...
Grandma...
What?
She was Norway's most famous tap dancer, a pioneer in the genre.
And for her to die... falling down a staircase...
In Stavanger!
- Three flights!
- Wow, that's terrible.
Maybe I should go now...
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thanks.
- Too much?
- Un poquito.
That bald record producer was here yesterday looking at the blue blazer.
Hammarsten?
Did you play my demo?
Uh, no, sorry.
He wasn't here long.
We didn't have his size.
- Shit!
I always miss him.
- Didn't they want to sign you once?
I thought so...
But they signed some "Idol" loser with the same "look".
What bullshit.
Have you seen anyone who looks like me on "Idol"?
I suppose I should send in my demo.
Keep in touch.
Hammarsten is awesome;
he's worked with everyone.
Hey, why don't you unpack today's delivery?
If his size came in, you can call him!
Sounds fun.
I, uh, put on your demo.
- And he left his card.
- No way!
What the?
Wh?
- What did he...
Should I?
- Just call him.
- Now?
!
- Yeah.
Yeah!
I need my brows shaped, too.
- Welcome!
Can I take your coat?
- No thanks, I just saw my son there.
Sebastian!
- Hi!
- Hi, Mom.
Oh, you're soaking!
Heading home?
- No, to the cemetery.
- It's the 20th already?
Yes.
He would have been 27 today.
I can wait if you want to come.
No, I have a lot going on tonight, I won't have time.
- Okay.
Were you off today?
- No, I worked...
And I talked to a music producer who heard my demo!
What did he say?
Have you bought clothes again!
Honey, it's no wonder your paycheck doesn't last.
Really!
He said he'll call later this week and his label may want to sign me.
- I think it'll happen this time!
- Well, that's good, I guess.
- I've got to go now.
- Can't you tell Dad?
- About what?
- The record label!
- Tell him yourself.
- He'll just go on about that job.
- Can't you just let him call...
- No, Mom, it's not going to happen.
- You can't be a store clerk forever!
- I'm not a store clerk!
I'm getting a record contract!
Stop worrying about me.
I never worry about you.
People like you always get by.
- "People like me"?
- Talk to you later!
- What do you think?
- It sounds good.
- But?
- Are you planning on working today?
Can you pass me the labels behind you?
Thanks...
- The head office still bugging you?
- No.
- I'm getting promoted.
- Yeah?
To what?
Purchaser for Scandinavia.
I'll work at the head office.
- And attend all the European shows!
- Only the European ones?
I'm kidding!
That's great!
Why didn't you tell me?
Sweet!
- When do you start?
- In June.
That's totally awesome.
You deserve it.
And I'll be stuck here in the storeroom.
Look, I'm sorry, but I can't work here.
I just feel...
- I can't take it!
- Seriously, you don't "work" much.
You mostly just surf on your iPhone.
You haven't worked a full day...
Quiet!
Hang on, hang on...
Sebastian.
Hi!
I'm great, thanks.
No, I'm not busy.
I'm actually off work today.
Sure, I'm in the neighborhood anyway.
Great, see you later.
Bye.
- YES!
The record company!
- What did they say?
- To be there in a half hour!
- Hey!
Sebbe!
- The jacket?
- Dock my pay or something.
Hi, I'm Jens Hammarsten.
I mean, I'm here to see him.
I'm Sebastian Silverberg.
One moment, please.
I have a Sebastian Silverberg here.
Okay.
- Around the corner, 4th on the left.
- Fourth door.
Thanks.
- Let's keep in touch, Sebbe.
Later.
- Bye, uh, later!
- Are you coming?
We're freezing!
- Go in!
I'm on my way.
- Look, is Pelle there?
- What do you want with him?
Enough with your Norwegian accent!
Give me Pelle!
We're going in.
I'm going to the bar.
Sebbe!
Hello?
Hello?
He's not there!
- Hello?
- Yes!
Congrats!
- A contract, that's sweet, man!
- I know.
It's incredible.
And it's about time!
- Is it a done deal?
Have you signed?
- I need a lawyer to check it first.
- I wondered if you could help me?
- Of course!
Hey, I see a taxi.
Tonight's going to be awesome!
Hello?
Hello?
Can someone help me?
Hello!
?
Can someone help me?
!
Hello!
?
Hello!
?
Can you see the light?
No.
- Now?
- No.
- Now?
- No.
- And now?
- No.
- Does your head hurt?
- Yes, back here.
- The back of your head?
- Yeah... or sort of everywhere.
Let me take a look at the other eye.
Do you see the light now?
No!
I don't see any fucking light!
What the hell is wrong?
!
Stop crying, Mom!
What's wrong?
!
Don't touch me!
Your son had an aneurysm.
The fall caused it to burst, and the bleeding damaged the visual cortex.
It was a time bomb, just waiting to go off.
But he will be able to see again, right?
- He will get his sight back?
- I'm sorry.
It's highly unlikely that it will return naturally.
The good news is that Sebastian is being treated, so he's in no danger.
- So what do we do now?
- We wait.
- Wait?
For what?
- To see if his condition changes.
And seek new treatments.
There's progress all the time in this field.
We'll keep searching.
We can't just do nothing.
I refuse to accept this!
You heard the doctor, his condition may change.
It's pretty cozy in here.
For a while.
- Have you heard from Hammarsten?
- No, that's over.
What?
Why?
I don't know.
I got a letter "on behalf of Jens Hammarsten."
- He didn't even call me himself.
- What a fucking fake.
But you're a singer.
You don't need to see to be a star.
Look at Ray Charles, or Stevie Wonder, or...
- Youssou N'dour.
- What do you mean, Youssou N'dour?
The guy who sings "Seven Seconds Away."
- He's not blind.
- He's not?
We're going out tonight.
Want to come?
Oh come on!
You going to drag me around like a seeing-eye dog?
I'm stuck here!
My parents got me an assistant to help me with my "daily life."
- What daily life?
I have no life.
- Of course you do!
Come on, Sebbe!
Come out with us tonight.
I'll look after you.
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
Cheers!
The best way to get over a girl is to "get over" another girl.
- Did you get that Sebbe?
- Why don't you sing something?
- What?
- Cheers!
Erik!
Erik!
Erik!
Sorry.
Sorry, sorry!
Erik!
Erik!
Erik!
Erik!
- Fucking drunk.
Get out of here!
- You OK?
- He's not drunk, he's blind!
- Sure he is...
What are you laughing at?
You think this is funny?
Get me a cab.
Get me a cab!
- At Gmail?
...dot com, yes.
- What's your password?
- donkeyballs84.
No, there's nothing interesting here.
- Invitations to night clubs...
- Delete.
And you've got mail from Oskar af Ström-de Luca and Pelle Borg.
- They wonder why you never call.
- Delete those too.
Straight ahead, straight...
You know the way.
You're a meter from the couch.
Watch out for the rug.
Cool!
This is some place you've got.
- Are you bringing the guitar?
- No.
- The amp?
- No.
- You collect watches?
- Nah, I just like them.
You can tell a lot from a person's watch.
Mine came free with a tank of gas.
That says a lot about me, doesn't it?
I can help you post them on eBay if you like.
They'd be worth a lot.
- Why would I sell my watches?
- Oh, uh...
I thought that now...
You want some coffee?
I'll go to 7-Eleven.
Yeah.
I'll be back soon.
- Good morning!
- Hello.
Hi.
I brought my guitar.
I thought maybe we could jam.
- Shall we play?
- Nah, I thought I'd get dressed.
- I think it would be good for you.
- I don't feel like it.
You don't have to see the strings.
It's in your muscle memory.
I have a friend who works at the music school.
He has this group, they're called...
"Everyone Can" - they're special needs kids.
I've heard them play.
They're wicked!
The keyboardist is deaf.
It's wild - how does he do it?
So I asked if they had an opening for you, because I thought...
Okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry!
Okay, take it easy.
Easy!
Okay, take it easy.
Sebastian!
Open up!
Your dad and I want to help, you know that.
But you have to help us to help you.
- What do you want?
- Is that so hard to understand?
I don't want a fucking personal assistant!
Condescending jackasses who push you around.
Or worse, some fat old lady to wipe my ass and comb my hair.
- Sebastian, that's enough.
- What do you want us to do?
You have no idea how hard we're working to help you!
Not to mention the apartment I'm paying for.
- Which is empty and you won't let...
- It's always about money with you!
It's not about money!
I'd give everything we own to make you well.
But we're lost here.
What do you want from us?
I want my fucking sight back!
My life back!
Can you do that?
No, you can't!
So there's not much you can do.
- Hello.
- Hi, I'm Mia.
- Come in.
- Thanks
It was a nice walk from the station.
I think spring is finally here.
Yes, it's nice.
- Have you come a long way?
- No, I live in the Hornstull area.
So, Mia, can you tell me about yourself?
I'm 24, I live in Hornstull, as I said...
I work three or four evenings a week in the home help services.
- Here you are.
- Thanks.
And on weekends I work at Åhléns department store.
Well, it's every other week, so I can work the other weekends with...
Sebastian.
- Which department?
- Gloves and hosiery.
I can get you a 25% discount if you come while I'm working.
Not that you look like you need a discount on hosiery.
- Do you have any formal training?
- No.
I don't know what I want to do yet, so I'm just working and saving up.
Saving is good.
What the hell is this?
Have you invested in stocks or bonds or what?
A bank account.
- I see.
What's your interest rate?
- Göran!
What?
As I said on the phone,
Sebastian lost his eyesight in an accident three months ago, and it's taking time for him to adapt.
Since the accident he's been very angry.
We want to find someone who doesn't irritate him as much as the others.
Do you understand?
I can't make any promises.
I mean, I've never worked with blind people before.
Did I spit on you?
Don't worry.
Why don't you go out and introduce yourself!
- Now?
- Yes.
Take the cookies.
What is it!
?
I said you don't have to come here all the time.
Call my cell or just shout from the kitchen.
I'll hear you.
Hi, I'm Mia.
Your mom told me to come and introduce myself.
She did?
She gave me some cookies.
Want some?
No, I don't eat fast carbs.
- You're not going to offer to help?
- Well, I assumed you'd ask.
Cool, a Patek Aquanaut!
Oh, you have a Panerai too!
Two, actually.
You like watches?
Yeah.
My grandpa had a watch store in the old town.
He worked there till he died in April '94.
The same day as Kurt Cobain.
Not that they had anything in common.
Except heroin addiction, of course.
Grandpa used to say you can tell a lot from a person's watch.
He said that?
But he never wore one.
He didn't want to be judged that way.
- Clearing out CDs?
- Looking for a song.
- I don't remember the name or artist.
- That could take time.
How about I read the names and make "definitely not" and "maybe" piles?
Then you just have to listen to the maybes.
- Okay
So, what have you got?
- Could it be Robbie Williams?
- No.
- Per Gessle?
- No, it's not Swedish.
That makes things easier.
Engelbert Humperdinck?
You have eclectic taste.
No, it's not Engelbert.
- Oh, Backstreet Boys?
- No, they...
- I've got a Backstreet Boys CD?
- You sound worried!
I'm just kidding, you don't.
Or maybe you do?
No, not Backstreet Boys.
- What are you sighing over?
- Pictures of America.
- I'm saving for a road trip.
- Cool.
I'm going to fly to LA, buy a car and start driving.
When I get to New York I'll sell the car and fly back to Sweden.
- The Grand Canyon looks enormous.
- It is pretty big.
- Have you been to America?
- Yeah.
- When?
- A few times.
New York with the guys.
Disneyland, Disneyworld.
We went to the Grand Canyon when I was 8-9.
You had just turned 8.
Sebastian screamed for three straight hours.
We were taking a donkey ride and Sebastian wanted ice cream.
We told him there was no ice cream in the Grand Canyon, but he kept on.
Finally the guide had us turn back, saying the donkeys couldn't take it.
"Donkey get nervous!"
Yeah, yeah, donkey get nervous.
Donkeys are very neurotic animals.
- Aren't they?
- It's common knowledge...
- Why don't you two go out?
- We are out.
- Okay...
See you later.
- Bye!
Is that bastard back?
- Get it off!
Get it off!
- It's gone now, calm down.
I fucking hate fucking wasps!
The woman grabs the man's buttock.
- Want some popcorn?
- No thanks.
He touches her left breast.
And two more!
And lateral!
- And five more!
- Stop that, I'm counting!
That's great, keep going!
I'll get it.
Silverberg.
Hi, thanks for calling me back.
It's about my son, Sebastian Silverberg...
- To the elevator?
- No, first left before the elevator.
Welcome home.
So I'm starting my new job on Monday.
Friday is my last day in the store!
Yes!
The new catalogue is here and the collection looks sweet.
- Who's this?
You have a brother?
- We miss you buddy.
Call me ASAP.
Hey, Sebbe, it's Oskar.
Me and Pelle just passed that Brazilian model who tried to go down on you, in the toilet at East, and we just had to call you.
We miss you like hell.
Call us!
...added you on facebook in January but you haven't confirmed my request yet...
- A bit 80s with an answering machine?
- Nice if you don't feel like talking.
I bet.
I guess it fits the American Psycho look you're going for here.
- Were those your friends?
- Yeah.
- Close friends?
- Sort of.
I found a CD with a hot picture of you on the cover.
Can I put it on?
- If you must.
- I must!
Oh my god!
I'm blown away.
Your voice is amazing!
I don't know what to say, you're gifted!
The lyrics sucked, but feel my goosebumps!
- The lyrics?
- Feel!
- What about the lyrics?
- It's like a 90s boy band song.
- Such a great voice!
- Thanks.
- Who wrote your songs?
- I did.
Oh...
Well, maybe I didn't really get the lyrics.
What's it about?
Um, well, it's, you know...
You're walking down the street, you see a girl.
She's hot.
You think okay.
You know.
She's dressed hot.
You think okay...
Sort of...
You have to dare to put yourself out there when you write.
Let yourself be vulnerable.
Dare to show your feelings!
Without feelings the words are empty.
Write about heartbreak, about rejection.
It has to be personal, specific, from the heart, like Coldplay, or David Gray.
Or Paolo Nutini!
- Cut that out!
- You have to feel the magical pain of life!
- What romantic bullshit.
Magical pain?
Come on!
What?
You never had your heart broken?
Been rejected?
Never been in love?
- Ached for someone?
- No, not really.
What have you been doing all your life?
I'll tell you some other time.
Can I ask you something?
Are you a one-piece girl or a bikini babe?
- I sunbathe naked on private jetties.
- Oh yeah?
You liar!
NOW you dare all of a sudden!
Here come two super-skinny chicks with pouty lips.
One has a big-eared rat on a string.
Oh wow.
Two very elegant businessmen right behind you.
- Not bad.
But something is wrong.
- What?
One of them walks funny.
I bet he's just had a sack and crack wax.
Oh, he's itchy.
He may have lost some skin.
- More, more!
- We have a cougar, could be Russian.
With a real Playboy bunny body.
Oops, her heel is stuck in the grate.
She's struggling, she's about to fall - and someone comes to the rescue.
You're crazy.
You're making this up!
- No, I swear!
- Playboy bunny body...
- Do I have something in my teeth?
- No.
When will you learn to trust me?
I won't let you go around with food on your face or your fly open.
- You might not notice.
- I notice most things.
- You're so vain!
- I just don't want stuff in my teeth.
- Ice cream?
- Ice cream...
That sounds good.
The bench is here.
Hi!
Excuse me, have I seen you somewhere before?
- I don't think I've seen you before.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah...
- But I'm sure...
- Where do you hang out?
- Where don't I hang out?
- Maybe it was at the terrace at F12?
- F12, maybe!
- By the way, I'm Sebastian.
- Lisa.
Nice to meet you.
- What are you doing tonight?
- I'll probably go out.
- Maybe we can meet up?
- Wow, pushy!
Why don't you put your number on my phone?
Write: "Lisa with the pretty hair."
- You have a lot of Lisas?
- There's Lisa with the ugly hair too.
There.
Your phone.
Oh!
I keep it in my back pocket.
Actually the other one.
Thanks.
- See you.
- I'll be in touch.
Here's your ice cream.
Who was that?
- You saw her?
Was she hot?
- You don't know her?
- What was she doing?
- Nothing.
Was she hot?
She was a typical...
She was average height.
Thin - not creepy thin, but a fairly straight figure.
She had a friendly face, thick eyebrows, natural brown hair and hazel eyes.
What's so funny?
You were so observant!
Doesn't sound like anything for me anyway.
- Why not?
- Just doesn't sound like any fun.
So, what do you look like then?
Looks are important to you, aren't they?
They're important to everyone.
Those who deny it are either lying or ugly.
In which case they're not in a position to be picky.
- Come on, what do you look like?
- How do you think I look?
In my head you're... fit, with fine features, perfect taste in clothes... and I'm thinking blonde with blue eyes.
Like a shorter version of Cameron Diaz.
Am I close?
- Pretty much...
- I'm so good at that!
Here comes a wasp!
What!
Is it on me?
Take my ice cream!
Take it!
- I shouldn't have had any ice cream!
- It's gone now.
- Do you like TV talent shows?
- Not a fan, why?
There's a new one coming this fall and I thought you should audition.
- Forget it!
- Why not?
Sebastian Silverberg, the Blind Singer?
It'd be like that armless guitarist on YouTube.
Forget it!
- How are the road trip plans going?
- Fine.
The saving is slow.
You're so cheap, it ought to go quickly.
- I'll get there eventually.
- Of course you will.
That's good!
But how about "All alone - where are you" instead?
- That would work.
- Okay, then go into...
The bridge, followed by the new chorus.
From the top.
Good!
- I ought to be getting home.
- What time is it?
- 1:30.
- That's practically breakfast time.
There's no point in going home before breakfast.
- And we have 15 verses to write.
- Okay, let's do that.
Send in your audition demos to our new talent show, Star Struck!
Sebbe...
I may have accidentally sent your demo to the show...
- Accidentally?
- Don't be mad - you're so good!
Especially since I've been helping with the lyrics!
- I'm not doing it.
- Just see if you get an audition!
I'm not going on one of those shows.
- A bad attitude doesn't suit you.
- But everything else does!
Stop it!
That drives me crazy!
What's that?
I can't hear you through a mouthful of chips.
Sebastian!
- It's your parents.
- Open up, throw us the key!
- Call the police.
- Sebastian!
Fantastic news!
- What?
- They've decided to operate!
- What?
- They want you there tomorrow!
- I'm going to have?
- Yes!
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
- I can't find my toothbrush.
- I'll try to find it.
I thought you could hold on to my watch.
- Can I put it in my bag?
- As long as you don't scratch it!
I need to tell you something...
Hi there.
It's time for a little sedative.
Ah, nice.
What did you want to say?
Oh, nothing.
- I should go now.
- Okay.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Mia?
- See you soon.
- See you.
Mia?
Sebastian!
Mia had to go.
She'll be back tomorrow.
- You look beautiful, Mom!
- Oh, darling!
- Everything's all right now.
- You look good, too, Dad!
Hi, it's Mia Hi, Sebbe!
Hi!
Hi, Sebastian...
It's me, Mia!
Hi, Sebbe, it's me!
Hi, Sebastian, it's me, Mia!
"You're borderline", she says.
I said, "Finish your course before you start diagnosing people."
It's impolite, just because you're studying psychology.
Hi...
- I can come back later.
- No, no, come in!
- So this is Mia?
- This is her.
- I guess I don't look like...
- Don't worry about it.
- Erik, Mia
- Mia, Erik.
- I brought you some chocolates.
- Hey there.
- Hi, I'm Mia.
- How are you?
How do you feel?
- Well...
Everything's brighter and more colorful.
Dad looks fatter and Mom looks older.
Don't tell them I said that!
I heard you get to go home on Wednesday.
What will you do first?
I'm going to go back to my old life.
Like it was before the accident.
- Hi!
- Hey!
Great to see you!
Cheers!
Hi, Sebastian, it's Mia.
Sorry you couldn't meet me yesterday.
I'm working all week, but maybe we can go for a walk on Friday?
- Everything all right?
- I'm fine.
- How are the road trip plans going?
- Great.
In fact...
- I'm sorry.
Can I take this?
- Sure.
Hey!
Lobster!
Yeah, great.
I was wondering if it's okay if I bring three friends?
Great!
No, just put them under my name.
Okay, see you later.
Bye.
- Sorry.
- It's okay.
- Sebbe!
Hi!
- Hi!
Jessica.
- You remember Kristina?
- Of course.
- Erik told us what happened.
- It must have been awful!
Yeah, it was... difficult, but I've moved on.
Sorry, this is Mia, an old friend.
- This is Jessica and Kristina.
- Are you going out tonight?
- Yeah.
- Sweet, maybe we'll see you.
- I'm sure we will.
- Nice girls.
- Yeah.
- Want to get some ice cream?
- I don't really have time.
- Have you written any music lately?
- No, I haven't felt like it.
- Don't give up!
You're so talented.
- I know.
Is that really the kind of girls you like hanging out with?
- What's wrong with them?
- I just thought you'd be...
That I'd be... what?
Honestly, Mia, you don't know me.
You knew me when I was a different person.
I'm grateful for your help.
- But you have no idea who I am now.
- How can you say that?
Are you mad that I don't look like that?
- I don't care what you look like.
- Okay...
- But it is weird that you lied.
- Well, I knew you liked Barbie dolls.
- That says more about you than me.
- What do you mean by that?
You lied about your looks and you liked me better when I was helpless.
Now that I can see, you suddenly have a problem with me.
I just wonder what happened to you.
We laughed at stupid girls like that.
No, I laughed at you laughing at "stupid girls like that".
- You're obsessed with them.
Drop it.
- You drop it!
What's your problem?
!
When will you dare to take a chance?
Go for your dream - you're so close!
Get a life!
Find a handicapped boyfriend if it turns you on.
- Seriously?
- Yes, seriously.
I just want you to succeed because you're so good.
Because I care.
- Thanks.
That's great.
- What do you mean "great"?
- You'd rather be with one of those...
- Go on, what?
- You know what I mean!
- Yes, I would.
Totally.
- You're a blind idiot!
- Nope, I'm not blind.
- Then open your eyes!
- Have a nice life.
You too!
- It's all I have.
- You have Maria and the kids.
This is the only hobby I have.
I don't have anything else.
Hi, are you looking for anything special?
'Hi awake?
'
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
You know what?
This isn't a very nice way to treat people.
- It's fucking immature.
- I'm going to my grandma's funeral!
Yeah, yeah.
Your grandma dies often, doesn't she?
You don't even remember sleeping with me before.
Incredible.
Bye.
Say hello to grandma!
I thought she'd take a hint, but she calls me crying, says she broke up with her boyfriend for me, and I was like, why?
Women.
Why are they so emotional?
So much drama!
- Sebbe?
- Huh?
- Don't you get tired of this shit?
- What shit?
I can't be bothered.
I'm going home.
- Who's going home?
- Sebbe, apparently.
- Come on, Sebbe!
You've changed.
- Cool it.
Don't be so emotional.
- So much drama!
- Yeah, yeah.
- Take care.
- Sebbe!
Don't be so boring!
- Buy your own drinks, Oskar!
- You suck!
Loser!
Sebbe?
Oh!
Excuse me?
- Do you ever see Mia?
- No, not for a while.
Such a nice girl.
Pretty and sweet and ambitious.
- You're not in touch at all?
- We don't hang in the same circles.
But you two seemed so close.
We didn't have much choice.
She was here yesterday with a letter for you.
In the drawer.
- Is this it?
Nothing else?
- No, that's all.
Thanks.
Can you tell us something about yourself that's not on the form?
Like what?
Something that makes you different, or special?
Let's try an easier question.
When did you decide to become an artist?
I remember it was on my brother Theo's eighth birthday.
When all the kids had gone home,
Theo and I went upstairs to play with his presents.
He'd gotten a Millennium Falcon space ship, plus all the Star Wars action figures, and I was super jealous.
We were playing and MTV was on.
And it was Tracy Chapman with the live version of Fast Car.
And I remember we both just stopped playing, all at once, and looked at the TV.
I saw how fascinated he was.
I was only six, but I thought to myself, "This is what I'm going to do with my life."
I begged Mom to buy me a guitar, and she did.
Then...
Theo got sick that summer.
He died six months later.
So he never got to see that I kept practicing.
Apart from Theo, music is the only thing I've ever loved.
- You have one new message.
- Hi, Mia, it's Sebastian!
I guess you're working.
I just wanted to say I auditioned for Star Struck today and I made it.
I'll be on TV on Saturday, live.
So I just want to thank you for sending in my demo and everything.
Oh, I have another call.
I miss...
Take care, and thanks a million again.
Bye.
Hi, Mom!
No, not much.
I'm going to be on TV on Saturday.
It's almost time for the show you've been waiting for all summer.
Sweden's biggest talent show...
It's extremely important that you're on time.
- Nervous?
- Nah...
I'm sure it's going to go great!
Screaming psychos, alcoholic mothers, cut-up junkies...
All of them come before me!
Our next talent is a guitarist and singer.
All the way from Östermalm...
- Are you married?
- No, but I'm banging your wife.
She's unclean!
...that you'll want to hang with.
A big hand for Sebastian Silverberg!
- Quiet, quiet, Sebastian's on!
- Come on, son!
That was Sebastian's twist on Robyn's Hang with Me.
- Over to you, Josefin.
- What can I say?
You were awesome!
Thanks.
- Lars?
- Powerful.
Very good!
I just hope people vote for your voice, not your good looks!
- He was wonderful!
- Wasn't he!
To vote for Sebastian Silverberg, dial 08-205080.
- Did you call from both phones?
- Yes, I have both!
Every vote counts!
The next act is from Piteå:
Marie Stråhle and her dogs Mini and Bobo!
Dancing dogs may have been entertaining before TV and X-boxes...
- Watch it!
- Look where you're going!
No freak show act will win.
Forget them.
- So the acrobat girls?
- They're out.
- But their acrobatic skills could...
- They're at least 40!
- Sebbe!
We voted for you!
- We want you to win!
- Can we have your autograph?
- What are your names?
Whoa...
Johanna, Elin, Irma?
Stand straight!
Thank you, dear.
- So that's your friend?
- More an acquaintance.
He must be the most handsome man I've ever seen!
Unfortunately, he thinks so too.
- I say no.
- That's a no.
- That was embarrassing.
- And I'd like to say no.
I hope you vote for this group!
That was great!
- Sure, I can sing at your place.
- Oh, please do!
I have a flight to LA via London on the 19th.
- It leaves at 6: 15 AM, is that OK?
- I'll check.
- Is it okay?
- Oh, I just...
I... no...
You know what, I don't think I'm ready to book yet.
- What do you think?
- I think you should go!
Yes, you're right.
Book it!
One, two, three, four and one, two, three.
- Together, and "Baby" and...
- I'm sorry... this doesn't feel...
The steps, "Baby"...
I can't even see the camera!
It's okay, honey, that's why we rehearse with the cameraman.
You do your thing and let him work on staying out of the way.
From the top!
With his unique version of the Marina and the Diamonds song,
Sebastian Silverberg with I Am Not a Robot!
Those are his parents!
They're so sweet!
Tell me when you see his friends.
- Has he stopped calling?
- No, he's called a few times.
- What did he say?
- I haven't answered.
Quiet!
- He's a partier - is he hung over?
- No, that's not it.
Keep it going!
My god...
Good work!
As usual, we start with the judges.
Lars, over to you!
- Are you still in the running?
- Just barely.
- Tell me when you see my hand.
- Now.
- I'll call the doctor.
We'll go...
- I've already seen him.
They're doing all they can.
- Sebastian!
- Sebastian, can I get a picture?
What happened last week, Sebastian?
Do you feel ready for tomorrow?
That was fine.
- How is Sebastian's vision?
- He says it comes and goes.
- Will he tell the truth?
- I don't know.
He doesn't want it to come out until after the final.
He's afraid it will affect the voting.
- How are you?
- I'm okay.
It's harder for Göran.
It's hard to see his son hurting, after...
- Sebastian told me about Theo.
- He did?
He hardly ever talks about him.
It's great that he's begun to open up.
You've done wonders for him!
Shit!
Accept it, you're useless.
You'll never beat my high score.
That was a great melody.
Nice lyrics.
- Is it about anyone special?
- You, of course!
Gimme that.
- Can you see well enough to play?
- Well enough to beat you!
Hi, it's Sebastian.
Leave a message after the sound.
Hello, this is Walter Bergman from the evening news.
We've learned that you're losing your sight after a brain hemorrhage.
The story will be on the front page.
Call me if you have any comments.
My number is 08...
Hi Sebastian, this is Stina from Gossip magazine.
Would you...
Hello.
- Hello, hi... how are you?
- Fine.
- I didn't expect you to answer.
- I know...
Look, I know I owe you a massive apology for the last time we met.
I acted like a total ass.
I'm really, really sorry.
- Hmm, so how are you?
- Pretty good.
I...
I'm okay.
Can you believe the record label wants me back!
- Really?
Will you sign with them?
- Nah.
I think I'll wait for an indie label that lets me write my own stuff.
Aren't you going to sing any of your own songs on the show?
I could, but I don't know.
Time has just flown by and...
- Not everyone is as brave as you.
- Brave?
I don't know about that.
- Do you want to come tonight?
- To the final?
- Well, I'm leaving in the morning...
- Yeah?
Wow!
- To America?
...and I'm still packing, so...
I can ask them to reserve a seat for you in case you change your mind.
Okay...
I'll let you go now.
I hope your road trip is awesome.
- That it's everything you hoped.
- Thanks.
- Well, bon voyage.
- Bye.
"Bon voyage"?
After ten exciting weeks following ten unique talents, hand-picked from thousands of applicants, it's time for the final.
- 30 minutes, Sebastian.
- Sure...
- Do you need anything?
- No, I'm fine.
Wait - there is something I could use some help with.
I will!
Maybe not right when I land, but after a few days.
Hi, Mom.
Yeah, he told me.
Can I call you back?
- What are you doing here?
I had to see you.
I didn't want you to leave without a proper goodbye.
Well...
Bye then.
I have to finish packing.
So I can go "get a life", right?
- And you need to get back!
- But...
I'm so sorry for how I treated you.
Seeing you after the operation reminded me of the accident and how terrible I felt then.
I mean... when I got to know you in all that time we spent together,
You made me feel things...
You know, things I'd never felt before.
Like... before I met you, I felt like a Swatch on the inside, but like a Patek Philippe on the outside.
- You're talking about watches now?
- I mean...
My lyrics!
You know how they were, but you made me feel the opposite.
More like Coldplay than Lady Gaga, you know?
You made me feel...
You make me feel like...
Instead of:
That's what I wanted to say.
And also...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Come on, let's go to the final.
- Screw the final.
Hello and welcome to the grand final!
A big hand for the hip hop dance group Rhythmic Soul Crew.
- Shit...
- Where the hell have you been?
!
Take a seat in the front there.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
- God, I'm still in my pajamas!
- You're so embarrassing!
Go!
Let's hear it for the gravity-defying dancers of Rhythmic Soul Crew!
It's time to introduce the man who's made big headlines this week.
Let's give a big hand for Sebastian Silverberg!
- Hi, Sebastian.
- Hi.
I love you, Sebbe!
- How are you?
- I have major butterflies right now!
I'll bet.
Before you perform, I thought I'd give you the chance to comment on all the rumors circulating the past few weeks.
Okay, uh...
It's true, I'm losing my sight.
My journey hasn't been all that easy this past year.
But I guess, even if...
even if you face tough times, you just have to take a chance and try your best.
That's what helps you write interesting lyrics, right?
It gives me great pleasure to present, for the first time with one of his own songs, Sebastian Silverberg!
I'd like to dedicate this song to those who are starting new journeys.
And tonight I can see.
Tonight I can see everything.
Previously on Smash.
What happened to the sex?
Tom and I are not connecting.
It's really that bad?
It's just not you.
♪Ce n'est pas ma faute♪
I wish I could get out of this show.
I just quit Bombshell.
You're joking.
Jerry broke down.
Bombshell is finally mine.
- Ivy is free now.
- Whoo!
- Oh, sorry.
- Scott!

It's your life's work.
She used you.

I mean, all I know right now is that we spent the night together, and it was the best night of my life.
Okay, well, I guess we see the moment differently.
No, you see it wrong.
No offense.
None taken.
Although I don't like to think of any idea as "wrong"

All right, you don't want to play angry, fine.
But do something.

It's sensational.

You left your ringer on?
I forgot.
It's been a week.
He's not calling back.
Scott was one of my closest friends in grad school.
I mean, we may have had a falling out, but that was 15 years ago.
There's no way he's still holding on to a grudge.
Grudges don't go away.
They get bigger.
I just don't think that's what it is.
There must be something I'm not getting.
Yeah.
The hint.
Everyone, please enjoy croissants and coffee from Balthazar.
And then it's...
[Mimics whip cracking]
Back to work.
[Laughter]
You're even better than you were the first time around.
That's because I'm not terrified.
You're my director now.
And I'm finally Marilyn.
Oh, by the way, I had an idea.
I feel like I need a bigger catch breath before Star, you know, so I can really belt at the end.
- What do you think?
- I love it.
Whatever instincts you have,
I want to hear about them.
You know, that goes for everyone.
If you have thoughts or feelings about your character or the text, come to my house tonight and share them.
I believe, unlike some people, that actors have something to contribute apart from just doing what they're told.
Forget Derek.
This is a whole new Bombshell.
Well, then, if you don't mind,
I could really use a break in act two.
I'm in every scene.
And I'm not complaining, but I could really use a breather.
I will look into that.
I want my star to be as happy as she can be.
Ivy looks amazing here, doesn't she?
She's got her mother's face.
And her rack.
Shame she's not as big a draw as Leigh Conroy.
It'd make my job easier.
Why, is there a problem?
Tom's name does not fill the seats the way Derek Wills' does, so unless we drum up some excitement, you're going to be wandering around Times Square in a sandwich board.
- So tell me how to fix it.
- Perception.
The only press on Bombshell right now is what a hot mess it is.
We have to turn that around.
That was his direct.
Try his cell.
Have you been on the phone the whole time?
I'm aging here, Sean.
I just hit menopause while on hold.
How's our story for the New York Times?
I was told it was a no-go.
Well, that's impossible.
Richard Francis is the head of the arts section.
He's a very old friend.
No one is friends in this business.
He's the one who passed.
Oh, he had to run to a meeting?
Leave him a message.
"Screw you.
Love, Agnes."
Sam!
Ivy.
How long is your break again?
A week.
Sorry, it's going to be a little crazy while you're here.
How's it going up there?
Tom actually listens to me.
He cares about what I have to say.
Well, I'm jealous.
About the show, or that I'm up there working with Tom?
Come on, why don't you come upstairs and say hi?
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
If you remember correctly, he's the one who ended it.
He practically pushed me out to tour with book of mormon.
Well, let me push you back in.
A weird thing just happened on my way to the bathroom.
Do I want to hear this?
Marc thanked me for the monologue
I'm apparently giving him in act two.
He's a great actor.
What's a little monologue?
A sentence, which is exactly what he has right now.
Listen, I know that you want this to be a democracy...
Ah, ah, ah...
I prefer "an intellectual salon."
Right.
But at the end of the day, you are the director.
You have to be a parent.
Set strong boundaries, or you're going to lose control of your kids.
That was Derek's style, and his kids were miserable.
I appreciate your looking out for me, but I know what I'm doing.
For the first time in ages, everything's coming together.
Sam?
You two looked pretty comfy up there.
We were acting.
It didn't look like acting.
He's been blowing me off all week.
He barely talks to me offstage.
Will you ask him what's going on?
Guess who has the casting list?
Oh, I want to see.
It's so crazy they still haven't cast the diva.
Love her, love her.
Ooh, love to hate her.
Right?
Wow, these people are actually coming here to meet Derek.
Why don't you go in for it?
That role would be perfect for you.
Derek would never take me seriously.
Look at who he's meeting with.
What the hell?
Lea Michele?
Lea Michele?
If you say it one more time, she magically appears.
Do you understand anything about this show, huh?
The point is to come out of nowhere, take people by surprise.
You cast a celebrity, it overshadows everything.
The diva is the biggest superstar in the world, right?
She's Lady Gaga.
She's Madonna.
And if we cast a real star to mirror that, that would be a big coup, all right?
I know what I'm doing here, Jimmy.
Just let me do my job.
Oh, I've let you do a lot of things that I'm not cool with.
Not this one.
It's my show.
Hit it.

- There's a lot of friction, what they want?
- Is charming, isn't it?
Yeah, he's just a kid.
He challenges authority.
I've worked with a lot of kids.
I've found listening to them more effective than ignoring what they have to say.
I couldn't ignore that if I tried.
You're a very big get for this theater, Derek.
I'm aware of that.
But down here, we expect our directors and writers to work together.
Find some common ground.
See you in a bit.
It's a good list.
People running lines on a break, fresh pastries...
This is so not like tour life, let me tell you.
Well, you look great.
You know, what's really a shame is being one of the leads in the hottest show on tour right now, and regretting taking the job.
If you regret it so much, why not come back?
No, I wasn't...
I'm sure I could find a place for you here.
Could you excuse us a minute?
Yeah.
You can't offer him a role.
There's nothing left, besides Gladys.
Even our swings are hired.
You heard him.
He's not happy.
I can find something.
Not without losing something.
I miss him.
He should be here.
We're not going to lose anything, trust me.
I tried to stop her.
Oh, you can't, Mia.
She hasn't stopped moving since the '70s.
So your name came up this morning, and I said to my publicist,
"there must be some sort of mistake,
"because the Richard Francis I know adores a good story, he adores good theater, and he adores me."
The problem is, you don't have a good story, Eileen.
I am in rehearsal for the biggest musical yet to be seen on Broadway, one that I am back in control of.
Yeah, but it's been done to death in the gossip columns.
Feuding actresses, oversexed directors, divorce, betrayal, and not right for the New York Times.
Richard, why don't you come on down to rehearsal?
You can be the first reporter to see Bombshell redux.
Perhaps you can even find a new angle.
Ohh.
Locked in the bedroom at your own party?
You look like me at my sweet sixteen.
I'm going through the script, trying to find a place for Sam.
And you're right.
There's nothing.
At least you tried.
You know what I think you should do tonight?
Drink champagne.
Have fun with your friends.
You've earned that much.
And tomorrow, you can tell Sam that you couldn't make it work.
He'll understand.
Ah, I told you he'd be in here.
What's going on?
Everyone wants to sing.
Come and play for us.
I'm working.
The man doesn't even have a drink.
Let's get the man a drink.
- One drink.
- One drink?
- Uh, that's my shirt.
- No, I think it's mine.
Oh, yeah, did you, uh, go to Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn?
Not technically.
But see the way the fabric's worn through?
Mm.
The neckline is stretched out so it falls off one shoulder like that?
That makes it a girl's shirt.
Can I have it?
Well, you certainly look better in it than I do, that's for sure.
Hey, what if Amanda stole a t-shirt from Jesse the night they were together?
And then, later on, he sees her wearing it in one of her videos...
- Like she's taunting him.
- Or missing him.
You should tell Derek about that.
Why don't you?
He doesn't really seem interested in anything I have to say.
To be fair, you're not really listening to him, either.
You may let him push you around, but I don't have to.
I don't let him push me around.
I didn't get him at first, but once I clicked into the way he directs, we started connecting.
No, no, I'm pretty sure his "connection" with you is special.
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm keeping the t-shirt.
What's all this?
I've been looking through old drafts, trying to find you a break in act two.
Hey, I recognize this.
It's not from Bombshell.
It's from a musical we were working on about, uh, Vegas in the '60s.
I played that for you, remember?
Of course I do.
Why didn't you finish it?
Because, other than that song...
- It blew.
- Hey, I loved it.
Not going to lie, after I heard it,
I started dusting off my nat king Cole, hoping one day I'd get a chance to perform it.
Did you really?
I did.
Really.

Haven't used any of that in a while.
You still got it.
Thank you.
I've missed this..
That song almost feels like it could be in Bombshell.
Too bad Nat King Cole didn't know Marilyn.
He could've.
He was a big supporter of Kennedy's, performed a ton at his rallies.
Maybe we could introduce J.F.K. at one of them.
Uh, I think how we meet J.F.K. is... is just fine.
When Marilyn does.
Sam, what do you think?
Ii mean, I want to come home, but you don't have to make all those changes for me.
Call the mormons.
Tell them you're not coming back.
I'm getting you back in the show.
Wait, are you sure?
Can you do that?
I'm the director, aren't I?
Oh, my God.
[Cheering]
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Tom.
Yep.
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey.
I've just put together some ideas for the show, and I think you're going to like them.
Uh, they're led screens.
They allow for a big range of photographic sets.
They're from Japan, very high tech.
That's cool, but we're low-fi.
I figured we'd have, you know, actual furniture.
Yeah, well, if you're not going to let me have a name actor for the diva, we need to make a statement somewhere.
How about with the show itself?
I'm just trying to get us on the same page.
The more you talk, the less I feel that we are.
This isn't Broadway.
What do you know about Broadway?
Well, I know that you're used to getting anything you want there and that last time, you put so many bells and whistles all over everything that no one noticed the show had any problems until it was too late.
Jimmy...
I'm just trying to open your show up.
All right?
That's what a good director does.
The show doesn't need opening up.
It needs to be true to what it is.
Well, this is harder than I thought.
Maybe I can make it easier.
What do you think about Ana auditioning for the diva?
Oh, she's super talented.
You haven't seen half of what she can do.
And she's already here.
Look, Ana is perfect as Jesse's sister.
Yeah, but I just thought...
I just thought I'd ask.
[Sleepy grunt]
[Knocks]
Hey.
Heard you were looking for me.
Where'd you get those?
Jimmy thought I should have a look, see what you're planning.
I'm not sure this is the right aesthetic for this show, or the theater.
I thought you were looking for size, Scott.
I'm sorry, I'm a bit confused.
Thematically, yes, one of the best things about the show is the chemistry between your two leads.
I don't want them overwhelmed by the staging.
That was me thinking you wanted to make a splash with your first show, Scott.
Blow the town away.
Yeah, but I don't want to bankrupt the theater to do it.
Well, I've got five led screens arriving this morning.
They're all donated.
Contrary to popular opinion,
I've got some friends in this business.
Look, it'll be a Broadway show with an off-Broadway budget.
Oh, come on, at least let me show you what I'm thinking.
It's a little vague right now, but picture red, white, and blue...
Where's our Marilyn?
I thought we were doing Mr. and Mrs. Smith today.
We switched up the schedule a little bit at the last minute.
Well, no one told me.
I have Richard Francis from the New York Times meeting me here to see Ivy today.
I gave her the morning off so we could play around with something.
There's a potential new number I want to show you, something I think the show's been missing.
I cannot believe that you would do this without my approval.
You're going to love Tom's Bombshell.
It's a much more elegant take...
Well, you call in Ivy right now!
- Why don't we wait outside?
- Great idea.
Eileen...
Hold on.
Not until I show it to you first.
A disagreement in front of the most important arts editor in town?
Great reboot, guys.
- Richard Francis is here?
- Yes.
Tell him I'll be right out.
Keep him cool.
Can you please just look at the song?
The show is about Marilyn, not J.F.K.
I can't have two songs about him.
I agree.
And Our little secret is the one that's actually about Marilyn.
You're the director.
You decide.
And this time, maybe you'd like to clue me in.
We are not losing the Marilyn
- J.F.K. number.
It's relevant to the story that we're trying to tell.
This one is not.
I know.
[Sighs]
Uhh!
I promised Sam.
That promise isn't even 12 hours old.
He'll understand.
What about the hat?
Too much Sammy, not enough nat, right?
You going to tell him?
Tell me what?
We cannot put the number in.
That's...
That's not necessarily...
Tom, I just left my job.
Tom.
I'm thinking.
I'm thinking.
Sam, um, we'll... we'll be back in a little while.
- Okay...
- Come on, let's go for a walk.
- What?
- Just come on.
I tried, but I think he needs to hear it from you.
Just show up at the audition.
Show him what you've got.
No, I don't want to piss off Derek and risk losing the part I already have.
You're not asking him to give you the part, just a chance.
No.
He already said no.
I don't want to push it.
He pushes us.
Okay, you'd be amazing.
We both know it.
Come on, fight for it.
I still think you have a shot.
You want me to grow a pair, how about you?
I'll talk to Derek if you talk to Jimmy.
You really think Derek is going to fold?
Scott doesn't want his bells and whistles, either.
This theater is downtown.
It's not Broadway.
You told Scott about it?
What choice did I have?
I'm not going to let Derek beat me.
"Beat you"?
Why are you making this so personal?
Is this about Karen?
Oh, my God.
It so is.
Did something happen between the two of you?
You remember when you thought Karen and Derek were dating?
Yeah, well, they weren't.
But he wants them to be.
He told me last week to stay away from her.
Are you going to?
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, buddy.
Thanks for showing Scott my presentation.
Great news, he really loves the LED screens.
When you're ready, we'll be doing Voice in a dream, all right?
There's no new story here Eileen.
Producer and director at odds, the last minute changes...
It's all been said.
Then say it a new way!
I mean, I need the press, Richard.
You could talk about how you got your show back.
Well, that might be a very interesting story, but it involves my daughter, and I'm not about to drag her through this.
That's too bad.
Mother and daughter banding together to save a show, people eat that stuff up.
They do, don't they?
Thanks for your help, Richard, very much.
Where are you going?
Keep your phone on.
I'm going to get you a new story.
What are we doing down here?
Are we buying pot?
I haven't done that in years.
I'm proud of you.
The way you've stepped up as director, executing your vision while making everyone feel supported and heard, it's amazing.
But...
But a director needs to be a leader, and a leader makes hard decisions.
And when it comes to hard decisions, he's the best.
No, no, no.
They're in the wrong order.
Are you serious?
All right, back to the top.
Oh, bloody hell!
The files are too big for the system.
They keep crashing.
This is ridiculous.
It just needs to get up and running.
We have three weeks to rehearse.
Do you want to spend the whole time rebooting a computer?
What I don't want is to show some kid simply walking across the stage for five minutes.
It's "some kid" walking across a stage to tell a girl that he loves her.
If we can't get an audience to care about that on its own, one of us isn't very good at his job.
So, what, you're saying I can't direct this show?
No, I'm saying you hide behind fancy screens and orchestras and clothes because you have nothing else up your sleeve.
What do you think, Karen?
Do we need any of this?
Oh, don't put her in the middle.
I didn't.
You did.
Tell him what you really think.
- Oh, shut up.
- Oh...
It's okay.
Go ahead.
It's...
Not right for this show.
I'm sorry, Derek.
Pathetic, the lot of you.
Hope you enjoyed the show.
Scott?
What are you doing here?
Well, you haven't been returning my calls.
I've been busy.
Right.
Of course.
Sorry.
You're not still mad about my play, are you?
I-I thought maybe, and then I realized that it was 15 years ago.
And I'm sure you understood that anyone in my position would have done the same thing, and...
I wouldn't have.
It was Lincoln center.
You were my friend.
My friend who promised me
I could direct that play at the vineyard.
They offered me Mike Nichols.
What should I have done?
You should have said no.
It launched my career.
And almost ruined mine.
I promised them that play, and I lost my slot.
I couldn't work for a year.
And when I could, it wasn't in New York.
You've had a spectacular career.
Yeah, and it took me 15 years to get back here.
So pardon me if yours isn't the first face I want to see.
The way you talked to those actors in there...
Oh, God, seriously?
This now?
It was awesome.
You really don't care what they think of you, do you?
No.
How do you sleep at night, knowing everybody hates you?
I'm seriously asking.
Well... you realize that having them respect you is more important than having them like you.
It's a lonely business, Tom.
You can't be friends with them.
I don't think that's going to be a problem for you and Jimmy.
[Laughs]
That one is killing me.
He's 24 years old, and he's telling me how to do my job.
[Laughs]
Reminds me of you at that age.
Shut up.
I was not that bad.
You were worse.
Arrogant, stubborn, full of huge ideas that nobody believed in but you.
In the end, you were right.
Maybe that kid is the same.
Listen to him.
He's not your enemy.
[Sighs]
Derek is kind of slice ball, isn't he?
I don't get why Karen hangs around him all the time.
Who should she be hanging around?
Jimmy?
No.
That is not what I meant.
I didn't think so.
We've all wanted things we can't have.
The trick is to learn to let go and enjoy the things that you can have.
What's up?
I started out in theaters like this.
Actually, they were worse than this.
They were the sort of theaters where the audience used to walk across the stage in the middle of the performance to go to the toilet.
But I did some of my best work in them.
I was innovative 'cause I had to be.
You know, I got bigger jobs, more money, bigger sets.
And yes...
There is a very slim possibility that you might have a point.
It's been a while since I had to think outside the box.
Thanks.
So your show's not about scenery or props or costumes, so what is it about?
Two people falling in love...
And what gets in the way of that.
And what gets in the way of love is...
Other people.
In my experience, at least.
Great.
Well, let's show that, then.
Okay, so we're halfway through act one.
Jesse has just heard Amanda singing a song on the radio, a song that he wrote that she stole.
But he's not angry.
He wants to see her again.
So he goes after her.
So stage right is greenpoint, where Jesse starts out.
Stage left is L.A., where Amanda is performing her first big concert as Nina.
But the journey is tough.
There are many obstacles in the way.
Obstacles?
Thank you.

[Cheers and applause]
Scott.
Just listen.
I can't pretend that I'm not happy that my first play was done at Lincoln Center.
But if I'm being honest,
I knew what I did hurt you.
And instead of apologizing back then,
I told myself that it wasn't really that bad.
So here I am, 15 years too late, saying I'm sorry.
Thanks.
Hey, Jules.
I heard about your split from Frank.
I remember...
How in love you both were.
I'm sorry.
[Rock music playing]
You're right.
We're cowards.
What are you talking about?
Using that bathroom is the bravest thing
I've done in weeks.
I had to make mittens out of paper towels.
I'm crazy about him.
Seeing him perform today made it so clear.
Even right now, watching him hit on that guy for Kyle has me all...
Melty.
- Then tell him.
- He's not into me.
Then you'll know.
And you'll cry, and you'll hate him, and then you'll move on.
At least you put yourself out there.
I'm scared.
What if I put myself out there first?
Hey, you.
Look alive.

Yeah.
Tom, what's the matter?
What's wrong?
I can't put that number in Bombshell.
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.
Hmm.
I knew it.
You'd be amazing in it, and I'd love to see you do it someday, but Julia's right.
The Kennedy number is better for the show.
You know, I left my job for this.
You left your job because you're unhappy.
I left my job for a lot of reasons.
And I thought you'd changed.
I thought you were finally ready for this, but you're the same old Tom, putting work before what's really important.
Where are you going?
To see if I can get my job back.
Oh, hey.
I had another idea...
A way to differentiate between my Marilyn and Karen's.
I thought maybe we could redo a couple of the costumes.
Yeah, I don't think so.
I was only thinking maybe one or two.
They're perfect the way they are.
We're also not going to be able to work in that break for you in act two.
I'm sorry.
Can we at least discuss it?
We just did.
Mm, but your note about the catch breath, that was spot-on.
Great job.
Places, everyone, for the top.
Let's run the whole shebang, no stopping.
How'd it go?
I cut it.
I know that was hard.
Yes, it was.
But it was also right.
Mm hmm.
I need you to take another pass on the Gladys scenes.
- What?
- I know how much they mean to you, but I need them to be a little more focused.
Take out the fat.
- Okay.
- By tonight.
Apparently, Eileen has a name lined up.
She's on her way here now.
I'll go start on it now.
Good.
Relax for two minutes.
- I have some news.
- Lupone?
No, I want to go in a new direction.
Leigh Conroy has agreed to come out of retirement and play the part of Gladys.
- Ivy's mother.
- It's a good story, Tom.
The New York Times has agreed to announce it as soon as we pull the trigger.
That is, of course, unless you think
Ivy might feel threatened.
[Indistinct chatter]
Do it.
- I'll make the call.
- All right.
Bobby, stop texting.
Places for real.
Everyone full out.
Don't let me see the mistakes.
I just paid 134.50 twice and a babysitter.
Congratulations.
[Alternative rock music playing]
You just became our diva.
[Laughs] What?
Hey.
I'm sorry I didn't see it before.
I'll accept if you buy me another drink.
Sure thing.
[Laughs]
So let me ask you a serious question.
Should we have one more drink?
Yeah, I think you've had enough tonight.
Come on.
This is the first time we've been out in ages, and you've been blowing me off lately.
Yeah, I know.
Why?
Do you like me or not?
- Of course I like you.
- No.
I mean, do you like me?
♪
Either of you guys want a drink?
Walk me home.
Yeah, my pleasure.
Oh, hey, is Ana going with you?
Uh, no, I think she's taken care of.
As is Kyle.
See you at rehearsals tomorrow.
Yeah, night.
Thanks for walking me home.
I can take it from here.
You sure?
Don't need an escort upstairs?
[Laughs]
We could get another drink.
I know a spot on the corner.
I have an early rehearsal tomorrow, and the director is a control freak.
[Tender music]
Fair enough.
Good night.
Night.
♪
[Doorbell buzzes]
Fine, I guess I can handle one more drink.
[Buzz]
[Knock at door]
That was fast.
What, did you run up here?
[Breathing hard]
Previously on Smash...
What happened to the sex?
Tom and I aren't connecting.
Is it really that bad?
It's just not you.
I wish I could get out of this show.
I just quit Bombshell.
You're joking.
Jerry broke down.
Bombshell is finally mine.
Ivy is free now.
Woo!
Oh, sorry.
Scott.
Julia.
That is a terrible idea.
We don't need to spell out our theme.
You want to go out after this and get a drink?
When I direct, I tend to get focused on something.
Or someone.
Okay, stop there.
That reaction is still a bit soft.
You just shrugged.
And when you realize she's gone, you're angry.
You've been played.
No, I haven't.
Well, she just took your music.
It's your life's work.
She used you.
Uh, I have no idea what she did yet.
I mean, all I know right now is that we spent the night together, and it was the best night of my life.
Okay, well, I guess we see the moment differently.
No, you see it wrong.
No offense.
None taken.
Although I don't like to think of any idea as "wrong"
on the first day of rehearsal.
Right, you don't want to play angry, fine, but do something.
You shrug up there, they shrug out here.
All right.
Reset from the top, please.
Fade up on a star with it all in her sights
All the love and the lights that surround her
Someday she'll think twice
Of the dues and the price
She'll have to pay but not...
I forgot how great she is.
I didn't.
She'll do all she can
For the love of one man and for millions who love from afar
I'm what you've been needing
It's all here and my heart's pleading
Let me be your star!
It's sensational.
I hate to leave, but Agnes is waiting.
Good luck.
Thanks.
You left your ringer on?
I forgot.
It's been a week.
He's not calling back.
Scott was one of my closest friends in grad school.
I mean, we may have had a falling out, but that was 15 years ago.
There's no way he's still holding on to a grudge.
Grudges don't go away.
They get bigger.
I just don't think that's what it is.
There must be something I'm not getting.
Yeah, the hint.
Everyone, please enjoy croissants and coffee from Balthazar.
And then it's Back to work.
You're even better than you were the first time around.
It's because I'm not terrified.
You're my director now.
And I'm finally Marilyn.
Oh, by the way, I had an idea.
I feel like I need a bigger catch breath before "star,"
you know, so I can really belt at the end.
What do you think?
I love it.
Whatever instincts you have, I want to hear about them.
You know, that goes for everyone.
If you have thoughts or feelings about your character or the text, come to my house tonight and share them.
I believe, unlike some people, that actors have something to contribute apart from just doing what they're told.
Forget Derek.
This is a whole new Bombshell.
Well, then, if you don't mind, I could really use a break in Act II.
I'm in every scene.
And I'm not complaining, but I could really use a breather.
I will look into that.
I want my star to be as happy as she can be.
Ivy looks amazing here, doesn't she?
She's got her mother's face.
And her rack.
Shame she's not as big a draw as Leigh Conroy.
It'd make my job easier.
Why?
Is there a problem?
Tom's name does not fill the seats the way Derek Wills' does.
So unless we drum up some excitement, you're going to be wandering around
Times Square in a sandwich board.
So tell me how to fix it.
Perception.
The only press on Bombshell right now is what a hot mess it is.
We have to turn that around.
That was his direct.
Try his cell.
Have you been on the phone the whole time?
I'm aging here, Sean.
I just hit menopause while on hold.
How's our story for The New York Times?
I was told it was a no-go.
Well, that's impossible.
Richard Francis is the head of the Arts section.
He's a very old friend.
No one is friends in this business.
He's the one who passed.
Oh, he had to run to a meeting?
Leave him a message.
"Screw you.
Love, Agnes."
Sam!
Ivy.
How long's your break again?
A week.
Sorry, it's going to be a little crazy while you're here.
How's it going up there?
Tom actually listens to me.
He cares about what I have to say.
I'm jealous.
About the show?
Or that I'm up there working with Tom?
Come on.
Why don't you come upstairs and say hi?
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
If you remember correctly, he's the one who ended it.
He practically pushed me out to tour with Book of Mormon.
Well, let me push you back in.
Come in.
A weird thing just happened on my way to the bathroom.
Do I want to hear this?
Marc thanked me for the monologue
I'm apparently giving him in Act II.
He's a great actor.
What's a little monologue?
A sentence, which is exactly what he has right now.
Listen, I know that you want this to be a democracy...
Ah, ah, ah, I prefer "an intellectual salon."
Right.
But at the end of the day, you are the director.
You have to be a parent.
Set strong boundaries or you're gonna lose control of your kids.
That was Derek's style.
And his kids were miserable.
I appreciate your looking out for me, but I know what I'm doing.
For the first time in ages, everything is coming together.
Sam?
You two looked pretty comfy up there.
We were acting.
It didn't look like acting.
He's been blowing me off all week.
He barely talks to me offstage.
Will you ask him what's going on?
Guess who has the casting list?
Oh, I wanna see.
It's so crazy, they still haven't cast The Diva.
Love her.
Love her.
Ooh, love to hate her.
Right?
Wow, these people are actually coming here to meet Derek.
Why don't you go in for it?
That role would be perfect for you.
Derek would never take me seriously.
Look at who he's meeting with.
What the hell?
Lea Michele?
Lea Michele?
If you say it one more time, she magically appears.
Do you understand anything about this show, huh?
The point is to come out of nowhere, take people by surprise.
You cast a celebrity, it overshadows everything.
The Diva is the biggest superstar in the world, right?
She's Lady Gaga, she's Madonna.
And if we cast a real star to mirror that, that would be a big coup.
All right?
I know what I'm doing here, Jimmy.
Just let me do my job.
Oh, I've let you do a lot of things that I'm not cool with.
Not this one.
It's my show.
SMASH S02E08 The Bells And Whistles Sync to WEB-DL by Jill.Valentine
That's a lot of friction for day one.
He's charming, isn't he?
Yeah, he's just a kid.
He challenges authority.
I've worked with a lot of kids.
I've found listening to them more effective than ignoring what they have to say.
I couldn't ignore that if I tried.
You're a very big get for this theater, Derek.
I'm aware of that.
But down here, we expect our directors and writers to work together.
Find some common ground.
See you in a bit.
It's a good list.
People running lines on a break, fresh pastries.
This is so not like tour life, let me tell you.
Well, you look great.
What's really a shame is being one of the leads in the hottest show on tour right now and regretting taking the job.
If you regret it so much, why not come back?
No, I wasn't...
I'm sure I could find a place for you here.
Could you excuse us a minute?
Yeah.
You can't offer him a role.
There's nothing left, besides Gladys.
Even our swings are hired.
You heard him.
He's not happy.
I can find something.
Not without losing something.
I miss him.
He should be here.
We're not gonna lose anything, trust me.
I tried to stop her.
You can't, Mia.
She hasn't stopped moving since the '70s.
So your name came up this morning, and I said to my publicist, "There must be some sort of mistake
"because the Richard Francis I know adores a good story,
"he adores good theater,
"and he adores me."
The problem is, you don't have a good story, Eileen.
I am in rehearsal for the biggest musical yet to be seen on Broadway, one that I am back in control of.
Yeah, but it's been done to death in the gossip columns.
Feuding actresses, oversexed directors, divorce, betrayal, and not right for The New York Times.
Richard, why don't you come on down to rehearsal?
You can be the first reporter to see Bombshell redux.
Perhaps you can even find a new angle.
Locked in the bedroom at your own cast party?
You look like me at my sweet sixteen.
I'm going through the script, trying to find a place for Sam.
And you're right.
There's nothing.
At least you tried.
You know what I think you should do tonight?
Drink champagne.
Have fun with your friends.
You've earned that much.
And tomorrow, you can tell Sam that you couldn't make it work.
He'll understand.
Ah, I told you he'd be in here.
What's going on?
Everyone wants to sing.
Come and play for us.
I'm working.
The man doesn't even have a drink.
Let's get the man a drink.
One drink.
One drink?
Uh, that's my shirt.
No, I think it's mine.
Oh, yeah, did you go to Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn?
Not technically.
But see the way the fabric is worn through?
The neckline is stretched out so that it falls off one shoulder, like that?
That makes it a girl's shirt.
Can I have it?
Well, you certainly look better in it than I do, that's for sure.
Hey.
What if Amanda stole a T-shirt from Jesse the night they were together, and then later on he sees her wearing it in one of her videos?
Like she's taunting him.
Or missing him.
You should tell Derek about that.
Why don't you?
He doesn't really seem interested in anything I have to say.
To be fair, you're not really listening to him, either.
You may let him push you around, but I don't have to.
I don't let him push me around.
I didn't get him at first, but once I clicked into the way he directs, we started connecting.
No, no, I'm pretty sure his connection with you is special.
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm keeping the T-shirt.
What's all this?
I've been looking through old drafts, trying to find you a break in Act II.
Hey, I recognize this.
It's not from Bombshell.
It's from a musical we were working on about Vegas in the '60s.
I played that for you, remember?
Of course I do.
Why didn't you finish it?
Because other than that song...
It blew.
Hey, I loved it.
Not gonna lie, after I heard it,
I started dusting off my Nat King Cole, hoping one day I'd get a chance to perform it.
Did you really?
I did.
Really.
'Round and 'round goes the wheel of love
Some say like Russian roulette
There's a jackpot I'm dreaming of
I'm ready to place my bet
No need to beg, steal or borrow
The future is looking bright
Yes, I'm laying odds on tomorrow
So let's start Start
Tomorrow tonight
Can't you feel, baby, we're in the chips
Tomorrow's our lucky day, yeah
I can feel gold at our fingertips
We'll prosper if we parlay, yeah
No time for sadness and sorrow
Together we'll fight that fight
Yes
I'm laying odds on tomorrow
So let's start tomorrow tonight
Don't need no clover or lucky charm
That rabbit can keep his foot
As long as we're walking arm in arm
It's aces I feel
So shut up and deal
I know that we're on a winning streak
The future can't come too soon
Let's climb together to reach that peak
Then, baby, we'll shoot the moon
I'm high as Kilimanjaro
And with you, Jack, I'm ready for flight
Yes, I'm laying odds on tomorrow
So let's start tomorrow tonight
Dance break!
Whoo!
As long as we're walkin' arm in arm
It's aces I feel
So shut up and deal
Oh, I know that we're on a winning streak
The future can't come too soon
Can't come too soon
Let's climb together to reach that peak
Then, baby, we'll shoot the moon
I'm high as Kilimanjaro
Yeah!
And with you, Jack, I'm ready for flight
Yeah, I'm laying odds on tomorrow
So let's start tomorrow tonight
Let's start tomorrow tonight
Woo-eeh
Haven't used any of that in a while.
You still got it.
Thank you.
I've missed this.
That song almost feels like it could be in Bombshell.
Too bad.
Nat King Cole didn't know Marilyn.
He could have.
He was a big supporter of Kennedy's, performed a ton at his rallies.
Maybe we could introduce JFK at one of them?
I think how we meet JFK is just fine.
When Marilyn does.
Sam, what do you think?
I mean, I want to come home, but you don't have to make all those changes for me.
Call the Mormons.
Tell them you're not coming back.
I'm getting you back in the show.
Wait.
Are you sure?
Can you do that?
I'm the director, aren't I?
Oh, my God!
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Tom.
Yep.
Hey.
What's going on?
Hi.
I've just put together some ideas for the show and I think you're going to like them.
They're LED screens.
They allow for a big range of photographic sets.
They're from Japan, very high-tech.
That's cool, but we're lo-fi.
I figured we'd have, you know, actual furniture.
Yeah, well, if you're not gonna let me have a name actor for The Diva, we need to make a statement somewhere.
How about with the show itself?
I'm just trying to get us on the same page.
The more you talk, the less I feel that we are.
This isn't Broadway.
What do you know about Broadway?
Well, I know that you're used to getting anything you want there, and that, last time, you put so many bells and whistles all over everything that no one noticed the show had any problems until it was too late.
Jimmy...
I'm just trying to open your show up.
All right?
That's what a good director does.
The show doesn't need opening up.
It needs to be true to what it is.
Well, this is harder than I thought.
Maybe I can make it easier.
What do you think about Ana auditioning for The Diva?
Oh, she's super talented.
You haven't seen half of what she can do.
And she's already here.
Look, Ana is perfect as Jesse's sister.
Yeah, but I just thought...
I just thought I'd ask.
Hey.
Heard you were looking for me.
Where did you get those?
Jimmy thought I should have a look.
See what you're planning.
I'm not sure this is the right aesthetic for this show, or the theater.
I thought you were looking for size, Scott.
Sorry, I'm a bit confused.
Thematically, yes, but one of the best things about the show is the chemistry between your two leads.
I don't want them overwhelmed by the staging.
And here was me thinking you wanted to make a splash with your first show, Scott.
Blow the town away.
Yeah.
But I don't want to bankrupt the theater to do it.
Well, I've got five LED screens arriving this morning.
They're all donated.
Contrary to popular opinion, I've got some friends in this business.
Look, it'll be a Broadway show with an off-Broadway budget.
Oh, come on.
At least let me show you what I'm thinking?
It's a little vague right now, but picture red, white and blue...
Where's our Marilyn?
I thought we were doing Mr. Mrs. Smith today.
We switched up the schedule a little bit at the last minute.
Well, no one told me.
I have Richard Francis from The New York Times meeting me here to see Ivy today.
I gave her the morning off so we could play around with something.
There's a potential new number I want to show you, something I think the show's been missing.
I cannot believe that you would do this without my approval.
You're going to love Tom's Bombshell,
Oh, yeah?
It's a much more elegant take...
You call in Ivy right now!
Why don't we wait outside?
Great idea.
Eileen, hold on, not until I show it to you first.
A disagreement in front of the most important Arts editor in town?
Great reboot, guys.
Richard Francis is here?
Yes.
Tell him I'll be right out.
Keep him cool.
Can you please just look at the song?
This show is about Marilyn, not JFK.
I can't have two songs about him.
I agree.
And Our Little Secret is the one that's actually about Marilyn.
You're the director.
You decide.
And this time, maybe you'd like to clue me in.
We are not losing the Marilyn-JFK number.
It's relevant to the story that we're trying to tell.
This one is not.
I know.
Uh!
I promised Sam.
That promise isn't even 12 hours old.
He'll understand.
What about the hat?
Too much Sammy, not enough Nat, right?
Gonna tell him?
Tell me what?
We cannot put the number in.
That's...
That's not necessarily...
Tom, I just left my job.
Tom.
I'm thinking.
I'm thinking.
Sam, um, we'll be back in a little while.
Okay.
Come on, let's go for a walk.
What?
Just come on.
I tried, but I think he needs to hear it from you.
Just show up at the audition.
Show him what you got.
No.
I don't want to piss off Derek and risk losing the part I already have.
You're not asking him to give you the part, just a chance.
No.
He already said no.
I don't want to push it.
He pushes us.
Okay, you'd be amazing.
We both know it.
Come on, fight for it.
I still think you have a shot.
You want me to grow a pair, how about you?
I'll talk to Derek if you talk to Jimmy.
You really think Derek is gonna fold?
Scott doesn't want his bells and whistles, either.
This theater is downtown, it's not Broadway.
You told Scott about it?
What choice did I have?
I'm not gonna let Derek beat me.
"Beat you"?
Why are you making this so personal?
Is this about Karen?
Oh, my God.
It so is.
Did something happen between the two of you?
You remember when you thought Karen and Derek were dating?
Yeah.
Well, they weren't.
But he wants them to be.
He told me last week to stay away from her.
Are you going to?
Hey.
Oh, hey, buddy.
Thanks for showing Scott my presentation.
Great news, he really loves the LED screens.
When you're ready, we'll be doing Voice in a Dream, all right?
There's no new story here, Eileen.
Producer and director at odds, last-minute changes, it's all been said.
Then say it a new way!
I mean, I need the press, Richard.
You could talk about how you got your show back.
Well, that might be a very interesting story, but it involves my daughter, and I'm not about to drag her through this.
That's too bad.
Mother and daughter banding together to save a show, people eat that stuff up.
They do, don't they?
Thanks for your help, Richard, very much.
Where are you going?
Keep your phone on.
I'm going to get you a new story.
What are we doing down here?
Are we buying pot?
We haven't done that in years.
I'm proud of you.
The way you've stepped up as director, executing your vision while making everyone feel supported and heard, it's amazing.
But?
But a director needs to be a leader, and a leader makes hard decisions.
And when it comes to hard decisions, he's the best.
No, no, no, they're in the wrong order!
Are you serious?
All right, back to the top.
Oh, bloody hell!
The files are too big for the system.
They keep crashing.
This is ridiculous.
It just needs to get up and running.
We have three weeks to rehearse.
You wanna spend the whole time rebooting a computer?
What I don't want is to show some kid simply walking across a stage for five minutes.
It's some kid walking across a stage to tell a girl that he loves her.
If we can't get an audience to care about that on its own, one of us isn't very good at his job.
So what, you're saying I can't direct this show?
No.
I'm saying you hide behind fancy screens and orchestras and clothes because you have nothing else up your sleeve.
What do you think, Karen?
Do we need any of this?
Oh, don't put her in the middle.
I didn't.
You did.
Tell him what you really think, huh?
Oh, shut up.
It's okay.
Go ahead.
It's...
Not right for this show.
I'm sorry, Derek.
Pathetic.
The lot of you.
I hope you enjoyed the show.
Scott?
What are you doing here?
Well, you haven't been returning my calls.
I've been busy.
Right.
Of course.
Sorry.
You're not still mad about my play, are you?
I thought maybe, and then I realized it was 15 years ago, and I'm sure you understood that anyone in my position would have done the same thing.
I wouldn't have.
It was Lincoln Center.
You were my friend.
My friend who promised me I could direct that play at the Vineyard.
They offered me Mike Nichols.
What should I have done?
You should have said no.
It launched my career.
And almost ruined mine.
I promised them that play, and I lost my slot.
I couldn't work for a year.
And when I could, it wasn't in New York.
You've had a spectacular career.
Yeah, and it took me 15 years to get back here.
So pardon me if yours isn't the first face I want to see.
The way you talked to those actors in there...
Oh, God.
Seriously, this now?
It was awesome.
You really don't care what they think of you, do you?
No.
How do you sleep at night knowing everybody hates you?
I'm seriously asking.
Well, you realize that having them respect you is more important than having them like you.
It's a lonely business, Tom.
You can't be friends with them.
Don't think that's gonna be a problem for you and Jimmy.
That one is killing me.
He's 24 years old and he's telling me how to do my job.
Reminds me of you at that age.
Shut up.
I was not that bad.
You were worse.
Arrogant, stubborn, full of huge ideas that nobody believed in but you.
In the end, you were right.
Maybe that kid is the same.
Listen to him.
He's not your enemy.
Derek is kind of a sleazeball, isn't he?
I don't get why Karen hangs around him all the time.
Who should she be hanging around?
Jimmy?
No.
That is not what I meant.
I didn't think so.
We've all wanted things we can't have.
The trick is to learn to let go and enjoy the things that you can have.
What's up?
I started out in theaters like this.
Actually, they were worse than this.
They were the sort of theaters where the audience used to walk across the stage in the middle of the performance to go to the toilet.
But I did some of my best work in them.
I was innovative because I had to be.
You know, I got bigger jobs, more money, bigger sets.
And yes, there is a very slim possibility that you might have a point.
It's been a while since I had to think outside the box.
Thanks.
So, your show's not about scenery or props or costumes.
So what is it about?
Two people falling in love, and what gets in the way of that.
And what gets in the way of love is...
Other people.
In my experience, at least.
Great.
Well, let's show that, then.
Okay, so we're halfway through Act I.
Jesse has just heard Amanda singing a song on the radio, a song that he wrote that she stole.
But he's not angry.
He wants to see her again.
So he goes after her.
So stage right is Greenpoint, where Jesse starts out.
Stage left is L.A., where Amanda is performing her first big concert as Nina.
But the journey is tough.
There are many obstacles in the way.
Obstacles?
Thank you.
Music track, please.
I thought I was hopeless I thought I was broken
I'd struggle to laugh when the whole room was joking
I'd wait in the cold but the door wouldn't open till I
Till I heard your voice in a dream
And nothing comes easy when everyone's rushing
The signal's got speed but there's no real connection
I tried reaching out It was just my reflection till I
Till I heard your voice in a dream
So sing to me and I will forgive you for taking my heart in the suitcase you packed
Sing to me like the lights didn't blind you like you blinded me when I heard your voice in a dream
And I could have loved you but you had the hunger for life in the lights so when they called your number
I couldn't compete with the spell you were under
- Still I
- Still I
I hear your voice in my dreams
So sing to me and I will forgive you for taking my heart in the suitcase you packed
Sing to me like the lights didn't blind you like you blinded me when I heard your voice in a dream
I thought I could love you but you had the hunger
Oh, nothing comes easy when everyone's rushing
I thought I could love you I thought I could love you
Scott.
Just listen.
I can't pretend that I'm not happy that my first play was done at Lincoln Center.
But if I'm being honest,
I knew what I did hurt you.
And instead of apologizing back then,
I told myself that it wasn't really that bad.
So here I am,
15 years too late, saying I'm sorry.
Thanks.
Hey, Jules.
I heard about your split from Frank.
I remember how in love you both were.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
We're cowards.
What are you talking about?
Using that bathroom is the bravest thing I've done in weeks.
I had to make mittens out of paper towels.
I'm crazy about him.
Seeing him perform today made it so clear.
Even right now, watching him hit on that guy for Kyle has me all...
Melty.
Then tell him.
He's not into me.
Then you'll know.
And you'll cry, and you'll hate him, and then you'll move on.
At least you put yourself out there.
I'm scared.
What if I put myself out there first?
Hey, you.
Look alive.
Derek Wills, I am the one.
If I were a boy even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning and throw on what I wanted and go
I'd drink beer with the guys and chase after girls
I'd make out with who I wanted and never get busted for it 'cause they'd stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think that I'd understand
how it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her 'cause I know how it hurts
when you lose the one you wanted 'cause he's taking you for granted and everything you had got destroyed
But you're just a boy
Yeah!
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
I can't put that number in Bombshell.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I knew it.
You'd be amazing in it, and I'd love to see you do it someday, but Julia is right, the Kennedy number is better for the show...
You know, I left my job for this.
You left your job because you're unhappy.
I left my job for a lot of reasons.
And I thought you'd changed.
I thought you were finally ready for this, but you're the same old Tom, putting work before what's really important.
Where are you going?
To see if I can get my job back.
Oh, hey, I had another idea, a way to differentiate between my Marilyn and Karen's.
I thought maybe we could redo a couple of the costumes.
Yeah, I don't think so.
I was only thinking maybe one or two...
They're perfect the way they are.
We're also not going to be able to work in that break for you in Act II.
I'm sorry.
Can we at least discuss it?
We just did.
Mmm.
But your note about the catch breath, that was spot-on.
Great job.
Places, everyone, for the top.
Let's run the whole shebang.
No stopping.
How'd it go?
I cut it.
I know that was hard.
Yes, it was.
But it was also right.
Mmm-hmm.
I need you to take another pass on the Gladys scenes.
What?
I know how much they mean to you, but I need them to be a little more focused.
Take out the fat.
Okay.
By tonight.
Apparently, Eileen has a name lined up.
She's on her way here now.
I'll go start on it now.
Good.
Relax for two minutes.
I have some news.
LuPone?
No.
I want to go in a new direction.
Leigh Conroy has agreed to come out of retirement and play the part of Gladys.
Ivy's mother.
It's a good story, Tom.
The New York Times has agreed to announce it as soon as we pull the trigger.
That is, of course, unless you think Ivy might feel threatened.
Do it.
I'll make the call.
All right.
Bobby, stop texting.
Places for real.
Everyone, full out.
Don't let me see the mistakes.
I just paid $134.50 twice and a babysitter.
Congratulations.
You just became our Diva.
What?
Hey.
I'm sorry I didn't see it before.
I'll accept if you buy me another drink.
Sure thing.
Let me ask you a serious question.
Should we have one more drink?
Yeah.
I think you've had enough tonight.
Come on.
This is the first time we've been out in ages, and you've been blowing me off lately.
Yeah, I know.
Why?
Do you like me or not?
Of course I like you.
No.
I mean, do you like me?
Either of you guys want a drink?
Walk me home?
Yeah.
My pleasure.
Oh, hey, is Ana going with you?
Uh, no, I think she's taken care of.
As is Kyle.
See you at rehearsals tomorrow.
Yeah. 'Night.
Thanks for walking me home.
I can take it from here.
You sure?
You don't need an escort upstairs?
We could get another drink.
I know a spot on the corner.
I have an early rehearsal tomorrow, and the director's a control freak.
Fair enough.
Good night.
'Night.
Fine, I guess I can handle one more drink.
That was fast.
What, did you run up here?
Sync to WEB-DL by Jill.Valentine
Previously on MasterChef...
The top home cooks in America took their place in the MasterChef kitchen...
This is the kitchen of your dreams.
And it wasn't long before things got heated.
You underestimated the wrong person.
Keep cooking.
Shut your mouth.
Somebody's going home tonight.
Who is it?
Mac and cheese girl over here.
I have never hated someone so much.
The elimination tests saw some disastrous dishes.
It looks like someone pooped on the plate.
- Mm.
- This was a waste of time.
In the end...
Sorry, your time is done in MasterChef.
Sasha was the first MasterChef hopeful eliminated.
- Tonight...
- Go!
It's the first team challenge of the season...
They're children, not animals.
As the home cooks face their toughest critics yet.
My mom cooks better.
Guys, I need help.
Start putting some meatballs on or you're never gonna have it done.
I'm seriously about to lose it.
And then a pressure test turns ugly fast.
That was a bitch move.
Who will see their culinary dream come to an end?
One of you is going home.
It all happens right now on MasterChef.
It's an early start for our 18 remaining home cooks who are about to face their first MasterChef team challenge.
I'm on a bus headed to I assume a school because buses usually go to schools.
If we were to go back to high school, I was a tomboy.
Bri would be, like, the quiet one.
Eddie would be the athlete.
Howard would probably be one of the cool guys.
James would be kind of the oddball.
and Krissi would be the loudmouth.
I had more enemies than friends 'cause I never kept my mouth shut.
Our bus arrives at emperor elementary school.
As the students begin their morning studies...
The best home cooks in America are about to get a lesson of their own.
All right, guys.
18 home cooks on time and ready for class.
Let's go, guys.
Come on.
Good morning!
Morning, chef!
Welcome to your very first MasterChef team challenge.
In a couple of hours from now, you will be cooking for the most picky eaters on the planet.
Your challenge today is to provide a healthy, nutritious lunch to over 300 elementary school children.
I have never in my life cooked for large masses, let alone 301 kids.
So I'm in for a roller coaster today.
Each team is responsible for one entree and a dessert.
You'll have just 1 hour and 45 minutes to prepare and cook your lunch dishes, and then 90 minutes to serve each and every child here a delicious, healthy, nutritious meal.
One they'll actually want to eat, because they're the judges today.
The losing team will of course face, their very first pressure test where at least one of you will be expelled from MasterChef for good.
- Understood?
- Yes, chef.
Jessie and Jordan, you had the best two dishes in the last elimination test.
You will be today's team captains.
Please go stand here next to Gordon.
I rarely cook for kids.
I have one niece and two nephews, so I'm gonna pick some people that I know are gonna be a good asset for my team, especially when it comes to feeding kids.
Jessie, since you had the best dish in the elimination test, you have the huge advantage of first round draft pick.
I think I want to go with Lynn.
- Yeah!
First.
- Wow.
I pick Lynn to be on my team first, because he can plate things impeccably.
So he will oversee the final product.
Lynn, how are you feeling?
It's always a great feeling to get picked first.
That's who I was gonna pick.
He's a multitalented individual, when it comes to the kitchen.
Jordan.
This person, the experience they have working hand-in-hand with children is gonna be quite a benefit.
I'm gonna pick Savannah.
Savannah, wow.
That was my second choice.
I did want Savannah because she's a schoolteacher.
Who better to have on your team?
- I'm gonna go with Bethy.
- Bethy.
I'm gonna go with James.
Thank you, sir.
I'm goin' with Beth.
My next apron is gonna go to somebody that has a great grasp on the nutrition aspect.
- Eddie.
- Let's go, Eddie.
- I'm going with Bime.
- Bime, wow.
We winning'.
You picked the right person.
I'm gonna go with Jonny.
Jonny, welcome to the blue team.
- Natasha.
- Natasha.
I can stick my foot down as hard as she can, and I'm not scared of her, because I'm gonna show her authority and she's gonna listen to me.
So, Krissi, why don't you walk on over here?
Everybody's scared of my mouth.
Everybody thinks I'm kinda, like, gonna take over...
Let's go, you son of a bitch.
And people don't like that.
Oh, well.
- Come here, Bri.
- Bri, wow.
Adriana.
- Let's go.
- Thank you, Jordan.
You got it.
I'm gonna pick you, Luca.
Interesting.
He has a hard exterior, but he's got a soft interior.
I'm going with Howard.
Okay, last two.
You're picking both teams.
Could be smart now.
There's Malcolm and Kathy.
I can see how I can screw Jordan.
I'm gonna pick Malcolm.
Wow, wow, wow.
By taking Malcolm, he gets stuck with Kathy.
She's the weak link.
Kathy, nobody picked you.
How does that make you feel?
I don't care.
I love being underestimated, because people don't know what I'm gonna bring to them.
Like, they'll wake up eventually.
Gonna kick some ass for me?
You got it.
I have a few middle-of-the-roaders.
But everybody here can cook.
so as long as they listen to me,
I-I think we can succeed.
- Are you ready?
- Yes, chef.
Your 1 hour, 45 minute prep time starts now.
Let's go.
In this team challenge, the red and blue teams must now create a healthy menu for the elementary school students.
The meal must contain a protein, a starch, a vegetable, and a fruit.
All right, guys, veg-wise,
We've got cauliflower, green beans, corn, brussels.
No green, no green.
No greens.
Kids hate green.
- Corn.
- Okay, no green.
So corn is sounding good, right?
I'm depending on my teammates that know what kids like.
They all said their kids don't touch greenery, so we wanted corn.
We didn't want green beans and broccoli.
If we did chicken, like, teriyaki, it could be all cooked, and you have it in the sauce, so it's hot.
We're cooking for kids.
We're not cooking for us.
Right, we'll make it super simple, rice and chicken.
All right, go ahead.
Go...
Whatever it is.
A fruit dessert.
Let's do strawberries.
Kids like strawberries.
All right.
We know what we want.
Despite some objections, red team captain Jessie has decided to go with chicken teriyaki, corn, and a strawberry crumble for their kids' lunch menu.
While on the blue team, our home cooks head in a more conventional direction.
- Pasta, pasta.
- Yeah, we have pasta.
Why don't we do turkey meatball?
- We got whole tomatoes?
- Yeah, we got whole tomatoes.
Whole tomatoes.
I'll...
I'll make a marinara.
We got green beans.
You think we can make green beans work?
Definitely, definitely.
- We need some sort of fruit.
- We got apples?
Yeah, we got Granny Smith.
I'll make a apple crisp.
I think it's straightforward.
Spaghetti and meatball menu is gonna be awesome for kids.
One, two, three.
Blue team!
Blue team quickly agrees on their lunch menu:
Turkey meatballs and pasta with green beans and an apple crisp for dessert.
But Gordon has some concerns.
Well, the execution of this with 300 kids is just paramount.
How many meatballs per portion?
We'll probably be right-- right around two.
- If it's gonna be short, we'll...
- Two golf balls.
So two balls?
So that's...
that's literally 600.
- You got it.
- Wow.
- Good luck.
- You got it.
Thank you, sir.
Jordan and the blue team picked meatballs in a marinara sauce.
- Classic.
- Smart.
So kids are gonna see that, recognize the color.
Beautiful red.
It's something that they've had numerous times before.
Yeah.
So red team's menu.
Jessie's selected chicken teriyaki.
At that age, they eat with their eyes.
So you're gonna see a dark piece of chicken with a dark sauce on there.
Could be a bit of a turn-off.
The selection of meatball versus chicken teriyaki, there's no doubt in my mind that I'm going meatballs.
Blue team's menu may sound better.
But you've got a lot of prep involved.
- 600 meatballs.
- 600 meatballs they're gonna make?
- 600 meatballs, 2 each.
- Oh, my god.
So right now, I don't know.
It's neck and neck.
Guys, 50 minutes left!
Less than 1 hour to cook for 300 elementary school students.
Be careful.
Don't over-mix it.
While the blue team continues to season their meatballs, the red team has already started searing their chicken, but Joe and Graham notice a serious problem.
Hey, listen, if you keep on moving that chicken around so much, you're gonna basically just boil it.
You want it to get some caramelization on it.
You see this much steam?
That's just all water coming out, and that's cooking it all the way around.
So you want less on that grill and more evenly distributed.
Jessie, do you see what's going on over here?
On, like, one side, there's, like, 1,000 pounds of chicken.
Over here, there's a whole flattop warming a pan of corn.
I've got Malcolm and Lynn handling the meat.
There's a whole work surface and all the chicken's in one pile.
So it's not cooking right.
Jessie, you've got to take control here because this is gonna be boiled chicken.
So the boys acted like they hadn't cooked chicken before, which made me really nervous.
As Jessie gets the red team back on track, the judges discover an even more pressing issue on the blue team.
Guys, you just started making meatballs?
10 more trays like that to get to 300 meatballs.
20 more to get to 600 meatballs.
We're gonna be cuttin' it close.
All the time it's taken us making all these meatballs is just [bleep] stupid.
Someone start putting some meatballs on this flattop or you're never gonna have it done.
- Jordan?
- Yeah?
Step it up, get your team together and step it up now.
Everybody.
With just 30 minutes remaining until lunch service, the blue team led by captain Jordan is scrambling to prep and cook over 600 meatballs for 300-plus elementary school students.
What I'm trying to do is get your head in the game.
- so there's 50 meatballs.
- Right.
You're still minus 550.
You need to start diverting, and someone step up and take responsibility.
- No way it's gonna work.
- Nowhere near it.
But no one seems to care about it, so...
We're gonna have to change our game plan.
What do you wanna do?
What do you wanna do?
It makes me nervous to change.
However, I know this is such an easier approach.
You guys, we're doin' 'em.
Hey, we're just gonna do a meat sauce.
Don't even... hey, you don't need to roll 'em anymore.
No more rolling.
We're done rolling.
- All right.
- Just chop it up.
While the blue team rushes to turn their meatballs into meat sauce, the red team is struggling with the seasoning for their chicken teriyaki.
Have you tasted it, Jessie?
The teriyaki sauce?
I did, it's too salty, and they're working on it, and they're thickening it.
That's it?
Why is it so watery?
Because we had to add more water, 'cause it was too salty.
But surely you put fruit in there for kids like pineapple, or, you know, some ketchup in there, or something.
We could.
We could.
It's for kids, right?
It's not... it's not adult teriyaki, right?
So I'm just trying to make it a little bit more sweeter, yeah.
Pineapple would probably go good.
I'll go look to see if we have that.
Jessie, just taste that.
There's no season in anything.
They're children, not animals.
No, but this is not seasoned yet.
We're gonna season it when we mix it with the kettle.
Why wouldn't they put the vegetables in the beginning so the veg and the rice cook at the same time?
Cooking vegetables separate?
Adding them to rice?
I mean, this is insane.
With not long to go before lunch service,
Gordon checks in on the elementary school students to assess their food preferences.
Will they favor the blue team's pasta and meat sauce or the red team's chicken teriyaki?
So I want to ask a few questions about the food.
Who likes turkey?
Hmm.
Who likes spaghetti?
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh.
- Who likes chicken?
- Yeah.
Here we go.
Who likes chicken teriyaki?
No.
- I never tried it.
- Oh, dear.
- I need more sauce.
- Okay, it's right here.
- Yeah, it's good, right?
- Hey, we're good.
I think it's good.
I think we were able to fix the teriyaki sauce, after, you know, adding ten extra ingredients, and thickening it up, and I finally feel like we have a really good sauce.
With under five minutes to go before service, red team has started plating...
Come on, we need more rice.
We need more rice.
While the blue team hasn't finished one of their sides.
James, I need that salad up here asap.
We need to start plating it.
I've got a pot full of green beans.
It's not boiling.
These kids are gonna be here.
It's just not getting hot.
Like, I don't know what to do.
Red team, blue team, one minute to go.
Bean salad!
I need it asap!
25 seconds.
They're barely cooked, but hey, we got to serve the green beans anyway, regardless of how cooked they are.
Give it to me.
Go.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one,
Let's go.
There come the kids.
Come on, guys!
The kids are comin'!
Oh, my god.
They are so loud.
Holy [bleep].
I look up, and I see a sea of kids.
And I'm, like, "oh, gosh, this is gonna be painful."
These kids are coming like a flood right now, man, like a tsunami.
This is my nightmare.
This is the day I die.
Boys and girls, are you hungry?
Yeah!
- Let's go, guys.
- Hi, buddy!
Oh, my god, look at how cute you are!
The teams now have just 1 hour to serve lunch to 301 picky elementary school children.
The students will taste both teams' dishes and then vote for their favorite.
You are so cute!
I need more plates.
I need more plates.
The blue team is serving pasta and meat sauce with green beans and an apple crisp.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
You're welcome, sir.
The red team is serving chicken teriyaki and rice with corn and a strawberry crumble.
I need some plates, please!
I don't know what they were doing behind me.
Just give me plates.
What is the problem?
I need plates!
Krissi's got nothing to serve.
No coordination.
No one knows what they're doing.
Come on, Jordan.
Take control, man.
Jordan is pretty much frazzled.
We're all just trying to move as quick as possible to put everything on the plate for these kids.
Let me just give you some ice cream, okay?
Oh, my god.
Guys, I need help.
As both teams fight to keep up with the endless lunch line,
Joe heads out to the students to see whose food is getting the best grades.
Did you get to try both food of the red team and the blue team?
- What did you like better?
- I like the blue team better.
You like the blue team better?
Vote blue team!
Vote blue team!
- Who are you gonna vote for?
- Red.
- Red?
- There you are.
I really don't like the blue team's green beans.
They're hard.
I know.
They're not cooked.
The blue team's green beans bent my fork.
You like red better?
Why?
Chicken is like barbecue chicken.
It's like barbecue.
so it's a little sweet?
- Yeah.
- You like that?
I got a lot of really good feedback on the chicken, which is surprising for me because I thought it would be more...
more salty.
And instead, they made it sweet, which was smart.
And then there's people who just love pasta, and they're going for the pasta.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
So it's either one or the other.
It's really a toss-up.
Gotta hit me faster.
It's more than halfway through service, and while the blue team's start was unsteady, they have managed to keep up the pace...
- Come on, guys.
- Come on!
But on the red team, service is beginning to fall apart.
Come on, we need just rice on a plate.
Rice on a plate, that's all that matters right now, Bethy.
The kids just never quit coming.
I don't know where they're coming from, but they're just comin' in like a herd of sheep.
Dessert behind.
I'm a dessert behind.
I'm a dessert...
I'm two desserts behind.
Three desserts behind.
The kids come faster than we're ready for them.
and I see empty plates.
and I'm furious because these empty plates
Mean they can't vote for us.
We need hands now!
Jessie!
Get organized here, guys.
What team do you love?
Blue!
Yeah!
It's the final moments of the first MasterChef team challenge.
Not only do our home cooks have 301 mouths to feed, but they have to ensure the kids get high-quality food on every plate.
- Thank you.
- You are very welcome.
While the blue team led by captain Jordan has successfully served lunch to all their students, the red team led by captain Jessie has missed several plates.
I don't want any more plates missed, fellas.
Every plate has to have food on it or it doesn't get counted.
If those kids don't have our plate, that's kids not trying our food.
That's losing votes, basically.
So, red team, I don't think the teriyaki was the right move.
However, it...
it's pretty decent.
But their dessert is outstanding.
- What do you think?
- It's hard.
It's really hard because I would choose the pasta over the rice and chicken teriyaki.
However, the veggies...
the corn over on red
I think totally smokes the blue.
I thought the chicken was a bit of a risk.
They executed it.
They fixed it.
It was too salty.
They made it sweet.
I'm all for the red team on this challenge.
Although the judges favor the red team's menu, it will be the children's votes that will determine the winner.
Who liked the red team's dish?
One, two.
Who liked the blue team's dish?
Uh-oh, blue's a big winner on this table.
Red team, blue team, your last child is coming through.
Here you go.
Enjoy.
Vote blue team, buddy.
All right!
Ho...
Oh!
Red team, blue team,
Well done.
Congratulations.
Hey, you guys, I saw a lot of full red plates.
I'm feeling good.
I'm happy.
We served every kid and I think we came out and did what we wanted to do.
Boys and girls, please gather around by the side of the bus.
It's, like, impossible to call.
I can't tell if, like, we slaughtered it or if we bombed it because our fate's in their little, tiny, creepy hands.
Let's go, guys.
The students gather to vote for their favorite team.
Will they choose blue team's pasta and meat sauce menu or the red team's chicken teriyaki and rice?
Boys and girls, you are now the MasterChef judges.
On the count of three,
I'm gonna ask you to run into the square that cooked your favorite food for lunch.
Was it the red team or the blue team?
Come on.
Come on.
Whoo!
Come on over!
Are you all ready to vote?
On the count of three.
One, two, three!
Come on, come on, come on!
Come on, guys!
Yeah, over here!
Red team!
Red team!
Whoo!
Stay where you are.
We're gonna have to take a count.
I'm feeling a little nervous.
I can't tell who has more kids on their side and that's scary.
When I look over to the side, I'm like, "oh, my god."
There's just the same amount or maybe more on their side.
Now, the nerves are starting to kick in, man.
It's just, like, this could be anybody's game.
Okay, boys and girls,
We have the official verdict.
One team scored 58% of the votes and the other team scored 42%.
The winning team...
Is...
Red team!
Whoo!
Thank you!
This has been, like, the best week ever for me.
I got to be team captain.
We had a great team.
Everyone performed so well, and we won.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Oh, my god.
Yeah!
Blue team, you now face the pressure test where minimum one of you will be leaving the MasterChef competition.
Red team wins.
We know now we have to go into a pressure test and I'm super pissed off.
Somebody's gonna go home on this, so the pressure's on.
[bleep] this.
Seriously, [bleep] this.
I'm not surprised that we lost.
Jordan frazzled everybody.
and it was just...
it was a [bleep] show, a complete [bleep] show from start to finish.
I'm...
I'm seriously about to lose my [bleep].
The winners, this way.
Ooh, pressure test.
One of us is outta here.
You.
It's definitely not gonna be me.
The majority of my team is definitely disappointed.
We're all against each other again.
I'd like to chop somebody's head off for going into this pressure test.
No names.
Wrong captain.
If there's one person to blame for this loss, it's Jordan.
It was just bad leadership.
I came into this competition to win and whatever this pressure test is,
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to win.
Yesterday, you competed in your first team challenge, feeding 300 elementary school kids.
The red team, led by Jessie, are safe.
None of you will be facing this extraordinary pressure test.
- Great job.
- Thank you so much.
Unfortunately, Jordan, you and your team failed to make the grade.
Therefore, you are about to face a dreaded pressure test, where at least one of you will be going home.
Jordan, what do you think happened?
I think our inexperience serving large crowds surfaced its ugly head and we had to think on our feet.
We ended up changing it up.
And I know that screwed us in the end.
We or you?
Because certain people were delivering throughout, like Krissi and her vision on the sauce.
Howard made almost 200 meatballs and then there was everyone else, who was looking for your direction.
Listen carefully.
Here's the good news.
There are nine home cooks in front of us, but just six of you will compete in this pressure test.
Damn.
And the person who will choose who is safe...
Is...
Listen carefully.
Here's the good news.
There are nine home cooks in front of us, but just six of you will compete in this pressure test.
Damn.
And the person who will choose who is safe...
Is...
Is you, Jordan,
- The team captain.
- Oh!
Who do you honestly think did well enough to be saved from tonight's pressure test?
The first name is someone that executed well yesterday.
But it's also somebody that I think
I can beat farther on down the road.
I'm gonna save Howard.
Howard.
Well done.
Head upstairs to the gallery.
Thank you.
Jordan absolutely made the best decision by saving me because, yeah, I made a few mistakes in the kitchen, but, like, I'm a badass when it comes to, like, making sure that mission is completed.
As your second choice, who are you saving from elimination?
This is somebody that helped me out a lot yesterday.
It's also somebody I don't want to face in a pressure test.
I'm gonna save James.
James.
Off you go.
Jordan, you have one more save left.
But before you make your choice, let me tell you something.
As team captain, you can choose to save yourself.
Oh.
I think when it comes down to it, this is a competition, so I'm gonna take it for myself.
Please go upstairs.
Krissi, give me your insight.
Listen, honor is honor.
That was a bitch move.
In my neighborhood, that'd get your ass kicked.
Captain goes down with the ship.
I think it's stupid to not save yourself.
You're gonna "go down with your ship"?
Well, I'm not a [bleep] captain of a ship.
I'm a captain of a team that is no longer a team.
Okay.
Are you ready to find out the dish that will determine your MasterChef future?
Cheesecake.
I've never made cheesecake.
I don't even like cheesecake.
I've baked enough cheesecakes that I'm feeling good.
So I think I'm the safest at this point.
Let's be honest.
That is a true American classic.
The perfect balance between flavor and texture.
Absolutely unique, but one mistake with your techniques, and the whole thing can become a total disaster.
Please head to your stations.
At your stations, you all have identical ingredients.
There's also a limited pantry in case you want your cheesecake to stand out from the pack.
You have just 90 minutes to prepare, bake, chill, and garnish one amazing cheesecake that will save you from elimination.
Your 90 minutes starts...
Now.
Good luck.
Who do you think's gonna shine?
Who's gonna fall?
I'm expecting a lot from Krissi and Savannah.
Experienced bakers.
Kathy, I'm not sure about.
I think Jonny is out of his depth.
I'm afraid that Eddie does not have the technical skills to execute this cake.
- Medic.
- Adriana's already cut herself.
How can you cut yourself making a cheesecake?
Making a cheesecake?
So the secret behind a great cheesecake is in the base.
When your base is solid, your mixture's solid.
First of all, start the base, get the base into the fridge, set it.
Sugar, eggs, whisk and then lightly break down the cheese and incorporate that.
What do you think that they're gonna have 'em in the oven for?
40 minutes?
45 minutes?
Yeah, 45, 45, 50 minutes.
But if you take that out one minute too early, it's gonna sink with a huge, almost like a massive hole in the middle.
So this is all about that jeopardy.
Right, Kathy.
What are you doing in there?
I'm making a berry compote.
Waiting for the berries to burst.
Mm-hmm, in just an hour from now, you could be leaving the competition.
Yeah, you're right.
Cheesecake's in the oven?
Cheesecake's in the oven.
All of you by now should have your cheesecakes in the oven.
Start thinking about the topping and how well the topping blends with the texture of your cheesecake.
Savannah, dessert's quite a strong point for you.
- Mm-hmm.
- Confident?
Definitely, I'm gonna make a salted caramel cheesecake.
So you're gonna ripple the actual cheesecake with a salted caramel?
The caramel's gonna go on top.
Have you got what it takes to stay in this competition?
Absolutely.
Adriana.
So I have my cheesecake in the oven and here, I have some guava paste and some mangoes.
- Guava paste?
- Yes.
- You feel confident today?
- I do.
I'm...
I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but cheesecake is something I actually love.
Great.
Ladies and gentlemen, 20 minutes to go.
A simple cheesecake will determine your MasterChef future.
What the hell?
I'm noticing my oven is smoking.
Something's burning.
What's burning?
I cannot believe this just happened.
I'm goin' home.
Like, I'm done.
Like, I'm just gonna go ahead and pack my bags and go home.
Something's burning.
What's burning?
What the hell?
I got a broke pan that's dripping out the bottom.
My cheesecake is dripping from the bottom.
Something's wrong with my pan, so it's leaking.
I take my cheesecake out of the oven.
I take aluminum foil and place it underneath my pan, and it finally stops dripping.
If I can get my cheesecake to start cooking quicker,
Everything will solidify so that there's nothing to leak out.
Coming up to two minutes to go.
Come on.
Show some flair.
Oh, badass.
Jonny, I'm worried about.
You know slices of pineapple don't sit well on top of a cheesecake.
- You'll never cut it.
- No.
Kathy... she made a fruit compote that looks like restaurant quality.
Adriana used canned guava paste.
Guave paste in a cheesecake?
Come on.
Here we are.
Enhance those finishing touches.
Five, four, three, two, one, and stop, guys.
Well done.
Now, it's time to taste
Those amazing-looking cheesecakes and find out who has just cooked their last dish.
Let's start off with Krissi.
Let's go, please.
Yeah, I see Krissi's dish and I think her plating's like her... clunky.
- Oh, Krissi.
- My cheesecake fell.
It's not the most beautiful cake.
No.
And what is...
what are these round things?
Those are...
those are raspberry bombs.
That's a good-looking cheesecake.
You see, had this stayed up another inch,
We would have had the perfect specimen.
This cheesecake has a lightness and a restraint to it.
It's beautiful.
The crust is nice and thin.
This is very fluffy, light, flavorful,
Delicious.
You keep giving me food that I'm used to eating at home.
Thank you.
Very rich.
Very creamy.
The raspberry, it's not cloying and heavy.
It just provides a nice, little pop of acidity.
- Thank you.
- Great job.
Now that's as good as it gets.
You've got the base exactly the way it should be.
Look at the shiny texture of the filling.
It's got class.
I mean, real class.
You're a force to be reckoned with, because it tastes absolutely sublime.
- Thank you.
- Good job.
Thank you.
Listen, if you're not scared of me, you should be 'cause I can cook.
Jonny, please bring your cheesecake forward.
it's a pineapple foster topping with a toasted coconut and a raspberry blood orange whipped cream.
So for me, as a New Yorker, when I want a cheesecake,
I want a cheesecake that's thick.
You're a man of adventurous flavors,
But this is like a lumberjack trying to do a pirouette.
It's all crust.
The cheesecake part of the cheesecake has a good flavor.
The pineapples don't really make sense.
They're very fibrous.
They kind of contrast the texture, which I don't like.
You might have missed the spirit of this cheesecake.
Okay, Kathy.
Let's go, please.
Uh, just a regular cheesecake.
On the top, I did a blueberry, blackberry compote.
The topping's great.
What really makes that cheesecake sing is the lemon.
Overall, a cheesecake that asks you to come back and try some more.
Thank you.
Eddie.
it's a vanilla bean cheesecake with a mixed berry compote on top.
Huh.
So what's the problem there?
- Did you cook the berries down?
- I cooked them down.
So they're bleeding now.
So before you put that on top of your cheesecake, then you need to drain that.
- Yeah, it's delicious.
- Thank you.
Had you just drained that fruit first, for me, that would have been a ten out of ten.
However, it's a bloody good effort, let me tell you.
I appreciate it.
All right, Savannah, please come forward.
You know, Savannah bakes.
That's what Savannah does.
But I'm looking at Savannah's cheesecake, and she might be in a little bit of trouble here.
It's a salted caramel cheesecake with a hazelnut almond Brittle and a honey whipped cream.
So almost half of that cheesecake is the base.
You almost don't even taste the actual cheesecake part.
This topping here, it's like maple candy.
It's poor execution.
The flavor isn't there.
Someone's going home, and you're in that mix right now.
It seems like you made this cake to try and help Jonny stay in the competition.
Try.
Now, honestly, what do you think of that cake?
It's too sweet, and the crust is too thick.
You think this cake should save your spot in the MasterChef kitchen?
I know that I didn't execute it, but I would like to stay.
Unfortunately, we're not here to make you happy.
We're here to find the next MasterChef.
You think this cake should save your spot in the MasterChef kitchen?
I know that I didn't execute it, but I would like to stay.
Unfortunately, we're not here to make you happy.
We're here to find the next MasterChef.
Last up, Adriana, please.
Let's go.
It is a mango guava cheesecake.
It looks like a Victoria sponge.
It looks like a tart, not a cake.
And guava.
I saw a can of...
was it guava paste?
- It was guava paste.
- So it wasn't even fresh fruit?
No.
My big problem is the guava.
If it was a process plant and we're looking for 10,000 cheesecakes,
I'd use something canned.
But there's something really weird about canned guava.
What a shame.
The guava, mango all cooked down, it doesn't have that huge tropical flavor.
and the coconut on top really doesn't add anything except a little bit of chew 'cause it's un-toasted.
I wanted to do something different.
I didn't want to go too homey.
Yeah.
I admire that.
I just don't think it went the way that you wanted.
Okay.
The crust is like sand.
Secondly, the topping has no relevance to the cake and this cake might have just bought Savannah another day here in the MasterChef kitchen.
Okay, all of you, please step forward.
Tough pressure test.
We asked for one of the most classic desserts anywhere in the world:
a stunning cheesecake.
Okay.
Eddie, Krissi, Kathy, step forward, please.
You three really came up with a stunning cheesecake.
Thank you, chef.
Congratulations.
You're all safe.
Join to the gallery.
Well done.
Great job.
Jonny, the topping was nowhere near MasterChef quality.
The filling...
You nailed.
You're safe.
Frankly, I'm shocked.
I can't believe I'm still here.
Ladies, that was a very tough pressure test.
I think it's gonna be Savannah that's going home, and it's because Savannah's cake was even smaller than mine and the fact that I have sweetness, tartness is going to save me.
Here's the sad news.
We've seen great things from both of you and this has been a very, very difficult decision.
I'm honestly thinking that I'm going home and I just...
I'm not ready to go home yet.
Adriana...
Your time is done in MasterChef.
Savannah, upstairs, please.
You dodged that bullet.
Adriana...
Whilst you grew up with guava, using them on top of a cheesecake, you have to be very, very careful.
You should be proud.
You should be super excited with what you've been able to do.
I'm definitely proud.
Continue that dream.
I will.
Adriana, thank you.
Please take off your apron and leave the MasterChef kitchen.
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you.
Good night.
I don't know exactly where I'm going from here.
I just know that I'm not going to let this defeat me, so this is just the beginning.
Go for it.
Praise the Lord.

Guys. 9N5-.
I have an announcement to make.
- What?
What are you talking about?
As all of you know.
I and Sneha came to this place 15 years ago for the first time.
You remember?
- Of course.
I had bought a teddy bear for Sneha.
We were 8 years old.
That teddy bear costed me 1000 bucks.
And Sneha lost the teddy bear here.
Really?
- So she had robbed for the first time here.
Second time.
We were in college.
We came here just for the sake of it.
Ice cream.
- Ma'am sent me to get an ice cream.
I ran for a kilometer.
I got ajolt again.
Third time it was her birthday.
I bought a dress for her which didn't fit her.
So mean.
That was years ago, Saahil.
Today she has given me yet another shock.
Shock worth millions.
What?
- What do you mean?
What?
- Yes.
What?
Sam.
Saahil.
Oh God!
Sneha, will you marry me?
Yes.
Yes.
Sneha has agreed.
Oh God.
O God.
Sweetheart, love is such a sweet thing.
Love is a source of life.
On an obscure picture, love is a change.

Not on me.
Okay.
We are buddies.
We are friends.
Come on.
You need not hide it from me.
Let's go.
Two beers.
- Okay, sir.
Brother, I am telling the truth.
I have never even looked at another girl.
So you are saying you have not done anything"
...with any other girl apart from Sneha.
I haven't done anything with Sneha either.
We are waiting for our marriage.
It means you haven't done anything with any girl to this day.
No.
Oh.
Now I get it.
-What?
But you shouldn't ruin Sneha's life like this.
I understand that you like boys over girls.
That's okay.
It's legal now.
Not a problem.
Brother, please.
What are you saying?
I am not interested in boys whatsoever.
I'm perfectly straight.
Absolutely normal.
Normal.
Straight.
My foot.
You haven't done anything with the one you girl you have.
You haven't done anything with any girl.
You call yourself normal.
You are not my brother.
Someone must have swapped you in the hospital.
Here is your beer.
- To hell with your beer.
I need whisky now.
Enjoyed?
- A lot.
Hen's party is the one you should enjoy.
I know.
Dance, song.
Wedding.
You know that I am not interested in all of that.
We should have a hen's party.
It's been six years to your marriage.
Have kids at least now.
One has kids only once the honeymoon is over.
Correct.
Our honeymoon is still going strong.
Naughty-
Okay.
Listen, I have fixed the hotel and menu.
At her behest.
Have a check.
- Sure.
Come.
- Alright.
Champ.
- Hi uncle.
Rockstar uncle.
What's up with Saahil?
He hasn't done anything with girl till date.
Is he gay?
No.
Thankfully he isn't gay.
He is like I will do it after marriage and not before marriage.
And all that.
Look, you are my disciple.
You won't give up so easily.
Keep at it.
Uncle, I'll fix this celibate at any cost.
Stay away from girls.
Okay.
This advice at this age of mine.
Does it sound nice?
Bye, Saahil.
You can shut the bar.
Your astrologer's prediction is going to come true..
...because this marriage of yours is going to break.
You will have to remarry.
You are drunk.
I am not drunk.
But when you come to your senses you'll know.
What's problem in loving one single girl?
I mean you had told me.
And you are with sister-in-law since so long.
I don't know why you are telling me these things.
It's your accountant.
Bye Saahil.
Veena, my baby.
How are you?
I love you too.
No.
I am a little busy with the wedding.
Yes.
Yes.
She is here.
I'll meet.
I'll meet.
Once I am free.
Champ.
Why aren't you answering my call?
I don't want to talk to you, brother.
You are cheating on sister-in-law.
You could be like this"
- Could be.
Be realistic.
This is how God has made us.
You must have heard the saying.
All men are dogs.
Yes, I have.
This is the biggest truth.
Dude, we are dogs.
Trust me.
There is cheating in our hormones.
Don't..don't justify yourself, brother.
Please.
It is the truth.
You have heard this.
A king has 20 queens.
Have you heard that a queen has 20 kings?
That doesn't happen.
Not possible.
Actually a man gets bored being with just one woman.
A woman doesn't get bored.
And when a man gets bored his hormones start attacking him.
His frustration increases.
And his takes his frustration out on his wife and kids.
They start fighting and come to blows.
And finally they get divorced.
Understand.
So the moral of the story is..
...to have a happily married life, you must cheat on your wife.
Brother, why are you telling me all this now?
I am about to get married.
I am saving your marriage.
My friend.
Brother, I am not interested in your hormones and hormonal theory.
Can you please keep your hormones to yourself?
Son, don't ever underestimate hormones.
Let alone humans.
Hormones haven't spared even Gods.
For example Lord Rama.
- What?
Lord Rama was the ideal man, brother.
He loved Mother Sita all his life.
Correct.
You are right.
Hormones didn't stop hounding Him.
He had to assume Krishna's avatar to satisfy them.
I got you, baby.
I got you.
I'm sorry.
Did I disturb?
- Not at all.
I was explaining to him how to be a good husband.
Teach him well, brother-in-law.
I want him just like you.
I will make him just like me.
- Really?
I was looking for sister.
Where is she?
She must be talking to her tailor.
Okay.
I'll go find her.
See you.
See you.
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.
So sweet.
You'll ruin the life of such a sweet girl.
You know that?
Selfish man.
I am selfish?
You are unbelievable.
Please go from here.
I don't want to talk to you.
I'll go away.
But you'll remember me when your hormones start to kick in.
Okay.
Go.
Just go.
- Hormones.
When they kick in you'll realise.
- Okay.
Do you remember?
I was telling you about this book.
It is called before the heart attacks.
Have you read it?
No.
-You haven't?
You really have to.
You know.
75% men cheat on their women..
...In the first week of their marriage.
Can you imagine that?
I was so shocked.
Saahil.
Saahil.
-What?
Are you okay?
- Yes.
Of course.
Anyway, I was telling you that..
Saahil.
Saahil.
- No.
Just like that.
Saahil.
Saahil, lam talking to you, right?
You seem lost.
Saahil.
Saahil.
Are you alright?
Are you sure?
Yes, of course.
I am fine.
I am fine.
- Are you alright?
Absolutely fine.
Darling, let's go home.
I think you'll be much better.
'Hormones.
When they kick in you'll realise.'
Sir, your sex on the beach.
Saahil, what's wrong with you?
I ordered it.
What are you doing?
I am feeling really hot.
I am just going into the pool for a dip.
Saahil, where are you going?
Careful, Saahil.
Oh God.
'But you'll remember me when your hormones start to kick in.'
What are you doing?
Saahil.
Let go of decency.
Let go of all inhibitions.
Let go of decency.
Let go of all inhibitions.
There is beauty all around.
The world is full of beauties.
Let go of control.
Do something indecent.

Brother.
Hole three, sir?
- Yes.
Sir.
Come on.
Behind every successful man there is a woman.
Come.
That's true.
If you get such success from one single girl..
"Then how much success will you get from loads of girls.
Brother, even if I agree with you for once..
"But what if Sneha comes to know of that.
What I am about to tell you is a really big secret.
Okay?
We men have it hidden deep in our hearts.
Okay.
It's like a code.
Alright?
Brotherhood.
- Brotherhood?
Right.
Brotherhood.
- Brotherhood.
We men have hidden this secret in our hearts since ages.
You understand.
The great saint guru flirt had written this.
Guru flirt.
What nonsense.
Stop kidding.
Take his name with respect.
Call him the great saint guru flirt.
What is wrong with you, man?
Guru flirt wrote a rule book.
In it was mentioned how we men should cheat on women.
If we men get to know of these rules..
...then these women can do us no harm.
I'll tell you that.
You know that.
And I'll teach you all these rules.
But remember.
With great powers comes greater responsibility.
Now guru flirt has become spider man.
Superheroes don't marry.
Got it?
Spiderman.
Batman.
And even Hanuman didn't marry.
Guru flirt was a rock star.
But I must tell you that it's not easy.
All this is not that easy.
Sir.
- Thank you.
The best lose in this game.
Brother, I am nervous.
Tell me the first rule.
Let me tell you some experiences of my life..
...before telling you the rule.
- Okay.
It's been like a few years to me and Nammo's marriage.
Go to office.
- I hate working.
Bye-bye.
As you guys are aware that this year has been really nice.
I think we have done a great job.
Congratulations to all of you and I think we should..
Tell me now.
Tell me now.
Excuse me.
Hi baby.
Sure.
Why not?
Okay.
Bye.
You say something.
So.. my wife.
God, don't ever change our lives.
I wish we spend every day like this.
Right.
Oh God.
I love you so much.
- Love you too.
I need a detailed report of the..
Okay.
I need a detailed report of the U.K consignment.
And I want you to check out on the Hyderabad and Chennai offices.
God, don't ever change our lives.
I wish we spend every day like this.
Right.
Good night, baby.
Good night.
Listen, I don't have time for dinner.
We'll go when I have the time.
Yes, right.
I have been hearing since quite a few years now.
Don't give me this deprived wife nonsense.
Okay.
Don't.
You know, Veena.
I don't feel like going home these days.
So don't go.
Relax here today.
No, it's not that.
I don't feel like going home every day.
Life has become really monotonous.
Really.
It's like life has become really boring.
There's absolutely no excitement in my life.
This?
- This is a B-cup size.
Hey baby.
- Where are you?
I'm in the office.
Why?
What happened?
Really.
I was missing you.
I love you for that.
Okay, listen.
I'm in a meeting.
Little busy.
So I'll catch you later.
Okay?
I love you, baby.
Bye.
Show me.

I am showing.
I mean I can't wait.
Take off your clothes.
Take off your clothes.
Wait.
Fine.
Fine.
Okay.
Oh my God!
That is so good.
Oh God!
I just..
You know it is so hot.
How dare you?
Cheat.
I'm sorry.
I doubted you.
It's okay.
Well done.
You did it perfectly.
Okay.
Also put an earring that goes with it.
I love you.
And I am extremely sorry.
Stop.
You mean you had planned all this?
Yes.
Guilt.
Guilt is a man's biggest enemy.
Half of the people get caught because of guilt.
So the first rule.
You know when you cheat on your wife.
You get a guilty feeling.
Give this feeling to your wife..
...before we feel it.
Make her feel guilty.
Since that day your sister-in-law has never doubted me..
...even by mistake.
I am good.
I am so..
- Brother.

No energy drink can cure him.

I am about to tell you the second rule.
Once you know this, you'll understand everything.
The second rule is actually a tribute to him.

They are nice.
Keep quiet.
Help me find it.
Come on.
Darn it.
- Find it.
It must be here somewhere.
Have you hidden it?
What am I going to do with your bra?
I can't find it.
Were you wearing a bra?
Hey..
What kind of a woman do you think I am?
Tell me something.
Where is..bra..
Why are you getting worried?
Its price is just 60 rupees.
To hell with 60 rupees.
If my wife finds your bra, she'll cut me into 60 pieces.
So tell her that it's hers.
Right.
Don't irrigate me.
Come on.
Find the bra.
Then what happened?
That bra is still missing.
Uncle is living in the fear that the bra will be found anytime.
But the bra couldn't be found.

This is why I don't believe in arranged marriages.
Are you hiding something?
No.
Not at all.

You know.
I won't leave you till you tell me.
So tell me.

What?
- Her nose.
She can sniff everything.
Do you know what's more dangerous than nose?

The power that a woman has to sniff another woman.
That's why you should buy the strongest, most concentrated.

So that your wife can never sniff your mistress.

Why do they show echo in Hindi films?
WOW!
I feel alive again.
WOW!
What happened to you?
Do you know?
Mom and dad had a love marriage.
Really?
Seeing them, you can't guess.
Hey.
What happened?
I was kidding.
Saahil, since childhood I have seen my parents fighting.
I always felt their marriage is a big mistake.
But today, when I found out that they were also like us..
...I mean, at some point even they were this much in love.
I am really worried.
We won't be like them, right?
Look.
For me we got married 15 years ago.
We are just being official.
Right?
And not much has changed in these 15 years.
I don't even remember any serious fight between us.
Yes.
You have hit me 5-6 times.
I don't know if we can call that a fight.
The seventh time.
I promise you.
No matter what happens.
We will never change.
Promise?
I hate drop outs.
I hate people who drop out of their course.
It's the insult of brotherhood.
I mean..
- You can say whatever you want.
I can't deceive Sneha.
You don't know what she is going through.
-I know.
I know.
Her parents used to fight, right?
That has to happen, obviously.
Her father is also like you.
Very straight.
Didn't listen to hormones.
He is regretting.
I don't want your children to have..
...the same childhood that Sneha had.
Shravan.
- What happened?
The same thing that had to happen.
As usual uncle Surya is late.
His flight has been delayed by an hour.
Uncle Surya has this habit of coming late.
Very soon late will be affixed to his name.
An hour.
Come on.
Let's have drinks.
In the afternoon.
There is no fixed time for drinking.
Come on.
What to explain?
I have to explain how to control your wife..
...how to handle her.
Look at this.
You are teaching me?
If I start practicing now, I will learn by then.
See this.
This is called a dedicated student.
Teach him.
Is it his marriage or your marriage?
Shut up.
I don't know why I married you.
Foolish jerk!
This..this is men's plight after marriage.
Can I join you?
No.
I am sorry, ma'am.
It's taken.
Come on.
Trust me.
You won't regret it.
Look, ma'am.
I am not interested.
And I told you.
It's already taken.
Damn!
Did you see, brother?
Not everyone is like you.
He fought with his wife.
But he is still loyal.
Baby, I missed you so much.
Hello!
What took you so long?
- You know the Delhi traffic.
Sonny, it doesn't matter to hormones..
"Whether it's a man or a woman.
Got it?
People like you do discrimination in the society.
Got it?
I love hormones.
Naughty-
What happened?
Brother, I am tense.
Tell me the next rule quickly.
The next rule.
Truth always triumphs.
Truth always triumphs.
If you ever make a blunder in life, tell your wife the truth.

You are marrying.
Aunt has not come?

She is coming.

Congratulations.
Where did you disappear, leaving me alone?
I was searching for you.
I see.
I came out and was flirting with a tall, fair, beautiful.
...foreigner air-hostess.
And I kissed her.
Come closer.
- In front of everyone?
I told you.
Come closer.
You are again lying.
You were smoking cigarette secretly, weren't you?
I have forbidden you so many times.
Don't smoke.
Still, why don't you listen to me?
Really, Saahil.
I just don't know what to do with your uncle.
Do you know?
One day I went to his office.
He was smoking with his secretary.
Next time when I came home..
...I saw him smoking with our neighbor.
One day when I was not at home..
...he was smoking with the maid.
Maid?
- I really don't know what to do with you.
Kittu, keep the luggage in the car.
I am leaving.
I wish she is leaving forever.
It will be great.
Shall I tell you something?
I love wives.
But other's wives.
Guilty.
Guilty.
If I don't find my beloved, I search for him on the streets.
My beloved has come.
- Yes.
My beloved has come.
- Yes.
My beloved has come.
- Yes.
Were you waiting for me to go?
Can I go dance?
- Come on.
Hey!
Go.
Go.
WOW!
Wow!
Wow!
My stomach hurts.
I wonder what they gave me to eat.
The marriage preparations are going on fine?
- Yes, uncle.
Anything amiss?
Anything missing?
No, uncle.
It's great.
Are you speaking the truth?
Yes.
Young man.
Since childhood you pushed Saahil into bad habits.
I didn't say anything.
I thought you are a kid.
You will reform.
But you didn't reform.
Now Saahil is getting married.
Don't teach him anything wrong..
...or try to teach him your philosophy.
What?
- Okay, uncle.
Be a nice man.
Yes, uncle.
Put some more.
Look at my size.
You want to drink?
- Yes.
It's the occasion.
It's not.
We have to go to Sneha.
- I will see you.
Come on.
What happened?
Uncle has gone crazy.
He has lost the plot.
Why?
What happened?
- He doesn't understand brotherhood.
Forget about him.
Listen.
When soldiers go for war, they learn how to fire a gun.
They don't read the instruction manual.
I don't understand.
Look..
I am giving you theoretical knowledge.
Right?
If you want to win the exam of marriage..
...It's very important to apply it practically.
But I still don't get it.
What?
What's the problem?
You can't see the problem?
- No.
I can't see a single beautiful face here.
We need a girl.
Girl?
- You know, to experiment, we need a girl.
You know, what we need?
We need a bomb.
A girl who is..very hot.
What are you saying?
What bomb?
Hello, cheater.
- Hi.
Megha, hi.
Wow!
- Hi.
What a pleasant surprise!
I mean, you are here.
It's not a pleasant surprise for me.
You left me.
And are marrying Sneha.
You cheat.
Nice girl.
Megha.
Oops!
I am stuck.
Now I will have to go and meet everyone.
Hello, uncle.
Hello, aunt.
- Right.
Well, I see you.
-Yeah.
Please.
Hi, Megha.
- Damn!
Damn!
What is she doing here?
- Who is she?
She is my family friend.
Last year I got her marriage proposal.
I rejected it.
After that she went to Kolkata.
I don't know why she has come back.
Sneha must have invited her.
Sneha hates her.
Really?
- Yeah.
I don't know how she will react when she will see her here.
I am..
I am dead.
I like her.
She is good.
Experiment.
God!
Well, as expected, it was terrible.
I mean, I don't know why people can't forget their past.
As such, you are not feeling awkward to see me here, are you?
No.
No.
What are you saying?
It's fine.
In fact, I am glad you are here.
You are looking fabulous.
I must say.
Well, I am here on a business trip.
Dad told me you are getting married.
And you know, I thought I will come along and congratulate.
And don't worry.
Isn't she the same Megha about whom you keep talking?
What?
- Yes.
He really misses you.
lam telling you.
By the way, I am Shravan.
I am his cousin.
- Hi.
He really likes you.
In fact, he was telling me that you should attend all functions.
You have to.
- Really?
You have to.
Me?
- Yes.
Look, don't say no.
You shouldn't break the groom's heart.
You know what I mean?
- Well..
Last few days of his freedom.
You have to be with him.
I love him.
He is a great guy.
He likes you.
You got to be around.
I will see you in a minute.
Bye.
Saahil..are you sure about this?
Yeah.
I mean, of course.
You should stay.
Mom, I will just be back in a minute.
Okay?
Stay
- Two minutes.
That's a surprise.
Hi.
- Hi.
Hi.
Hi, Sneha.
Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Sneha, I am sorry.
But I didn't like your dress.
You know, her dressing sense has always been a problem.
But I hope your wedding attire is better than this.
Because on that day I am going to wear a very beautiful sari.
I am sure, Megha.
- Don't worry.
I will try not to look more beautiful than you.
By the way, honestly, I was finding it awkward..
...to attend your marriage.
But Saahil insisted so much.
That I couldn't refuse.
Is that so?
- Well, you guys have a great wedding.
Have a good time.
Yeah?
- Thank you.
Bye, Saahil.
- Bye.
See you.
No.
I didn't.
Sneha.
Oh God!
What do I do?
That's it.
What happened?
What happened?
Don't you feel ashamed to ask that?
For the first time Sneha and I had a major fight.
Now even I believe the priest.
This marriage won't work out.
I am gone.
I am done.
I am done.
You worry a lot.
Right now, you have to worry about that girl.
You know, the one on whom we will apply the rule.
I think Megha is perfect for that.
Why do you want me to get divorced before my marriage, brother?
She is Megha.
I had got her marriage proposal last year.
She was in love with me.
Sneha hates her.
That's the reason why.
Got it?
She wants to get back at Sneha.
She will do anything for you.
It's an ego clash, buddy.
What if because of this ego clash she tells Sneha the truth..
...and tries to break our marriage?
Do you want to break my marriage?
- No.
I have another rule for that.
But no such thing will happen.
Trust me.
I am done.
I am done.
Please.
I am done.
Please, brother"
- Hello, cheater.
Hi.
You..what are you..
You had messaged me.
Let's have lunch together.
When did I..when did I do that?
Why are you feeling shy?
So what?
Go and have lunch with her.
You must go to that place.
China Gold.
And over there okra..
Sorry.
Butter garlic crab.
Brilliant.
Really?
- Brilliant.
Okay.
Let's just go there.
- Yeah.
Go there.
- Awesome.
Let's go.
Yeah.
Go.
- We are getting late.
You message and then show attitude.
Brother.
- Saahil.
Hold on.
I will just come.
My things.
What happened?
- You forgot your phone yesterday.
Saahil.
- Saahil.
Let's go.
- Lunch.
Quickly.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Time for butter garlic crab.
Come on.
Watch drama unfold.
- You are getting married.
Watch drama unfold.
- Stop it!
Yes, please.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
Stop it.
What's wrong with you?
What happened now?
Enough of lectures.
Time for exam.
What exam..
Sneha.
- What?
Saahil.
- What?
What is he doing here?
Who is that girl?
Who is with him?
Hi.
Why are you feeling shy?
Come with me.
Come.
- This is embarrassing.
We are waiting for you for so long.
We are waiting since two hours.
- Hi, Sneha.
You know, darling.
Now hear the truth from them.
Both love each other.
- What?
Oh my God!
Okay.
Relax.
You know, Sneha is like my little sister.
She won't tell anyone.
Right?
- Right.
Of course.
What happened is that they met in Kolkata.
And they fell in love.
Her father didn't approve of this alliance.
So that day at the party, Megha told me..
...Saahil, can we invite him for the wedding?
I said, Of course.
What"
- You don't understand, darling.
In our marriage somebody else will also settle down.
How cool is that!
I love it.
- Thank you so much.
So kind of you.
And you doubt me.
You were..
Fine.
Actually, she was feeling shy.
She didn't want to tell you.
- Leave me.
What are you doing?
What is this?
Calm down, brother.
- Brother?
We are there.
We will convince uncle.
Which uncle..
-You don't understand.
Come on.
- Tushar.
Neha.
What are you doing?
Listen"
- I am his fiancée.
Fiancée?
- No.
No, Neha.
Neha.
- Tushar.
Don't show me your face again.
- Neha.
Neha.
I am sorry, Neha.
- Go away.
Tushar.
- Don't talk to me.
Please go.
Come.
I hate guys who cheat.
Because of him..
- Just relax.
...men are ruined.
- Calm down.
Calm down.
L..
- Just calm down.
I am really sorry.
I doubted you.
I am so sorry, Saahil.
It's okay.
You passed with flying colors, brother.
Don't talk to me, brother.
You trapped me.
It was a test.
- Yeah.
Right.
What if I had got caught?
Do you know?
I was torn.
From where is it torn, sir?
I selected the best quality cloth.
Who is talking to you?
Quiet.
You are my student, buddy.
You can't fail.
Yeah.
Right.
What about that poor boy?
He was ruined because of us.
He is a loser.
Why are you worrying for him?
These dedicated boys deserve it.
Forget about him.
No matter what you say.
I am done with all this brotherhood stuff.
I escaped by a whisker.
I won't take a risk again.
Did you understand?
Why do you keep threatening me?
You are not doing a favor on me by learning.
I am doing a favor on you by teaching you.
Got it?
So please don't do a favor.
Don't do it.
Please.
Done.
Finished.
Over.
I won't do it.
- Don't do it.
Had you learnt this last rule, you would have never..
...faced any problem in your life.
See you at the wedding.
- Yes.
Fine.
Bro.
You will know when you will get divorced.
Brother.
It's hormones.
- No.
No.
You can't escape.
You handle your hormones.
Did you see uncle's plight?
Do you want to be like that?
I won't be like uncle.
Do you want to keep your wife happy?
This is the only way.
Hi, uncle.
You want to kiss her?
No.
I don't smoke.
Please.
He is my nephew.
What will you do if aunt finds out?
Kiss me.
Please.
Harry, you are again smoking.
I told you.
Don't smoke.
I can't find the bra.
Where is the bra?
Darn you.
The kid is getting married here.
What are you looking for?
What are you doing here?
Sneha has left.
She wouldn't have married a cheater like you.
No.
- Hi, cheater.
- No.
You look so sexy while sleeping.
Megha, please.
Please, Megha.
Megha, please.
- What's going on?
I mean.. my suspicion was right?
Wake up, Saahil.
You are dreaming.
Wake up.
Oh my God!
Saahil, see your face.
Relax.
We were just joking.
- Sorry.
I am really sorry.
Should you..wake me up like that?
Actually, we have resolved our differences.
And I am so glad that you invited her for the wedding.
Well, I guess I should give the would-be bride..
...and groom some time.
Well, I will see you guys down.
See you, guys.
- See you.
Bye.
I know what you are thinking.
- What?
As to how come Megha and I are together.
Right?
- Yes.
But just think about it, Saahil.
First you refused to marry her.
And now, Tushar also cheated on her.
Right?
- Yes.
I just thought that the least we could do is be sweet to her.
Anyway, get ready quickly.
We are going for dinner.
Okay?
We?
- Yes.
Megha is also coming along.
Just make it quick, darling.
Okay?
- Okay.
Until now I spoke the truth.
Both fought like cats and dogs.
I lied once.
And..
Brother" it works.
Fourth rule.
Deny completely.
If your wife sees you with another girl, deny it clearly.
Say no on her face.
And you should deny so confidently.
"That your wife shouldn't trust her own eyes.
Brother..this is practically impossible.
No one doubts what one sees.
What happened?
- See that.
What?
- Aunt Babita.
She takes pills the whole day.
I am feeling sleepy.
- Aunt, you are here.
I am searching for you for so long.
- Is that so?
I have to give you the pill.
You take such good care of me, Jhandu.
Aunt, I told you so many times.
My name is not Jhandu.
It's Fandu.
Fandu.
He is so forgetful, Farida.
I am Gunjan.
So who is Farida?
Come, I will show you.
Do you know?
She is not ill.
Uncle Popat is unwell.
And she takes pills.
- What illness is this?
He is a dude.
Popat.
- Yes!
What happened?
- What are you doing?
What am I doing?
Didn't you feel ashamed?
- For what?
For what you are doing with her.
Which girl are you talking about?
- This..
This girl who was here.
Where are you going?
Where are you running?
- I am not running.
I am here.
Make a cup of tea for me.
- Tea?
What has happened to you?
It didn't make any difference to you?
What has happened to you?
You are saying weird things.
I am saying weird things.
Me?
What were you doing with that girl?
Which girl?
- That..
What will you have with tea?
Send whoever you want.
I mean, whatever you have.
Damn!
Uncle Popat.
He actually did this?
WOW!
I mean, that's genius.
Poor aunt Babita.
She has been to 8-10 psychiatrists.
No use.
She is taking pills.
And uncle Popat is having fun.
Brother, I must say.
We have such a lecherous family.
Shut up!
Lecherous!
Kittu!
- Yes, mama.
Kittu, tell me the truth.
Did you take Rs.200 from my purse?
No.
Why will I take money from your purse?
Kittu, I am warning you.
Yes.
Don't lie.
Yesterday you asked Rs.200 from me.
Yes.
As ii you gave me a cheque of crates.
I will slap you.
I didn't give you money.
You must have stolen it.
Kittu, I know you.
Mother, I swear on you.
I didn't take any money.
Kittu, here is your stuff.
It was for Rs.250. I bought it for Rs.200.
You fool.
You steal.
And swear on me falsely.
Idiot.
lam fed up of father and son.
His father faints all the time.
And son steals.
Robber.
Idiot.
Stupid.
Thief.
You fool, this rule applies on wives and not on mothers.
If you use it on mother, you will be slapped like that.
He was trying.
Well done.
The wedding party is here.
Come and groove.
Listen.
- Yes.
Go and perform the henna ritual for Saahil.
So that the kids can start the musical function.
Or else it will be quite late.
- Okay.
Come.
The wedding party is here.
Come and groove.
I don't like the smell of henna.
Why?
- I don't know.
The smell of henna is so romantic.
It's ajoyous occasion.
Dance.
It's ajoyous occasion.
Dance.
Do one thing.
Tell your wife to finish the ritual quickly.
So that we can begin the musical function.
Or else it will be very late.
- Is everything going fine?
Everything is fine.
Check on the catering.
No problem?
- Don't worry.
Come and groove.
Have a blast.
Where were you?
At least come on time for family functions.
Well, I..
Yes.
Done?
- Yes.
Done?
- Yes.
I know what you are going to say.
You are going to say you were with a girl.
I know you.
You were smoking secretly.
I can still smell the smoke on you.
So don't lie to me.
You got it?
Listen, leave all this.
Come and see Mrs. Dillon's solitaires.
Come.
-Yes.
Coming.
Go.
Sorry.
Hi, Harry.
-Will you marry me?
What?
- God bless you.
What is this?
- It's not real.
It's tattoo.
Why are you looking at me?
Go and see your would-be bride.
It's ajoyous occasion.
Dance.
Apply henna.
Hello.
Popat, what are you doing with her?
- What am I doing?
What are you doing, clinging to this girl?
What are you saying?
When you are here, can I do anything with a girl?
You are holding her hand.
- Holding her hand?
Now you will say..
I kissed her.
You did it.
You kissed her.
I saw it.
Isn't she the same girl who was in our bedroom?
You see the same girl.
At least see some other girl.
Give me some credit.
I will have to change your medicine.
Otherwise you won't change the girl.
Go.
Come on.
I will change your pill.
Come.
- Yes.
I doubt him needlessly.
Look guys, I am high on brandy.
I am high on brandy.
I am high on brandy.
'Bra.
Bra.
Bra.
Bra.'
'Bra.
Bra.
Bra.
Bra.'
'Bra.
Bra.
Bra.
Bra.'
'Bra.
Bra.
Bra.
Bra.'
'Bra.
Bra.
Bra.
Bra.'
Oh God!
He fainted even here.
He has humiliated me.
Kittu, take him to the room.
I will..
- Hi, Megha.
Come, join us.
Alright.
- Come.
See this.
- Beautiful.
Saahil is trying to find his name.
Is this Saahil?
This.. this..
- This one?
- S..
Isn't it the one?
- Damn!
It's my boss's phone.
Can you just pick it up, Saahil?
Can you just quickly pick it up?
- I..
Saahil, please put it next to my ear.
- What are you doing?
How do I pick it up?
Is this the one?
- Yes.
Hello.
Hello.
Saahil, there is no network.
Come there.
Hello.
Hello, sir.
-What?
Hello.
Saahil, come to that corner.
Please.
There is no network here.
Hello.
Hello.
Network problem.
- Hello, sir.
Sir, two minutes.
There is no network.
One moment.
Yeah.
Side.
Saahil, just a little.
- There is network here.
Hello.
No.
Come to that side.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Hello.
Thanks, Shravan.
You are welcome.
Just don't fall in love.
Okay?
I just want him to have fun.
That's it.
I will take care of it.
- Bye.
Hey cheater.
Megha, this is wrong.
I know.
I know you love Sneha a lot and all that crap.
You are getting married after two days.
And I don't want to waste time over stupid lunches and dinners.
Shravan told me.
You are also attracted towards me.
What's wrong with you?
I am going to get married.
Your phone.
Saahil saw and he found it.
Really.
- Yeah.
Guys.
Guys, the only good thing about marriage..
...Is bachelor's party.
Yes!
- Absolutely.
It's Priya's call.
Oh God!
Today is Friday.
What happened?
- Saahil, I have to go home.
Why?
What happened?
- I had to go to my in-laws.
I completely forgot.
- Pick up the phone.
You are gone.
Saahil, your aunt.
Are you crazy?
I am getting married.
Sam, your granny.
Are you crazy?
We used her last time at Raghu's bachelor's party.
What do I do?
Damn!
Will my grandpa do?
It's been only five years since he died.
It's safe.
It's safe.
Yes.
It will do.
- Guys.
Hello.
Yes, Priya.
Priya, I was coming home.
I got Gagan's call on the way.
His grandpa passed away.
I know.
It's sad.
I will have to be with him.
I have to support him.
Poor guy doesn't have anyone.
I hope you understand, baby.
Yes.
And please tell mom and dad that.
...next week we will meet for dinner.
I love you, sweetheart.
Thank you so much for understanding.
Yeah.
Okay.
Bye.
Thank you, grandpa.
Let's have some fun, guys.
Gagan, thanks.
I love you.
I don't lie.
I don't lie.
Have you made all the arrangements?
- Yes, aunt.
Have you kept all the veneration items in the car?
Yes, I did.
What about the water of Ganges?
We've packed everything, aunt.
I don't have to worry as long as you're here.
Here.
- Sneha.
Yes.
- Keep this inside.
While leaving, pray in our family deity's temple.
- Okay.
We'll be back soon.
By tomorrow.
Go on.
- Let's go.
Call me when you get there.
Give that.
We need some Coniac shots.
I'm still wearing this.
Where are you sticking your hand in?
Sister-in-law, what's his problem?
Inder, I am fed up of him.
Two years after our marriage..
...he started looking for something.
And he's still looking for it.
He can't find it.
I'm fed up..
- Sonia.
Call them up.
Why are you tensed now?
That confectioner sent the wrong sweets.
Mrs. Gunjan should've been worried about that.
Hello.
Dear?
- Yes.
Where's Sahil?
He's gone out with his friends.
- Strange.
He's getting married day after tomorrow.
So why party now with friends?
The children these days, care less for the rituals"
...and are more concerned about partying.
What do they call it?
Bachelor party.
- Bachelor party!
No need to worry.
Shravan's with him.
That's what I'm worried about.
Something for your mind, your body and your soul.
It's the power to arouse.
The powers.
I see.
I don't want to.
I don't want to.
I see.
I don't want to.
I don't want to.
Where have you brought me?
We were supposed to go directly to the temple.
This is a kind of temple, Sneha.
Okay, now please open this.
Okay, okay.
Relax.
Surprise!
You know, why can't our wife dance like this with us?
Shut up!
Henpecked husband.
- Forget him.
We're with angels, and you're thinking about those witches.
Shut up, guys.
- That's my leg.
But Sahil, Shravan's filled our life with fun.
Yes.
Booze and girls.
Forget the booze, we drink every day.
Let's go after the girls today.
Watch me take it down.
Watch me take it down.
Get drunk now.
Hit the ground.
String that around.
Leave him alone.
Thank you.
I knew you're a good man.
Don't thank me, buddy.
These girls are not for you.
Megha's for you.
No, no, no..
Every time you said no to me, you've landed in trouble.
Okay.
Last few days..before marriage.
Alright.
Honeymoon suite.
Top floor.
Come on, Sneha.
This party's been organised for you.
Why so serious?
Enjoy it.
You think I don't know that.
...Sid lied to me to attend Sahil's bachelor party.
Don't you know, all men are dogs?
I know about the bachelor's party.
Sahil asked me before going.
And anyway, I trust him completely.
I know he won't do anything wrong.
Relax.
Relax, Sahil.
Just relax.
Later.
Anyway, thanks for this party of yours.
I am really not interested.
What happened?
No..nothing.
Relax.
I am sorry.
- Sahil.
What's wrong?
I'm going.
- Sahil.
No, no, I got to go.
- There's nothing wrong.
No, this is wrong.
Hey.
Stay.
- Sorry.
I can't do this.
- Please don't go.
Please don't go away.
No, I cannot do this.
Sahil..
On the path..of life.
- Sahil.
Listen.
We'll always be together.
- Sneha.
Sneha!
- Why do I see..
"This distance between you and me?
The heart that was delicate as flower.
Turned to amber.
Where my wishes turned to ashes.
If you aren't with me.
Life is worthless.
What do I do..
With the happiness that's missing you.
The prints of our memory..
"Exist in the reposition of time.
Every corner of the heart..
...still holds your promises.
The heart that was delicate as flower.
Turned to amber.
Where my wishes turned to ashes.
If you aren't with me.
Life is worthless.
Hey"
Why did you come here?
- To know..
...why didn't you tell the truth about Shravan to everyone?
That doesn't prove that I didn't make a mistake?
Did you and Megha..
Then what's your fault?
I made a big mistake.
Before the wedding, if I can dare to enter a girl's bedroom.
Then later, I can dare to go anywhere.
Unlike Sneha, I deserve it.
Go on.
Who can return me my love?
Who can get me out of this mess?
Who can help me forget my pain?
O Lord, unite me with my love.
O Lord, return me my life.
O Lord, I don't stand a chance before you.
O Lord, alleviate my pain.
O Lord, unite me with my love.
Oh Lord!
Oh Lord!
Oh Lord!
Oh Lord!
I don't want to go ahead with this marriage?
Oh, God!
What's this new problem now?
Sahil, what are you saying?
Don't you have any shame?
First that, and now this.
Take your uncle Suri.
He only smokes.
He doesn't have any other bad habits.
I always knew this was going to happen.
See, we're in trouble now.
This is a big problem.
Look, son.
We've been married for 22 years.
But we never thought like this.
But you're already..
- Enough!
We won't discuss this anymore.
And no one will talk to Sahil about this.
- Yes.
I will talk to Sneha's papa.
Yes.
I don't want to touch.
- Come on.
Fundoo, tell aunt"
Uncle.
Bless you.
People can be angry over anything"
"but he shouldn't vent it out on food.
I will eat it myself.
- Hey!
It won't taste bitter if I feed you.
Open your mouth.
Chew it!
You should always chew your food properly.
Do you..
love Sneha.
Hey!
Come here.
I got it.
You don't have to say it.
The tears in your eyes..
Is conveying the saga in your heart.
Don't feel shy.
These tears are a strange thing.
Elders have said..
...when the heart's overwhelmed..
...you don't know what to do, can't take a decision..
"That's when you should cry your heart out.
Come on.
Cry.
Cry your heart out.
Cry your heart out.
And let your problems flow out through these tears.
Good!
I really love Sneha, uncle.
I made a big mistake, uncle.
- No, you didn't.
You don't know.
-I know it.
I made a big mistake, uncle.
- No, you didn't.
I know everything.
You were tricked.
Yes.
I know.
I do.
I know all these tricks.
They are dangerous.
I know..that Shravan tricked you into going there.
To that girl.
And I knew you won't do anything.
And my..
My faith won!
I didn't get it, uncle.
I'm not speaking a different language, son.
This isn't new.
This has been happening for really long.
Even we had people like Shravan.
We were instigated too.
I was even misled.
The truth is..
I lost control a few times myself.
It's true.
When I tried to do something.
...I remembered about your mother's love.
And I stopped.
Whenever there's a war between brotherhood..
...and love.
-Yes.
Love always wins.
And that happened with you.
If you had been selfish, you wouldn't have said it to Sneha.
You said it to Sneha yourself.
You cancelled this marriage.
Come on, get ready.
But, uncle.
I thought I cancelled the marriage.
What now?
- What else?
Wear your wedding attire and go get the girl..
Meaning?
- What?
Who cancelled your wedding?
I explained everything to Sneha's papa and..
We don't have much time.
Smp hugging me-
Your marriage is due.
You know, uncle.
I hope you won't mind.
I always thought you're a snoot.
I still am.
Brother Sahil!
Brother Sahil!
- Careful.
Brother Sahil!
Sister-in-law Sneha is missing.
-What?
No need to worry.
This is our own city.
We'll find her.
Understood?
- No, uncle.
I'll go.
And I'll find her.
Help me out.

Just don't go.
You don't want to see my face, then don't.
Just give me one chance to speak, please.
Just trust me.
Look.
Whatever happened last night.
Nothing happened..
Whatever happened last night.
It was a bachelor's party.
So, Sid got me drunk.
You know, normally I don't drink too much.
You saw me at the wrong place, at the wrong time.
You..
I was coming out of her room when you caught me.
What explanation are you going to give me?
You lied to me each time, Sahil.
You were in the restaurant with Megha, right?
And what did you tell me?
I was such a fool.
I always trusted you more than myself.
It was my biggest mistake.
And since when did you become so manipulative?
Or is it just Megha's influence?
Sahil.
Sahil.
Here I am.
Sahil.
What are you doing there?
Wait.
I'll be right back.
Anybody there?
Please help.
Sneha, don't go.
- Oh my, God!
Sahil, give me your hand.
- Listen.
Yes.
- Pull my shirt, I'll try to come in.
Pull.
Pull.
It's breaking.
Somebody help.
Sahil.
Give me your hand.
Shut up, Sahil.
Just give me your hand.
You were talking about manipulation.
- What?
Do you know brother was behind all this manipulation?
Sahil, stop your nonsense.
And don't say anything.
Give me your hand.
He dragged me into all this.
Oh, God!
Sahil, give me your hand.
Brother's been cheating on sister-in-law..
...for the last 15 years, do you know that?
Sahil, do you know what sister-in-law will say if she hears?
Are you..
- Sister has left home.
Sahil, give me your hand.
You cheated on me, still I am saving you.
I don't know why.
Just give me your hand.
I'm tired!
Why is everyone after me for no reason?
I didn't cheat on you.
I didn't do anything.
Okay, Sahil..
- I'm going.
I'm going.
No, no, give me your hand.
Feeling very sorry.
- Sahil, what.
Tell brother that I forgive him.
No problem.
Ask aunt to stop taking medicines.
Ask uncle to..
- Stop it..
To stop smoking.
That's it.
- Give me your hand.
What are you doing?
Tell Kittu to stop listening to brother.
Sahil, you will fall.
Please.
Say that you forgive me.
Give me your hand.
Did you forgive me?
Sahil, give me your hand.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Sahil, give me your hand.
Come on, hurry up.
Will you marry me?
- Of course I will.
Promise.
- First hold my hand.
Sorry.
I can't hold your hand.
If I do, I will fall down.
You will have to hold on to my legs?
- What?
How can I..
Sahil, shut up!
Give me your hand.
I'm going to keep my feet there, okay.
On the count of three, pull me inside.
How can I pull your leg?
- Yes.
You will have to.
Pull.
-Sahil.
One..
Two.. jump!

Yes.
These days I'm giving lessons on love to brother.
And, Sneha and me..
...we're as happy as we can be.
Sahil.
You're married now.
What about kids?
- Of course, you should have kids.
There are few rules of becoming a father.
Sahil.
First rule..
God, what do I do?
Yes.
Everyone present here, I've a small request.
Everyone stand in that corner.

Guys. 9N5-.
I have an announcement to make.
- What?
What are you talking about?
As all of you know.
I and Sneha came to this place 15 years ago for the first time.
You remember?
- Of course.
I had bought a teddy bear for Sneha.
We were 8 years old.
That teddy bear costed me 1000 bucks.
And Sneha lost the teddy bear here.
Really?
- So she had robbed for the first time here.
Second time.
We were in college.
We came here just for the sake of it.
Ice cream.
- Ma'am sent me to get an ice cream.
I ran for a kilometer.
I got ajolt again.
Third time it was her birthday.
I bought a dress for her which didn't fit her.
So mean.
That was years ago, Saahil.
Today she has given me yet another shock.
Shock worth millions.
What?
- What do you mean?
What?
- Yes.
What?
Sam.
Saahil.
Oh God!
Sneha, will you marry me?
Yes.
Yes.
Sneha has agreed.
Oh God.
O God.
Sweetheart, love is such a sweet thing.
Love is a source of life.
On an obscure picture, love is a change.
Ocean in a drop.
And a lifetime in a moment.
Should I bow down or cast away every evil eye?

Love is a source of life.
It is spark that has come through.
Love is a world of dreams.
Ocean in a drop.
And a lifetime in a moment.
Should I bow down or cast away every evil eye?
O God, what should I do?
O God, what should I do?
O God, what should I do?
O God, what should I do?

My desires are running wild.
Like the clouds in the sky.
Like raindrops.
I have lost control.
My heart's going wild.
My desires are running wild.
It has a world of its own.

All the best.

Saahil, how are you.
- Great.
Gunjan, your son has become really handsome.

Hello, everybody.
Champ.
Uncle, you are looking really smart.
How is your marriage coming on?
Super hit.
Since you have trained me.
Cheers.
- Here we go.
Dude, what about the bachelor's party?
Bachelor's party.
What are you saying?
I'll organise the best strippers for you.
I swear.
A gift from me to you.
Brother, please.
I am one woman guy.
That's a great line.
Will work on Sneha.
Not on me.
Okay.
We are buddies.
We are friends.
Come on.
You need not hide it from me.
Let's go.
Two beers.
- Okay, sir.
Brother, I am telling the truth.
I have never even looked at another girl.
So you are saying you have not done anything"
...with any other girl apart from Sneha.
I haven't done anything with Sneha either.
We are waiting for our marriage.
It means you haven't done anything with any girl to this day.
No.
Oh.
Now I get it.
-What?
But you shouldn't ruin Sneha's life like this.
I understand that you like boys over girls.
That's okay.
It's legal now.
Not a problem.
Brother, please.
What are you saying?
I am not interested in boys whatsoever.
I'm perfectly straight.
Absolutely normal.
Normal.
Straight.
My foot.
You haven't done anything with the one you girl you have.
You haven't done anything with any girl.
You call yourself normal.
You are not my brother.
Someone must have swapped you in the hospital.
Here is your beer.
- To hell with your beer.
I need whisky now.
Enjoyed?
- A lot.
Hen's party is the one you should enjoy.
I know.
Dance, song.
Wedding.
You know that I am not interested in all of that.
We should have a hen's party.
It's been six years to your marriage.
Have kids at least now.
One has kids only once the honeymoon is over.
Correct.
Our honeymoon is still going strong.
Naughty-
Okay.
Listen, I have fixed the hotel and menu.
At her behest.
Have a check.
- Sure.
Come.
- Alright.
Champ.
- Hi uncle.
Rockstar uncle.
What's up with Saahil?
He hasn't done anything with girl till date.
Is he gay?
No.
Thankfully he isn't gay.
He is like I will do it after marriage and not before marriage.
And all that.
Look, you are my disciple.
You won't give up so easily.
Keep at it.
Uncle, I'll fix this celibate at any cost.
Stay away from girls.
Okay.
This advice at this age of mine.
Does it sound nice?
Bye, Saahil.
You can shut the bar.
Your astrologer's prediction is going to come true..
...because this marriage of yours is going to break.
You will have to remarry.
You are drunk.
I am not drunk.
But when you come to your senses you'll know.
What's problem in loving one single girl?
I mean you had told me.
And you are with sister-in-law since so long.
I don't know why you are telling me these things.
It's your accountant.
Bye Saahil.
Veena, my baby.
How are you?
I love you too.
No.
I am a little busy with the wedding.
Yes.
Yes.
She is here.
I'll meet.
I'll meet.
Once I am free.
Champ.
Why aren't you answering my call?
I don't want to talk to you, brother.
You are cheating on sister-in-law.
You could be like this"
- Could be.
Be realistic.
This is how God has made us.
You must have heard the saying.
All men are dogs.
Yes, I have.
This is the biggest truth.
Dude, we are dogs.
Trust me.
There is cheating in our hormones.
Don't..don't justify yourself, brother.
Please.
It is the truth.
You have heard this.
A king has 20 queens.
Have you heard that a queen has 20 kings?
That doesn't happen.
Not possible.
Actually a man gets bored being with just one woman.
A woman doesn't get bored.
And when a man gets bored his hormones start attacking him.
His frustration increases.
And his takes his frustration out on his wife and kids.
They start fighting and come to blows.
And finally they get divorced.
Understand.
So the moral of the story is..
...to have a happily married life, you must cheat on your wife.
Brother, why are you telling me all this now?
I am about to get married.
I am saving your marriage.
My friend.
Brother, I am not interested in your hormones and hormonal theory.
Can you please keep your hormones to yourself?
Son, don't ever underestimate hormones.
Let alone humans.
Hormones haven't spared even Gods.
For example Lord Rama.
- What?
Lord Rama was the ideal man, brother.
He loved Mother Sita all his life.
Correct.
You are right.
Hormones didn't stop hounding Him.
He had to assume Krishna's avatar to satisfy them.
I got you, baby.
I got you.
I'm sorry.
Did I disturb?
- Not at all.
I was explaining to him how to be a good husband.
Teach him well, brother-in-law.
I want him just like you.
I will make him just like me.
- Really?
I was looking for sister.
Where is she?
She must be talking to her tailor.
Okay.
I'll go find her.
See you.
See you.
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.
So sweet.
You'll ruin the life of such a sweet girl.
You know that?
Selfish man.
I am selfish?
You are unbelievable.
Please go from here.
I don't want to talk to you.
I'll go away.
But you'll remember me when your hormones start to kick in.
Okay.
Go.
Just go.
- Hormones.
When they kick in you'll realise.
- Okay.
Do you remember?
I was telling you about this book.
It is called before the heart attacks.
Have you read it?
No.
-You haven't?
You really have to.
You know.
75% men cheat on their women..
...In the first week of their marriage.
Can you imagine that?
I was so shocked.
Saahil.
Saahil.
-What?
Are you okay?
- Yes.
Of course.
Anyway, I was telling you that..
Saahil.
Saahil.
- No.
Just like that.
Saahil.
Saahil, lam talking to you, right?
You seem lost.
Saahil.
Saahil.
Are you alright?
Are you sure?
Yes, of course.
I am fine.
I am fine.
- Are you alright?
Absolutely fine.
Darling, let's go home.
I think you'll be much better.
'Hormones.
When they kick in you'll realise.'
Sir, your sex on the beach.
Saahil, what's wrong with you?
I ordered it.
What are you doing?
I am feeling really hot.
I am just going into the pool for a dip.
Saahil, where are you going?
Careful, Saahil.
Oh God.
'But you'll remember me when your hormones start to kick in.'
What are you doing?
Saahil.
Let go of decency.
Let go of all inhibitions.
Let go of decency.
Let go of all inhibitions.
There is beauty all around.
The world is full of beauties.
Let go of control.

Brother.
Hole three, sir?
- Yes.
Sir.
Come on.
Behind every successful man there is a woman.
Come.
That's true.
If you get such success from one single girl..
"Then how much success will you get from loads of girls.
Brother, even if I agree with you for once..
"But what if Sneha comes to know of that.
What I am about to tell you is a really big secret.
Okay?
We men have it hidden deep in our hearts.
Okay.
It's like a code.
Alright?
Brotherhood.
- Brotherhood?
Right.
Brotherhood.
- Brotherhood.
We men have hidden this secret in our hearts since ages.
You understand.
The great saint guru flirt had written this.
Guru flirt.
What nonsense.
Stop kidding.
Take his name with respect.
Call him the great saint guru flirt.
What is wrong with you, man?
Guru flirt wrote a rule book.
In it was mentioned how we men should cheat on women.
If we men get to know of these rules..
...then these women can do us no harm.
I'll tell you that.
You know that.
And I'll teach you all these rules.
But remember.
With great powers comes greater responsibility.
Now guru flirt has become spider man.
Superheroes don't marry.
Got it?
Spiderman.
Batman.
And even Hanuman didn't marry.
Guru flirt was a rock star.
But I must tell you that it's not easy.
All this is not that easy.
Sir.
- Thank you.
The best lose in this game.

- I hate working.
Bye-bye.
As you guys are aware that this year has been really nice.
I think we have done a great job.
Congratulations to all of you and I think we should..
Tell me now.
Tell me now.
Excuse me.
Hi baby.
Sure.
Why not?
Okay.
Bye.
You say something.
So.. my wife.
God, don't ever change our lives.
I wish we spend every day like this.
Right.
Oh God.
I love you so much.
- Love you too.
I need a detailed report of the..
Okay.
I need a detailed report of the U.K consignment.
And I want you to check out on the Hyderabad and Chennai offices.
God, don't ever change our lives.
I wish we spend every day like this.
Right.
Good night, baby.
Good night.
Listen, I don't have time for dinner.
We'll go when I have the time.
Yes, right.
I have been hearing since quite a few years now.
Don't give me this deprived wife nonsense.
Okay.
Don't.
You know, Veena.
I don't feel like going home these days.
So don't go.
Relax here today.
No, it's not that.
I don't feel like going home every day.
Life has become really monotonous.
Really.
It's like life has become really boring.
There's absolutely no excitement in my life.
This?
- This is a B-cup size.
Hey baby.
- Where are you?
I'm in the office.
Why?
What happened?
Really.
I was missing you.
I love you for that.
Okay, listen.
I'm in a meeting.
Little busy.
So I'll catch you later.
Okay?
I love you, baby.
Bye.
Show me.
- Wait.
I am showing.
I mean I can't wait.
Take off your clothes.
Take off your clothes.
Wait.
Fine.
Fine.
Okay.
Oh my God!
That is so good.
Oh God!
I just..
You know it is so hot.
How dare you?
Cheat.
I'm sorry.
I doubted you.
It's okay.
Well done.
You did it perfectly.
Okay.
Also put an earring that goes with it.
I love you.
And I am extremely sorry.
Stop.
You mean you had planned all this?
Yes.
Guilt.
Guilt is a man's biggest enemy.
Half of the people get caught because of guilt.
So the first rule.
You know when you cheat on your wife.
You get a guilty feeling.
Give this feeling to your wife..
...before we feel it.
Make her feel guilty.
Since that day your sister-in-law has never doubted me..
...even by mistake.
I am good.
I am so..
- Brother.
Hello.
- Hi.
Listen, your accountant had called up.
I didn't pick it up.
Call him back.
So sweet.
Thank you.
Thank you, darling.
Thank you.
Hello baby.
What are you doing?
Uncle, you?
Aunt Gunjan, uncle is here.
Really?
Brother.
- God bless.
God bless.
You should've call.
I would've come to receive you.

Where is Saahil?
I'll call him.
- Saahil.
Coming.

You are still a little boy.
Will you be able to handle the responsibility of marriage?
Brother, you rest.
Okay.
Come on.
Mister, marriage is no joke.
The best get defeated.
Got it?
- Come.
Thank God.
Here.
Here's some energy drink.
People often need this after meeting uncle.
Saahil.
Saahil.
Darn it.
You can't carry such light bags.
I have to spend my entire life with a man like this.
What did your father have against my father"
"that he married you to me?
Why has God made the custom of marriage?
Gunjan.
Sister-in-law Dolly.
Come.
Come.
- You have lost so much of weight.
Thank you.
Brother.
Forget it.
It's his job.
Saahil.
-Aunt.
Bless me.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

- Uncle.
Forget your uncle.
Congratulations on your wedding.
Listen.
Listen.
Don't refuse.
For my sake.
Keep it.
Have ice cream, son.
And listen.
Don't share it with Geeto.
Got it?
God bless.
He looks so cute.
Listen Gunjan.
When I was..
How much did she give?
10 rupees for happy marriage.
I didn't refuse.
It's okay.
Oh no.
- I think he needs this.
Let it be.
Let it be.
No energy drink can cure him.
I swear.
Why?
- You know.
I am about to tell you the second rule.
Once you know this, you'll understand everything.
The second rule is actually a tribute to him.
To him.
- This scrawny man.
He is not able to carry two bags.
He was once a wrestler in Punjab.
'People used to be scared of him.'
'He had a great body and was fit as a fiddle.'
'Look at him now.' lam high.
I am high
Gulal, where did you learn these tricks from?
I am high.
I am high.
What happened?
I can't find my bra.
You don't need to wear bra.
They are nice.
Keep quiet.
Help me find it.
Come on.
Darn it.
- Find it.
It must be here somewhere.
Have you hidden it?
What am I going to do with your bra?
I can't find it.
Were you wearing a bra?
Hey..
What kind of a woman do you think I am?
Tell me something.
Where is..bra..
Why are you getting worried?
Its price is just 60 rupees.
To hell with 60 rupees.
If my wife finds your bra, she'll cut me into 60 pieces.
So tell her that it's hers.
Right.
Don't irrigate me.
Come on.
Find the bra.
Then what happened?
That bra is still missing.
Uncle is living in the fear that the bra will be found anytime.
But the bra couldn't be found.
Second rule.
It's very important.
Whether your wife is in Ludhiana or London.
Don't ever bring your girlfriend at home.
Never.
Second rule.
Very important.
Poor chap.
'Bra.
Bra.
Bra.
Bra.

I can't throw him out.
Inder, you are just impossible.
You are impossible.
- What happened?
My engagement is taking place.
It's good I am getting married and leaving this house.
You shouldn't say that.
I am fed up of their daily quarrels.
Just look at them.
They fight everyday.
This is why I don't believe in arranged marriages.
Are you hiding something?
No.
Not at all.
When you can't lie, why do you even try?
You know.
I won't leave you till you tell me.
So tell me.
Sneha, your mother and father had a love marriage.
- What!
Oh my God!
I don't believe that.
You are just impossible.
You can do whatever you want.
I am going.
I ruined my life by marrying you.
- So what happened to them now?
I don't know.
- Because of your papa we will never reach the function.
Come quickly, dear.
Very strong perfume.
Do you know?
What's the most dangerous thing in a woman?
What?
- Her nose.
She can sniff everything.
Do you know what's more dangerous than nose?
- What?
The power that a woman has to sniff another woman.
That's why you should buy the strongest, most concentrated.
...cologne available in the market.
So that your wife can never sniff your mistress.
Smart.
- Give me your perfume.
Here.
Spray it nicely.
Here.
Yeah!

Today we have got engaged.
Engaged.
Engaged.
Why do they show echo in Hindi films?
WOW!
I feel alive again.
WOW!
What happened to you?
Do you know?
Mom and dad had a love marriage.
Really?
Seeing them, you can't guess.
Hey.
What happened?
I was kidding.
Saahil, since childhood I have seen my parents fighting.
I always felt their marriage is a big mistake.
But today, when I found out that they were also like us..
...I mean, at some point even they were this much in love.
I am really worried.
We won't be like them, right?
Look.
For me we got married 15 years ago.
We are just being official.
Right?
And not much has changed in these 15 years.
I don't even remember any serious fight between us.
Yes.
You have hit me 5-6 times.
I don't know if we can call that a fight.
The seventh time.
I promise you.
No matter what happens.
We will never change.
Promise?
I hate drop outs.
I hate people who drop out of their course.
It's the insult of brotherhood.
I mean..
- You can say whatever you want.
I can't deceive Sneha.
You don't know what she is going through.
-I know.
I know.
Her parents used to fight, right?
That has to happen, obviously.
Her father is also like you.
Very straight.
Didn't listen to hormones.
He is regretting.
I don't want your children to have..
...the same childhood that Sneha had.
Shravan.
- What happened?
The same thing that had to happen.
As usual uncle Surya is late.
His flight has been delayed by an hour.
Uncle Surya has this habit of coming late.
Very soon late will be affixed to his name.
An hour.
Come on.
Let's have drinks.
In the afternoon.
There is no fixed time for drinking.
Come on.
What to explain?
I have to explain how to control your wife..
...how to handle her.
Look at this.
You are teaching me?
If I start practicing now, I will learn by then.
See this.
This is called a dedicated student.
Teach him.
Is it his marriage or your marriage?
Shut up.
I don't know why I married you.
Foolish jerk!
This..this is men's plight after marriage.
Can I join you?
No.
I am sorry, ma'am.
It's taken.
Come on.
Trust me.
You won't regret it.
Look, ma'am.
I am not interested.
And I told you.
It's already taken.
Damn!
Did you see, brother?
Not everyone is like you.
He fought with his wife.
But he is still loyal.
Baby, I missed you so much.
Hello!
What took you so long?
- You know the Delhi traffic.
Sonny, it doesn't matter to hormones..
"Whether it's a man or a woman.
Got it?
People like you do discrimination in the society.
Got it?
I love hormones.
Naughty-
What happened?
Brother, I am tense.
Tell me the next rule quickly.
The next rule.
Truth always triumphs.
Truth always triumphs.
If you ever make a blunder in life, tell your wife the truth.
Brother, I don't understand.
No need to understand, son.
Look ahead.
The live telecast is going on.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Look.
- What is he doing?
Look.
Look.
Look.
- Watch what happens next.
Shall I tell you something?
The pleasure of kissing a foreigner is different.
Congratulations.
Your marriage is also fixed.
You are marrying.
Aunt has not come?
- Aunt is dead.
What?
- I mean, she is bringing the luggage.
She is coming.
She is coming.
She is coming.
She is coming.
She is coming.
Do you have a cigarette?
Cigarette?
Here.
- Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Lighter.
Hold this.
Hold this.
Hurry UP-
Uncle, cigarette.
-Yes.
Cigarette.
But I love it.
I love it.
Give me your hand.
Congratulations.
Where did you disappear, leaving me alone?
I was searching for you.
I see.
I came out and was flirting with a tall, fair, beautiful.
...foreigner air-hostess.
And I kissed her.
Come closer.
- In front of everyone?
I told you.
Come closer.
You are again lying.
You were smoking cigarette secretly, weren't you?
I have forbidden you so many times.
Don't smoke.
Still, why don't you listen to me?
Really, Saahil.
I just don't know what to do with your uncle.
Do you know?
One day I went to his office.
He was smoking with his secretary.
Next time when I came home..
...I saw him smoking with our neighbor.
One day when I was not at home..
...he was smoking with the maid.
Maid?
- I really don't know what to do with you.
Kittu, keep the luggage in the car.
I am leaving.
I wish she is leaving forever.
It will be great.
Shall I tell you something?
I love wives.
But other's wives.
Guilty.
Guilty.
If I don't find my beloved, I search for him on the streets.
My beloved has come.
- Yes.
My beloved has come.
- Yes.
My beloved has come.
- Yes.
Were you waiting for me to go?
Can I go dance?
- Come on.
Hey!
Go.
Go.
WOW!
Wow!
Wow!
My stomach hurts.
I wonder what they gave me to eat.
The marriage preparations are going on fine?
- Yes, uncle.
Anything amiss?
Anything missing?
No, uncle.
It's great.
Are you speaking the truth?
Yes.
Young man.
Since childhood you pushed Saahil into bad habits.
I didn't say anything.
I thought you are a kid.
You will reform.
But you didn't reform.
Now Saahil is getting married.
Don't teach him anything wrong..
...or try to teach him your philosophy.
What?
- Okay, uncle.
Be a nice man.
Yes, uncle.
Put some more.
Look at my size.
You want to drink?
- Yes.
It's the occasion.
It's not.
We have to go to Sneha.
- I will see you.
Come on.
What happened?
Uncle has gone crazy.
He has lost the plot.
Why?
What happened?
- He doesn't understand brotherhood.
Forget about him.
Listen.
When soldiers go for war, they learn how to fire a gun.
They don't read the instruction manual.
I don't understand.
Look..
I am giving you theoretical knowledge.
Right?
If you want to win the exam of marriage..
...It's very important to apply it practically.
But I still don't get it.
What?
What's the problem?
You can't see the problem?
- No.
I can't see a single beautiful face here.
We need a girl.
Girl?
- You know, to experiment, we need a girl.
You know, what we need?
We need a bomb.
A girl who is..very hot.
What are you saying?
What bomb?
Hello, cheater.
- Hi.
Megha, hi.
Wow!
- Hi.
What a pleasant surprise!
I mean, you are here.
It's not a pleasant surprise for me.
You left me.
And are marrying Sneha.
You cheat.

Nice girl.
Megha.
Oops!
I am stuck.
Now I will have to go and meet everyone.
Hello, uncle.
Hello, aunt.
- Right.
Well, I see you.
-Yeah.
Please.
Hi, Megha.
- Damn!
Damn!
What is she doing here?
- Who is she?
She is my family friend.
Last year I got her marriage proposal.
I rejected it.
After that she went to Kolkata.
I don't know why she has come back.
Sneha must have invited her.
Sneha hates her.
Really?
- Yeah.
I don't know how she will react when she will see her here.
I am..
I am dead.
I like her.
She is good.
Experiment.
God!
Well, as expected, it was terrible.
I mean, I don't know why people can't forget their past.
As such, you are not feeling awkward to see me here, are you?
No.
No.
What are you saying?
It's fine.
In fact, I am glad you are here.
You are looking fabulous.
I must say.
Well, I am here on a business trip.
Dad told me you are getting married.
And you know, I thought I will come along and congratulate.
And don't worry.
Isn't she the same Megha about whom you keep talking?
What?
- Yes.
He really misses you.
I am telling you.
By the way, I am Shravan.
I am his cousin.
- Hi.
He really likes you.
In fact, he was telling me that you should attend all functions.
You have to.
- Really?
You have to.
Me?
- Yes.
Look, don't say no.
You shouldn't break the groom's heart.
You know what I mean?
- Well..
Last few days of his freedom.
You have to be with him.
I love him.
He is a great guy.
He likes you.
You got to be around.
I will see you in a minute.
Bye.
Saahil..are you sure about this?
Yeah.
I mean, of course.
You should stay.
Mom, I will just be back in a minute.
Okay?
Stay
- Two minutes.
That's a surprise.
Hi.
- Hi.
Hi.
Hi, Sneha.
Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Sneha, I am sorry.
But I didn't like your dress.
You know, her dressing sense has always been a problem.
But I hope your wedding attire is better than this.
Because on that day I am going to wear a very beautiful sari.
I am sure, Megha.
- Don't worry.
I will try not to look more beautiful than you.
By the way, honestly, I was finding it awkward..
...to attend your marriage.
But Saahil insisted so much.
That I couldn't refuse.
Is that so?
- Well, you guys have a great wedding.
Have a good time.
Yeah?
- Thank you.
Bye, Saahil.
- Bye.
See you.
No.
I didn't.
Sneha.
Oh God!
What do I do?
That's it.
What happened?
What happened?
Don't you feel ashamed to ask that?
For the first time Sneha and I had a major fight.
Now even I believe the priest.
This marriage won't work out.
I am gone.
I am done.
I am done.
You worry a lot.
Right now, you have to worry about that girl.
You know, the one on whom we will apply the rule.
I think Megha is perfect for that.
Why do you want me to get divorced before my marriage, brother?
She is Megha.
I had got her marriage proposal last year.
She was in love with me.
Sneha hates her.
That's the reason why.
Got it?
She wants to get back at Sneha.
She will do anything for you.
It's an ego clash, buddy.
What if because of this ego clash she tells Sneha the truth..
...and tries to break our marriage?
Do you want to break my marriage?
- No.
I have another rule for that.
But no such thing will happen.
Trust me.
I am done.
I am done.
Please.
I am done.
Please, brother"
- Hello, cheater.
Hi.
You..what are you..
You had messaged me.
Let's have lunch together.
When did I..when did I do that?
Why are you feeling shy?
So what?
Go and have lunch with her.
You must go to that place.
China Gold.
And over there okra..
Sorry.
Butter garlic crab.
Brilliant.
Really?
- Brilliant.
Okay.
Let's just go there.
- Yeah.
Go there.
- Awesome.
Let's go.
Yeah.
Go.
We are getting late.
You message and then show attitude.
Brother.
- Saahil.
Hold on.
I will just come.
My things.
What happened?
- You forgot your phone yesterday.
Saahil.
- Saahil.
Let's go.
- Lunch.
Quickly.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Time for butter garlic crab.
Come on.
Watch drama unfold.
- You are getting married.
Watch drama unfold.
- Stop it!
Yes, please.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
Stop it.
What's wrong with you?
What happened now?
Enough of lectures.
Time for exam.
What exam..
Sneha.
- What?
Saahil.
- What?
What is he doing here?
Who is that girl?
Who is with him?
Hi.
Why are you feeling shy?
Come with me.
Come.
- This is embarrassing.
We are waiting for you for so long.
We are waiting since two hours.
- Hi, Sneha.
You know, darling.
Now hear the truth from them.
Both love each other.
- What?
Oh my God!
Okay.
Relax.
You know,Sneha is like my little sister.
She won't tell anyone.
Right?
- Right.
Of course.
What happened is that they met in Kolkata.
And they fell in love.
Her father didn't approve of this alliance.
So that day at the party, Megha told me..
...Saahil, can we invite him for the wedding?
I said, Of course.
What"
- You don't understand, darling.
In our marriage somebody else will also settle down.
How cool is that!
I love it.
- Thank you so much.
So kind of you.
And you doubt me.
You were..
Fine.
Actually, she was feeling shy.
She didn't want to tell you.
- Leave me.
What are you doing?
What is this?
Calm down, brother.
- Brother?
We are there.
We will convince uncle.
Which uncle..
-You don't understand.
Come on.
- Tushar.
Neha.
What are you doing?
Listen"
- I am his fiancée.
Fiancée?
- No.
No, Neha.
Neha.
- Tushar.
Don't show me your face again.
- Neha.
Neha.
I am sorry, Neha.
- Go away.
Tushar.
- Don't talk to me.
Please go.
Come.
I hate guys who cheat.
Because of him..
- Just relax.
...men are ruined.
- Calm down.
Calm down.
L..
- Just calm down.
I am really sorry.
I doubted you.
I am so sorry, Saahil.
It's okay.
You passed with flying colors, brother.
Don't talk to me, brother.
You trapped me.
It was a test.
- Yeah.
Right.
What if I had got caught?
Do you know?
I was torn.
From where is it torn, sir?
I selected the best quality cloth.
Who is talking to you?
Quiet.
You are my student, buddy.
You can't fail.
Yeah.
Right.
What about that poor boy?
He was ruined because of us.
He is a loser.
Why are you worrying for him?
These dedicated boys deserve it.
Forget about him.
No matter what you say.
I am done with all this brotherhood stuff.
I escaped by a whisker.
I won't take a risk again.
Did you understand?
Why do you keep threatening me?
You are not doing a favor on me by learning.
I am doing a favor on you by teaching you.
Got it?
So please don't do a favor.
Don't do it.
Please.
Done.
Finished.
Over.
I won't do it.
- Don't do it.
Had you learnt this last rule, you would have never..
...faced any problem in your life.
See you at the wedding.
- Yes.
Fine.
Bro.
You will know when you will get divorced.
Brother.
It's hormones.
- No.
No.
You can't escape.
You handle your hormones.
Did you see uncle's plight?
Do you want to be like that?
I won't be like uncle.
Do you want to keep your wife happy?
This is the only way.
Hi, uncle.
You want to kiss her?
No.
I don't smoke.
Please.
He is my nephew.
What will you do if aunt finds out?
Kiss me.
Please.
Harry, you are again smoking.
I told you.
Don't smoke.
I can't find the bra.
Where is the bra?
Darn you.
The kid is getting married here.
What are you looking for?
What are you doing here?
Sneha has left.
She wouldn't have married a cheater like you.
No.
- Hi, cheater.
- No.
You look so sexy while sleeping.
Megha, please.
Please, Megha.
Megha, please.
- What's going on?
I mean.. my suspicion was right?
Wake up, Saahil.
You are dreaming.
Wake up.
Oh my God!
Saahil, see your face.
Relax.
We were just joking.
- Sorry.
I am really sorry.
Should you..wake me up like that?
Actually, we have resolved our differences.
And I am so glad that you invited her for the wedding.
Well, I guess I should give the would-be bride..
...and groom some time.
Well, I will see you guys down.
See you, guys.
- See you.
Bye.
I know what you are thinking.
- What?
As to how come Megha and I are together.
Right?
- Yes.
But just think about it, Saahil.
First you refused to marry her.
And now, Tushar also cheated on her.
Right?
- Yes.
I just thought that the least we could do is be sweet to her.
Anyway, get ready quickly.
We are going for dinner.
Okay?
We?
- Yes.
Megha is also coming along.
Just make it quick, darling.
Okay?
- Okay.
Until now I spoke the truth.
Both fought like cats and dogs.
I lied once.
And..
Brother" it works.
Fourth rule.
Deny completely.
If your wife sees you with another girl, deny it clearly.
Say no on her face.
And you should deny so confidently.
"That your wife shouldn't trust her own eyes.
Brother..this is practically impossible.
No one doubts what one sees.
What happened?
- See that.
What?
- Aunt Babita.
She takes pills the whole day.
I am feeling sleepy.
- Aunt, you are here.
I am searching for you for so long.
- Is that so?
I have to give you the pill.
You take such good care of me, Jhandu.
Aunt, I told you so many times.
My name is not Jhandu.
It's Fandu.
Fandu.
He is so forgetful, Farida.
I am Gunjan.
So who is Farida?
Come, I will show you.
Do you know?
She is not ill.
Uncle Popat is unwell.
And she takes pills.
- What illness is this?
He is a dude.
Popat.
- Yes!
What happened?
- What are you doing?
What am I doing?
Didn't you feel ashamed?
- For what?
For what you are doing with her.
Which girl are you talking about?
- This..
This girl who was here.
Where are you going?
Where are you running?
- I am not running.
I am here.
Make a cup of tea for me.
- Tea?
What has happened to you?
It didn't make any difference to you?
What has happened to you?
You are saying weird things.
I am saying weird things.
Me?
What were you doing with that girl?
Which girl?
- That..
What will you have with tea?
Send whoever you want.
I mean, whatever you have.
Damn!
Uncle Popat.
He actually did this?
WOW!
I mean, that's genius.
Poor aunt Babita.
She has been to 8-10 psychiatrists.
No use.
She is taking pills.
And uncle Popat is having fun.
Brother, I must say.
We have such a lecherous family.
Shut up!
Lecherous!
Kittu!
- Yes, mama.
Kittu, tell me the truth.
Did you take Rs.200 from my purse?
No.
Why will I take money from your purse?
Kittu, I am warning you.
Yes.
Don't lie.
Yesterday you asked Rs.200 from me.
Yes.
As ii you gave me a cheque of crates.
I will slap you.
I didn't give you money.
You must have stolen it.
Kittu, I know you.
Mother, I swear on you.
I didn't take any money.
Kittu, here is your stuff.
It was for Rs.250.
I bought it for Rs.200.
You fool.
You steal.
And swear on me falsely.
Idiot.
lam fed up of father and son.
His father faints all the time.
And son steals.
Robber.
Idiot.
Stupid.
Thief.
You fool, this rule applies on wives and not on mothers.
If you use it on mother, you will be slapped like that.
He was trying.
Well done.
The wedding party is here.
Come and groove.
Listen.
- Yes.
Go and perform the henna ritual for Saahil.
So that the kids can start the musical function.
Or else it will be quite late.
- Okay.
Come.
The wedding party is here.
Come and groove.
I don't like the smell of henna.
Why?
- I don't know.
The smell of henna is so romantic.
It's ajoyous occasion.
Dance.
It's ajoyous occasion.
Dance.
Do one thing.
Tell your wife to finish the ritual quickly.
So that we can begin the musical function.
Or else it will be very late.
- Is everything going fine?
Everything is fine.
Check on the catering.
No problem?
- Don't worry.
Come and groove.
Have a blast.
Where were you?
At least come on time for family functions.
Well, I..
Yes.
Done?
- Yes.
Done?
- Yes.
I know what you are going to say.
You are going to say you were with a girl.
I know you.
You were smoking secretly.
I can still smell the smoke on you.
So don't lie to me.
You got it?
Listen, leave all this.
Come and see Mrs. Dillon's solitaires.
Come.
-Yes.
Coming.
Go.
Sorry.
Hi, Harry.
-Will you marry me?
What?
- God bless you.
What is this?
- It's not real.
It's tattoo.
Why are you looking at me?
Go and see your would-be bride.
It's ajoyous occasion.
Dance.
Apply henna.
Hello.
Popat, what are you doing with her?
- What am I doing?
What are you doing, clinging to this girl?
What are you saying?
When you are here, can I do anything with a girl?
You are holding her hand.
- Holding her hand?
Now you will say..
I kissed her.
You did it.
You kissed her.
I saw it.
Isn't she the same girl who was in our bedroom?
You see the same girl.
At least see some other girl.
Give me some credit.
I will have to change your medicine.
Otherwise you won't change the girl.
Go.
Come on.
I will change your pill.
Come.
- Yes.
I doubt him needlessly.
Look guys, I am high on brandy.
I am high on brandy.
I am high on brandy.
'Bra.
Bra.
Bra.
Bra.'
'Bra.
Bra.
Bra.
Bra.'
'Bra.

'Bra.

'Bra.

Oh God!
He fainted even here.
He has humiliated me.
Kittu, take him to the room.
I will..
- Hi, Megha.
Come, join us.
Alright.
- Come.
See this.
- Beautiful.
Saahil is trying to find his name.
Is this Saahil?
This.. this..
- This one?
- S..
Isn't it the one?
- Damn!
It's my boss's phone.
Can you just pick it up, Saahil?
Can you just quickly pick it up?
- I..
Saahil, please put it next to my ear.
- What are you doing?
How do I pick it up?
Is this the one?
- Yes.
Hello.
Hello.
Saahil, there is no network.
Come there.
Hello.
Hello, sir.
-What?
Hello.
Saahil, come to that corner.
Please.
There is no network here.
Hello.
Hello.
Network problem.
- Hello, sir.
Sir, two minutes.
There is no network.
One moment.
Yeah.
Side.
Saahil, just a little.
- There is network here.
Hello.
No.
Come to that side.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Hello.
Thanks, Shravan.
You are welcome.
Just don't fall in love.
Okay?
I just want him to have fun.
That's it.
I will take care of it.
- Bye.
Hey cheater.
Megha, this is wrong.
I know.
I know you love Sneha a lot and all that crap.
You are getting married after two days.
And I don't want to waste time over stupid lunches and dinners.
Shravan told me.
You are also attracted towards me.
What's wrong with you?
I am going to get married.
Your phone.
Saahil saw and he found it.
Really.
- Yeah.
Guys.
Guys, the only good thing about marriage..
...Is bachelor's party.
Yes!
- Absolutely.
It's Priya's call.
Oh God!
Today is Friday.
What happened?
- Saahil, I have to go home.
Why?
What happened?
- I had to go to my in-laws.
I completely forgot.
- Pick up the phone.
You are gone.
Saahil, your aunt.
Are you crazy?
I am getting married.
Sam, your granny.
Are you crazy?
We used her last time at Raghu's bachelor's party.
What do I do?
Damn!
Will my grandpa do?
It's been only five years since he died.
It's safe.
It's safe.
Yes.
It will do.
- Guys.
Hello.
Yes, Priya.
Priya, I was coming home.
I got Gagan's call on the way.
His grandpa passed away.
I know.
It's sad.
I will have to be with him.
I have to support him.
Poor guy doesn't have anyone.
I hope you understand, baby.
Yes.
And please tell mom and dad that.
...next week we will meet for dinner.
I love you, sweetheart.
Thank you so much for understanding.
Yeah.
Okay.
Bye.
Thank you, grandpa.
Let's have some fun, guys.
Gagan, thanks.
I love you.
I don't lie.
I don't lie.
Have you made all the arrangements?
- Yes, aunt.
Have you kept all the veneration items in the car?
Yes, I did.
What about the water of Ganges?
We've packed everything, aunt.
I don't have to worry as long as you're here.
Here.
- Sneha.
Yes.
- Keep this inside.
While leaving, pray in our family deity's temple.
- Okay.
We'll be back soon.
By tomorrow.
Go on.
- Let's go.
Call me when you get there.
Give that.
We need some Coniac shots.
I'm still wearing this.
Where are you sticking your hand in?
Sister-in-law, what's his problem?
Inder, I am fed up of him.
Two years after our marriage..
...he started looking for something.
And he's still looking for it.
He can't find it.
I'm fed up..
- Sonia.
Call them up.
Why are you tensed now?
That confectioner sent the wrong sweets.
Mrs. Gunjan should've been worried about that.
Hello.
Dear?
- Yes.
Where's Sahil?
He's gone out with his friends.
- Strange.
He's getting married day after tomorrow.
So why party now with friends?
The children these days, care less for the rituals"
...and are more concerned about partying.
What do they call it?
Bachelor party.
- Bachelor party!
No need to worry.
Shravan's with him.
That's what I'm worried about.
Something for your mind, your body and your soul.
It's the power to arouse.
The powers.
I see.
I don't want to.
I don't want to.
I see.
I don't want to.
I don't want to.
Where have you brought me?
We were supposed to go directly to the temple.
This is a kind of temple, Sneha.
Okay, now please open this.
Okay, okay.
Relax.
Surprise!
You know, why can't our wife dance like this with us?
Shut up!
Henpecked husband.
- Forget him.
We're with angels, and you're thinking about those witches.
Shut up, guys.
- That's my leg.
But Sahil, Shravan's filled our life with fun.
Yes.
Booze and girls.
Forget the booze, we drink every day.
Let's go after the girls today.
Watch me take it down.
Watch me take it down.
Get drunk now.
Hit the ground.
String that around.
Leave him alone.
Thank you.
I knew you're a good man.
Don't thank me, buddy.
These girls are not for you.
Megha's for you.
No, no, no..
Every time you said no to me, you've landed in trouble.
Okay.
Last few days..before marriage.
Alright.
Honeymoon suite.
Top floor.
Come on, Sneha.
This party's been organised for you.
Why so serious?
Enjoy it.
You think I don't know that.
...Sid lied to me to attend Sahil's bachelor party.
Don't you know, all men are dogs?
I know about the bachelor's party.
Sahil asked me before going.
And anyway, I trust him completely.
I know he won't do anything wrong.
Relax.
Relax, Sahil.
Just relax.
Later.
Anyway, thanks for this party of yours.
I am really not interested.
What happened?
No..nothing.
Relax.
I am sorry.
- Sahil.
What's wrong?
I'm going.
- Sahil.
No, no, I got to go.
- There's nothing wrong.
No, this is wrong.
Hey.
Stay.
- Sorry.
I can't do this.
- Please don't go.
Please don't go away.
No, I cannot do this.
Sahil..

On the path..of life.
- Sahil.
Listen.
We'll always be together.
- Sneha.
Sneha!
- Why do I see..
"This distance between you and me?
The heart that was delicate as flower.
Turned to amber.
Where my wishes turned to ashes.
If you aren't with me.
Life is worthless.
What do I do..
With the happiness that's missing you.
The prints of our memory..
"Exist in the reposition of time.
Every corner of the heart..
...still holds your promises.
The heart that was delicate as flower.
Turned to amber.
Where my wishes turned to ashes.
If you aren't with me.
Life is worthless.
Hey"
Why did you come here?
- To know..
...why didn't you tell the truth about Shravan to everyone?
That doesn't prove that I didn't make a mistake?
Did you and Megha..
Then what's your fault?
I made a big mistake.
Before the wedding, if I can dare to enter a girl's bedroom.
Then later, I can dare to go anywhere.
Unlike Sneha, I deserve it.
Go on.
Who can return me my love?
Who can get me out of this mess?
Who can help me forget my pain?
O Lord, unite me with my love.
O Lord, return me my life.
O Lord, I don't stand a chance before you.
O Lord, alleviate my pain.
O Lord, unite me with my love.
Oh Lord!
Oh Lord!
Oh Lord!
Oh Lord!
I don't want to go ahead with this marriage?
Oh, God!
What's this new problem now?
Sahil, what are you saying?
Don't you have any shame?
First that, and now this.
Take your uncle Suri.
He only smokes.
He doesn't have any other bad habits.
I always knew this was going to happen.
See, we're in trouble now.
This is a big problem.
Look, son.
We've been married for 22 years.
But we never thought like this.
But you're already..
- Enough!
We won't discuss this anymore.
And no one will talk to Sahil about this.
- Yes.
I will talk to Sneha's papa.
Yes.
I don't want to touch.
- Come on.
Fundoo, tell aunt"
Uncle.
Bless you.
People can be angry over anything"
"but he shouldn't vent it out on food.
I will eat it myself.
- Hey!
It won't taste bitter if I feed you.
Open your mouth.
Chew it!
You should always chew your food properly.
Do you..
love Sneha.
Hey!
Come here.
I got it.
You don't have to say it.
The tears in your eyes..
Is conveying the saga in your heart.
Don't feel shy.
These tears are a strange thing.
Elders have said..
...when the heart's overwhelmed..
...you don't know what to do, can't take a decision..
"That's when you should cry your heart out.
Come on.
Cry.
Cry your heart out.
Cry your heart out.
And let your problems flow out through these tears.
Good!
I really love Sneha, uncle.
I made a big mistake, uncle.
- No, you didn't.
You don't know.
-I know it.
I made a big mistake, uncle.
- No, you didn't.
I know everything.
You were tricked.
Yes.
I know.
I do.
I know all these tricks.
They are dangerous.
I know..that Shravan tricked you into going there.
To that girl.
And I knew you won't do anything.
And my..
My faith won!
I didn't get it, uncle.
I'm not speaking a different language, son.
This isn't new.
This has been happening for really long.
Even we had people like Shravan.
We were instigated too.
I was even misled.
The truth is..
I lost control a few times myself.
It's true.
When I tried to do something.
...I remembered about your mother's love.
And I stopped.
Whenever there's a war between brotherhood..
...and love.
-Yes.
Love always wins.
And that happened with you.
If you had been selfish, you wouldn't have said it to Sneha.
You said it to Sneha yourself.
You cancelled this marriage.
Come on, get ready.
But, uncle.
I thought I cancelled the marriage.
What now?
- What else?
Wear your wedding attire and go get the girl..
Meaning?
- What?
Who cancelled your wedding?
I explained everything to Sneha's papa and..
We don't have much time.
Smp hugging me-
Your marriage is due.
You know, uncle.
I hope you won't mind.
I always thought you're a snoot.
I still am.
Brother Sahil!
Brother Sahil!
- Careful.
Brother Sahil!
Sister-in-law Sneha is missing.
-What?
No need to worry.
This is our own city.
We'll find her.
Understood?
- No, uncle.
I'll go.
And I'll find her.
Help me out.
You're looking pretty.
You aren't ready yet.
The procession will be arriving any minute now.
Hurry up.
You're still carrying that machine on your head.
They are called rollers.
You go on, I've a stomach-ache.
Stomach-ache.
No, no, I can't leave you alone.
- I said go.
Go!
I'll join you later.
Go.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi.
- Hi.
What's your name?
- Ambika.
Ambika.
Sit.
Don't worry.
Like I said, Sahil will bring Sneha on time.
You just control your guests.
Yes.
Don't let anyone know..
"That Sneha's not at home.
- As you say.
Just remember, my honour's at stake here.
I hope you will handle everything?
It's getting late.
Hurry up.
- Coming.
I'm leaving.
Here's your tea?
Do you need anything else?
Then, I'll get ready too.
I've stitched new clothes"
...to wear on Sahil's wedding.
Yes.
Fundoo.
Yes.
- Hello, brother Sahil.
There's a new problem.
- What?
Shravan has told everything to sister-in-law Namrata.
What?
- Congratulations.
She slapped him and left the house.
What a great.
Will this wedding take place or not?
Uncle.
- Yes.
Is everything okay?
- Yes, it is.
But, uncle, you said Sahil will be arriving with Sneha.
- Yes.
That isn't Sahil.
Then who is he?
Phandeshwar Nath Tiwari.
Fundoo.
That's the servant.
You mean..my wife's welcoming a servant.
He works for us.
But my wife is welcoming a servant.
My wife is welcoming a servant.
- Handle everything.
Don't hug him.
He'll cling on to you for no reason.
How about me?
Uncle.
Where are you?
Uncle, I was co-ordinating with brother.
I'm coming from the airport.
Uncle.
- You won't find her at the airport.
I know, I know, I know.
Stop being so filmy, and get real.
- Yes!
And think where she could be.
Uncle, you just handle everything there..
...I will come back only with her.
- Well done.
Uncle.
Do something, uncle.
It's his marriage, what will uncle do?
Uncle will have to do something.
One, two, three..
It's a day of happiness.
It's a day of happiness.
He'll get a lot of gifts and blessings.
It's my son's wedding.
Play the music.
It's my son's wedding.
Play the music.
It's my son's wedding.
Yes, brother.
- Sahil, Sneha's at Lodhi garden.
Okay.
- Now.
Come here now.
Sister-in-law.
- I'm looking for her.
No, sister-in-law's in the taxi right here.
What?
- Listen.
There's ajam at Cannaught Place.
You can get here.
Come here right now.
Thanks, buddy.
Thanks, thanks, thanks.
You come here.
- Copy that.

So that you can break my heart, and my trust again.
It's over between us, Shravan.
I've understood what love us.
What it means to loose it?
I promise you I..
I won't get up in the morning..
...until you don't wake me up lovingly.
I won't wear my tie until you don't tie it.

I've finished my quota of mistakes in this one.
Now..in all the other lifetimes.
...I want to give you love.
If you make another mistake, I will never forgive you.
I am sorry.

Uncle.
- Yes.
Everyone's finished dancing.
All the uncle, aunts, even the guests danced with us.
Even the band's tired.
How much more are you going to make us dance?
Enough singing and dancing.
The auspicious time for the marriage is passing-by.
- Yes.
Can we go inside now?
- Yes.
But, uncle, he..
- Come on.
But..
- Let's go.
Come.
- Let's go in.
Come on.
Is there alcohol inside?
I knew I will find you here.
Go away, Sahil.
Look, I know you're angry.
I don't want to see your face.
- Okay, fine.
Just don't go.
You don't want to see my face, then don't.
Just give me one chance to speak, please.
Just trust me.
Look.
Whatever happened last night.
Nothing happened..
Whatever happened last night.
It was a bachelor's party.
So, Sid got me drunk.
You know, normally I don't drink too much.
You saw me at the wrong place, at the wrong time.
You..
I was coming out of her room when you caught me.
What explanation are you going to give me?
You lied to me each time, Sahil.
You were in the restaurant with Megha, right?
And what did you tell me?
I was such a fool.
I always trusted you more than myself.
It was my biggest mistake.
And since when did you become so manipulative?
Or is it just Megha's influence?
Sahil.
Sahil.
Here I am.
Sahil.
What are you doing there?
Wait.
I'll be right back.
Anybody there?
Please help.
Sneha, don't go.
- Oh my, God!
Sahil, give me your hand.
- Listen.
Yes.
- Pull my shirt,I'll try to come in.
Pull.

Guys. 9N5-.
I have an announcement to make.
- What?
What are you talking about?
As all of you know.
I and Sneha came to this place 15 years ago for the first time.
You remember?
- Of course.
I had bought a teddy bear for Sneha.
We were 8 years old.
That teddy bear costed me 1000 bucks.
And Sneha lost the teddy bear here.
Really?
- So she had robbed for the first time here.
Second time.
We were in college.
We came here just for the sake of it.
Ice cream.
- Ma'am sent me to get an ice cream.
I ran for a kilometer.
I got ajolt again.
Third time it was her birthday.
I bought a dress for her which didn't fit her.
So mean.
That was years ago, Saahil.
Today she has given me yet another shock.
Shock worth millions.
What?
- What do you mean?
What?
- Yes.
What?
Sam.
Saahil.
Oh God!
Sneha, will you marry me?
Yes.
Yes.
Sneha has agreed.
Oh God.
O God.
Sweetheart, love is such a sweet thing.
Love is a source of life.
On an obscure picture, love is a change.
Ocean in a drop.
And a lifetime in a moment.
Should I bow down or cast away every evil eye?
O God, what should I do?

O God, what should I do?

My desires are running wild.

I have lost control.
My heart's going wild.

Saahil, how are you.

Hello, everybody.
Champ.
Uncle, you are looking really smart.
How is your marriage coming on?
Super hit.
Since you have trained me.
Cheers.
- Here we go.
Dude, what about the bachelor's party?
Bachelor's party.
What are you saying?
I'll organise the best strippers for you.
I swear.
A gift from me to you.
Brother, please.
I am one woman guy.
That's a great line.
Will work on Sneha.
Not on me.
Okay.
We are buddies.
We are friends.
Come on.
You need not hide it from me.
Let's go.
Two beers.
- Okay, sir.
Brother, I am telling the truth.
I have never even looked at another girl.
So you are saying you have not done anything"
...with any other girl apart from Sneha.
I haven't done anything with Sneha either.
We are waiting for our marriage.
It means you haven't done anything with any girl to this day.
No.
Oh.
Now I get it.
-What?
But you shouldn't ruin Sneha's life like this.
I understand that you like boys over girls.
That's okay.
It's legal now.
Not a problem.
Brother, please.
What are you saying?
I am not interested in boys whatsoever.
I'm perfectly straight.
Absolutely normal.
Normal.
Straight.
My foot.
You haven't done anything with the one you girl you have.
You haven't done anything with any girl.
You call yourself normal.
You are not my brother.
Someone must have swapped you in the hospital.
Here is your beer.
- To hell with your beer.
I need whisky now.
Enjoyed?
- A lot.
Hen's party is the one you should enjoy.
I know.
Dance, song.
Wedding.
You know that I am not interested in all of that.
We should have a hen's party.
It's been six years to your marriage.
Have kids at least now.
One has kids only once the honeymoon is over.
Correct.
Our honeymoon is still going strong.
Naughty-
Okay.
Listen, I have fixed the hotel and menu.
At her behest.
Have a check.
- Sure.
Come.
- Alright.
Champ.
- Hi uncle.
Rockstar uncle.
What's up with Saahil?
He hasn't done anything with girl till date.
Is he gay?
No.
Thankfully he isn't gay.
He is like I will do it after marriage and not before marriage.
And all that.
Look, you are my disciple.
You won't give up so easily.
Keep at it.
Uncle, I'll fix this celibate at any cost.
Stay away from girls.
Okay.
This advice at this age of mine.
Does it sound nice?
Bye, Saahil.
You can shut the bar.
Your astrologer's prediction is going to come true..
...because this marriage of yours is going to break.
You will have to remarry.
You are drunk.
I am not drunk.
But when you come to your senses you'll know.
What's problem in loving one single girl?
I mean you had told me.
And you are with sister-in-law since so long.
I don't know why you are telling me these things.
It's your accountant.
Bye Saahil.
Veena, my baby.
How are you?
I love you too.
No.
I am a little busy with the wedding.
Yes.
Yes.
She is here.
I'll meet.
I'll meet.
Once I am free.
Champ.
Why aren't you answering my call?
I don't want to talk to you, brother.
You are cheating on sister-in-law.
You could be like this"
- Could be.
Be realistic.
This is how God has made us.
You must have heard the saying.
All men are dogs.
Yes, I have.
This is the biggest truth.
Dude, we are dogs.
Trust me.
There is cheating in our hormones.
Don't..don't justify yourself, brother.
Please.
It is the truth.
You have heard this.
A king has 20 queens.
Have you heard that a queen has 20 kings?
That doesn't happen.
Not possible.
Actually a man gets bored being with just one woman.
A woman doesn't get bored.
And when a man gets bored his hormones start attacking him.
His frustration increases.
And his takes his frustration out on his wife and kids.
They start fighting and come to blows.
And finally they get divorced.
Understand.
So the moral of the story is..
...to have a happily married life, you must cheat on your wife.
Brother, why are you telling me all this now?
I am about to get married.
I am saving your marriage.
My friend.
Brother, I am not interested in your hormones and hormonal theory.
Can you please keep your hormones to yourself?
Son, don't ever underestimate hormones.
Let alone humans.
Hormones haven't spared even Gods.
For example Lord Rama.
- What?
Lord Rama was the ideal man, brother.
He loved Mother Sita all his life.
Correct.
You are right.
Hormones didn't stop hounding Him.
He had to assume Krishna's avatar to satisfy them.
I got you, baby.
I got you.
I'm sorry.
Did I disturb?
- Not at all.
I was explaining to him how to be a good husband.
Teach him well, brother-in-law.
I want him just like you.
I will make him just like me.
- Really?
I was looking for sister.
Where is she?
She must be talking to her tailor.
Okay.
I'll go find her.
See you.
See you.
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.
So sweet.
You'll ruin the life of such a sweet girl.
You know that?
Selfish man.
I am selfish?
You are unbelievable.
Please go from here.
I don't want to talk to you.
I'll go away.
But you'll remember me when your hormones start to kick in.
Okay.
Go.
Just go.
- Hormones.
When they kick in you'll realise.
- Okay.
Do you remember?
I was telling you about this book.
It is called before the heart attacks.
Have you read it?
No.
-You haven't?
You really have to.
You know.
75% men cheat on their women..
...In the first week of their marriage.
Can you imagine that?
I was so shocked.
Saahil.
Saahil.
-What?
Are you okay?
- Yes.
Of course.
Anyway, I was telling you that..
Saahil.
Saahil.
- No.
Just like that.
Saahil.
Saahil, lam talking to you, right?
You seem lost.
Saahil.
Saahil.
Are you alright?
Are you sure?
Yes, of course.
I am fine.
I am fine.
- Are you alright?
Absolutely fine.
Darling, let's go home.
I think you'll be much better.
'Hormones.
When they kick in you'll realise.'
Sir, your sex on the beach.
Saahil, what's wrong with you?
I ordered it.
What are you doing?
I am feeling really hot.
I am just going into the pool for a dip.
Saahil, where are you going?
Careful, Saahil.
Oh God.
'But you'll remember me when your hormones start to kick in.'
What are you doing?
Saahil.
Let go of decency.
Let go of all inhibitions.
Let go of decency.
Let go of all inhibitions.
There is beauty all around.
The world is full of beauties.
Let go of control.

Brother.
Hole three, sir?
- Yes.
Sir.
Come on.
Behind every successful man there is a woman.
Come.
That's true.
If you get such success from one single girl..
"Then how much success will you get from loads of girls.
Brother, even if I agree with you for once..
"But what if Sneha comes to know of that.
What I am about to tell you is a really big secret.
Okay?
We men have it hidden deep in our hearts.
Okay.
It's like a code.
Alright?
Brotherhood.
- Brotherhood?
Right.
Brotherhood.
- Brotherhood.
We men have hidden this secret in our hearts since ages.
You understand.
The great saint guru flirt had written this.
Guru flirt.
What nonsense.
Stop kidding.
Take his name with respect.
Call him the great saint guru flirt.
What is wrong with you, man?
Guru flirt wrote a rule book.
In it was mentioned how we men should cheat on women.
If we men get to know of these rules..
...then these women can do us no harm.
I'll tell you that.
You know that.
And I'll teach you all these rules.
But remember.
With great powers comes greater responsibility.
Now guru flirt has become spider man.
Superheroes don't marry.
Got it?
Spiderman.
Batman.
And even Hanuman didn't marry.
Guru flirt was a rock star.
But I must tell you that it's not easy.
All this is not that easy.
Sir.
- Thank you.
The best lose in this game.
Brother, I am nervous.
Tell me the first rule.
Let me tell you some experiences of my life..
...before telling you the rule.
- Okay.
It's been like a few years to me and Nammo's marriage.
Go to office.
- I hate working.
Bye-bye.
As you guys are aware that this year has been really nice.
I think we have done a great job.
Congratulations to all of you and I think we should..
Tell me now.
Tell me now.
Excuse me.
Hi baby.
Sure.
Why not?
Okay.
Bye.
You say something.
So.. my wife.
God, don't ever change our lives.
I wish we spend every day like this.
Right.
Oh God.
I love you so much.
- Love you too.
I need a detailed report of the..
Okay.
I need a detailed report of the U.K consignment.
And I want you to check out on the Hyderabad and Chennai offices.
God, don't ever change our lives.
I wish we spend every day like this.
Right.
Good night, baby.
Good night.
Listen, I don't have time for dinner.
We'll go when I have the time.
Yes, right.
I have been hearing since quite a few years now.
Don't give me this deprived wife nonsense.
Okay.
Don't.
You know, Veena.
I don't feel like going home these days.
So don't go.
Relax here today.
No, it's not that.
I don't feel like going home every day.
Life has become really monotonous.
Really.
It's like life has become really boring.
There's absolutely no excitement in my life.
This?
- This is a B-cup size.
Hey baby.
- Where are you?
I'm in the office.
Why?
What happened?
Really.
I was missing you.
I love you for that.
Okay, listen.
I'm in a meeting.

So I'll catch you later.
Okay?
I love you, baby.

I am showing.
I mean I can't wait.
Take off your clothes.
Take off your clothes.
Wait.
Fine.
Fine.
Okay.
Oh my God!
That is so good.
Oh God!
I just..
You know it is so hot.
How dare you?
Cheat.
I'm sorry.
I doubted you.
It's okay.
Well done.
You did it perfectly.
Okay.
Also put an earring that goes with it.
I love you.
And I am extremely sorry.
Stop.
You mean you had planned all this?
Yes.
Guilt.
Guilt is a man's biggest enemy.
Half of the people get caught because of guilt.
So the first rule.
You know when you cheat on your wife.
You get a guilty feeling.
Give this feeling to your wife..
...before we feel it.
Make her feel guilty.
Since that day your sister-in-law has never doubted me..
...even by mistake.
I am good.
I am so..

I can't find it.
Were you wearing a bra?
Hey..
What kind of a woman do you think I am?
Tell me something.
Where is..bra..
Why are you getting worried?
Its price is just 60 rupees.
To hell with 60 rupees.
If my wife finds your bra, she'll cut me into 60 pieces.
So tell her that it's hers.
Right.
Don't irrigate me.
Come on.
Find the bra.
Then what happened?

- What!
Oh my God!
I don't believe that.
You are just impossible.
You can do whatever you want.
I am going.
I ruined my life by marrying you.
- So what happened to them now?
I don't know.
- Because of your papa we will never reach the function.
Come quickly, dear.
Very strong perfume.
Do you know?
What's the most dangerous thing in a woman?
What?
- Her nose.
She can sniff everything.
Do you know what's more dangerous than nose?
- What?
The power that a woman has to sniff another woman.
That's why you should buy the strongest, most concentrated.
...cologne available in the market.
So that your wife can never sniff your mistress.
Smart.
- Give me your perfume.
Here.
Spray it nicely.
Here.
Yeah!

I love you, Sneha!
'I love you, Sneha!
'
Today we have got engaged.
Engaged.
Engaged.
Why do they show echo in Hindi films?
WOW!
I feel alive again.
WOW!
What happened to you?
Do you know?
Mom and dad had a love marriage.
Really?
Seeing them, you can't guess.
Hey.
What happened?
I was kidding.
Saahil, since childhood I have seen my parents fighting.
I always felt their marriage is a big mistake.
But today, when I found out that they were also like us..
...I mean, at some point even they were this much in love.
I am really worried.
We won't be like them, right?
Look.
For me we got married 15 years ago.
We are just being official.
Right?
And not much has changed in these 15 years.
I don't even remember any serious fight between us.
Yes.
You have hit me 5-6 times.
I don't know if we can call that a fight.
The seventh time.
I promise you.
No matter what happens.
We will never change.
Promise?
I hate drop outs.
I hate people who drop out of their course.
It's the insult of brotherhood.
I mean..
- You can say whatever you want.
I can't deceive Sneha.
You don't know what she is going through.
-I know.
I know.
Her parents used to fight, right?
That has to happen, obviously.
Her father is also like you.
Very straight.
Didn't listen to hormones.
He is regretting.
I don't want your children to have..
...the same childhood that Sneha had.
Shravan.
- What happened?
The same thing that had to happen.
As usual uncle Surya is late.
His flight has been delayed by an hour.
Uncle Surya has this habit of coming late.
Very soon late will be affixed to his name.
An hour.
Come on.
Let's have drinks.
In the afternoon.
There is no fixed time for drinking.
Come on.
What to explain?
I have to explain how to control your wife..
...how to handle her.
Look at this.
You are teaching me?
If I start practicing now, I will learn by then.
See this.
This is called a dedicated student.
Teach him.
Is it his marriage or your marriage?
Shut up.
I don't know why I married you.
Foolish jerk!
This..this is men's plight after marriage.
Can I join you?
No.
I am sorry, ma'am.
It's taken.
Come on.
Trust me.
You won't regret it.
Look, ma'am.
I am not interested.
And I told you.
It's already taken.
Damn!
Did you see, brother?
Not everyone is like you.
He fought with his wife.
But he is still loyal.
Baby, I missed you so much.
Hello!
What took you so long?
- You know the Delhi traffic.
Sonny, it doesn't matter to hormones..
"Whether it's a man or a woman.
Got it?
People like you do discrimination in the society.
Got it?
I love hormones.
Naughty-
What happened?
Brother, I am tense.
Tell me the next rule quickly.
The next rule.
Truth always triumphs.
Truth always triumphs.
If you ever make a blunder in life, tell your wife the truth.
Brother, I don't understand.
No need to understand, son.
Look ahead.
The live telecast is going on.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Look.
Look.
- What is he doing?
Look.
Look.
Look.
- Watch what happens next.
Shall I tell you something?
The pleasure of kissing a foreigner is different.
Congratulations.
Your marriage is also fixed.
You are marrying.
Aunt has not come?
- Aunt is dead.
What?
- I mean, she is bringing the luggage.
She is coming.
She is coming.
She is coming.
She is coming.
She is coming.
Do you have a cigarette?
Cigarette?
Here.
- Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Lighter.
Hold this.
Hold this.
Hurry UP-
Uncle, cigarette.
-Yes.
Cigarette.
But I love it.
I love it.
Give me your hand.
Congratulations.
Where did you disappear, leaving me alone?
I was searching for you.
I see.
I came out and was flirting with a tall, fair, beautiful.
...foreigner air-hostess.
And I kissed her.
Come closer.
- In front of everyone?
I told you.
Come closer.
You are again lying.
You were smoking cigarette secretly, weren't you?
I have forbidden you so many times.
Don't smoke.
Still, why don't you listen to me?
Really, Saahil.
I just don't know what to do with your uncle.
Do you know?
One day I went to his office.
He was smoking with his secretary.
Next time when I came home..
...I saw him smoking with our neighbor.
One day when I was not at home..
...he was smoking with the maid.
Maid?
- I really don't know what to do with you.
Kittu, keep the luggage in the car.
I am leaving.
I wish she is leaving forever.
It will be great.
Shall I tell you something?
I love wives.
But other's wives.
Guilty.
Guilty.
If I don't find my beloved, I search for him on the streets.
My beloved has come.
- Yes.
My beloved has come.
- Yes.
My beloved has come.
- Yes.
Were you waiting for me to go?
Can I go dance?
- Come on.
Hey!
Go.
Go.
WOW!
Wow!
Wow!
My stomach hurts.
I wonder what they gave me to eat.
The marriage preparations are going on fine?
- Yes, uncle.
Anything amiss?
Anything missing?
No, uncle.
It's great.
Are you speaking the truth?
Yes.
Young man.
Since childhood you pushed Saahil into bad habits.
I didn't say anything.
I thought you are a kid.
You will reform.
But you didn't reform.
Now Saahil is getting married.
Don't teach him anything wrong..
...or try to teach him your philosophy.
What?
- Okay, uncle.
Be a nice man.
Yes, uncle.
Put some more.
Look at my size.
You want to drink?
- Yes.
It's the occasion.
It's not.
We have to go to Sneha.
- I will see you.
Come on.
What happened?
Uncle has gone crazy.
He has lost the plot.
Why?
What happened?
- He doesn't understand brotherhood.
Forget about him.
Listen.
When soldiers go for war, they learn how to fire a gun.
They don't read the instruction manual.
I don't understand.
Look..
I am giving you theoretical knowledge.
Right?
If you want to win the exam of marriage..
...It's very important to apply it practically.
But I still don't get it.
What?
What's the problem?
You can't see the problem?
- No.
I can't see a single beautiful face here.
We need a girl.
Girl?
- You know, to experiment, we need a girl.
You know, what we need?
We need a bomb.
A girl who is..very hot.
What are you saying?
What bomb?
Hello, cheater.
- Hi.
Megha, hi.
Wow!
- Hi.
What a pleasant surprise!
I mean, you are here.
It's not a pleasant surprise for me.
You left me.
And are marrying Sneha.
You cheat.
Nice girl.
Megha.
Oops!
I am stuck.
Now I will have to go and meet everyone.
Hello, uncle.
Hello, aunt.
- Right.
Well, I see you.
-Yeah.
Please.
Hi, Megha.
- Damn!
Damn!
What is she doing here?
- Who is she?
She is my family friend.
Last year I got her marriage proposal.
I rejected it.
After that she went to Kolkata.
I don't know why she has come back.
Sneha must have invited her.
Sneha hates her.
Really?
- Yeah.
I don't know how she will react when she will see her here.
I am..
I am dead.
I like her.
She is good.
Experiment.
God!
Well, as expected, it was terrible.
I mean, I don't know why people can't forget their past.
As such, you are not feeling awkward to see me here, are you?
No.
No.
What are you saying?
It's fine.
In fact, I am glad you are here.
You are looking fabulous.
I must say.
Well, I am here on a business trip.
Dad told me you are getting married.
And you know, I thought I will come along and congratulate.
And don't worry.
Isn't she the same Megha about whom you keep talking?
What?
- Yes.
He really misses you.
lam telling you.
By the way, I am Shravan.
I am his cousin.
- Hi.
He really likes you.
In fact, he was telling me that you should attend all functions.
You have to.
- Really?
You have to.
Me?
- Yes.
Look, don't say no.
You shouldn't break the groom's heart.
You know what I mean?
- Well..
Last few days of his freedom.
You have to be with him.
I love him.
He is a great guy.
He likes you.
You got to be around.
I will see you in a minute.
Bye.
Saahil..are you sure about this?
Yeah.
I mean, of course.
You should stay.
Mom, I will just be back in a minute.
Okay?
Stay
- Two minutes.
That's a surprise.
Hi.
- Hi.
Hi.
Hi, Sneha.
Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Sneha, I am sorry.
But I didn't like your dress.
You know, her dressing sense has always been a problem.
But I hope your wedding attire is better than this.
Because on that day I am going to wear a very beautiful sari.
I am sure, Megha.
- Don't worry.
I will try not to look more beautiful than you.
By the way, honestly, I was finding it awkward..
...to attend your marriage.
But Saahil insisted so much.
That I couldn't refuse.
Is that so?
- Well, you guys have a great wedding.
Have a good time.
Yeah?
- Thank you.
Bye, Saahil.
- Bye.
See you.
No.
I didn't.
Sneha.
Oh God!
What do I do?
That's it.
What happened?
What happened?
Don't you feel ashamed to ask that?
For the first time Sneha and I had a major fight.
Now even I believe the priest.
This marriage won't work out.
I am gone.
I am done.
I am done.
You worry a lot.
Right now, you have to worry about that girl.
You know, the one on whom we will apply the rule.
I think Megha is perfect for that.
Why do you want me to get divorced before my marriage, brother?
She is Megha.
I had got her marriage proposal last year.
She was in love with me.
Sneha hates her.
That's the reason why.
Got it?
She wants to get back at Sneha.
She will do anything for you.
It's an ego clash, buddy.
What if because of this ego clash she tells Sneha the truth..
...and tries to break our marriage?
Do you want to break my marriage?
- No.
I have another rule for that.
But no such thing will happen.
Trust me.
I am done.
I am done.
Please.
I am done.
Please, brother"
- Hello, cheater.
Hi.
You..what are you..
You had messaged me.
Let's have lunch together.
When did I..when did I do that?
Why are you feeling shy?
So what?
Go and have lunch with her.
You must go to that place.
China Gold.
And over there okra..
Sorry.
Butter garlic crab.
Brilliant.
Really?
- Brilliant.
Okay.
Let's just go there.
- Yeah.
Go there.
- Awesome.
Let's go.
Yeah.
Go.
- We are getting late.
You message and then show attitude.
Brother.
- Saahil.
Hold on.
I will just come.
My things.
What happened?
- You forgot your phone yesterday.
Saahil.
- Saahil.
Let's go.
- Lunch.
Quickly.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Time for butter garlic crab.
Come on.
Watch drama unfold.
- You are getting married.
Watch drama unfold.
- Stop it!
Yes, please.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
Stop it.
What's wrong with you?
What happened now?
Enough of lectures.
Time for exam.
What exam..
Sneha.
- What?
Saahil.
- What?
What is he doing here?
Who is that girl?
Who is with him?
Hi.
Why are you feeling shy?
Come with me.
Come.
- This is embarrassing.
We are waiting for you for so long.
We are waiting since two hours.
- Hi, Sneha.
You know, darling.
Now hear the truth from them.
Both love each other.
- What?
Oh my God!
Okay.
Relax.
You know, Sneha is like my little sister.
She won't tell anyone.
Right?
- Right.
Of course.
What happened is that they met in Kolkata.
And they fell in love.
Her father didn't approve of this alliance.
So that day at the party, Megha told me..
...Saahil, can we invite him for the wedding?
I said, Of course.
What"
- You don't understand, darling.
In our marriage somebody else will also settle down.
How cool is that!
I love it.
- Thank you so much.
So kind of you.
And you doubt me.
You were..
Fine.
Actually, she was feeling shy.
She didn't want to tell you.
- Leave me.
What are you doing?
What is this?
Calm down, brother.
- Brother?
We are there.
We will convince uncle.
Which uncle..
-You don't understand.
Come on.
- Tushar.
Neha.
What are you doing?
Listen"
- I am his fiancée.
Fiancée?
- No.
No, Neha.
Neha.
- Tushar.
Don't show me your face again.
- Neha.
Neha.
I am sorry, Neha.
- Go away.
Tushar.
- Don't talk to me.
Please go.
Come.
I hate guys who cheat.
Because of him..
- Just relax.
...men are ruined.
- Calm down.
Calm down.
L..
- Just calm down.
I am really sorry.
I doubted you.
I am so sorry, Saahil.
It's okay.
You passed with flying colors, brother.
Don't talk to me, brother.
You trapped me.
It was a test.
- Yeah.
Right.
What if I had got caught?
Do you know?
I was torn.
From where is it torn, sir?
I selected the best quality cloth.
Who is talking to you?
Quiet.
You are my student, buddy.
You can't fail.
Yeah.
Right.
What about that poor boy?
He was ruined because of us.
He is a loser.
Why are you worrying for him?
These dedicated boys deserve it.
Forget about him.
No matter what you say.
I am done with all this brotherhood stuff.
I escaped by a whisker.
I won't take a risk again.
Did you understand?
Why do you keep threatening me?
You are not doing a favor on me by learning.
I am doing a favor on you by teaching you.
Got it?
So please don't do a favor.
Don't do it.
Please.
Done.
Finished.
Over.
I won't do it.
- Don't do it.
Had you learnt this last rule, you would have never..
...faced any problem in your life.
See you at the wedding.
- Yes.
Fine.
Bro.
You will know when you will get divorced.
Brother.
It's hormones.
- No.
No.
You can't escape.
You handle your hormones.
Did you see uncle's plight?
Do you want to be like that?
I won't be like uncle.
Do you want to keep your wife happy?
This is the only way.
Hi, uncle.
You want to kiss her?
No.
I don't smoke.
Please.
He is my nephew.
What will you do if aunt finds out?
Kiss me.
Please.
Harry, you are again smoking.
I told you.
Don't smoke.
I can't find the bra.
Where is the bra?
Darn you.
The kid is getting married here.
What are you looking for?
What are you doing here?
Sneha has left.
She wouldn't have married a cheater like you.
No.
- Hi, cheater.
- No.
You look so sexy while sleeping.
Megha, please.
Please, Megha.
Megha, please.
- What's going on?
I mean.. my suspicion was right?
Wake up, Saahil.
You are dreaming.
Wake up.
Oh my God!
Saahil, see your face.
Relax.
We were just joking.
- Sorry.
I am really sorry.
Should you..wake me up like that?
Actually, we have resolved our differences.
And I am so glad that you invited her for the wedding.
Well, I guess I should give the would-be bride..
...and groom some time.
Well, I will see you guys down.
See you, guys.
- See you.
Bye.
I know what you are thinking.
- What?
As to how come Megha and I are together.
Right?
- Yes.
But just think about it, Saahil.
First you refused to marry her.
And now, Tushar also cheated on her.
Right?
- Yes.
I just thought that the least we could do is be sweet to her.
Anyway, get ready quickly.
We are going for dinner.
Okay?
We?
- Yes.
Megha is also coming along.
Just make it quick, darling.
Okay?
- Okay.
Until now I spoke the truth.
Both fought like cats and dogs.
I lied once.
And..
Brother" it works.
Fourth rule.
Deny completely.
If your wife sees you with another girl, deny it clearly.
Say no on her face.
And you should deny so confidently.
"That your wife shouldn't trust her own eyes.
Brother..this is practically impossible.
No one doubts what one sees.
What happened?
- See that.
What?
- Aunt Babita.
She takes pills the whole day.
I am feeling sleepy.
- Aunt, you are here.
I am searching for you for so long.
- Is that so?
I have to give you the pill.
You take such good care of me, Jhandu.
Aunt, I told you so many times.
My name is not Jhandu.
It's Fandu.
Fandu.
He is so forgetful, Farida.
I am Gunjan.
So who is Farida?
Come, I will show you.
Do you know?
She is not ill.
Uncle Popat is unwell.
And she takes pills.
- What illness is this?
He is a dude.
Popat.
- Yes!
What happened?
- What are you doing?
What am I doing?
Didn't you feel ashamed?
- For what?
For what you are doing with her.
Which girl are you talking about?
- This..
This girl who was here.
Where are you going?
Where are you running?
- I am not running.
I am here.
Make a cup of tea for me.
- Tea?
What has happened to you?
It didn't make any difference to you?
What has happened to you?
You are saying weird things.
I am saying weird things.
Me?
What were you doing with that girl?
Which girl?
- That..
What will you have with tea?
Send whoever you want.
I mean, whatever you have.
Damn!
Uncle Popat.
He actually did this?
WOW!
I mean, that's genius.
Poor aunt Babita.
She has been to 8-10 psychiatrists.
No use.
She is taking pills.
And uncle Popat is having fun.
Brother, I must say.
We have such a lecherous family.
Shut up!
Lecherous!
Kittu!
- Yes, mama.
Kittu, tell me the truth.
Did you take Rs.200 from my purse?
No.
Why will I take money from your purse?
Kittu, I am warning you.
Yes.
Don't lie.
Yesterday you asked Rs.200 from me.
Yes.
As ii you gave me a cheque of crates.
I will slap you.
I didn't give you money.
You must have stolen it.
Kittu, I know you.
Mother, I swear on you.
I didn't take any money.
Kittu, here is your stuff.
It was for Rs.250. I bought it for Rs.200.
You fool.
You steal.
And swear on me falsely.
Idiot.
lam fed up of father and son.
His father faints all the time.
And son steals.
Robber.
Idiot.
Stupid.
Thief.
You fool, this rule applies on wives and not on mothers.
If you use it on mother, you will be slapped like that.
He was trying.
Well done.
The wedding party is here.
Come and groove.
Listen.
- Yes.
Go and perform the henna ritual for Saahil.
So that the kids can start the musical function.
Or else it will be quite late.
- Okay.
Come.
The wedding party is here.
Come and groove.
I don't like the smell of henna.
Why?
- I don't know.
The smell of henna is so romantic.
It's ajoyous occasion.
Dance.
It's ajoyous occasion.
Dance.
Do one thing.
Tell your wife to finish the ritual quickly.
So that we can begin the musical function.
Or else it will be very late.
- Is everything going fine?
Everything is fine.
Check on the catering.
No problem?
- Don't worry.
Come and groove.
Have a blast.
Where were you?
At least come on time for family functions.
Well, I..
Yes.
Done?
- Yes.
Done?
- Yes.
I know what you are going to say.
You are going to say you were with a girl.
I know you.
You were smoking secretly.
I can still smell the smoke on you.
So don't lie to me.
You got it?
Listen, leave all this.
Come and see Mrs. Dillon's solitaires.
Come.
-Yes.
Coming.
Go.
Sorry.
Hi, Harry.
-Will you marry me?
What?
- God bless you.
What is this?
- It's not real.
It's tattoo.
Why are you looking at me?
Go and see your would-be bride.
It's ajoyous occasion.
Dance.
Apply henna.
Hello.
Popat, what are you doing with her?
- What am I doing?
What are you doing, clinging to this girl?
What are you saying?
When you are here, can I do anything with a girl?
You are holding her hand.
- Holding her hand?
Now you will say..
I kissed her.
You did it.
You kissed her.
I saw it.
Isn't she the same girl who was in our bedroom?
You see the same girl.
At least see some other girl.
Give me some credit.
I will have to change your medicine.
Otherwise you won't change the girl.
Go.
Come on.
I will change your pill.
Come.
- Yes.
I doubt him needlessly.
Look guys, I am high on brandy.
I am high on brandy.
I am high on brandy.
'Bra.

Come, join us.
Alright.
- Come.
See this.
- Beautiful.
Saahil is trying to find his name.
Is this Saahil?
This.. this..
- This one?
- S..
Isn't it the one?
- Damn!
It's my boss's phone.
Can you just pick it up, Saahil?
Can you just quickly pick it up?
- I..
Saahil, please put it next to my ear.
- What are you doing?
How do I pick it up?
Is this the one?
- Yes.
Hello.

Thanks, Shravan.
You are welcome.
Just don't fall in love.
Okay?
I just want him to have fun.
That's it.
I will take care of it.
- Bye.
Hey cheater.
Megha, this is wrong.
I know.
I know you love Sneha a lot and all that crap.
You are getting married after two days.
And I don't want to waste time over stupid lunches and dinners.
Shravan told me.
You are also attracted towards me.
What's wrong with you?
I am going to get married.
Your phone.
Saahil saw and he found it.
Really.
- Yeah.
Guys.
Guys, the only good thing about marriage..
...Is bachelor's party.
Yes!
- Absolutely.
It's Priya's call.
Oh God!
Today is Friday.
What happened?
- Saahil, I have to go home.
Why?
What happened?
- I had to go to my in-laws.
I completely forgot.
- Pick up the phone.
You are gone.
Saahil, your aunt.
Are you crazy?
I am getting married.
Sam, your granny.
Are you crazy?
We used her last time at Raghu's bachelor's party.
What do I do?
Damn!
Will my grandpa do?
It's been only five years since he died.
It's safe.
It's safe.
Yes.
It will do.
- Guys.
Hello.
Yes, Priya.
Priya, I was coming home.
I got Gagan's call on the way.
His grandpa passed away.
I know.
It's sad.
I will have to be with him.
I have to support him.
Poor guy doesn't have anyone.
I hope you understand, baby.
Yes.
And please tell mom and dad that.
...next week we will meet for dinner.
I love you, sweetheart.
Thank you so much for understanding.
Yeah.
Okay.
Bye.
Thank you, grandpa.
Let's have some fun, guys.
Gagan, thanks.
I love you.
I don't lie.
I don't lie.
Have you made all the arrangements?
- Yes, aunt.
Have you kept all the veneration items in the car?
Yes, I did.
What about the water of Ganges?
We've packed everything, aunt.
I don't have to worry as long as you're here.
Here.
- Sneha.
Yes.
- Keep this inside.
While leaving, pray in our family deity's temple.
- Okay.
We'll be back soon.
By tomorrow.
Go on.
- Let's go.
Call me when you get there.
Give that.
We need some Coniac shots.
I'm still wearing this.
Where are you sticking your hand in?
Sister-in-law, what's his problem?
Inder, I am fed up of him.
Two years after our marriage..
...he started looking for something.
And he's still looking for it.
He can't find it.
I'm fed up..
- Sonia.
Call them up.
Why are you tensed now?
That confectioner sent the wrong sweets.
Mrs. Gunjan should've been worried about that.
Hello.
Dear?
- Yes.
Where's Sahil?
He's gone out with his friends.
- Strange.
He's getting married day after tomorrow.
So why party now with friends?
The children these days, care less for the rituals"
...and are more concerned about partying.
What do they call it?
Bachelor party.
- Bachelor party!
No need to worry.
Shravan's with him.
That's what I'm worried about.
Something for your mind, your body and your soul.
It's the power to arouse.
The powers.
I see.
I don't want to.
I don't want to.
I see.
I don't want to.
I don't want to.
Where have you brought me?
We were supposed to go directly to the temple.
This is a kind of temple, Sneha.
Okay, now please open this.
Okay, okay.
Relax.
Surprise!
You know, why can't our wife dance like this with us?
Shut up!
Henpecked husband.
- Forget him.
We're with angels, and you're thinking about those witches.
Shut up, guys.
- That's my leg.
But Sahil, Shravan's filled our life with fun.
Yes.
Booze and girls.
Forget the booze, we drink every day.
Let's go after the girls today.
Watch me take it down.
Watch me take it down.
Get drunk now.
Hit the ground.
String that around.
Leave him alone.
Thank you.
I knew you're a good man.
Don't thank me, buddy.
These girls are not for you.
Megha's for you.
No, no, no..
Every time you said no to me, you've landed in trouble.
Okay.
Last few days..before marriage.
Alright.
Honeymoon suite.
Top floor.
Come on, Sneha.
This party's been organised for you.
Why so serious?
Enjoy it.
You think I don't know that.
...Sid lied to me to attend Sahil's bachelor party.
Don't you know, all men are dogs?
I know about the bachelor's party.
Sahil asked me before going.
And anyway, I trust him completely.
I know he won't do anything wrong.
Relax.
Relax, Sahil.
Just relax.
Later.
Anyway, thanks for this party of yours.
I am really not interested.
What happened?
No..nothing.
Relax.
I am sorry.
- Sahil.
What's wrong?
I'm going.
- Sahil.
No, no, I got to go.
- There's nothing wrong.
No, this is wrong.
Hey.
Stay.
- Sorry.
I can't do this.
- Please don't go.
Please don't go away.
No, I cannot do this.
Sahil..
On the path..of life.
- Sahil.
Listen.
We'll always be together.
- Sneha.
Sneha!
- Why do I see..
"This distance between you and me?
The heart that was delicate as flower.
Turned to amber.
Where my wishes turned to ashes.
If you aren't with me.
Life is worthless.
What do I do..
With the happiness that's missing you.
The prints of our memory..
"Exist in the reposition of time.
Every corner of the heart..
...still holds your promises.
The heart that was delicate as flower.
Turned to amber.
Where my wishes turned to ashes.
If you aren't with me.
Life is worthless.
Hey"
Why did you come here?
- To know..
...why didn't you tell the truth about Shravan to everyone?
That doesn't prove that I didn't make a mistake?
Did you and Megha..
Then what's your fault?
I made a big mistake.
Before the wedding, if I can dare to enter a girl's bedroom.
Then later, I can dare to go anywhere.
Unlike Sneha, I deserve it.
Go on.
Who can return me my love?
Who can get me out of this mess?
Who can help me forget my pain?
O Lord, unite me with my love.
O Lord, return me my life.
O Lord, I don't stand a chance before you.
O Lord, alleviate my pain.
O Lord, unite me with my love.
Oh Lord!
Oh Lord!
Oh Lord!
Oh Lord!
I don't want to go ahead with this marriage?
Oh, God!
What's this new problem now?
Sahil, what are you saying?
Don't you have any shame?
First that, and now this.
Take your uncle Suri.
He only smokes.
He doesn't have any other bad habits.
I always knew this was going to happen.
See, we're in trouble now.
This is a big problem.
Look, son.
We've been married for 22 years.
But we never thought like this.
But you're already..
- Enough!
We won't discuss this anymore.
And no one will talk to Sahil about this.
- Yes.
I will talk to Sneha's papa.
Yes.
I don't want to touch.
- Come on.
Fundoo, tell aunt"
Uncle.
Bless you.
People can be angry over anything"
"but he shouldn't vent it out on food.
I will eat it myself.
- Hey!
It won't taste bitter if I feed you.
Open your mouth.
Chew it!
You should always chew your food properly.
Do you..
love Sneha.
Hey!
Come here.
I got it.
You don't have to say it.
The tears in your eyes..
Is conveying the saga in your heart.
Don't feel shy.
These tears are a strange thing.
Elders have said..
...when the heart's overwhelmed..
...you don't know what to do, can't take a decision..
"That's when you should cry your heart out.
Come on.
Cry.
Cry your heart out.
Cry your heart out.
And let your problems flow out through these tears.
Good!
I really love Sneha, uncle.
I made a big mistake, uncle.
- No, you didn't.
You don't know.
-I know it.
I made a big mistake, uncle.
- No, you didn't.
I know everything.
You were tricked.
Yes.
I know.
I do.
I know all these tricks.
They are dangerous.
I know..that Shravan tricked you into going there.
To that girl.
And I knew you won't do anything.
And my..
My faith won!
I didn't get it, uncle.
I'm not speaking a different language, son.
This isn't new.
This has been happening for really long.
Even we had people like Shravan.
We were instigated too.
I was even misled.
The truth is..
I lost control a few times myself.
It's true.
When I tried to do something.
...I remembered about your mother's love.
And I stopped.
Whenever there's a war between brotherhood..
...and love.
-Yes.
Love always wins.
And that happened with you.
If you had been selfish, you wouldn't have said it to Sneha.
You said it to Sneha yourself.
You cancelled this marriage.
Come on, get ready.
But, uncle.
I thought I cancelled the marriage.
What now?
- What else?
Wear your wedding attire and go get the girl..
Meaning?
- What?
Who cancelled your wedding?
I explained everything to Sneha's papa and..
We don't have much time.
Smp hugging me-
Your marriage is due.
You know, uncle.
I hope you won't mind.
I always thought you're a snoot.
I still am.
Brother Sahil!
Brother Sahil!
- Careful.
Brother Sahil!
Sister-in-law Sneha is missing.
-What?
No need to worry.
This is our own city.
We'll find her.
Understood?
- No, uncle.
I'll go.
And I'll find her.
Help me out.
You're looking pretty.
You aren't ready yet.
The procession will be arriving any minute now.
Hurry up.
You're still carrying that machine on your head.
They are called rollers.
You go on, I've a stomach-ache.
Stomach-ache.
No, no, I can't leave you alone.
- I said go.
Go!
I'll join you later.
Go.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi.
- Hi.
What's your name?
- Ambika.
Ambika.
Sit.
Don't worry.
Like I said, Sahil will bring Sneha on time.
You just control your guests.
Yes.
Don't let anyone know..
"That Sneha's not at home.
- As you say.
Just remember, my honour's at stake here.
I hope you will handle everything?
It's getting late.
Hurry up.
- Coming.
I'm leaving.
Here's your tea?
Do you need anything else?
Then, I'll get ready too.
I've stitched new clothes"
...to wear on Sahil's wedding.
Yes.
Fundoo.
Yes.
- Hello, brother Sahil.
There's a new problem.
- What?
Shravan has told everything to sister-in-law Namrata.
What?
- Congratulations.
She slapped him and left the house.
What a great.
Will this wedding take place or not?
Uncle.
- Yes.
Is everything okay?
- Yes, it is.
But, uncle, you said Sahil will be arriving with Sneha.
- Yes.
That isn't Sahil.
Then who is he?
Phandeshwar Nath Tiwari.
Fundoo.
That's the servant.
You mean..my wife's welcoming a servant.
He works for us.
But my wife is welcoming a servant.
My wife is welcoming a servant.
- Handle everything.
Don't hug him.
He'll cling on to you for no reason.
How about me?
Uncle.
Where are you?
Uncle, I was co-ordinating with brother.
I'm coming from the airport.
Uncle.
- You won't find her at the airport.
I know, I know, I know.
Stop being so filmy, and get real.
- Yes!
And think where she could be.
Uncle, you just handle everything there..
...I will come back only with her.
- Well done.
Uncle.
Do something, uncle.
It's his marriage, what will uncle do?
Uncle will have to do something.
One, two, three..
It's a day of happiness.
It's a day of happiness.
He'll get a lot of gifts and blessings.
It's my son's wedding.
Play the music.
It's my son's wedding.
Play the music.
It's my son's wedding.
Yes, brother.
- Sahil, Sneha's at Lodhi garden.
Okay.
- Now.
Come here now.
Sister-in-law.
- I'm looking for her.
No, sister-in-law's in the taxi right here.
What?
- Listen.
There's ajam at Cannaught Place.
You can get here.
Come here right now.
Thanks, buddy.
Thanks, thanks, thanks.
You come here.
- Copy that.

It's over between us, Shravan.
I've understood what love us.
What it means to loose it?
I promise you I..
I won't get up in the morning..
...until you don't wake me up lovingly.
I won't wear my tie until you don't tie it.

All the uncle, aunts, even the guests danced with us.
Even the band's tired.
How much more are you going to make us dance?
Enough singing and dancing.
The auspicious time for the marriage is passing-by.
- Yes.
Can we go inside now?
- Yes.
But, uncle, he..
- Come on.
But..
- Let's go.
Come.
- Let's go in.
Come on.
Is there alcohol inside?
I knew I will find you here.
Go away, Sahil.
Look, I know you're angry.
I don't want to see your face.
- Okay, fine.
Just don't go.
You don't want to see my face, then don't.
Just give me one chance to speak, please.
Just trust me.
Look.
Whatever happened last night.
Nothing happened..
Whatever happened last night.
It was a bachelor's party.
So, Sid got me drunk.
You know, normally I don't drink too much.
You saw me at the wrong place, at the wrong time.
You..
I was coming out of her room when you caught me.
What explanation are you going to give me?
You lied to me each time, Sahil.
You were in the restaurant with Megha, right?
And what did you tell me?
I was such a fool.
I always trusted you more than myself.
It was my biggest mistake.
And since when did you become so manipulative?
Or is it just Megha's influence?
Sahil.
Sahil.
Here I am.
Sahil.
What are you doing there?
Wait.
I'll be right back.
Anybody there?
Please help.
Sneha, don't go.
- Oh my, God!
Sahil, give me your hand.
- Listen.
Yes.
- Pull my shirt, I'll try to come in.
Pull.
Pull.
It's breaking.
Somebody help.
Sahil.
Give me your hand.
Shut up, Sahil.
Just give me your hand.
You were talking about manipulation.
- What?
Do you know brother was behind all this manipulation?
Sahil, stop your nonsense.
And don't say anything.
Give me your hand.
He dragged me into all this.
Oh, God!
Sahil, give me your hand.
Brother's been cheating on sister-in-law..
...for the last 15 years, do you know that?
Sahil, do you know what sister-in-law will say if she hears?
Are you..
- Sister has left home.
Sahil, give me your hand.
You cheated on me, still I am saving you.
I don't know why.
Just give me your hand.
I'm tired!
Why is everyone after me for no reason?
I didn't cheat on you.
I didn't do anything.
Okay, Sahil..
- I'm going.
I'm going.
No, no, give me your hand.
Feeling very sorry.
- Sahil, what.
Tell brother that I forgive him.
No problem.
Ask aunt to stop taking medicines.
Ask uncle to..
- Stop it..
To stop smoking.
That's it.
- Give me your hand.
What are you doing?
Tell Kittu to stop listening to brother.
Sahil, you will fall.
Please.
Say that you forgive me.
Give me your hand.
Did you forgive me?
Sahil, give me your hand.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Sahil, give me your hand.
Come on, hurry up.
Will you marry me?
- Of course I will.
Promise.
- First hold my hand.
Sorry.
I can't hold your hand.
If I do, I will fall down.
You will have to hold on to my legs?
- What?
How can I..
Sahil, shut up!
Give me your hand.
I'm going to keep my feet there, okay.
On the count of three, pull me inside.
How can I pull your leg?
- Yes.
You will have to.
Pull.
-Sahil.
One..
Two.. jump!
Sahil.
Sahil.
Our love-story might've been complete.
"But the marriage horror story was still left.

Yes.
These days I'm giving lessons on love to brother.
And, Sneha and me..
...we're as happy as we can be.
Sahil.
You're married now.
What about kids?
- Of course, you should have kids.
There are few rules of becoming a father.
Sahil.
First rule..
God, what do I do?
Yes.
Everyone present here, I've a small request.
Everyone stand in that corner.

Listen to me.

(Scottish accent) Not exactly a frequent flyer, are you, luv?
These international flights, they can be hell on the ol' stomach, eh?
Mm.
You feeling better, hon?
That... that man....
Filled with rats.
(Pants)
Uh...
Can you take your seat, please, sir?
Just... this plane's filled with rats.
(Whispers)
- Okay.
(Pants)
- And we... we gotta kill them all, starting with the queen.
Aah!
(Passengers screaming)
(Air whooshes)
(Stafford) What's the deal with you and detective Tommy Sullivan?
Am I gonna have to fight a duel with that guy every time I want to ask you out or what?
(Laughs) Well, I would pay to see that, but... mm.
(Chuckles) I...
I don't think so.
But there is a story there, huh?
Yeah.
A long one...
Mm.
That I'm not telling.
Well, I don't want you to tell it.
I just want to know it has an end.
Tommy and I dated, some stuff happened, and now I'm out with you, having a very nice time.
End of story.
This was nice, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Surprisingly so.
It doesn't have to end here, you know?
It kinda does.
Lacey.
She's a big girl.
She's with her grandmother.
All you gotta do is call her, tell her you're gonna have a late night.
A very late... night.
Hmm.
(Clicks tongue)
Hey, it's me.
Can you stay a little longer?
(Joan) Funny, Lacey just asked me to spend the night, have a girls' movie night, just the three of us.
Okay, but... make it two.
I'm gonna be out late.
Uh, I think she was trying to mend the fences between us.
I think that's gonna take a little more than popcorn and a movie, don't you?
Okay.
Right.
It wasn't my idea.
Never mind.
You're having fun.
Stay out.
- Better for us both.
- Thank you.
I think.

(Sirens wailing)
(Emergency radio chatter)
(Indistinct conversations)
(Wailing continues)
Where's the M.E.?
There she is.
(Wailing continues)
(Man) Hey!
We need six more hoses on that westside fire.
We need to setup that perimeter.
What do you know?
You're looking at flight 875, or what's left of it.
Antigua to Philly.
82 souls on the manifest.
What brought it down?
N.T.S.B.'s gonna figure that out.
All we know is, they lost altitude, clipped a few trees over there, and broke off the tail section.
The main section cleared the woods, but it took out this power grid.
Blacked out half the city.
- Intentionally?
(Martin)
- I don't think so.
I think the pilot dumped fuel before he hit, or else this whole thing would've blown sky-high.
And we got survivors.
Anybody set up an airlift to the burn unit over at County?
- Who's in charge here?
(Man)
- You're looking at it.
We've got four paramedic crews here.
The rest are all over the city dealing with that blackout.
What about N.T.S.B.?
They're six hours out.
They can't get in.
The power outage shut down the airport.
(Wailing continues)
(Amplified voice) Medical personnel, listen up.
My name's Charles Stafford.
I am the health commissioner.
We're gonna set up a triage area off to my left.
(Radio chatter continues) We're gonna make a makeshift morgue in this building over here to my right.
Let's move, people.
Go!
(Man over radio) Copy, medic 16.
We've got it coming your way.
(Siren whoops)
Okay.
He's all set.
(Sighs) That guy says the same thing as everybody else.
Crazy guy with a gun shot out a window, depressurized the cabin.
The F.A.A. says there was a U.S. air marshal on board, a John Davies.
Former marine corps.
Manifest puts him in seat 26D.
(Stafford) Well, I say, we better we find him if he's still alive.
Find out why he didn't subdue the gunman.
Maybe he is the gunman.
Body of Proof 3x11
- Dark City Original air date May 7, 2013
The crash of a passenger plane into a power station has plunged Philly into darkness and chaos.
There have been reports of looting and violence throughout the city.
And we are live at the scene of the crash that caused it all with Dr. Kate Murphy, Chief Medical Examiner.
What is the death toll so far, Dr. Murphy?
I'm not at liberty to release that information yet.
We still have people inside that plane, both living and dead.
And our first responders are here to make sure that there are more of the former than the latter.
(Sirens wailing, emergency radio chatter)
You need to give me more than that.
Excuse me?
You know who sent me here.
District Attorney Dan Russell.
He told me to come down here and get some hero shots of you, make you look good, and in return, you'd be a little more... forthcoming.
So how about a few sound bites from our, uh, next congresswoman?
(Wailing continues)
(Indistinct conversations)
(Man sniffles) Ahh.
(Emergency radio chatter)
Sir.
Sir.
Hey, sir.
W... were you on the plane?
Yeah.
You're damn right I was.
Okay.
Well, I'm just trying to help.
- That's... that's him.
- What?
- Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on.
- That's... that's the jacked up son of a bitch who started shooting.
You sure?
Aye, I'm sure.
He shot us out of the damn sky!
So a trained air marshal flipped out midflight and brought down a jet he's supposed to protect?
I want to know everything about this guy... where he's traveled, where he's trained... and why he had a seizure midflight.
Petechial hemorrhaging, antemortem bite marks on his tongue... he had a seizure before the crash.
We need to pull blood for a tox screen A.S.A.P.
Okay, have Kate catalog everything.
Have your people load him up, take him to the M.E.O.
Go with them.
The tail of this plane is still missing.
There may be more dead or more survivors.
I'm on it.
Megan, listen, people go crazy during a blackout.
Remember New York in '91?
Yes, I remember.
Just be careful, all right?
Okay.
You be careful, too.
Okay.
Thanks for caring.
I'll call you to check in later.
Hey.
You need an extra pair of eyes?
Uh, yeah.
Sure.
Flashlight, glow sticks, and battery-powered radio.
(Laughs) Oh, boy.
You girls are prepared.
I watch this great series called "Doomsday Prep Wars."
The first rule of surviving the apocalypse... batteries.
My first rule back in the day... eat the perishables.
(Laughs)
You know, I haven't been in a blackout since...
New York, 1991.
And I ended up walking 32 blocks from the train station to your mother's tiny little apartment on the westside.
(Chuckles)
And that's when I got my big surprise.
I found out that she was dating Tommy Sullivan.
Were they in love?
No.
It was just... kid stuff.
I tried to tell her so at the time, but she wouldn't listen.
I know you probably don't understand why your mom and I aren't on such friendly terms these days, but I want you to know, it has nothing to do with you.
I know.
Okay, good.
I know why you've been fighting.
Mom thinks granddad didn't kill himself, that he was murdered.
And now she wants to bring up his body, and...
Lacey...
I overheard you, and she doesn't know that I know.
I just...
I had to ask.
I don't want to talk about this, okay?
But, grandma, wh... what if... what if mom's right?
Why wouldn't you want to know the truth?
I said no.
I didn't want to have this awful, morbid conversation with her, and I certainly don't want to have it with you.
(Indistinct conversations)
How many are there?
Uh, 52 dead so far, but the good news is, we have had reports of survivors.
(Electricity crackles)
Is our generator gonna hold?
Oh, it's gon' hold.
The apocalypse will come and go before we shut down.
But just in case, I broke out these puppies.
Don't think I don't watch "Doomsday Prep Wars"
on the Splice Channel.
So I just put
- seven crash survivors in the conference room.
- What?
They didn't want to go to the hospital to get checked out, they just wanted to be here with their loved ones.
I'd really like to interview them.
I don't think so.
Who are you anyway?
This is Mandy Wells from WVGH.
She's with me.
Just keep the survivors there until we're ready to have them I.D. the deceased, all right?
And then we'll see if they want to talk to the press.
(Elevator bell dings)
(Indistinct conversations)
Ohh.
Can I help you folks?
We were at the airport.
We were waiting for the flight to come in when we found out...
You have family on flight 875?
Yes.
Yes, my husband.
His name is Thomas.
And my grandson Max.
He was traveling alone.
Please check.
Okay, this is Dr. Brumfield.
He'll get you situated, and we'll find out what happened to your loved ones.
You have a list in your hand right there.
Now is that a list of people that made it and who didn't?
Because I just need to know.
Is my wife... is she dead?
Pam Jacks.
She's a flight attendant.
The list is incomplete.
But Jacks...
I don't see her name.
What about Thomas?
Tom Westphall?
I'm so sorry.
(Sobs) No.
Please.
No.
(Sniffles)
No.
(Crying)
Um, Mrs. Westphall, just one question.
(Lowered voice) Okay, okay, come here.
Come here.
Ow!
(Normal voice) Are you serious?
That woman just found out she lost her husband.
I am just doing my job.
Adam.
(Scoffs)
Yeah.
We're about to autopsy the air marshal.
You in or out?
Uh, I'm out.
I'm on crowd control.
Oh, Megan.
You hear from Tommy?
Not yet.
You?
No.
So... the blackout of '91, huh?
Guess you two go way back.
Well, it's... it's complicated.
I'm a pretty bright girl.
Try me.
(Tires squealing)
Must be debris from the plane.
(Beep)
Call Adam Lucas.
(Autodials)
(Busy signal beeping)
The cell towers must be taking a beating.
I...
I'd try, but my battery's dead.
Call Megan.
(Auto dials)
This is Megan Hunt.
Leave a message.
Megan, listen, it's Tommy.
I'm just checking in.
I think I got a lead on the tail section, but it's... it's pretty damn remote out here.
What the... (Tires squealing)
(Wood cracks)
(Crashing)
(Buzzing)
Petechial hemorrhaging means asphyxiation prior to crash.
(Stafford) Yeah, and prior to that, he was screaming about a flying rat queen.
This guy's high as a kite on something.
On what we won't know until the electricity comes back on.
And all the labs are down.
We'll just have to wait to find out what it is he took.
Or was given.
I highly doubt that he decided to get his fix midair.
This looks like foul play to me.
That's a leap.
He was a U.S. air marshal.
They're routinely subjected to drug tests and background checks.
What, so nobody ever faked a drug test before?
Have a buddy come in, pee in the cup.
Are you speaking from experience?
I'm speaking as someone who knows human beings.
They are predictably unpredictable.
There's no jaundice, no track marks, no bruxism.
This guy was not a drug addict.
Wait.
So what are you saying, he was just randomly drugged?
Not random.
He was an undercover air marshal.
Maybe somebody found out, somebody who had something so big to hide, they were willing to do anything to keep it secret.
A lot of ifs in that scenario.
Okay.
We've got six people in the conference room who had first-class seats to the show.
Why don't you find out what they saw?
(Buzzes)
So, Mr. Franco, I need you to tell me everything you remember about the flight.
Anything at all.
Stupid things, things you don't think matter, maybe they do.
You know, I remember there was this... child kicking the back of my chair.
(Boy) I gotta go pee.
And he was trying to get to the bathroom, but he practically ripped the back of my chair off trying to get there, so I turned around to say something, and he bumped into the guy next to him,
the gunman.
Did you notice anything else about him?
Yeah.
I thought it was odd, you know?
This kid plows right into him... and he doesn't even blink.
He just keeps staring.
(Whispers indistinctly) (Man, Indian accent) I remember he seemed polite.
When we boarded, he helped a woman with her carry-on luggage.
Uh, "very... polite,"
I remember saying to my wife.
She thought the man liked the woman.
(Stafford) Why did she think that?
Because he came up to her and spoke with her a few times during the flight.
I didn't really notice him again until...
Anyway, he pulls out this ginormous gun from God knows where, and starts waving it around, yelling something about flying rats.
He aimed it right at me.
(Screaming)
Well, not at me.
At the chick beside me.
She was wearing this, uh, blue scarf.
Poor thing had been airsick during most of the flight.
She squeezed my hand during the shooting, during the crash.
I mean, it felt like hours, but it must have been seconds?
Tanner, the... the... the woman in the blue scarf, do you remember her name?
She said her name was Carla.
Carla Mendez, seat 23A.
Deceased.
She's here in the morgue.
One thing that they remember about her is the blue scarf.
That and the, uh, the air marshal was fixated on her.
We need to take a look at her, verify her identity, find out where she's been, exactly what she was doing on that flight.
You think she's behind all this?
Maybe another victim.
People saw her go into the bathroom a lot.
She coulda been drugged, too.
(Cell phone chimes)
Hmm.
It's voice mail from Tommy.
Service has been crap all night.
You're lucky you got anything.
Put it on speaker.
Megan, listen, it's Tommy.
I'm just checking in.
I think I got a lead on the tail section, but it's... it's pretty damn remote out here.
(Tires squeal)
(Wood cracks, crashing)
Megan, Megan, where are you going?
I'm gonna find him.
No, you're not.
It's chaos out there.
You stay here.
Do your job.
Find out who...
No!
Something has happened...
Megan, I will find him.
He's right.
He's got a badge, gun, whole police department backing him up.
You find him.
Okay.
He's gonna be all right.
Yeah.
(Horns honk)
(Touch screen clicks)
(Breathes unsteadily)
(Phone rings)
Tommy...
Sullivan.
You missed me.
Leave a message after the beep.
(Pants)
Uh, Tommy, I don't...
I don't know if you're gonna get this, but if you get this...
I... (Voice breaks) I need you to know that...
Everything okay out here?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, everything's fine.
I'll be in in a sec.
(Exhales)
(Inhales and exhales)
(Sniffles)
(Crickets chirping)
(Moans)
Ohh.
(Grunts) You okay?
Yeah.
My left ankle's jacked, though.
You?
(Groans) My shoulder's a little...
Oh, the phone's broken.
(Grunts)
(Exhales)
Wait a second.
We almost hit somebody.
(Both pant)
(Grunts)
(Tommy) She's alive.
Hi.
Wh... what's your name?
(Strained voice) Pam.
Please... you have to help us.
Us?
Pam, where... where'd you come from?
I don't...
I don't...
Down...
Mm.
We'll be right back, Pam.
Where you going?
I thought you were helping us with crowd control.
Cr...
I'm...
I'm not a traffic cop, Dr. Murphy.
You know, Mandy's downstairs prepping her cameraman.
I'm about to bring him up.
So maybe you could rein in the attitude a little?
You know, it's good to know you got your priorities in order.
If anyone has access to a radio or a working TV, they need information about what's going on here.
That is a priority.
So feel free to tell me whatever crawled up your ass. (Elevator bell dings)
Or better yet, get over it.
(Indistinct conversations)
You want to talk about it?
Nope.
Okay.
So let's find out what made Carla Mendez so special, it drove our air marshal friend off the deep end.
Yes, I'm beginning to agree with you.
He was drugged.
Maybe he thought she was some kind of terrorist threat.
Well, maybe he was right.
Let's have a look at her and find out.
(Electricity crackles)
(Curtis) Uh-oh.
Looks like the generator failed.
The backups should kick on any second.
Wait for it.
(Indistinct conversations)
Wait for it.
(Indistinct conversations continue)
Backup genny's not working.
Aw, hell.
That's not supposed to happen.
You two check on the generator.
On it.
Lights.
Here, everybody take one, turn to Channel 3.
Stafford and I will find the emergency lanterns in the storage room in the morgue.
Follow me.
(Indistinct conversations continue)
Whoa.
Carla Mendez.
Her body is gone.
Not gone.
Stolen.
What do you mean, lockdown?
Megan said a body is missing.
Uh-huh.
Somebody stole it, and nobody's going anywhere till they find it.
Wait a second.
I mean, why doesn't she just send in the cavalry?
We can't call the cavalry until we get this generator running again.
I'm a doctor, okay?
I'm not an electrician.
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
This is not a blown fuse.
L...
look.
You see those wires?
They were cut, deliberately.
(Curtis) Oh, crap.
Call Megan and tell her this is gonna take a while.
Okay, just... wait a second.
You know how to fix this?
Look, I'm a trained pathologist, and I have all six seasons of "Doomsday Prep Wars" saved on my DVR.
I got this.
Now hand me those pliers.
Hello?
Hello?
Uh-huh.
(Sighs)
Have you got a light?
"In case of emergency, use enclosed hex key"
"to open ceiling panel and push manual lever."
What ceiling panel?
There's no... there's no hex key.
Where's the friggin'... where's the friggin' hex key?
(Bangs panel door)
All right, calm down.
Calm down?
My partner's out there.
He may be dead, and... and I can't go help him because hey, you know what?
You've got time to give your press conferences, but you don't have time to make sure that your generators are up to code or your damn elevator is working!
(Creaking) Stop.
Listen.
(Creaking continues)
(Loud bang)
(Flames crackling)
Can anybody hear me?
(Breathing heavily)
(Pounding on door)
Hold on.
(Tommy grunts)
Just a second.
(Metal clanks)
(Grunts)
(Groans)
(Metal scrapes)
(Tommy grunts)
Hey.
Come on.
Come on out.
I'm Tommy.
What's your name?
Max.
You okay, Max?
Come with me.
(Exhales deeply)
Max.
I hid in the bathroom.
Of course you did.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
This might hurt a little bit.
(Exhales)
(Clicks)
Somehow I knew.
(Crying) I knew I was gonna die like this.
You're not gonna die.
Not if I can help it.
I'm just gonna put some padding to hold it in place.
(Pam groans)
(All shouting at once)
All right, everybody, be quiet!
Be quiet!
We're asking that you remain calm.
(Tanner) Calm?
You got armed guards at the doors.
(Megan) Because somebody in this room sabotaged our generators in order to steal a key piece of evidence.
Okay, tell us what the evidence was.
We can help look for it.
It was the body of the woman in 23A...
Carla Mendez.
Whoever was trying to cover their tracks in the air is now trying to cover them on the ground, and no one is leaving this room until we find out who and why.
(Man) Well, what does she have to do with me or her or him?
We weren't on the plane.
Yeah, but they all were.
(Huffs) Don't... don't look at me.
Look, not to be non, you know, post racial or anything, but, uh, can you not just ask the Arab guy?
Okay, I'm Sikh, you idiot.
A... and you were sitting next to her the entire time.
Maybe the air marshal wasn't staring at her.
Maybe he was staring at you!
(Franco) You were talking to him.
That's right.
I saw you...
No.
In the back of the plane.
That's right.
You guys were talking for a long time.
No, no, no, no, no.
You were talking to him!
What were you talking about?
I wa...
I wasn't talking to him.
I was hanging out at the... the stewardess' station.
There's this hot blonde I was trying to chat up...
- That's my wife!
- Hey!
- What did you do, you son of a bitch?
- Hey, hey, hey.
(All shouting at once)
Enough!
Enough!
Enough!
Enough!
Come with me.
Come with me.
(Indistinct conversations)
Listen to me.
Listen.
I checked the morgue log.
It took a while because your wife wasn't in an assigned section of the plane.
But I can tell you for sure, she is not here.
You know, she wanted to retire last year.
You know what I said to her?
"No way."
"In this economy?
We need the money."
It's my fault she's up there.
I don't even know why I went off on that guy right there.
I don't know.
But for some reason, it was just the thought of... (Sighs) The last kind thing ever said to my wife coming from a stranger.
Is that stupid?
(Sighs) No.
(Voice breaking) You know...
I've been wracking my brain.
I was trying to think of the... the last thing I said to her.
I can't.
Because nothing about that moment said...
"this is the last time."
If we knew when that was gonna be, we'd all do things differently.
You lose someone, too, doc?
He went out to find the tail section of the plane.
Stupid thing is, I know exactly what my last words to him were.
And...
(Chuckles) they were not poetry.
They were trite, flippant.
Now I might never see him again.
(Exhales)
I don't know.
(Objects clatter)
Here.
How about this?
Let me see.
Mm.
Give me a hand?
Okay.
(Grunts)
All right.
Here.
(Grunts)
Mm-hmm.
Listen, I'm...
I'm sorry about Tommy.
I really do hope he's all right.
You wanna talk about it?
Nope.
(Scoffs)
All right, what exactly is with you?
A reporter asks a couple questions, and you hulk out.
I mean, she's just trying to do her job.
Yeah, the job the D.A. asked her to do.
To, uh, give you the Dan Russell treatment, right?
Make you look like a hero.
So what?
Dan's my mentor.
Dan and my dad are two peas in a pod.
Seeing you follow in their footsteps is...
What?
Triggered some traumatic childhood memory?
Well, here's a newsflash for you...
I am not Dan Russell and I am not your father.
- Yeah?
Not yet.
- Oh, please.
Dan and my dad are actually very good friends.
Well, they are two high-profile lawyers in Philadelphia, so...
Yeah, but it's the, uh... it's the corrupt stuff they've done over the past few years that actually binds them together.
I think that's a bit of an exaggeration, don't you?
My dad... he tried to shine a light on the injustices against the little guy.
But, uh, little guys don't buy camera time, so he moved on to the bigger and bigger guys.
(Panting) And to win, he... he had to get into bed with some ugly people.
Before he knew it, my dad was crushing the little guy with the big guy.
And behind closed doors, a lot of bad stuff got swept under the rug... some of which was your mentor Dan's.
Right now, you're still one of the good guys, but you're signing up for the same ride my dad's on.
All it costs is your soul.
(Grunting)
- Get anything out of the survivors?
- Nada.
My, uh, "one of you in this room is a murderer" routine needs a little work.
What the hell happened to you two?
We got stuck in the elevator.
We've been there for hours.
You've been here this whole time?
- Yes.
- You were supposed to be finding Tommy.
Megan, we found...
I have been able to focus on my job because I thought you were out there looking for him.
Megan.
We radioed first responders for Tommy's crash as soon as we got free.
We found something.
(Clicks flashlight) (Stafford) Say hello to Carla Mendez, the infamous woman in the blue scarf.
Look at this.
Look at these edges.
- That didn't happen in the crash.
That's postmortem.
- Yeah.
(Stafford) See the white residue right there?
I bet you that tests positive for cocaine.
From the distention of her stomach,
I'd say that she swallowed... at least 80 bags?
That's a street value of what?
80 bags?
About $2 million.
Carla Mendez was a drug mule.
What do you want to bet the air marshal found out about it?
(Megan) Carla was carrying at least 80 bags of cocaine in her stomach.
She becomes sick, possibly from turbulence.
Or maybe one of the bags ruptured.
(Whispers indistinctly) So air marshal Davies gets suspicious.
Maybe he confronts her.
(Megan) And either Carla herself or... more likely an accomplice...
Tanner, Sanjit, Roberto?
(Whispers indistinctly) drugs Davies to either kill him or just incapacitate him long enough to make the getaway.
(Stafford) Instead, he flips out, causing the plane to crash.
(Man) Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
(Passengers scream)
Carla dies in the crash, but her accomplice doesn't.
He comes here to the morgue, cuts open her stomach, gets the stash, and tries to cover their tracks.
Well, then whoever it was that did this is sitting right outside... and we've interrogated them already.
But you didn't know what you were looking for.
Yeah, and you didn't have me.
It's not working.
Nothing you're doing is working.
(Exhales)
(Click, generator whirs) What?
!
- Black-gyver, you really did it!
- Hell, yeah!
Aah!
- Oh!
Ooh!
- Ha!
(Murmuring)
(Object thuds) Is this really necessary?
(Adam) Yes, it is.
Okay.
(Keys jangle)
Okay, here you go.
(Hands hit tabletop)
(Slaps back) You happy there, pal?
Megan.
Oh, come on, man!
That's not mine.
- Roberto Franco...
- Are you crazy?
Get outta here!
You're under arrest for the possession of narcotics.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
You know, it doesn't really matter that he's been caught.
My wife is still dead.
Yeah, we're fine, mom.
We slept through it mostly, actually.
Will I be seeing you soon?
Okay.
Bye.
She didn't want to talk to you.
(Inhales deeply)
Okay.
Like daughter, like granddaughter?
You asked me a question last night.
I snapped at you.
It's okay.
No, it's not okay.
You asked me why
I didn't want to know the truth about granddad.
It's because I already do.
He killed himself.
Do I have all the answers?
No.
But I had to move on.
And your mother is having a very tough time doing that.
And I understand.
I did, too.
I loved your granddad very much.
But if I didn't move forward, I never would've studied law,
I wouldn't have become a judge,
I wouldn't have... or introduced mom to a handsome young lawyer in your courtroom, and I wouldn't exist.
(Inhales deeply)
You are an old soul, and you would never, ever not exist.
- Okay, tell me if this hurts. - (Dunn) Come on, Max.
Let's go find that purse, huh?
She's good with kids.
How long have you two been dating?
Uh, we're not dating.
Why the hell not?
She likes you.
It's complicated.
Hmm.
Does "complicated" have a name?
Yeah.
What is it?
Megan.
Let me give you a bit of unsolicited advice.
Uncomplicate it.
And if you can't, move on.
You mean, just... settle?
No.
Be happy.
Life's too short.
(Dunn) I found your purse, right where you said it would be.
And your phone works, too.
Oh, great.
Who should we call first?
(Breathes deeply) (Beeping)
(Pours liquid)
(Cell phone rings)
(Cup clatters) (Ring)
- Huh.
- Phones are back on?
What?
(Ring)
That's... that's my wife's number.
How... how is my wife calling your number?
(Ring)
(Ring)
- Hey.
- Hey!
Oh, my God.
Look at you.
Wait.
Look at... you.
W... are you okay?
What's wrong?
Yeah, we're... we're okay.
We're fine.
Who's "we"?
Wait.
Uh, hey, I'm sorry to interrupt here, but you have my wife's my phone.
Is she there?
Yeah.
(Tommy exhales sharply and grunts)
(Voice breaks) Alex.
(Voice breaks) Pammy!
Pam, oh, my God.
Hi.
Alex...
I'm so sorry.
(Crying) I'm so sorry about everything.
No, baby.
No, I'm the one who's sorry.
I'm so sorry.
(Grunts and gags)
I...
Pam.
Pam!
What... what's going on?
What's wrong?
(Tommy) She's starting to shake.
Tommy, try to hold her.
Put...
put the phone on her injuries.
Mm.
Here.
(Groans)
(Grunts)
Her pulse, it's... it's racing.
She's in V-tach.
Does... does your wife have heart problems?
Uh, yeah.
She's got a murmur, but she's... she's on medication for it.
Max, bring me that, please.
(Wheezes)
Thank you.
(Objects clatter)
(Pills rattle)
- Uh, Dig-oxin?
- Digoxin.
0.24 milligrams.
Oral.
Get her to take two pills.
(Pills rattling) (Grunts)
(Gasping) Megan, she can't swallow anything.
She's choking on her own blood.
I don't think she can breathe.
Her airway's blocked.
Tommy, you're gonna have to do an emergency tracheotomy.
No!
Absolutely not!
He... he's not a doctor.
He can't do this.
You're gonna need a knife and...
and find a ball-point pen.
I got a pen.
Take the ink stem out.
Feel her neck, the ridges in her neck.
There are two bumps.
I need you to hit right between those bumps.
One cut, horizontal, 1 inch long, 1 inch deep, right into the trachea.
(Breathing heavily)
Do it.
(Sighs) Okay.
Okay, now take your finger, widen the hole, take the pen, push it down slowly towards her lung.
That's it.
Okay, it's in.
Okay.
It's not working.
She's not breathing.
Why?
Why... why isn't she breathing?
(Gasps)
She's breathing.
(Breathing raspily)
She's breathing.
Good.
Good job.
Good to see you both alive.
(Chuckles)
- Phew!
(Chuckles)
- Thank you.
(Exhales sharply)
Megan?
So I was able to radio one of my old friends in vice.
He says there's been talk of a shipment coming from overseas.
We could be dealing with a major cartel.
What?
He's alive.
(Chuckles)
And safe.
Hey.
I'm gonna hitch a ride out to the second crash site.
- You need me?
- No.
Uh, I just nailed down the drug that knocked out our air marshal friend.
Digoxin.
- Weird.
- Digoxin?
That's the same drug the flight attendant was taking for her heart condition.
She's the one who drugged the air marshal.
I...
I just saved the life of the person who brought down the plane.
So you're saying the flight attendant was really the drug runner?
Right, and Carla Mendez was her mule.
(Megan) The air marshal catches on to Carla and informs the flight attendant.
(Both speaking indistinctly) He asks her to radio ahead and call the cops, not realizing that Pam is in on the whole thing.
Pam panics.
She has to neutralize him.
Enjoy.
So she drugs him with her heart meds, hoping to knock him out or maybe even kill him.
But Digoxin given in high enough dosages...
(Passengers screaming) causes violent hallucinations.
Air marshal goes mad, shoots up the plane, brings it down.
So this guy Roberto Franco that you have in custody... he's what?
A, uh, a backup drug handler?
No.
Two drug handlers for one mule?
It's unlikely.
You know, Pam's husband told me that she wanted to quit flying two years ago, but he made her keep working.
What do you bet that he's her accomplice and he framed Roberto Franco?
The survivors, have they left yet?
Yeah, just now.
Oh, uh, I'll call security.
Alex Jacks?
Alex Jacks, hold it there.
What's this all about?
I believed every word that you said to me upstairs... about loving your wife, regretting choices that you made.
If you'd only let her retire two years ago... not from flying, but from drug running, which you failed to mention... 53 people would still be alive today.
What are you talking about?
You must work for some really scary people.
Your wife could've been in pieces for all you knew, but you still had to retrieve whatever's in that bag right there.
Was that your idea or your boss'?
All right.
Uhh!
Ooh!
Uhh!
(Grunting)
Uhh!
(Groans)
(Man speaks indistinctly)
(Metal clatters)
I didn't want any of this to happen.
(Sighs)
I just wanted the guy to pass out.
I didn't mean to kill anyone.
Yeah, well, even if things had worked out as planned,
$2 million worth of drugs weren't gonna help anybody.
You made some bad choices.
(Handcuff clicks)
(Sighs)
Well, Max is off to meet his granddad, and our limo awaits.
Headed out to the crash site?
No, the hospital or the police station... wherever they took the flight attendant.
And Tommy.
(Exhales)
And Tommy.
Okay, let me guess.
I'm, uh... not gonna get a rain check on that dinner, huh?
Eh, I don't think so, Charlie.
Yeah, I kinda figured that story of yours wasn't over yet.
(Breathes deeply)
Oh.
I, uh, was gonna wait till the madness passed to, uh, give you this, but... here you go.
Order of exhumation, for my father.
It's what you said you wanted.
Thank you.
Megan, sometimes it's, uh, it's better to leave the past in the past.
I don't want to.
(Elevator bell dings)
Is Tommy Sullivan still...
I see him.
Hey.
I got a squaddie parked out back.
You ready?
You look great.
Thank you.
Give me the keys.
(Keys jangle)
Ah, no.
One car wreck a day with you is my limit.
All right.
(Sighs deeply)
(Sighs) Hmm.
(ENGINES ROARING)
(WHISPERS) The ship's overtaken by rats.
MAN: (WHISPERS) The ship's overtaken by rats.
Okay.
(WHISPERS) The ship's overtaken by rats.
(MAN PANTING)
(MUTTERS)
(SCOTTISH ACCENT) Not exactly a frequent flyer, are you, love?
These international flights, they can be hell on the old stomach, eh?
You feeling better, hon?
That...
That man...
Filled with rats!
(PANTS)
Uh...
Can you take your seat, please, sir?
Just...
- This plane is filled with rats!
- (WHISPERS) Okay.
And we got to kill them all, starting with the queen!
Aah!
(PASSENGERS SCREAMING)
(AIR WHOOSHES)
What's the deal with you and Detective Tommy Sullivan?
Am I gonna have to fight a duel with that guy every time I want to ask you out, or what?
(LAUGHS) Well, I would pay to see that, but I don't think so.
- But there is a story there, huh?
- Yeah.
A long one that I'm not telling.
I don't want you to tell it, I just want to know it has an end.
Tommy and I dated, some stuff happened, and now I'm out with you, having a very nice time.
End of story.
This was nice, wasn't it?
Surprisingly so.
It doesn't have to end here, you know.
It kind of does.
Lacey...
She's a big girl, and she's with her grandmother.
All you got to do is call her.
Tell her you're gonna have a late night.
A very late night.
Hmm.
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Hey, it's me.
Can you stay a little longer?
Funny.
Lacey just asked me to spend the night, have a girls' movie night, just the three of us.
Okay, but make it two.
I'm going to be out late.
I think she was trying to mend the fences between us.
I think that's gonna take a little more than popcorn and a movie, don't you?
Okay.
All right.
It wasn't my idea.
Never mind.
If you're having fun, stay out.
- Better for us both.
- Thank you.
I think.
(SIGHS)
My mommy just extended my curfew.
Mmm.
(JET ENGINES ROARING)
(EXPLOSION)
(WOMAN GASPS AND SCREAMS)
What the hell just happened?
(ELECTRICITY CLANKS)
(SIRENS WAILING)
(EMERGENC Y RADIO CHATTER)
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
(WAILING CONTINUES)
Where's the ME?
There she is.
MAN:
Hey!
Get me six more hoses on that West Side fire!
We need to set up that perimeter.
What do you know?
You're looking at Flight 875, or what's left of it, Antigua to Philly.
Eighty-two souls on the manifest.
What brought it down?
NTSB's gonna figure that out.
All we know is they lost altitude, clipped a few trees over there, and broke off a tail section.
The main section cleared the woods, but took out this power grid.
Blacked out half the city.
- Intentionally?
- I don't think so.
I think the pilot dumped fuel before he hit, or else this whole thing would've blown sky-high.
And we got survivors.
Anybody set up an airlift to the burn unit over at County?
- Who's in charge here?
- You're looking at it.
We got four paramedic crews here.
The rest are all over the city, dealing with that blackout.
What about NTSB?
They're six hours out.
They can't get in.
The power outage shut down the airport.
Medical personnel, listen up.
My name's Charles Stafford, I am the Health Commissioner.
We're going to set up a triage area off to my left.
We're gonna make a makeshift morgue in this building over here to my right.
Let's move, people.
Go!
Okay, he's all set.
(SIGHS) That guy says the same thing as everybody else.
A crazy guy with a gun shot out a window, depressurized the cabin.
The FAA says there was a US Air Marshal on board, a John Davies, former Marine Corps.
Manifest puts him in seat 26-D.
I say we better find him.
If he's still alive, find out why he didn't subdue the gunman.
Maybe he is the gunman.
The crash of a passenger plane into a power station has plunged Philly into darkness and chaos.
There have been reports of looting and violence throughout the city, and we are live at the scene of the crash that caused it all with Dr. Kate Murphy, Chief Medical Examiner.
What is the death toll so far, Dr. Murphy?
I'm not at liberty to release that information yet.
We still have people inside that plane, both living and dead, and our first responders are here to make sure that there are more of the former than the latter.
(SIRENS WAILING, EMERGENC Y RADIO CHATTER)
You need to give me more than that.
Excuse me?
You know who sent me here.
District Attorney Dan Russell.
He told me to come down here, get some hero shots of you, make you look good, and, in return, you'd be a little more forthcoming.
So how about a few sound bites from our next congresswoman?
Sir?
Sir...
Hey, sir.
Were you on the plane?
Yeah.
You're damn right I was.
Okay, well, I'm just trying to help.
- That's him!
- What?
- Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on.
- That's...
That's the jacked-up son-of-a-bitch that started shooting!
- You sure?
- I am sure!
He shot us out of the damn sky!
So a trained Air Marshal flipped out mid-flight, and brought down a jet he was supposed to protect?
I wanna know everything about this guy, where's he's traveled, where he's trained...
And why he had a seizure mid-flight.
Petechial hemorrhaging, antemortem bite marks on his tongue.
He had a seizure before the crash.
We need to pull blood for a tox screen ASAP.
Okay.
Have Kate catalog everything.
Have your people load him up, take him to the MEO.
Go with him.
The tail of this plane is still missing.
There may be more dead or more survivors.
I'm on it.
Megan, listen.
People go crazy during a blackout.
Remember New York in '91?
Yes, I remember.
Just be careful, all right?
Okay.
You be careful, too.
Okay.
Thanks for caring.
I'll call you to check in later.
Hey.
You need an extra pair of eyes?
Uh, yeah.
Sure.
Flashlight, glow sticks, and a battery-powered radio.
(LAUGHS) Boy, you girls are prepared.
I watch this great series called Doomsday Prep Wars.
First rule of surviving the apocalypse?
Batteries.
My first rule back in the day?
Eat the perishables.
(LAUGHS)
You know, I haven't been in a blackout since New York, 1991.
And I ended up walking 32 blocks from the train station to your mother's tiny little apartment on the West Side.
And that's when I got my big surprise.
I found out that she was dating Tommy Sullivan.
Were they in love?
No, it was just kid stuff.
I tried to tell her so at the time, but she wouldn't listen.
I know you probably don't understand why your mom and I aren't on such friendly terms these days, but I want you to know it has nothing to do with you.
- I know.
- Okay.
Good.
I know why you've been fighting.
Mom thinks Granddad didn't kill himself, that he was murdered, and now she wants to bring up his body and...
- Lacey...
- I overheard you.
And she doesn't know that I know.
I just had to ask...
I don't want to talk about this.
- But, Grandma, what if Mom's right?
- Okay?
Why wouldn't you want to know the truth?
I said no.
I didn't want to have this awful, morbid conversation with her, and I certainly don't want to have it with you.
How many are there?
Fifty-two dead so far.
But the good news is we have had reports of survivors.
Is our generator going to hold?
It's going to hold.
The apocalypse will come and go before we shut down.
But just in case, I broke out these puppies.
Don't think I don't watch Doomsday Prep Wars on the Splice Channel.
So I just put seven crash survivors in the conference room.
They didn't want to go to the hospital to get checked out.
They just wanted to be here with their loved ones.
I'd really like to interview them.
I don't think so.
Who are you, anyway?
This is Mandy Wells with WVGH.
She's with me.
Just keep the survivors there until we're ready to have them ID the deceased, all right?
And then we'll see if they want to talk to the press.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
Can I help you folks?
We were at the airport.
We were waiting for the flight to come in when we found out...
You have family on Flight 875?
Yes.
My husband.
His name is Thomas.
And my grandson, Max.
He was traveling alone.
Please check.
Okay, this is Dr. Brumfield.
He'll get you situated.
And we'll find out what happened to your loved ones.
You have a list in your hand right there.
Now is that a list of people that made it and who didn't?
Because I just need to know.
Is my wife...
Is she dead?
MAN:
Pam Jacks.
She's a flight attendant.
This list is incomplete.
But, Jacks...
I don't see her name.
What about Thomas?
Tom Westphall.
I am so sorry.
(SOBS) No.
Please, no.
Um, Mrs. Westphall, just one question... (LOWERED VOICE) Okay, come here, come here.
- Ow!
- Are you serious?
That woman just found out she lost her husband.
I am just doing my job.
Adam.
(SCOFFS)
We're about to autopsy the Air Marshal.
You in or out?
Uh, I'm out.
I'm on crowd control.
Megan, have you heard from Tommy?
Not yet.
You?
No.
So, blackout of '91, huh?
Guess you two go way back.
It's complicated.
I'm a pretty bright girl.
Try me.
(TIRES SQUEALING)
Must be debris from the plane.
(BEEP)
Call Adam Lucas.
(AUTODIALS)
(BUS Y SIGNAL BEEPING)
The cell towers must be taking a beating.
I'd try, but my battery's dead.
- Call Megan.
- (AUTODIALS)
MEGAN: (ON RECORDING) This is Megan Hunt.
Leave a message.
Megan, listen.
It's Tommy.
I'm just checking in.
I think I got a lead on the tail section, but it's pretty damn remote out here.
What the... (TIRES SQUEALING)
Petechial hemorrhaging means asphyxiation prior to crash.
STAFFORD:
Yeah, and prior to that, he was screaming about a "flying rat queen."
This guy was high as a kite on something.
On what, we won't know until the electricity comes back on.
I mean, all the labs are down.
We'll just have to wait to find out what it is he took.
Or was given.
I highly doubt that he decided to get his fix mid-air.
This looks like foul play to me.
That's a leap.
He was a US Air Marshal.
They're routinely subjected to drug tests and background checks.
What, so nobody ever faked a drug test before?
Have a buddy come in and pee in the cup?
You speaking from experience?
I'm speaking as someone who knows human beings.
They are predictably unpredictable.
There's no jaundice, no track marks, no bruxism.
This guy was not a drug addict.
Wait, so what are you saying?
He was just randomly drugged?
Not random.
He was an undercover Air Marshal.
Maybe somebody found out, somebody who had something so big to hide they were willing to do anything to keep it secret.
Lot of "ifs" in that scenario.
Okay, we've got six people in the conference room who had first-class seats to the show.
Why don't you find out what they saw?
So, Mr. Franco,
I need you to tell me everything you remember about the flight.
Anything at all, stupid things, things you don't think matter.
Maybe they do.
I remember there was this child kicking the back of my chair.
- Got to go pee.
- He was trying to get to the bathroom, but he practically ripped the back of my chair off trying to get there.
So I turned around to say something, and he bumped into the guy next to him, the gunman.
Did you notice anything else about him?
Yeah, I thought it was odd, you know?
This kid plows right into him, and he doesn't even blink.
He just keeps staring.
(WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY)
I remember he seemed polite.
When we boarded, he helped a woman with her carry-on luggage.
"Very polite," I remember saying to my wife.
She thought the man liked the woman.
STAFFORD:
Why did she think that?
MAN:
Because he came up to her and spoke with her a few times during the flight.
I didn't really notice him again until...
Anyway, he pulls out this ginormous gun from God knows where, and starts waving it around, yelling something about flying rats.
He aimed it right at me.
Well, not at me, at the chick beside me.
She was wearing this blue scarf.
Poor thing had been air sick during most of the flight.
She squeezed my hand during the shooting, during the crash.
It felt like hours, but it must have been seconds.
ADAM:
Tanner.
The woman in the blue scarf, do you remember her name?
She said her name was Carla.
Carla Mendez, seat 23-A, deceased.
She's here in the morgue.
One thing that they remember about her is the blue scarf.
That and the Air Marshal was fixated on her.
We need to take a look at her.
Verify her identity, find out where she's been, exactly what she was doing on that flight.
You think she's behind all this?
Maybe another victim.
People saw her going to the bathroom a lot.
She could have been drugged, too.
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
It's a voicemail from Tommy.
Service has been crap all night.
You're lucky you got anything.
Put it on speaker.
Megan, listen.
It's Tommy.
I'm just checking in.
I think I got a lead on the tail section, but it's pretty damn remote out here.
(TIRES SQUEAL)
(WOOD CRACKS, CRASHING)
Megan.
Megan.
Where are you going?
I'm gonna find him.
No, you're not.
It's chaos out there.
You stay here, do your job, find out who...
No, something has happened!
- Megan, I will find him.
- He's right.
He's got a badge, gun, a whole police department backing him up.
You find him.
Okay.
He's gonna be all right.
Yeah.
(BREATHES UNSTEADILY)
(PHONE RINGS)
Tommy!
TOMMY: (ON RECORDING) Sullivan.
You missed me.
Leave a message after the beep.
(PANTS)
Uh, Tommy, I don't know if you're gonna get this, but if you get this,
(VOICE BREAKS) I need you to know that...
Everything okay out here?
Yeah.
Yeah, everything's fine.
I'll be in in a sec.
(EXHALES)
You okay?
Yeah.
My left ankle's jacked, though.
You?
My shoulder's a little...
Phone's broken.
(GRUNTS)
Wait a second.
We almost hit somebody.
She's alive.
What's your name?
Pam.
Please, you have to help us.
Us?
Pam, where did you come from?
Down...
We'll be right back, Pam.
Where are you going?
I thought you were helping us with crowd control.
I'm not a traffic cop, Dr. Murphy.
Mandy's downstairs prepping her cameraman.
I'm about to bring them up, so maybe you could rein in the attitude a little?
You know, it's good to know you got your priorities in order.
If anyone has access to a radio or a working TV, they need information about what's going on here.
That is a priority.
So feel free to tell me whatever crawled up your ass.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
Or better yet, get over it.
- You wanna talk about it?
- Nope.
Okay.
So let's find out what made Carla Mendez so special that drove our Air Marshal friend off the deep end.
Yes, I'm beginning to agree with you.
He was drugged.
Maybe he thought she was some kind of terrorist threat.
Maybe he was right.
Let's have a look at her and find out.
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)
CURTIS:
Uh-oh.
Looks like the generator failed.
The backup should kick on any second.
Wait for it.
Wait for it.
- Backup genny's not working.
- Hell!
That's not supposed to happen.
- You two check on the generator.
- On it.
Lights.
Here, everybody take one, turn to channel three.
Stafford and I will find the emergency lanterns in the storage room.
The morgue, follow me.
Whoa.
Carla Mendez.
Her body is gone.
Not gone.
Stolen.
What do you mean "lockdown"?
Megan said a body is missing.
Somebody stole it, and nobody's going anywhere till they find it.
Wait a second.
Why doesn't she just send in the cavalry?
We can't call the cavalry until we get this generator running again.
I'm a doctor, okay?
I'm not an electrician.
No.
No, no, no.
This is not a blown fuse.
Look.
See those wires?
They were cut deliberately.
CURTIS:
Oh, crap.
Call Megan and tell her this is going to take a while.
Okay.
Wait a second.
You know how to fix this?
Look, I'm a trained pathologist, and I have all six seasons of Doomsday Prep Wars saved on my DVR.
I got this.
Now hand me those pliers.
Hello?
Hello?
Uh-huh.
Have you got a light?
"In case of emergency, use enclosed hex key
"to open ceiling panel and push manual lever."
What ceiling panel?
There's no hex key.
Where's the friggin' hex key?
(BANGS PANEL DOOR)
- All right, calm down.
- Calm down?
My partner's out there.
He may be dead.
And I can't go help him, because, hey, you know what?
You've got time to give your press conferences, but you don't have time to make sure that your generators are up to code or your damn elevator is working!
- (CREAKING)
- Stop.
Listen.
(CREAKING CONTINUES)
(LOUD BANG)
Can anybody hear me?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(POUNDING ON DOOR)
Hold on.
(TOMMY GRUNTS)
Just a second.
Hey.
Come on.
Come on out.
I'm Tommy.
What's your name?
Max.
You okay, Max?
Come with me.
Max!
I hid in the bathroom.
Of course you did.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
This might hurt a little bit.
Somehow, I knew.
(CRYING) I knew I was gonna die like this.
You're not gonna die.
Not if I can help it.
I'm just gonna put some padding in it to hold it in place.
(PAM GROANS) ...just to make a phone call at least.
- Everybody, quiet!
All right, everybody, quiet!
Be quiet!
We're asking that you remain calm.
Calm?
You've got armed guards at the doors.
Because somebody in this room sabotaged our generators in order to steal a key piece of evidence.
Tell us what the evidence was.
We can help look for it.
It was the body of the woman in 23-A, Carla Mendez.
Whoever was trying to cover their tracks in the air, is now trying to cover them on the ground.
And no one is leaving this room until we find out who and why.
MAN:
What does she have to do with me?
Or her?
Or him?
We weren't on the plane.
Yeah.
But they all were.
Don't look at me.
Look, not to be non, you know, post-racial or anything, but can you not just ask the Arab guy?
Okay, I'm Sikh, you idiot.
And you were sitting next to her the entire time.
Maybe the Air Marshal wasn't staring at her, maybe he was staring at you.
- You were talking to him.
- That's right.
- I saw you.
- No.
In the back of the plane, you guys were talking for a long time.
- No, no, no.
- Don't lie about it.
You were talking to him!
What were you talking about?
I wasn't talking to him, I was hanging out at the stewardess' station.
- There was this hot blonde...
- That's my wife!
- What did you do, you son-of-a-bitch?
- Hey, hey, hey!
All right, all right, all right.
Enough!
That's enough!
Enough!
Come with me.
Come with me.
Listen to me.
Listen.
I checked the morgue log.
It took a while because your wife wasn't in an assigned section of the plane.
But I can tell you for sure she is not here.
She wanted to retire last year.
You know what I said to her?
"No way.
"In this economy?
We need the money."
It's my fault she's up there.
I don't even know why I went off on that guy right there.
I don't know.
But for some reason, it was just the thought of the last kind thing ever said to my wife coming from a stranger.
Is that stupid?
No.
(VOICE BREAKING) You know,
I've been wracking my brain.
I'm just trying to think of the last thing I said to her.
I can't.
Because nothing about that moment said,
"This is the last time."
If we knew when that was gonna be, we'd all do things differently.
You lose someone, too, Doc?
He went out to find the tail section of the plane.
Stupid thing is I know exactly what my last words to him were,
(CHUCKLES) and they were not poetry.
They were trite, flippant.
Now I might never see him again.
I don't know.
Here.
How about that?
Let me see.
Give me a hand?
Okay.
Mm-hmm.
Listen, I'm sorry about Tommy.
I really do hope he's all right.
You wanna talk about it?
Nope.
(SCOFFS)
All right, what exactly is with you?
A reporter asks a couple of questions, and you Hulk out.
I mean, she's just trying to do her job.
Yeah, the job the DA asked her to do, to give you the Dan Russell treatment, right?
Make you look like a hero.
So what?
Dan's my mentor.
Dan and my dad are two peas in a pod.
- Seeing you follow in their footsteps...
- What?
Triggered some traumatic childhood memory?
Well, here's a news flash for you.
I am not Dan Russell, and I am not your father.
- Yeah, not yet.
- Please.
Dan and my dad are actually very good friends.
Well, they are two high-profile lawyers in Philadelphia, so?
Yeah, but it's the corrupt stuff they've done over the past few years that actually binds them together.
I think that's a bit of an exaggeration, don't you?
My dad, he tried to shine a light on the injustices against the little guy.
But little guys don't buy camera time, so he moved on to bigger and bigger guys.
And to win, he had to get into bed with some ugly people.
Before he knew it, my dad was crushing the little guy with the big guy.
And behind closed doors, a lot of bad stuff got swept under the rug.
Some of which was your mentor, Dan's.
Right now, you're still one of the good guys.
But you're signing up for the same ride my dad's on.
All it costs is your soul.
(GRUNTING)
- Got anything out of the survivors?
- Nada.
My "one of you in this room is a murderer" routine needs a little work.
What the hell happened to you two?
We got stuck in the elevator.
Been there for hours.
- You've been here this whole time?
- Yes.
You were supposed to be finding Tommy.
- Megan, we found...
- I have been able to focus on my job because I thought you were out there looking for him.
Megan, we radioed first responders for Tommy's crash as soon as we got free.
We found something.
STAFFORD:
Say hello to Carla Mendez, the infamous woman in the blue scarf.
Look at this.
Look at these edges.
That didn't happen in the crash.
That's postmortem.
KATE:
Yeah.
STAFFORD:
See the white residue right there?
I bet you that tests positive for cocaine.
From the distention of her stomach,
I'd say that she swallowed at least 80 bags.
That's a street value of what?
Eighty bags?
That's about 2 million.
Carla Mendez was a drug mule.
What do you want to bet the Air Marshal found out about it?
MEGAN:
Carla was carrying at least 80 bags of cocaine in her stomach, she becomes sick, possibly from turbulence, or maybe one of the bags ruptured.
ADAM:
So Air Marshal Davies gets suspicious, maybe he confronts her...
MEGAN:
And then either Carla herself, or, more likely, an accomplice,
Tanner, Sanjit, Roberto, drugs Davies to either kill him orjust to incapacitate him long enough to make their getaway.
STAFFORD:
Instead, he flips out, causing the plane to crash.
MAN:
Hey, hey, hey!
(PASSENGERS SCREAM)
Carla dies in the crash, but her accomplice doesn't.
He comes here to the morgue, cuts open her stomach, gets his stash, and tries to cover their tracks.
Well, then, whoever it was that did this is sitting right outside.
And we've interrogated them already.
But you didn't know what you were looking for.
Yeah, and you didn't have me.
It's not working.
Nothing you're doing is working.
(GENERATOR WHIRS)
What?
- Black-Gyver, you really did it!
- Tell me!
(BOTH GROANING)
(MURMURING)
Is this really necessary?
- ADAM:
Yes, it is.
- Okay.
Here you go.
(KEYS JANGLE)
Happy now, pal?
Megan.
Come on, man, that's not mine.
- Roberto Franco.
- Are you crazy, kid?
You are under arrest for the possession of narcotics.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be held against you in the court of law.
You have the right to an attorney...
You know, it doesn't really matter that he's been caught.
My wife is still dead.
LACEY:
Yeah, we're fine, Mom.
We slept through it mostly, actually.
Will I be seeing you soon?
Okay.
Bye.
She didn't want to talk to you.
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Okay.
Like daughter, like granddaughter?
You asked me a question last night, I snapped at you.
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.
You asked me why I didn't want to know the truth about Granddad.
It's because I already do.
He killed himself.
Do I have all the answers?
No.
But I had to move on.
And your mother is having a very tough time doing that.
And I understand.
I did, too.
I loved your granddad very much.
But if I didn't move forward, I never would have studied law,
I wouldn't have become a judge.
I wouldn't...
Or introduce Mom to a handsome young lawyer in your courtroom, and I wouldn't exist.
(INHALES DEEPLY)
You are an old soul.
And you would never, ever not exist.
Tell me if this hurts.
RILEY:
Come on, Max, let's go find that purse, huh?
She's good with kids.
How long have you two been dating?
Uh, we're not dating.
Why the hell not?
She likes you.
It's complicated.
Hmm.
Does complicated have a name?
Yeah.
What is it?
Megan.
Let me give you a bit of unsolicited advice.
Uncomplicate it.
And if you can't, move on.
You mean just settle?
No.
Be happy.
Life's too short.
I found your purse.
Right where you said it would be.
And your phone works, too.
- Great.
- Who should we call first?
(BEEPING)
(POURS LIQUID)
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
- Huh.
- Phones are back on?
What... (STAMMERING) That's my wife's number.
How is my wife calling your number?
MEGAN:
Let's see.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Oh, my God!
Look at you.
Wait, look at you.
Are you okay?
What's wrong?
We're okay, we're fine.
Who's we?
Wait, hey, I'm sorry to interrupt here, but you have my wife's phone.
Is she there?
Yeah.
Alex.
(VOICE BREAKS) Pammy?
Pam.
Oh, my God!
Hi.
Alex.
I'm so sorry.
(CRYING) I'm so sorry about everything.
No, baby, no, I'm the one who's sorry.
I'm so sorry.
(GRUNTS AND GAGS)
Pam.
Pam!
What's going on?
What's wrong?
TOMMY:
She's starting to shake.
Tommy, try to hold her.
Put the phone on her injuries.
Here.
Her pulse, it's racing.
She's in V-tach.
Does your wife have heart problems?
Yeah, she's got a murmur, but she's on medication for it.
Max, bring me that, please.
Thank you.
- Dig-oxin?
- Digoxin.
.24 milligrams oral?
Get her to take two pills.
Megan, she can't swallow, and if she's choking on her own blood, I don't think she can breathe.
MEGAN:
Her airway's blocked.
Tommy, you're gonna have to do an emergency tracheotomy.
No, absolutely not.
He's not a doctor.
He can't do this.
You're gonna need a knife, and find a ball point pen.
I got a pen.
MEGAN:
Take the ink stem out, feel her neck.
The ridges on her neck, there are two bumps.
I need you to hit right between those bumps.
One cut, horizontal, one inch long, one inch deep, right into the trachea.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Do it!
(SIGHS) Okay.
Okay, now take your finger, widen the hole, take the pen, push it down slowly towards her lung.
That's it.
Okay, it's in.
Okay.
It's not working, she's not breathing.
Why?
Why isn't she breathing?
(GASPS)
She's breathing.
- She's breathing.
- Good.
Good job.
Good to see you both alive.
- Phew!
(CHUCKLES)
- Thank you.
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
Megan.
So I was able to radio one of my old friends in Vice.
He says there's been talk of a shipment coming from overseas.
We could be dealing with a major cartel.
- What?
- He's alive. (CHUCKLES)
Safe.
Hey, I'm gonna hitch a ride out to the second crash site, you need me?
No.
Just nailed down the drug that knocked out our Air Marshal friend.
Digoxin.
- Weird.
- Digoxin?
That's the same drug the flight attendant was taking for her heart condition.
She's the one who drugged the Air Marshal.
I just saved the life of the person who brought down the plane.
So you're saying the flight attendant was really the drug runner?
Right, and Carla Mendez was her mule.
The Air Marshal catches on to Carla and informs the flight attendant.
He asks her to radio ahead and call the cops, not realizing that Pam is in on the whole thing.
Pam panics.
She has to neutralize him.
Enjoy.
So she drugs him with her heart meds, hoping to knock him out or maybe even kill him.
STAFFORD:
But digoxin, given in high enough dosages,
- (PASSENGERS SCREAMING) - causes violent hallucinations.
Air Marshal goes mad, shoots up the plane and brings it down.
So this guy, Roberto Franco, that you have in custody, he's what, a back-up drug handler?
No, two drug handlers for one mule?
It's unlikely.
Pam's husband told me that she wanted to quit flying two years ago, but he made her keep working.
What do you bet that he's her accomplice, and he framed Roberto Franco?
- The survivors, have they left yet?
- Yeah, just now.
Uh, I'll call security.
Alex Jacks?
Alex Jacks, hold it there.
What's this all about?
I believe every word that you said to me upstairs, about loving your wife, regretting choices that you made.
If you'd only let her retire two years ago, not from flying, but from drug running, which you failed to mention,
53 people would still be alive today.
What are you talking about?
You must work for some really scary people.
Your wife could have been in pieces for all you knew.
But you still had to retrieve whatever's in that bag right there.
- Was that your idea or your boss'?
- All right.
(GRUNTING)
(GROANS)
(MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)
I didn't want any of this to happen.
I just wanted the guy to pass out.
I didn't mean to kill anyone.
Yeah, well, even if things had worked out as planned, 2 million worth of drugs weren't gonna help anybody.
You made some bad choices.
Well, Max is off to meet his granddad.
And our limo awaits.
Headed out to the crash site?
No, the hospital or the police station, wherever they took the flight attendant.
And Tommy.
And Tommy.
Yeah, let me guess?
I'm not gonna get a rain check on that dinner, huh?
Eh, I don't think so, Charlie.
I kind of figured that story of yours wasn't over yet.
(SIGHS)
Oh, I was gonna wait till the madness passed to give you this, but here you go.
Order of exhumation for my father.
It's what you said you wanted.
Thank you.
Megan, sometimes, it's better to leave the past in the past.
I don't want to.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
Is Tommy Sullivan still...
I see him.
Hey.
I got a squaddie parked out back.
You ready?
- You look great.
- Thank you.
- Give me the keys.
- No.
One car wreck a day with you is my limit.
All right.
(SIGHS DEEPLY)
Hmm.
- Mills!
- Previously on Chicago fire...
Wasn't a kitchen fire, Chief.
When I was looking at the dangerous buildings map, it hit me that all the arsonist's targets were on there.
It's a fire fighter.
Steady work has been pretty hard to come by.
Is that why you're setting the fires?
I guess you better prove it.
You get 1% all for doing nothing but walking away from our bar.
There is a scotch tasting happening
Friday night.
Would you want to join me?
I'd love to.
Allowing visitors to ride on any of the apparatus is a serious violation.
How does she know that?
There is a snitch in the house.
Fire's comin'!
I pled guilty to D.U.I. manslaughter.
Can you take care of Griffin and Ben?
I think you've outgrown these sneakers.
Griffin, please don't kick your backpack.
You're gonna smash your lunch.
You guys know the drill, right?
My sister Christie is gonna pick you up from school today and you'll stay at her house tonight
- while I'm on shift.
[stomps]
Tomorrow's our big day, so I'm going to pick you up from school early.
Try not to get too dirty at lunch.
I told you, I'm not going.
I know, Griffin.
But you have to.
Griffin!
I'm picking you up early tomorrow, and that's the end of it.
Now let's get going.
I'm already late.
Yes!
Where was it?
Right where you said.
In the console.
Thank you so much for driving it over.
- Thank you.
- No worries.
Are you rushing to get away from me again?
Uh...
Look, I was just in a relationship that... that fell apart.
So...
So I guess this is good-bye forever?
[laughs] [laughs]
I owe you one.
A marker.
I like that.
What's it good for?
Come to Molly's tomorrow night and find out.
Severide...
Severide, hey.
- Hey, what's up, Otis?
- Nothing.
I was just talking to Shay, told me the good news.
- Good news?
- Your new apartment.
Sounds tight.
- Oh.
Yeah, thanks.
- Yeah, no, problem.
She did say it was a three-bedroom, and you guys might be looking for a third roommate to, uh... [clicks tongue] defray the costs.
- She said that?
- Hey!
Yo, Otis!
We agreed we were gonna to him together.
Why do you even need a new place, Cruz?
Your apartment isn't bad.
You spend a night in my neighborhood, lulled to sleep by gunfire!
You try living two doors down from my mother.
Now, Severide, this is exactly the kind of drama you won't have to deal with if you choose a mellow, mature roommate.
[scoffs] Guys, it's just an apartment.
You haven't even seen the place.
I can come by right after shift.
Me too.
Listen, this isn't cheerleader tryouts.
You guys need to work this out amongst yourselves.
Chief!
Hey!
- You got a minute?
- Just the one.
Hey.
I know who our arsonist is.
Who?
Hadley?
No way.
I'm not buying it.
Look, I don't want to believe it myself, but I got a real bad feeling about this.
[sighs]
My old man, he wants to take it arson, but... he'd like to get your blessing first.
You got any proof?
- No, but I...
- Look.
I had my issues with the man, but he's a fire fighter and a good one.
So you want to accuse him of starting fires, you'd better have more than a bad feeling.
[alarm walls] [over P.A.] Squad 3, ambulance 61.
Car in water.
330 West Lower Wacker.
Driver lost control and barreled right through the guard rail.
- Anyone come up?
- Not since I got here.
- How many in the vehicle?
- No idea.

Chicago Fire S02E03 "Defcon 1"
Sync and corrected by Gianluca Belfiglio
Give him a tug.
Something's wrong.
Try him again.
Rope's caught on something.
He's off line.
Damn it!
Shay, grab me the monitor.
What happened down there?
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Why are you two so eager to move in with Shay and Severide, anyway?
For the residual tail, Mouch.
The...
The what now?
Okay, between Severide and Shay, think how many beautiful women are going to be parading through the apartment.
Imagine it:
Severide is out at the bar, he's chatting up some babe.
- She's got a friend.
- Uh-oh.
The fun doesn't have to stop there.
All he has to say is,
"Hey, let's take this back to my place where we can hang out with my awesome roommate, Joe."
- "Brian."
- Pathetic.
Okay, Mouch, why do you want to be their roommate?
I've been lonely since Mari left.
Oh, yeah.
That's not pathetic at all.
Great news, Otis.
I just got our beer distributor to comp us two kegs for the promotion.
Way to hustle, Herrmann.
Good beer or cheap beer?
Free beer.
Meanwhile, I still need 200 signatures to secure my nomination.
Relax, all right?
We'll get there.
Hey, you know, Mouch, you should meet my friend, Isabella.
She spent the last two years in D.C.
working for some congressman.
And she's back home now trying to start up her own political consulting firm.
That's overkill, don't you think?
It's not like he's running for POTUS.
Thank you, Gabriela.
I would very much like to meet your friend.
Wait, hold on.
Is she hot?
She's straight.
Hey, Mills, um, you got a sec?
Yeah.
What's up, Lieutenant?
My pop's out on the apron.
He wants to come in but doesn't want to disrespect you.
So, if you want him to stay outside...
Yeah, tell him he can stay outside.
He's here to help out with the arson investigation.
[sighs]
Okay.
Where I come from, you get in a fight, you shake each other's hands afterwards... and you put it behind you.
I can do that if you can.
I like you, kid.
You remind me of...
This doesn't make us buddies.
Just find the son of a bitch who torched my mom's diner.
Okay?
Just tell me why you think I should give you my blessing to investigate Kevin Hadley.
There's a well-established psychological profile for fire fighter arsonists, and Hadley fits it to a tee.
They tend to be white and male.
They come from broken homes.
Hadley's father abandoned them when he was 13.
They're usually unmarried.
They lack stable interpersonal relationships.
I mean, Chief, you saw the way he blew everything up around here.
Benny, you're talking about half the fire fighters I know, including you.
Chief, it's Hadley right down the list.
So you think he's motivated by anger over getting kicked out of 51?
You told him he wasn't worthy of this house, so he's trying to prove you wrong...
Show you that he's smarter than you are.
And he isn't going to stop until someone's dead.
Chief, you should know that I...
I confronted Hadley about this.
Really?
What'd he say?
He said, "Prove it."
- Hey, Pete.
- Yeah.
- How's your mom doing?
- Okay.
Trying to decide if she should rebuild or just call it quits.
Tell her we're going to take this arsonist down.
She knows.
We draw straws for the third bedroom.
No.
No, there is no way I am leaving this up to random chance.
It ought to be about who wants it most.
We should have a contest.
Dude...
The "Cinnamon challenge."
Where you try to eat a spoonful of cinnamon
- in under 60 seconds?
- Exactly.
You mean the Internet craze that lands people in the hospital with a collapsed lung?
- Yeah, that's the one.
- What are we, a bunch of frat boys all of a sudden?
It's cool.
Benny's got a solid reason to be here.
They told you about Hadley?
What about Hadley?
Uh...
Kelly thinks Hadley's the one responsible for the arson fires.
What?
Shay, are you serious?
[objects clatter] [clattering] [cell phone vibrates] I'll talk to him.
This is Matt.
Yeah, why?
Chief, need a big favor.
I got to run out for half an hour.
After you were late this morning?
Yeah, I know, Chief, but can Herrmann cover as acting officer while I'm gone?
You need a Lieutenant to cover for you.
I need that paperwork on my desk.
Chief, it's half an hour.
There better be a damn good reason.
There is.
Thanks.
[school bell rings]
Believe me,
Griffin and I are gonna have a long talk the minute I get off shift.
This won't happen again.
I have to say, Matt, this whole child care situation doesn't exactly instill me with confidence.
We're making the best of it.
There are other options.
Not for me.
I...
I have an obligation to Heather and her late husband.
Matt, your only obligation is to Griffin and Ben.
You need to make sure they have constant and proper guidance.
And if I feel like you can't provide that while you're working 24-hour shifts, well, then I have to share my concerns with DCFS.
[door opens] Hello?
Dawson?
- Hi.
- I'm sorry.
You are?
I'm Gabby Dawson.
I'm with Matt.
[police radio chatter, static]
Ugh.
I'm sorry about that.
I'm sorry.
I'm still on duty.
Ugh.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Um...
This isn't like Griffin at all.
Obviously, he's acting out.
In a span of a year, he's lost his father, and his mother's been taken away.
But he'll get there.
He'll get there.
He just needs to know that we're here and that we love him and it's okay to feel whatever he's feeling right now.
Thank you.
That's, uh... that's just what I was about to tell Matt.
[school bell rings]
Boden's got a big mouth.
You didn't have to come.
But you're so glad I did.
Griffin, what are you doing?
You can't just go around hitting kids.
All right, we'll talk later.
I'm gonna pick you up early tomorrow.
You can't.
I have detention.
Griffin, it's not like I'm trying to drag you along to pick up my dry cleaning.
This is a big deal.
Later.
Matt, if you're gonna engage in a battle of wills with an 11-year-old, you're gonna lose.
So what?
I'm supposed to back down?
No.
No, just back off a little.
Let him come to you.
Oh, good afternoon, Chief.
[both chuckle]
Ms. McLeod.
Come right in.
[laughs]
Um, listen.
A Kevin Hadley was dismissed from your house earlier this year.
Is that correct?
Why is arson discussing ongoing investigations with an outside consultant?
The reasons for his transfer are vague.
Why'd you force him out?
I don't believe that's your business.
Chief, all due respect, if one of your former men is now setting fires all over this city, it doesn't exactly cast your leadership abilities in the most flattering light.
Kevin Hadley exhibited unacceptable behavior toward another fire fighter.
He couldn't remain in the house.
I showed him the door.
Without filing a grievance with human resources?
I opted not to report his behavior.
My aim was to get the man out of the house, not to ruin his career.
So you let his unacceptable behavior go unreported, and now he's targeting 51 with arson fires.
Okay.
Well, thank you, Chief.
I just needed to get some clarification on that.
You have a good day.
Yeah.
How's it going, Clarke?
Cruz.
So a bunch of us are going to Molly's tomorrow.
- You should join us.
- Yeah.
Sure, tip back a few beers, get to know us all a bit better.
What's a movie from 1985 starring Cher?
Four letters.
I don't know.
Addams Family?
Anyhow, maybe we'll see you at Molly's.
Your wife too.
Bring her along.
Hey, Capp.
Can I borrow you for a second?
Brian, just go slow.
If I feel a pinch, I'll speak up.
You're sure about this.
It's gonna destroy the ring.
Or maybe we can get it off with olive oil.
My wife moved out, back in August.
So I don't need the ring anymore.
Sorry to hear that.
Yeah, what are you gonna do?
[alarm walls]
Keep that under your hat, huh?
- [over P.A.] Ambulance 61...
- Yeah, sure.
2051 West Potomac.
So...
I just pretended to be Casey's girlfriend.
Um, anyway, it's kind of a long story.
But the point is, it wasn't a big deal.
I mean, I wasn't, like, nervous or awkward or anything.
I'm content just being his friend.
Wow.
You're really into this Jay guy, aren't you?
Yeah, I think I am.
Okay.
Here we go.
What are we looking at?
Over here.
My buddy Chris.
He's got a little... problem.
Yep, that's a problem.
Okay, one nail I get.
But four?
He disabled the safety on his nail gun so it'll shoot rapid fire.
- A real time saver.
- They're in pretty tight.
Hey, Dawson, should we call a truck?
I don't know.
He's already going into shock.
Do you have a saw?
- We need to cut this board free.
- Yeah, here.
Whoa!
Oh!
Aah!
Deep breaths, deep breaths.
There you go.
Cut it as short as you can.
Ooh, ooh, ooh... [saw grating] Oh!
It's vibrating!
Sorry, man!
Are you okay?
He won't be okay until we get him to a hospital.
- Keep cutting.
- I can't.
I can't!
We're not amputating an arm.
It's a piece of wood!
Give it to me.
Cover his eyes.
[saw grating] [man screaming] [panting]
Aah!
Can you stand up?
Nice and easy.
Here you go.
Stay close to me.
Oh, and you guys should be wearing eye protection.
All right, this is an I.P.A.
It's a little hoppier than the last one.
Give it a taste.
It's not bad, right?
We got a whole slew of different...
I'm telling you, girl, you'd love Daft Punk.
"Get lucky." Oh, you're kidding me!
The guys with the crazy helmets!
[foreign accent] Oh!
Is that the horsey-riding song?
The... [galloping]
- [Cruz giggles]
- No?
God, no.
No.
You know what, girl?
You're about to have your horizons broadened.
I am gonna make you a mix CD.
Just you wait.
Hey, Cruz.
Mouch is here.
Time for the cinnamon challenge.
We're not really gonna do this thing, are we?
Are you kidding me?
I've been promoting it on my podcast.
I mean, people came out here to watch.
You know what?
I don't need the apartment that bad.
I'm out.
Looks like it is down to you and me, Cruz.
May the best man win.
Dude, this is ground cumin.
[container thuds] Oh, shoot.
Hey, they're right next to each other on the shelf!
Hey, Mouch.
I want you to meet my girl Isabella.
- Ah, the kingmaker, huh?
- [Isabella laughs]
I've heard a lot about you.
And I about you.
Sounds like you could use some campaign help.
Nice.
Firm grip.
Nobody ever won an election with clammy hands.
The secret is:
I wipe my palm on my pants.
So talk to me about your campaign strategy.
Uh, we just started talking about what I should...
Oh, cute.
Indeed.
- [Peter scoffs and laughs]
- Here, try this one.
Who is this guy?
Oh, that?
That's Jay.
He's sort of a regular now.
They're...
They're just friends.
It's cool, Otis.
I can handle it.
[low conversation]
She looks happy.
[police siren whooping]
Who's in charge here?
He is.
Hey, how ya doin', officers?
Come back after shift and try the autumn ale.
We got a complaint from one of your neighbors.
You're kidding me.
Who complained?
You know I can't tell you that.
Look, I'm afraid you're gonna have to shut this booth down.
No, no, no, no...
I cleared this with the city, see?
I got a permit that says we can hold an outdoor event, see?
[paper rustles] We're on the up and up.
This isn't about permits.
"Unlimited beer tasting, $10."
It's a violation of happy hour laws.
Can't serve unlimited alcohol for a set price.
Shut it down or get fined.
Right.
Game day.
Sorry, folks.
Gotta shut it down.
You wanna go to Defcon 5, Game Day?
I can go to Defcon 5.
Defcon 5 is actually the lowest level.
Shut up, Otis.
Okay.
What does that mean exactly,
"They put him on their list of suspects"?
Means that they're taking our suspicions seriously.
They'll dig into Hadley's background, maybe bring him in for questioning.
What they ought to do is keep an eye on him 24/7.
They need to catch him in the act.
Arson investigation doesn't have the manpower
- for that kind of surveillance.
- Hell, I got time on my hands.
I'll stake out his place.
Kelly, you start meddling with the investigation, and you could put their case on very shaky procedural grounds.
Please, just let A.I. handle it, okay?
Wow.
Hey.
This is a nice place you found here, Leslie.
Thank you.
And thanks so much for helping out.
I...
I feel bad.
You probably want to get back to Beth and the kids.
No, no, it's okay.
Anyway, Kelly needs me.
Well, come on.
Between these arson fires and Renee pulling the rug out from under you...
You're having trouble at home, aren't you?
Well, Beth and I are taking a little break right now.
- Oh, boy.
- No, no, it's gonna be fine.
I'm driving back to Kenosha every weekend.
It'll work out, okay?
Hey, can you give me a hand with the coffee table?
[Shay mutters]
We were doing pretty good there until officer friendly showed up.
After expenses, we cleared 62 bucks.
And remember, Arthur's gonna show up at the end of the week to collect his share of that.
Great.
Thanks for reminding me.
Arthur's this wannabe mobster who weaseled his way into a silent partnership.
Total leech.
[drawer bangs]
Hey, go home, Herrmann.
You've been on your feet all day.
- I'll finish cleaning up.
- Thanks, Dawson.
Maybe I'll go pour myself a nice, big, tall glass of antifreeze.
[keys jingle]
Good night.
[click]
Do you want a hand with the glasses?
[keys jingle]
Yeah, we could wash the glasses.
Or we could... let them soak awhile.
[keys clatter]
You need anything, Gabby?
Sorry, what?
You want some toast or something?
Oh, no.
Sorry, I'm great.
Thanks.
- See, you just got re-tweeted.
- Amazing.
Dawson, I owe you big-time.
Isabella's a real find.
What's going on?
I set Randy up with a social media presence so he can reach out to the online CFD community.
Now he can gather endorsements electronically.
I only need 120 more signatures, and I'm on the ballot.
That's great.
Where's Herrmann?
He should see this. [laughs]
- Thanks so much for doing this.
- Yeah, it's great practice.
And if I can get Randy elected union president that'll really help me establish myself in Chicago.
Yeah.
Plus it's no chore hanging around a firehouse, if you know what I mean.
I think Pete over there has a thing for me.
Oh, he's your ex?
Gabby, I didn't realize.
Don't worry, he's off-limits.
No, no.
Actually... you know what?
He's fair game.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
Can I have your attention, please?
As per discussion I have just had with our consultant friend Ms. McLeod, from here on out, anyone who must leave a shift for personal reasons, you need to submit a request and allow enough time for a relief to be brought in.
Absolutely no exceptions.
By the way...
Otis.
Cinnamon challenge.
Are you out of your mind?
Oh, it's cool, Chief.
We're gonna have a paramedic present.
You are a fire fighter with the city of Chicago, and you are promoting a dangerous stunt that has filled emergency rooms with victims who are stupid enough to try it!
Cinnamon challenge?
What cinnamon challenge?
We're not doing a cinnamon challenge.
I didn't think so.
How is she finding out all this stuff?
I know she doesn't subscribe to your podcast.
Can I have your attention, please?
I got an announcement to make too!
Just a heads up.
Lately we've been finding rat turds all over the house.
Seems that we have an infestation.
Finkus backstabberus... better known as the common snitch.
Not to fear, though.
These disgusting vermin don't typically last long at 51.
Something you wanna say to me, Herrmann?
Just puttin' it out there, Clarke.
A general warning.
Well, maybe I should give you a very specific warning.
Come on.
Come on!
Hey!
Enough.
Enough!
Enough of this.
You gotta be kidding me.
- Old 51.
I miss this place.
- Easy, Mills.
How's everyone been?
What are you doing here?
Just wanna buy a T-shirt.
Got to support the local firehouse, right?
Get out.
Before I carry you out.
Why?
So you can keep spreading lies about me?
What can we help you with, Hadley?
That's a laugh.
If I ever need help with anything, this is the last place I'll come looking for it.
Hey, buddy?
New guy.
Watch your back around here.
Word to the wise.
[alarm walls] [over P.A.] Engine 51, truck 81, squad 3, ambulance 61, battalion 25.
House fire.
South California and Madison.
[sirens whooping]
[horn blasting]
It's a condemned house.
Structurally unsound.
He's setting another trap for us, Chief.
Yeah, no doubt.
I'm gonna hold off.
Truck 81, Squad 3, stand down.
Engine 51, hit it with your water cannon.
Nobody goes inside.
We gonna let this one burn to the ground if we have to.
[glass shatters] [man groans]
- Dawson, Shay!
- Hey, buddy.
Hey, buddy.
Hold still!
Hold still!
Don't move.
My girlfriend's inside.
I can't find her.
Send me and Capp in.
That fire's in the structure.
We'll do one rapid primary search, and we'll get out.
You got one minute.
Capp!
Come on, let's move.
Herrmann!
Mills!
Get 'em a straight ladder.
Got it.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy.
- My girlfriend is...
- Take it easy!
They're looking for her right now, okay?
If she's still up there, they'll find her.
No!
She's not...
She's not upstairs!
- What?
- She woke me up.
Said she smelled something funny coming from the basement.
I think she went back down there!
Chief!
We got a problem!
Severide, get out of there.
She is not upstairs.
Get outta there now.
Copy that!
Capp!
Spellman, get a crew in the back door with a 1 3/4-inch hose.
Clear a path for truck to get into the basement.
- On it, chief.
- Mills!
- Yeah.
- With me.
Fire department!
Call out!
[instrument blipping]
Lieutenant!
We got her!
[creaking]
Chief!
We're cut off!
We're gonna need help getting out of the side window in sector four!
51!
Bring a ladder to sector four!
[glass shattering]
Move!
They don't have long!
All right, ready?
Go!
Got her?
- She's breathing.
- Lift her up.
Mills, you first.
[low chatter]
On "three." One, two, three.
We need saline and an IO drill and burn sheets...
lot's of 'em.
Severide.
Take it easy, Severide!
You almost killed that girl, you son of a bitch!
She could spend the next six months in the burn unit
- 'cause of you!
- Now, this is insanity.
Just followed you over here to watch you work.
- We know you started this fire!
- How could I?
I was at 51 when it happened.
You saw me.
Severide!
Severide.
You know what?
Keep your lousy T-shirt.
Let's go!
We got a fire to fight.
We're gonna go inside and sign us in.
Then we'll walk through a metal detector, just like at the airport.
They'll take us to a visiting room, then the guards will bring your mom in to sit and talk.
She'll be wearing kind of a funny jumpsuit and maybe she won't have on any makeup.
But she's still your mom.
- She still loves you.
- Can we just get on with it?
Griffin.
Listen to me, I've been where you are.
I know it's not easy to see your mom this way, but you have no idea what a great thing it is you're doing for her.
You two are all she has right now.
So keep being brave.
For her.
Okay.
All right.
Ready?
Yeah.
Okay, let's do it.
[baby crying] [beep] [buzzer]
[machinery beeping, buzzing, low chatter] [buzzer]
Mama!
Mama!
Mom!
Hey.
I missed you.
So I gotta sit there and listen to this guy Rome from arson and my old man lecture me about how I'm playing right into Hadley's hands.
That I'm giving him the attention he craves.
- What do they expect you to do?
- They want me to ignore him.
So he gets bolder, I guess...
I don't know... and slips up.
- What, or kill someone?
- That's... yes.
That's what I said.
I mean...
Hadley worked under me for two years.
I should have seen this coming.
Whoa.
Look, Kelly.
Don't put yourself through that.
It's not your fault.
I'm just sick and tired of waiting for bells to go off.
We need to stop reacting and start anticipating.
That's what we need to do.
No, what we need to do is let arson handle this.
And you and I need to go somewhere and get drunk.
Come on, I'm buying.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
Come on.
[both laugh]
God, you cheap-ass!
Come on.
Come on, Otis, we got drinks to serve.
This'll only take a minute.
And you're gonna love it.
Trust me.
[clicks tongue] [police radio chatter]
- Otis.
- Yes?
Did you call the fire marshal to report an over-capacity crowd at Game Day?
I don't know what you're talking about, Christopher.
What are you guys doing?
I think Otis just took us to Defcon 1.
Right this way, folks!
We got half-price drinks!
- Come on in and party!
- [both laugh]
Go get 'em!
- I'm getting outta here.
- [Joe chucking]
- Hey.
- Joe.
You burned me a CD?
Aw.
You are adorable.
[kisses] [chuckles]
What's up, Cruz?
[engine revving]
[distant voices]
Everything all right?
He wants you to promise you won't go away.
Like mom and dad.
I'm right here, guys.
I'm not going anywhere.
[loud overlapping chatter]
- Where's Zoya?
- No idea.
Okay, so... due to liability concerns, we had to Ixnay the cinnamon challenge.
But...
But fear not.
For Joe Cruz and I... are going to attempt the saltine cracker challenge:
where we will attempt to eat six crackers in under a minute with not a drop of water.
[Random groans] No, no, no, no.
It's gonna be awesome.
Trust me.
Okay, here we go.
[timer beeps]
[muffled]
Oh.
You can take the third bedroom.
- I'm out.
- Reawy?
[coughs]
Yeah!
Yeah-ah!
[unimpressed comments] Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Ha ha ha!
- All I ask is that you don't sit idly by while Greg Sullivan runs unopposed.
Your signature will help put me on the ballot, make sure we have a real choice at the voting booth.
Thank you, Tony.
[laughs]
He's like a new man.
Give me a lump of clay, and I'll mold it into a masterpiece.
- Oof!
- [both chuckle]
We're about to get our last two signatures.
Um, do you want to celebrate later?
Yeah, it sounds like fun.
Uh, do you realize that Gabby and I...
Gabby and I talked.
She's cool with it.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Interesting.
We did it!
200 signatures.
We made the deadline.
I am on the ballot!
[cheers and applause]
Hey, you and me, buddy!
We're going all the way!
Wow!
Well, well, well.
How about this crowd, huh?
Things are really looking up around here, huh?
So...
Hey, Dawson, get Arthur his dough... so he can be on his way.
Some kinda joke?
That's 1%, per our agreement.
What?
You want an audit?
No, tough guy.
I don't want an audit.
I want a new deal.
See, my man Jay here... he's been assessing your business.
We'll talk numbers soon, huh?
So... when you said that you were... you were working construction, you meant you were working for Arthur?
Look...
And you came here to spy on us?
Get outta my bar.
Now.
Sync and corrected by Gianluca Belfiglio
Wasn't a kitchen fire, chief.
When I was looking at the dangerous buildings map, it hit me that all the arsonist's targets were on there.
It's a fire fighter.
Steady work has been pretty hard to come by.
Is that why you're setting the fires?
I guess you better prove it.
You get 1% all for doing nothing but walking away from our bar.
There is a scotch tasting happening
Friday night.
Would you want to join me?
I'd love to.
Allowing visitors to ride on any of the apparatus is a serious violation.
How does she know that?
There is a snitch in the house.
Fire's comin'!
I pled guilty to D.U.I. manslaughter.
Can you take care of Griffin and Ben?
I think you've outgrown these sneakers.
Griffin, please don't kick your backpack.
You're gonna smash your lunch.
You guys know the drill, right?
My sister Christie is gonna pick you up from school today and you'll stay at her house tonight while I'm on shift.
Tomorrow's our big day, so I'm going to pick you up from school early.
Try not to get too dirty at lunch.
I told you, I'm not going.
I know, Griffin.
But you have to.
Griffin!
I'm picking you up early tomorrow, and that's the end of it.
Now let's get going.
I'm already late.
Yes!
Where was it?
Right where you said.
In the console.
Thank you so much for driving it over.
- Thank you.
- No worries.
Are you rushing to get away from me again?
Uh...
Look, I was just in a relationship that... that fell apart.
So...
So I guess this is good-bye forever?
I owe you one.
A marker.
I like that.
What's it good for?
Come to Molly's tomorrow night and find out.
Severide...
Severide, hey.
- Hey, what's up, Otis?
- Nothing.
I was just talking to Shay, told me the good news.
- Good news?
- Your new apartment.
Sounds tight.
- Oh.
Yeah, thanks.
- Yeah, no, problem.
She did say it was a three-bedroom, and you guys might be looking for a third roommate to, uh... defray the costs.
- She said that?
- Hey!
Yo, Otis!
We agreed we were gonna to him together.
Why do you even need a new place, Cruz?
Your apartment isn't bad.
You spend a night in my neighborhood, lulled to sleep by gunfire!
You try living two doors down from my mother.
Now, Severide, this is exactly the kind of drama you won't have to deal with if you choose a mellow, mature roommate.
Guys, it's just an apartment.
You haven't even seen the place.
I can come by right after shift.
Me too.
Listen, this isn't cheerleader tryouts.
You guys need to work this out amongst yourselves.
Chief!
Hey!
- You got a minute?
- Just the one.
Hey.
I know who our arsonist is.
Who?
Hadley?
No way.
I'm not buying it.
Look, I don't want to believe it myself, but I got a real bad feeling about this.
My old man, he wants to take it arson, but... he'd like to get your blessing first.
You got any proof?
- No, but I...
- Look.
I had my issues with the man, but he's a fire fighter and a good one.
So you want to accuse him of starting fires, you'd better have more than a bad feeling.
Squad 3, Ambulance 61.
Car in water.
330 West Lower Wacker.
Driver lost control and barreled right through the guard rail.
- Anyone come up?
- Not since I got here.
- How many in the vehicle?
- No idea.
Give him a tug.
Something's wrong.
Try him again.
Rope's caught on something.
He's off line.
Damn it!
Shay, grab me the monitor.
What happened down there?
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Why are you two so eager to move in with Shay and Severide, anyway?
For the residual tail, Mouch.
The... the what now?
Okay, between Severide and Shay, think how many beautiful women are going to be parading through the apartment.
Severide is out at the bar, he's chatting up some babe.
She's got a friend.
The fun doesn't have to stop there.
All he has to say is,
"hey, let's take this back to my place where we can hang out with my awesome roommate, Joe."
- "Brian."
- Pathetic.
Okay, Mouch, why do you want to be their roommate?
I've been lonely since Mari left.
Oh, yeah.
That's not pathetic at all.
Great news, Otis.
I just got our beer distributor to comp us two kegs for the promotion.
Way to hustle, Herrmann.
Good beer or cheap beer?
Free beer.
Meanwhile, I still need 200 signatures to secure my nomination.
Relax, all right?
We'll get there.
Hey, you know, Mouch, you should meet my friend, Isabella.
She spent the last two years in D.C.
Working for some congressman.
And she's back home now trying to start up her own political consulting firm.
That's overkill, don't you think?
It's not like he's running for potus.
Thank you, Gabriela.
I would very much like to meet your friend.
Wait, hold on.
Is she hot?
She's straight.
Hey, Mills, um, you got a sec?
Yeah.
What's up, Lieutenant?
My pop's out on the apron.
He wants to come in but doesn't want to disrespect you.
So, if you want him to stay outside...
Yeah, tell him he can stay outside.
He's here to help out with the arson investigation.
Okay.
Where I come from, you get in a fight, you shake each other's hands afterwards... and you put it behind you.
I can do that if you can.
I like you, kid.
You remind me of...
This doesn't make us buddies.
Just find the son of a bitch who torched my mom's diner.
Okay?
Just tell me why you think I should give you my blessing to investigate Kevin Hadley.
There's a well-established psychological profile for fire fighter arsonists, and Hadley fits it to a tee.
They tend to be white and male.
They come from broken homes.
Hadley's father abandoned them when he was 13.
They're usually unmarried.
They lack stable interpersonal relationships.
I mean, Chief, you saw the way he blew everything up around here.
Benny, you're talking about half the fire fighters I know, including you.
Chief, it's Hadley right down the list.
So you think he's motivated by anger over getting kicked out of 51?
You told him he wasn't worthy of this house, so he's trying to prove you wrong...
Show you that he's smarter than you are.
And he isn't going to stop until someone's dead.
Chief, you should know that I...
I confronted Hadley about this.
Really?
What'd he say?
He said, "prove it."
- Hey, Pete.
- Yeah.
- How's your mom doing?
- Okay.
Trying to decide if she should rebuild or just call it quits.
Tell her we're going to take this arsonist down.
She knows.
Wedraw straws for the third bedroom.
No.
No, there is no way I am leaving this up to random chance.
It ought to be about who wants it most.
We should have a contest.
Dude...
The "Cinnamon challenge."
Where you try to eat a spoonful of cinnamon
- in under 60 seconds?
- Exactly.
You mean the Internet craze that lands people in the hospital with a collapsed lung?
- Yeah, that's the one.
- What are we, a bunch of frat boys all of a sudden?
It's cool.
Benny's got a solid reason to be here.
They told you about Hadley?
What about Hadley?
Kelly thinks Hadley's the one responsible for the arson fires.
What?
Shay, are you serious?
I'll talk to him.
This is Matt.
Yeah, why?
Chief, need a big favor.
I got to run out for half an hour.
After you were late this morning?
Yeah, I know, Chief, but can Herrmann cover as acting officer while I'm gone?
You need a Lieutenant to cover for you.
I need that paperwork on my desk.
Chief, it's half an hour.
There better be a damn good reason.
There is.
Thanks.
Believe me,
Griffin and I are gonna have a long talk the minute I get off shift.
This won't happen again.
I have to say, Matt, this whole child care situation doesn't exactly instill me with confidence.
We're making the best of it.
There are other options.
Not for me.
I...
I have an obligation to Heather and her late husband.
Matt, your only obligation is to Griffin and Ben.
You need to make sure they have constant and proper guidance.
And if I feel like you can't provide that while you're working 24-hour shifts, well, then I have to share my concerns with DCFS.
Hello?
Dawson?
- Hi.
- I'm sorry.
You are?
I'm Gabby Dawson.
I'm with Matt.
I'm sorry about that.
I'm sorry.
I'm still on duty.
- Hey.
- Hey.
This isn't like Griffin at all.
Obviously, he's acting out.
In a span of a year, he's lost his father, and his mother's been taken away.
But he'll get there.
He'll get there.
He just needs to know that we're here and that we love him and it's okay to feel whatever he's feeling right now.
Thank you.
That's, uh... that's just what I was about to tell Matt.
Boden's got a big mouth.
You didn't have to come.
But you're so glad I did.
Griffin, what are you doing?
You can't just go around hitting kids.
All right, we'll talk later.
I'm gonna pick you up early tomorrow.
You can't.
I have detention.
Griffin, it's not like I'm trying to drag you along to pick up my dry cleaning.
This is a big deal.
Later.
Matt, if you're gonna engage in a battle of wills with an 11-year-old, you're gonna lose.
So what?
I'm supposed to back down?
No.
No, just back off a little.
Let him come to you.
Oh, good afternoon, Chief.
Ms. McLeod.
Come right in.
Um, listen.
A Kevin Hadley was dismissed from your house earlier this year.
Is that correct?
Why is arson discussing ongoing investigations with an outside consultant?
The reasons for his transfer are vague.
Why'd you force him out?
I don't believe that's your business.
Chief, all due respect, if one of your former men is now setting fires all over this city, it doesn't exactly cast your leadership abilities in the most flattering light.
Kevin Hadley exhibited unacceptable behavior toward another fire fighter.
He couldn't remain in the house.
I showed him the door.
Without filing a grievance with human resources?
I opted not to report his behavior.
My aim was to get the man out of the house, not to ruin his career.
So you let his unacceptable behavior go unreported, and now he's targeting 51 with arson fires.
Okay.
Well, thank you, Chief.
I just needed to get some clarification on that.
You have a good day.
Yeah.
How's it going, Clarke?
Cruz.
So a bunch of us are going to Molly's tomorrow.
- You should join us.
- Yeah.
Sure, tip back a few beers, get to know us all a bit better.
What's a movie from 1985 starring Cher?
Four letters.
I don't know.
Addams Family?
Anyhow, maybe we'll see you at Molly's.
Your wife too.
Bring her along.
Hey, Capp.
Can I borrow you for a second?
Brian, just go slow.
If I feel a pinch, I'll speak up.
You're sure about this.
It's gonna destroy the ring.
Or maybe we can get it off with olive oil.
My wife moved out, back in August.
So I don't need the ring anymore.
Sorry to hear that.
Yeah, what are you gonna do?
Keep that under your hat, huh?
- Ambulance 61...
- Yeah, sure.
2051 West Potomac.
So...
I just pretended to be Casey's girlfriend.
Um, anyway, it's kind of a long story.
But the point is, it wasn't a big deal.
I mean, I wasn't, like, nervous or awkward or anything.
I'm content just being his friend.
Wow.
You're really into this Jay guy, aren't you?
Yeah, I think I am.
Okay.
Here we go.
What are we looking at?
Over here.
My buddy Chris.
He's got a little... problem.
Yep, that's a problem.
Okay, one nail I get.
But four?
He disabled the safety on his nail gun so it'll shoot rapid fire.
- A real time saver.
- They're in pretty tight.
Hey, Dawson, should we call a truck?
I don't know.
He's already going into shock.
Do you have a saw?
- We need to cut this board free.
- Yeah, here.
Deep breaths, deep breaths.
There you go.
Cut it as short as you can.
Oh!
It's vibrating!
Sorry, man!
Are you okay?
He won't be okay until we get him to a hospital.
- Keep cutting.
- I can't.
I can't!
We're not amputating an arm.
It's a piece of wood!
Give it to me.
Cover his eyes.
Can you stand up?
Nice and easy.
Here you go.
Stay close to me.
Oh, and you guys should be wearing eye protection.
All right, this is an I.P.A.
It's a little hoppier than the last one.
Give it a taste.
It's not bad, right?
We got a whole slew of different...
I'm telling you, girl, you'd love Daft Punk.
"Get lucky." Oh, you're kidding me!
The guys with the crazy helmets!
Oh!
Is that the horsey-riding song?
The...
No?
God, no.
No.
You know what, girl?
You're about to have your horizons broadened.
I am gonna make you a mix CD.
Just you wait.
Hey, Cruz.
Mouch is here.
Time for the cinnamon challenge.
We're not really gonna do this thing, are we?
Are you kidding me?
I've been promoting it on my podcast.
I mean, people came out here to watch.
You know what?
I don't need the apartment that bad.
I'm out.
Look like it is down to you and me, Cruz.
May the best man win.
Dude, this is ground cumin.
Oh, shoot.
Hey, they're right next to each other on the shelf!
Hey, Mouch.
I want you to meet my girl Isabella.
Ah, the kingmaker, huh?
I've heard a lot about you.
And I about you.
Sounds like you could use some campaign help.
Nice.
Firm grip.
Nobody ever won an election with clammy hands.
I wipe my palm on my pants.
So talk to me about your campaign strategy.
Uh, we just started talking about what I should...
Oh, cute.
Indeed.
Here, try this one.
Who is this guy?
Oh, that?
That's Jay.
He's sort of a regular now.
They're... they're just friends.
It's cool, Otis.
I can handle it.
She looks happy.
Who's in charge here?
He is.
Hey, how ya doin', officers?
Come back after shift and try the autumn ale.
We got a complaint from one of your neighbors.
You're kidding me.
Who complained?
You know I can't tell you that.
Look, I'm afraid you're gonna have to shut this booth down.
No, no, no, no...
I cleared this with the city, see?
I got a permit that says we can hold an outdoor event, see?
We're on the up and up.
This isn't about permits.
"Unlimited beer tasting, $10."
It's a violation of happy hour laws.
Can't serve unlimited alcohol for a set price.
Shut it down or get fined.
Right.
Game day.
Sorry, folks.
Gotta shut it down.
You wanna go to Defcon 5, Game Day?
I can go to Defcon 5.
Defcon 5 is actually the lowest level.
Shut up, Otis.
Okay.
What does that mean exactly,
"they put him on their list of suspects"?
Means that they're taking our suspicions seriously.
They'll dig into Hadley's background, maybe bring him in for questioning.
What they ought to do is keep an eye on him 24/7.
They need to catch him in the act.
Arson investigation doesn't have the manpower
- for that kind of surveillance.
- Hell, I got time on my hands.
I'll stake out his place.
Kelly, you start meddling with the investigation, and you could put their case on very shaky procedural grounds.
Please, just let A.I. handle it, okay?
Wow.
Hey.
This is a nice place you found here, Leslie.
Thank you.
And thanks so much for helping out.
I...
I feel bad.
You probably want to get back to Beth and the kids.
No, no, it's okay.
Anyway, Kelly needs me.
Well, come on.
Between these arson fires and Renee pulling the rug out from under you...
You're having trouble at home, aren't you?
Well, Beth and I are taking a little break right now.
- Oh, boy.
- No, no, it's gonna be fine.
I'm driving back to Kenosha every weekend.
It'll work out, okay?
Hey, can you give me a hand with the coffee table?
We were doing pretty good there until officer friendly showed up.
After expenses, we cleared 62 bucks.
And remember, Arthur's gonna show up at the end of the week to collect his share of that.
Great.
Thanks for reminding me.
Arthur's this wannabe mobster who weaseled his way into a silent partnership.
Total leech.
Hey, go home, Herrmann.
You've been on your feet all day.
- I'll finish cleaning up.
- Thanks, Dawson.
Maybe I'll go pour myself a nice, big, tall glass of antifreeze.
Good night.
Do you want a hand with the glasses?
Yeah, we could wash the glasses.
Or we could... let them soak awhile.
You need anything, Gabby?
Sorry, what?
You want some toast or something?
Oh, no.
Sorry, I'm great.
Thanks.
- See, you just got re-tweeted.
- Amazing.
Dawson, I owe you big-time.
Isabella's a real find.
What's going on?
I set Randy up with a social media presence so he can reach out to the online CFD community.
Now he can gather endorsements electronically.
I only need 120 more signatures, and I'm on the ballot.
That's great.
Where's Herrmann?
He should see this.
- Thanks so much for doing this.
- Yeah, it's great practice.
And if I can get Randy elected union president that'll really help me establish myself in Chicago.
Yeah.
Plus it's no chore hanging around a firehouse, if you know what I mean.
I think Pete over there has a thing for me.
Oh, he's your ex?
Gabby, I didn't realize.
Don't worry, he's off-limits.
No, no.
Actually... you know what?
He's fair game.
Yeah?
Can I have your attention, please?
As per discussion I have just had with our consultant friend Ms. McLeod, from here on out, anyone who must leave a shift for personal reasons, you need to submit a request and allow enough time for a relief to be brought in.
Absolutely no exceptions.
By the way...
Otis.
Cinnamon challenge.
Are you out of your mind?
Oh, it's cool, Chief.
We're gonna have a paramedic present.
You are a fire fighter with the city of Chicago, and you are promoting a dangerous stunt that has filled emergency rooms with victims who are stupid enough to try it!
Cinnamon challenge?
What cinnamon challenge?
We're not doing a cinnamon challenge.
I didn't think so.
How is she finding out all this stuff?
I know she doesn't subscribe to your podcast.
Can I have your attention, please?
I got an announcement to make too!
Just a heads up.
Lately we've been finding rat turds all over the house.
Seems that we have an infestation.
Finkus backstabberus... better known as the common snitch.
Not to fear, though.
These disgusting vermin don't typically last long at 51.
Something you wanna say to me, Herrmann?
Just puttin' it out there, Clarke.
A general warning.
Well, maybe I should give you a very specific warning.
Come on.
Come on!
Hey!
Enough.
Enough!
Enough of this.
You gotta be kidding me.
- Old 51.
I miss this place.
- Easy, Mills.
How's everyone been?
What are you doing here?
Just wanna buy a T-shirt.
Got to support the local firehouse, right?
Get out.
Before I carry you out.
Why?
So you can keep spreading lies about me?
What can we help you with, Hadley?
That's a laugh.
If I ever need help with anything, this is the last place I'll come looking for it.
Hey, buddy?
New guy.
Watch your back around here.
Word to the wise.
Engine 51, Truck 81,
Squad 3, Ambulance 61, Battalion 25.
House fire.
South California and Madison.
It's a condemned house.
Structurally unsound.
He's setting another trap for us, Chief.
Yeah, no doubt.
I'm gonna hold off.
Truck 81, Squad 3, stand down.
Engine 51, hit it with your water cannon.
Nobody goes inside.
We gonna let this one burn to the ground if we have to.
- Dawson, Shay!
- Hey, buddy.
Hey, buddy.
Hold still!
Hold still!
Don't move.
My girlfriend's inside.
I can't find her.
Send me and Capp in.
That fire's in the structure.
We'll do one rapid primary search, and we'll get out.
You got one minute.
Capp!
Come on, let's move.
Herrmann!
Mills!
Get 'em a straight ladder.
Got it.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy.
- My girlfriend is...
- Take it easy!
They're looking for her right now, okay?
If she's still up there, they'll find her.
No!
She's not... she's not upstairs!
- What?
- She woke me up.
Said she smelled something funny coming from the basement.
I think she went back down there!
Chief!
We got a problem!
Severide, get out of there.
She is not upstairs.
Get outta there now.
Copy that!
Capp!
Spellman, get a crew in the back door with a 1 3/4-inch hose.
Clear a path for truck to get into the basement.
- On it, chief.
- Mills!
- Yeah.
- With me.
Fire department!
Call out!
Lieutenant!
We got her!
Chief!
We're cut off!
We're gonna need help getting out of the side window in sector four!
51!
Bring a ladder to sector four!
Move!
They don't have long!
All right, ready?
Go!
Got her?
- She's breathing.
- Lift her up.
Mills, you first.
On "three." One, two, three.
We need saline and an IO drill and burn sheets...
lot's of 'em.
Severide.
Take it easy, Severide!
You almost killed that girl, you son of a bitch!
She could spend the next six months in the burn unit
- 'cause of you!
- Now, this is insanity.
Just followed you over here to watch you work.
- We know you started this fire!
- How could I?
I was at 51 when it happened.
You saw me.
Severide!
Severide.
You know what?
Keep your lousy T-shirt.
Let's go!
We got a fire to fight.
We're gonna go inside and sign us in.
Then we'll walk through a metal detector, just like at the airport.
They'll take us to a visiting room, then the guards will bring your mom in to sit and talk.
She'll be wearing kind of a funny jumpsuit and maybe she won't have on any makeup.
But she's still your mom.
- She still loves you.
- Can we just get on with it?
Griffin.
Listen to me, I've been where you are.
I know it's not easy to see your mom this way, but you have no idea what a great thing it is you're doing for her.
You two are all she has right now.
So keep being brave.
For her.
Okay.
All right.
Ready?
Yeah.
Okay, let's do it.
Mama!
Mama!
Mom!
Hey.
I missed you.
So I gotta sit there and listen to this guy Rome from arson and my old man lecture me about how I'm playing right into Hadley's hands.
That I'm giving him the attention he craves.
- What do they expect you to do?
- They want me to ignore him.
So he gets bolder, I guess...
I don't know... and slips up.
- What, or kill someone?
- That's... yes.
That's what I said.
I mean...
Hadley worked under me for two years.
I should have seen this coming.
Whoa.
Look, Kelly.
Don't put yourself through that.
It's not your fault.
I'm just sick and tired of waiting for bells to go off.
We need to stop reacting and start anticipating.
That's what we need to do.
No, what we need to do is let arson handle this.
And you and I need to go somewhere and get drunk.
Come on, I'm buying.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
Come on.
God, you cheap-ass!
Come on.
Come on, Otis, we got drinks to serve.
This'll only take a minute.
And you're gonna love it.
Trust me.
- Otis.
- Yes?
Did you call the fire marshal to report an over-capacity crowd at Game Day?
I don't know what you're talking about, Christopher.
What are you guys doing?
I think Otis just took us to Defcon 1.
Right this way, folks!
We got half-price drinks!
Come on in and party!
Go get 'em!
I'm getting outta here.
- Hey.
- Joe.
You burned me a CD?
Aw.
You are adorable.
What's up, Cruz?
Everything all right?
He wants you to promise you won't go away.
Like mom and dad.
I'm right here, guys.
I'm not going anywhere.
- Where's Zoya?
- No idea.
Okay, so...
Due to liability concerns, we had to IX-nay the cinnamon challenge.
But... but fear not.
For Joe Cruz and I... are going to attempt the saltine cracker challenge:
Where we will attempt to eat six crackers in under a minute with not a drop of water.
No, no, no, no.
It's gonna be awesome.
Trust me.
Okay, here we go.
Oh.
You can take the third bedroom.
- I'm out.
- Reawy?
Yeah!
Yeah-ah!
All I ask is that you don't sit idly by while Greg Sullivan runs unopposed.
Your signature will help put me on the ballot, make sure we have a real choice at the voting booth.
Thank you, Tony.
He's like a new man.
Give me a lump of clay, and I'll mold it into a masterpiece.
We're about to get our last two signatures.
Um, do you want to celebrate later?
Yeah, it sounds like fun.
Uh, do you realize that Gabby and I...
Gabby and I talked.
She's cool with it.
Really?
Interesting.
We did it!
200 signatures.
We made the deadline.
I am on the ballot!
Hey, you and me, buddy!
We're going all the way!
Wow!
Well, well, well.
How about this crowd, huh?
Things are really looking up around here, huh?
So...
Hey, Dawson, get Arthur his dough... so he can be on his way.
Some kinda joke?
That's 1%, per our agreement.
What?
You want an audit?
No, tough guy.
I don't want an audit.
I wanna new deal.
See, my man Jay here... he's been assessing your business.
We'll talk numbers soon, huh?
So... when you said that you were...
You were working construction, you meant you were working for Arthur?
Look...
And you came here to spy on us?
Get outta my bar.
Now.
- Mills!
- Peter!
- Previously on chicago fire...
- Wasn't a kitchen fire, chief.
- When I was looking at the dangerous buildings map,
It hit me that all the arsonist's targets
Were on there.
It's a fire fighter.
- Steady work has been pretty hard to come by.
- Is that why you're setting the fires?
- I guess you better prove it.
- You get 1% all for doing nothing
- There is a scotch tasting happening
Friday night.
Would you want to join me?
- I'd love to.
- Allowing visitors to ride on any of the apparatus
Is a serious violation.
- How does she know that?
- There is a snitch in the house.
- Fire's comin'!
- I pled guilty to d.U.I. Manslaughter.
Can you take care of griffin and ben?
- I think you've outgrown these sneakers.
Griffin, please don't kick your backpack.
You're gonna smash your lunch.
You guys know the drill, right?
My sister christie is gonna pick you up
From school today
And you'll stay at her house tonight
While I'm on shift.
- [stomps]
- Tomorrow's our big day,
So I'm going to pick you up from school early.
Try not to get too dirty at lunch.
- I told you, I'm not going.
- I know, griffin.
But you have to.
Griffin!
I'm picking you up early tomorrow,
And that's the end of it.
Now let's get going.
I'm already late.
- Yes!
Where was it?
- Right where you said.
In the console.
- Thank you so much for driving it over.
Thank you.
- No worries.
Are you rushing to get away from me again?
- Uh...
Look, I was just in a relationship
That--that fell apart.
So...
- So I guess this is good-bye forever?
- [laughs]
- [laughs]
- I owe you one.
- A marker.
I like that.
What's it good for?
- Come to molly's tomorrow night and find out.
- Severide...
Severide, hey.
I was just talking to shay, told me the good news.
- Good news?
- Your new apartment.
- Oh.
Yeah, thanks.
- Yeah, no, problem.
And you guys might be looking for a third roommate to, uh... [clicks tongue] defray the costs.
- She said that?
- Hey!
Yo, otis!
We agreed we were gonna to him together.
- Why do you even need a new place, cruz?
- You spend a night in my neighborhood,
- You try living two doors down from my mother.
- Now, severide,
This is exactly the kind of drama
If you choose a mellow, mature roommate.
- [scoffs] guys, it's just an apartment.
You haven't even seen the place.
- I can come by right after shift.
- Me too.
You guys need to work this out amongst yourselves.
Chief!
Hey!
You got a minute?
- Just the one.
- Hey.
I know who our arsonist is.
- Who?
Hadley?
No way.
I'm not buying it.
But I got a real bad feeling about this.
But...
He'd like to get your blessing first.
- You got any proof?
- No, but I-- - look.
I had my issues with the man,
But he's a fire fighter and a good one.
So you want to accuse him of starting fires,
You'd better have more than a bad feeling.
[alarm walls]
- [over p.A.] squad 3, ambulance 61.
Car in water.
330 west lower wacker.
- Driver lost control and barreled
- Anyone come up?
- Not since I got here.
- How many in the vehicle?
- No idea.
[metal creaking]
[pounding, muffled yelling] [indistinct police radio chatter]
- Give him a tug.
Something's wrong.
Try him again.
- Rope's caught on something.
He's off line.
- Damn it!
- Shay, grab me the monitor.
- What happened down there?
You okay?
- Yeah.
I'm fine.
- Why are you two so eager to move in
With shay and severide, anyway?
- For the residual tail, mouch.
- The--the what now?
- Okay, between severide and shay,
Think how many beautiful women
Are going to be parading through the apartment.
- Imagine it:
Severide is out at the bar,
He's chatting up some babe.
She's got a friend.
- Uh-oh.
- The fun doesn't have to stop there.
All he has to say is,
Where we can hang out with my awesome roommate, joe."
- "brian." - pathetic.
- Okay, mouch, why do you want to be their roommate?
- I've been lonely since mari left.
- Oh, yeah.
That's not pathetic at all.
- Great news, otis.
I just got our beer distributor
To comp us two kegs for the promotion.
- Way to hustle, herrmann.
- Good beer or cheap beer?
- Free beer.
- Meanwhile, I still need 200 signatures
- Relax, all right?
We'll get there.
- Hey, you know, mouch,
You should meet my friend, isabella.
She spent the last two years in d.C.
Working for some congressman.
And she's back home now trying to start up
Her own political consulting firm.
- That's overkill, don't you think?
It's not like he's running for potus.
- Thank you, gabriela.
I would very much like to meet your friend.
- Wait, hold on.
Is she hot?
- She's straight.
- Hey, mills, um, you got a sec?
- Yeah.
What's up, lieutenant?
- My pop's out on the apron.
He wants to come in
But doesn't want to disrespect you.
So, if you want him to stay outside--
- Yeah, tell him he can stay outside.
- He's here to help out with the arson investigation.
- [sighs]
Okay.
Where I come from, you get in a fight,
You shake each other's hands afterwards...
And you put it behind you.
I can do that if you can.
- I like you, kid.
You remind me of--
- This doesn't make us buddies.
Just find the son of a bitch who torched my mom's diner.
Okay?
- Just tell me why you think I should give you my blessing
To investigate kevin hadley.
- There's a well-established psychological profile
For fire fighter arsonists,
And hadley fits it to a tee.
They tend to be white and male.
- Hadley's father abandoned them when he was 13.
They lack stable interpersonal relationships.
He blew everything up around here.
Half the fire fighters I know, including you.
- Chief, it's hadley right down the list.
- So you think he's motivated by anger
Over getting kicked out of 51?
- You told him he wasn't worthy of this house,
So he's trying to prove you wrong...
Show you that he's smarter than you are.
And he isn't going to stop until someone's dead.
- Chief, you should know that I...
I confronted hadley about this.
- Really?
What'd he say?
- He said, "prove it."
- Hey, pete.
- Yeah.
- How's your mom doing?
- Okay.
Trying to decide if she should rebuild
Or just call it quits.
- Tell her we're going to take this arsonist down.
- She knows.
- We'll draw straws for the third bedroom.
- No.
No, there is no way I am leaving this
Up to random chance.
It ought to be about who wants it most.
We should have a contest.
Dude...
The "cinnamon challenge."
- Where you try to eat a spoonful of cinnamon
In under 60 seconds?
- Exactly.
- You mean the internet craze that lands people
In the hospital with a collapsed lung?
- Yeah, that's the one.
- What are we,
A bunch of frat boys all of a sudden?
- It's cool.
Benny's got a solid reason to be here.
- They told you about hadley?
- What about hadley?
- Uh...
Kelly thinks hadley's the one responsible
For the arson fires.
- What?
- Shay, are you serious?
[objects clatter] [clattering] [cell phone vibrates]
- I'll talk to him.
This is matt.
Yeah, why?
Chief, need a big favor.
I got to run out for half an hour.
- After you were late this morning?
- Yeah, I know, chief,
But can herrmann cover
As acting officer while I'm gone?
- You need a lieutenant to cover for you.
I need that paperwork on my desk.
- Chief, it's half an hour.
- There better be a damn good reason.
- There is.
Thanks.
[school bell rings]
Believe me,
Griffin and I are gonna have a long talk
The minute I get off shift.
This won't happen again.
- I have to say, matt, this whole child care situation
Doesn't exactly instill me with confidence.
- We're making the best of it.
- There are other options.
I-I have an obligation to heather and her late husband.
- Matt, your only obligation is to griffin and ben.
They have constant and proper guidance.
And if I feel like you can't provide that
While you're working 24-hour shifts,
Well, then I have to share my concerns with dcfs.
[door opens] - hello?
- Dawson?
- Hi.
- I'm sorry.
You are?
- I'm gabby dawson.
I'm with matt.
[police radio chatter, static]
Ugh.
I'm sorry about that.
I'm sorry.
I'm still on duty.
Ugh.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Um...
This isn't like griffin at all.
Obviously, he's acting out.
In a span of a year, he's lost his father,
And his mother's been taken away.
But he'll get there.
He'll get there.
He just needs to know that we're here
And that we love him
And it's okay to feel whatever he's feeling right now.
- Thank you.
That's, uh...
That's just what I was about to tell matt.
[school bell rings]
- Boden's got a big mouth.
You didn't have to come.
- But you're so glad I did.
- Griffin, what are you doing?
You can't just go around hitting kids.
All right, we'll talk later.
I'm gonna pick you up early tomorrow.
- Griffin, it's not like I'm trying to drag you along
To pick up my dry cleaning.
This is a big deal.
Later.
- Matt, if you're gonna engage
In a battle of wills with an 11-year-old,
You're gonna lose.
- So what?
I'm supposed to back down?
- No.
No, just back off a little.
Let him come to you.
- Oh, good afternoon, chief.
[both chuckle]
- Ms. Mcleod.
Come right in.
- [laughs]
Um, listen.
A kevin hadley was dismissed from your house
Earlier this year.
Is that correct?
- Why is arson discussing ongoing investigations
With an outside consultant?
- The reasons for his transfer are vague.
Why'd you force him out?
- I don't believe that's your business.
- Chief, all due respect,
If one of your former men is now setting fires
It doesn't exactly cast your leadership abilities
- Kevin hadley exhibited unacceptable behavior
Toward another fire fighter.
He couldn't remain in the house.
- Without filing a grievance with human resources?
- I opted not to report his behavior.
My aim was to get the man out of the house,
Not to ruin his career.
- So you let his unacceptable behavior
Go unreported,
And now he's targeting 51 with arson fires.
Okay.
I just needed to get some clarification on that.
You have a good day.
- Yeah.
- How's it going, clarke?
- Cruz.
- So a bunch of us are going to molly's tomorrow.
You should join us.
- Yeah.
- Sure, tip back a few beers, get to know us all a bit better.
- What's a movie from 1985 starring cher?
Four letters.
- I don't know.
Addams family?
Anyhow, maybe we'll see you at molly's.
Your wife too.
Bring her along.
- Hey, capp.
Can I borrow you for a second?
- Brian, just go slow.
If I feel a pinch, I'll speak up.
- You're sure about this.
It's gonna destroy the ring.
Or maybe we can get it off with olive oil.
- My wife moved out, back in August.
So I don't need the ring anymore.
- Sorry to hear that.
- Yeah, what are you gonna do?
[alarm walls]
Keep that under your hat, huh?
- Ambulance 61...
- Yeah, sure.
- 2051 west potomac.
- So...
I just pretended to be casey's girlfriend.
Um, anyway, it's kind of a long story.
But the point is, it wasn't a big deal.
I mean, I wasn't, like, nervous or awkward or anything.
I'm content just being his friend.
You're really into this jay guy, aren't you?
- Yeah, I think I am.
- Okay.
Here we go.
- What are we looking at?
- Over here.
My buddy chris.
He's got a little...
Problem.
- Yep, that's a problem.
.
- [groaning]
- Okay, one nail I get.
But four?
- He disabled the safety on his nail gun
So it'll shoot rapid fire.
- A real time saver.
- They're in pretty tight.
- Hey, dawson, should we call a truck?
- I don't know.
He's already going into shock.
We need to cut this board free.
- Yeah, here.
- Whoa!
Oh!
Aah!
- Deep breaths, deep breaths.
There you go.
- Cut it as short as you can.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh... [saw grating] oh!
It's vibrating!
- Sorry, man!
Are you okay?
- He won't be okay until we get him to a hospital.
Keep cutting.
- I can't.
I can't!
- We're not amputating an arm.
It's a piece of wood!
Give it to me.
Cover his eyes.
[saw grating] [man screaming] [panting]
Aah!
- Can you stand up?
Nice and easy.
Here you go.
Stay close to me.
- Oh, and you guys
Should be wearing eye protection.
- All right, this is an I.P.A.
It's a little hoppier than the last one.
Give it a taste.
It's not bad, right?
We got a whole slew of different...
- I'm telling you, girl, you'd love daft punk.
"get lucky." oh, you're kidding me!
The guys with the crazy helmets!
- [foreign accent] oh!
Is that the horsey-riding song?
The...
[galloping]
- God, no.
No.
You know what, girl?
You're about to have your horizons broadened.
I am gonna make you a mix cd.
Just you wait.
- Hey, cruz.
Mouch is here.
Time for the cinnamon challenge.
- We're not really gonna do this thing, are we?
- Are you kidding me?
I've been promoting it on my podcast.
I mean, people came out here to watch.
- You know what?
I don't need the apartment that bad.
I'm out.
- Look like it is down to you and me, cruz.
May the best man win.
- Dude, this is ground cumin.
[container thuds] - oh, shoot.
Hey, they're right next to each other on the shelf!
- Hey, mouch.
I want you to meet my girl isabella.
- Ah, the kingmaker, huh?
- [laughs]
- I've heard a lot about you.
- And I about you.
Sounds like you could use some campaign help.
Nice.
Firm grip.
Nobody ever won an election with clammy hands.
- The secret is:
I wipe my palm on my pants.
- So talk to me about your campaign strategy.
- Uh, we just started talking about what I should...
- Oh, cute.
- Indeed.
- [laughs] - here, try this one.
- Oh, that?
That's jay.
He's sort of a regular now.
They're--they're just friends.
- It's cool, otis.
I can handle it.
[low conversation]
She looks happy.
[police siren whooping]
- Who's in charge here?
- He is.
- Hey, how ya doin', officers?
Come back after shift and try the autumn ale.
- We got a complaint from one of your neighbors.
- You're kidding me.
Who complained?
Look, I'm afraid you're gonna have to shut this booth down.
I cleared this with the city, see?
I got a permit that says we can hold an outdoor event, see?
[paper rustles] we're on the up and up.
- This isn't about permits.
"unlimited beer tasting, $10."
It's a violation of happy hour laws.
Can't serve unlimited alcohol for a set price.
Shut it down or get fined.
- Right.
Game day.
- Sorry, folks.
Gotta shut it down.
- You wanna go to defcon 5, game day?
I can go to defcon 5.
- Defcon 5 is actually the lowest level.
- Shut up, otis.
- Okay.
"they put him on their list of suspects"?
- Means that they're taking our suspicions seriously.
They'll dig into hadley's background,
- What they ought to do is keep an eye on him 24/7.
They need to catch him in the act.
- Arson investigation doesn't have the manpower
For that kind of surveillance.
- Hell, I got time on my hands.
- Kelly, you start meddling with the investigation,
And you could put their case on very shaky procedural grounds.
Please, just let a.I. Handle it, okay?
Wow.
Hey.
This is a nice place you found here, leslie.
- Thank you.
And thanks so much for helping out.
I-I feel bad.
You probably want to
Get back to beth and the kids.
- No, no, it's okay.
Anyway, kelly needs me.
Well, come on.
Between these arson fires
And renee pulling the rug out from under you...
- You're having trouble at home, aren't you?
- Well, beth and I are taking a little break right now.
- Oh, boy.
- No, no, it's gonna be fine.
I'm driving back to kenosha every weekend.
It'll work out, okay?
- Hey, can you give me a hand with the coffee table?
[shay mutters]
- We were doing pretty good there
Until officer friendly showed up.
After expenses, we cleared 62 bucks.
- And remember, arthur's gonna show up at the end of the week
To collect his share of that.
- Great.
Thanks for reminding me.
- Arthur's this wannabe mobster
Who weaseled his way into a silent partnership.
Total leech.
[drawer bangs]
Hey, go home, herrmann.
You've been on your feet all day.
I'll finish cleaning up.
- Thanks, dawson.
A nice, big, tall glass of antifreeze.
[keys jingle]
- Good night.
[click]
- Do you want a hand with the glasses?
[keys jingle]
- Yeah, we could wash the glasses.
Or we could...
Let them soak awhile.
[keys clatter]
- You need anything, gabby?
- Sorry, what?
- You want some toast or something?
- Oh, no.
Sorry, I'm great.
Thanks.
- See, you just got re-tweeted.
- Amazing.
Dawson, I owe you big-time.
Isabella's a real find.
- What's going on?
- I set randy up with a social media presence
So he can reach out to the online cfd community.
Now he can gather endorsements electronically.
- I only need 120 more signatures,
And I'm on the ballot.
- That's great.
- Where's herrmann?
He should see this.
- [laughs]
Thanks so much for doing this.
- Yeah, it's great practice.
And if I can get randy elected union president
That'll really help me establish myself in chicago.
- Yeah.
- Plus it's no chore hanging around a firehouse,
If you know what I mean.
I think pete over there has a thing for me.
Oh, he's your ex?
Gabby, I didn't realize.
Don't worry, he's off-limits.
- No, no.
Actually...
You know what?
He's fair game.
Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
- Can I have your attention, please?
As per discussion I have just had
With our consultant friend ms.
Mcleod,
Anyone who must leave a shift for personal reasons,
You need to submit a request
And allow enough time for a relief to be brought in.
Absolutely no exceptions.
By the way...
Otis.
Cinnamon challenge.
Are you out of your mind?
- Oh, it's cool, chief.
- You are a fire fighter with the city of chicago,
And you are promoting a dangerous stunt
That has filled emergency rooms
With victims who are stupid enough to try it!
- Cinnamon challenge?
What cinnamon challenge?
We're not doing a cinnamon challenge.
- I didn't think so.
- How is she finding out all this stuff?
I know she doesn't subscribe to your podcast.
- Can I have your attention, please?
- I got an announcement to make too!
Just a heads up.
Lately we've been finding rat turds all over the house.
Seems that we have an infestation.
Finkus backstabberus--
Better known as the common snitch.
These disgusting vermin don't typically last long at 51.
- Something you wanna say to me, herrmann?
- Just puttin' it out there, clarke.
A general warning.
- Well, maybe I should give you a very specific warning.
- Come on.
Come on!
- Hey!
Enough.
Enough!
Enough of this.
- You gotta be kidding me.
.
- Ol' 51.
I miss this place.
- Easy, mills.
- How's everyone been?
- What are you doing here?
- Just wanna buy a t-shirt.
Got to support the local firehouse, right?
- Get out.
Before I carry you out.
- Why?
So you can keep spreading lies about me?
- What can we help you with, hadley?
- That's a laugh.
If I ever need help with anything,
This is the last place I'll come looking for it.
Hey, buddy?
New guy.
Watch your back around here.
Word to the wise.
[alarm walls]
- Engine 51, truck 81,
Squad 3, ambulance 61, battalion 25.
House fire.
South california and madison.
[sirens whooping]
[horn blasting]
- It's a condemned house.
Structurally unsound.
He's setting another trap for us, chief.
- Yeah, no doubt.
I'm gonna hold off.
Truck 81, squad 3, stand down.
Engine 51, hit it with your water cannon.
Nobody goes inside.
We gonna let this one burn to the ground if we have to.
[glass shatters] [man groans]
Dawson, shay!
- Hey, buddy.
Hey, buddy.
Hold still!
Hold still!
Don't move.
- My girlfriend's inside.
I can't find her.
- Send me and capp in.
- That fire's in the structure.
- We'll do one rapid primary search,
And we'll get out.
- You got one minute.
- Capp!
Come on, let's move.
- Herrmann!
Mills!
Get 'em a straight ladder.
- Got it.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy.
- My girlfriend is-- - take it easy!
- They're looking for her right now, okay?
If she's still up there, they'll find her.
- No!
She's not-- she's not upstairs!
- What?
- She woke me up.
Said she smelled something funny coming from the basement.
I think she went back down there!
- Chief!
We got a problem!
- Severide, get out of there.
She is not upstairs.
Get outta there now.
- Copy that!
Capp!
- Spellman, get a crew in the back door
With a 1 3/4-inch hose.
Clear a path for truck to get into the basement.
- On it, chief.
- Mills!
- Yeah.
- With me.
- Fire department!
Call out!
[instrument blipping]
Lieutenant!
- We got her!
[creaking]
Chief!
We're cut off!
We're gonna need help
Getting out of the side window in sector four!
- 51!
Bring a ladder to sector four!
[glass shattering]
- Move!
They don't have long!
- All right, ready?
Go!
- Got her?
- She's breathing.
- Lift her up.
- Mills, you first.
[low chatter]
- On "three." one, two, three.
We need saline and an io drill
And burn sheets-- lot's of 'em.
- Severide.
- Take it easy, severide!
- You almost killed that girl, you son of a bitch!
She could spend the next six months in the burn unit 'cause of you!
- Now, this is insanity.
Just followed you over here to watch you work.
- We know you started this fire!
- How could I?
I was at 51 when it happened.
You saw me.
- Severide!
Severide.
- You know what?
Keep your lousy t-shirt.
- Let's go!
We got a fire to fight.
.
Gonna go inside and sign us in.
Then we'll walk through a metal detector,
Just like at the airport.
They'll take us to a visiting room,
Then the guards will bring your mom in
To sit and talk.
She'll be wearing kind of a funny jumpsuit
And maybe she won't have on any makeup.
But she's still your mom.
She still loves you.
- Can we just get on with it?
- Griffin.
Listen to me, I've been where you are.
I know it's not easy to see your mom this way,
What a great thing it is you're doing for her.
You two are all she has right now.
So keep being brave.
For her.
- Okay.
- All right.
Ready?
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's do it.
[baby crying] [beep] [buzzer]
[machinery beeping, buzzing, low chatter] [buzzer]
- Mama!
Mama!
- Mom!
- Hey.
I missed you.
- So I gotta sit there
And listen to this guy rome from arson
About how I'm playing right into hadley's hands.
That I'm giving him the attention he craves.
- What do they expect you to do?
- They want me to ignore him.
So he gets bolder, I guess-- I don't know--and slips up.
- What, or kill someone?
- That's--yes.
That's what I said.
I mean...
Hadley worked under me for two years.
I should have seen this coming.
- Whoa.
Look, kelly.
Don't put yourself through that.
It's not your fault.
- I'm just sick and tired of waiting
We need to stop reacting and start anticipating.
That's what we need to do.
- No, what we need to do is let arson handle this.
And you and I need to go somewhere and get drunk.
Come on, I'm buying.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
Come on.
[both laugh]
God, you cheap-ass!
- Come on.
- Come on, otis, we got drinks to serve.
- This'll only take a minute.
And you're gonna love it.
Trust me.
[clicks tongue] [police radio chatter]
- Otis.
- Yes?
- Did you call the fire marshal
To report an over-capacity crowd at game day?
- I don't know what you're talking about, christopher.
- What are you guys doing?
- I think otis just took us to defcon 1.
- Right this way, folks!
We got half-price drinks!
Come on in and party!
[both laugh]
- Go get 'em!
I'm getting outta here.
- [chucking]
Hey.
- Joe.
You burned me a cd?
Aw.
You are adorable.
[kisses] [chuckles]
- What's up, cruz?
[engine revving]
[distant voices]
- Everything all right?
- He wants you to promise you won't go away.
Like mom and dad.
- I'm right here, guys.
I'm not going anywhere.
[loud overlapping chatter]
- Where's zoya?
- No idea.
- Okay, so...
Due to liability concerns,
We had to ix-nay the cinnamon challenge.
But--but fear not.
For joe cruz and I...
Are going to attempt the saltine cracker challenge:
Where we will attempt to eat six crackers
In under a minute with not a drop of water.
- [random groans] - no, no, no, no.
It's gonna be awesome.
Trust me.
Okay, here we go.
[timer beeps]
[muffled]
- You can take the third bedroom.
I'm out.
- Reawy?
[coughs]
Yeah!
Yeah-ah!
[unimpressed comments] whoo-hoo-hoo!
Ha ha ha!
- All I ask
Is that you don't sit idly by
While greg sullivan runs unopposed.
Your signature will help put me on the ballot,
Make sure we have a real choice at the voting booth.
Thank you, tony.
- [laughs]
He's like a new man.
- Give me a lump of clay,
And I'll mold it into a masterpiece.
- Oof!
[both chuckle]
- We're about to get our last two signatures.
Um, do you want to celebrate later?
- Yeah, it sounds like fun.
Uh, do you realize that gabby and I--
- Gabby and I talked.
She's cool with it.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Interesting.
- We did it!
200 signatures.
We made the deadline.
I am on the ballot!
[cheers and applause]
- Hey, you and me, buddy!
We're going all the way!
Wow!
- Well, well, well.
How about this crowd, huh?
Things are really looking up around here, huh?
So...
- Hey, dawson, get arthur his dough...
So he can be on his way.
- Some kinda joke?
- That's 1%, per our agreement.
What?
You want an audit?
- No, tough guy.
I don't want an audit.
I wanna new deal.
See, my man jay here...
He's been assessing your business.
We'll talk numbers soon, huh?
- So...
When you said that you were--
You were working construction,
You meant you were working for arthur?
- Look...
- And you came here to spy on us?
Get outta my bar.
Now.
- Mills!
- Previously on Chicago fire...
Wasn't a kitchen fire, chief.
When I was looking at the dangerous buildings map, it hit me that all the arsonist's targets were on there.
It's a fire fighter.
Steady work has been pretty hard to come by.
Is that why you're setting the fires?
I guess you better prove it.
You get 1% all for doing nothing but walking away from our bar.
There is a scotch tasting happening
Friday night.
Would you want to join me?
I'd love to.
Allowing visitors to ride on any of the apparatus is a serious violation.
How does she know that?
There is a snitch in the house.
Fire's comin'!
I pled guilty to D.U.I. manslaughter.
Can you take care of Griffin and Ben?
I think you've outgrown these sneakers.
Griffin, please don't kick your backpack.
You're gonna smash your lunch.
You guys know the drill, right?
My sister Christie is gonna pick you up from school today and you'll stay at her house tonight
- while I'm on shift.
- [Stomps]
Tomorrow's our big day, so I'm going to pick you up from school early.
Try not to get too dirty at lunch.
I told you, I'm not going.
I know, Griffin.
But you have to.
Griffin!
I'm picking you up early tomorrow, and that's the end of it.
Now let's get going.
I'm already late.
Yes!
Where was it?
Right where you said.
In the console.
Thank you so much for driving it over.
- Thank you.
- No worries.
Are you rushing to get away from me again?
Uh...
Look, I was just in a relationship that... that fell apart.
So...
So I guess this is good-bye forever?
[Laughs]
[Laughs]
I owe you one.
A marker.
I like that.
What's it good for?
Come to Molly's tomorrow night and find out.
Severide...
Severide, hey.
- Hey, what's up, Otis?
- Nothing.
I was just talking to Shay, told me the good news.
- Good news?
- Your new apartment.
Sounds tight.
- Oh.
Yeah, thanks.
- Yeah, no, problem.
She did say it was a three-bedroom, and you guys might be looking for a third roommate to, uh...
[Clicks tongue] defray the costs.
- She said that?
- Hey!
Yo, Otis!
We agreed we were gonna to him together.
Why do you even need a new place, Cruz?
Your apartment isn't bad.
You spend a night in my neighborhood, lulled to sleep by gunfire!
You try living two doors down from my mother.
Now, Severide, this is exactly the kind of drama you won't have to deal with if you choose a mellow, mature roommate.
[Scoffs] Guys, it's just an apartment.
You haven't even seen the place.
I can come by right after shift.
Me too.
Listen, this isn't cheerleader tryouts.
You guys need to work this out amongst yourselves.
Chief!
Hey!
- You got a minute?
- Just the one.
Hey.
I know who our arsonist is.
Who?
Hadley?
No way.
I'm not buying it.
Look, I don't want to believe it myself, but I got a real bad feeling about this.
[Sighs]
My old man, he wants to take it arson, but... he'd like to get your blessing first.
You got any proof?
- No, but I...
- Look.
I had my issues with the man, but he's a fire fighter and a good one.
So you want to accuse him of starting fires, you'd better have more than a bad feeling.
[Alarm walls]
[Over P.A.] Squad 3, Ambulance 61.
Car in water.
330 West Lower Wacker.
Driver lost control and barreled right through the guard rail.
- Anyone come up?
- Not since I got here.
- How many in the vehicle?
- No idea.
[Metal creaking]
[Pounding, muffled yelling]
[Indistinct police radio chatter]
Give him a tug.
Something's wrong.
Try him again.
Rope's caught on something.
He's off line.
Damn it!
Shay, grab me the monitor.
What happened down there?
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Why are you two so eager to move in with Shay and Severide, anyway?
For the residual tail, Mouch.
The... the what now?
Okay, between Severide and Shay, think how many beautiful women are going to be parading through the apartment.
Imagine it:
Severide is out at the bar, he's chatting up some babe.
- She's got a friend.
- Uh-oh.
The fun doesn't have to stop there.
All he has to say is,
"hey, let's take this back to my place where we can hang out with my awesome roommate, Joe."
- "Brian."
- Pathetic.
Okay, Mouch, why do you want to be their roommate?
I've been lonely since Mari left.
Oh, yeah.
That's not pathetic at all.
Great news, Otis.
I just got our beer distributor to comp us two kegs for the promotion.
Way to hustle, Herrmann.
Good beer or cheap beer?
Free beer.
Meanwhile, I still need 200 signatures to secure my nomination.
Relax, all right?
We'll get there.
Hey, you know, Mouch, you should meet my friend, Isabella.
She spent the last two years in D.C.
Working for some congressman.
And she's back home now trying to start up her own political consulting firm.
That's overkill, don't you think?
It's not like he's running for potus.
Thank you, Gabriela.
I would very much like to meet your friend.
Wait, hold on.
Is she hot?
She's straight.
Hey, Mills, um, you got a sec?
Yeah.
What's up, Lieutenant?
My pop's out on the apron.
He wants to come in but doesn't want to disrespect you.
So, if you want him to stay outside...
Yeah, tell him he can stay outside.
He's here to help out with the arson investigation.
[Sighs]
Okay.
Where I come from, you get in a fight, you shake each other's hands afterwards... and you put it behind you.
I can do that if you can.
I like you, kid.
You remind me of...
This doesn't make us buddies.
Just find the son of a bitch who torched my mom's diner.
Okay?
Just tell me why you think I should give you my blessing to investigate Kevin Hadley.
There's a well-established psychological profile for fire fighter arsonists, and Hadley fits it to a tee.
They tend to be white and male.
They come from broken homes.
Hadley's father abandoned them when he was 13.
They're usually unmarried.
They lack stable interpersonal relationships.
I mean, Chief, you saw the way he blew everything up around here.
Benny, you're talking about half the fire fighters I know, including you.
Chief, it's Hadley right down the list.
So you think he's motivated by anger over getting kicked out of 51?
You told him he wasn't worthy of this house, so he's trying to prove you wrong...
Show you that he's smarter than you are.
And he isn't going to stop until someone's dead.
Chief, you should know that I...
I confronted Hadley about this.
Really?
What'd he say?
He said, "prove it."
- Hey, Pete.
- Yeah.
- How's your mom doing?
- Okay.
Trying to decide if she should rebuild or just call it quits.
Tell her we're going to take this arsonist down.
She knows.
Wedraw straws for the third bedroom.
No.
No, there is no way I am leaving this up to random chance.
It ought to be about who wants it most.
We should have a contest.
Dude...
The "Cinnamon challenge."
Where you try to eat a spoonful of cinnamon
- in under 60 seconds?
- Exactly.
You mean the Internet craze that lands people in the hospital with a collapsed lung?
- Yeah, that's the one.
- What are we, a bunch of frat boys all of a sudden?
It's cool.
Benny's got a solid reason to be here.
They told you about Hadley?
What about Hadley?
Uh...
Kelly thinks Hadley's the one responsible for the arson fires.
What?
Shay, are you serious?
[Objects clatter]
[Clattering]
[Cell phone vibrates] I'll talk to him.
This is Matt.
Yeah, why?
Chief, need a big favor.
I got to run out for half an hour.
After you were late this morning?
Yeah, I know, Chief, but can Herrmann cover as acting officer while I'm gone?
You need a Lieutenant to cover for you.
I need that paperwork on my desk.
Chief, it's half an hour.
There better be a damn good reason.
There is.
Thanks.
[School bell rings]
Believe me,
Griffin and I are gonna have a long talk the minute I get off shift.
This won't happen again.
I have to say, Matt, this whole child care situation doesn't exactly instill me with confidence.
We're making the best of it.
There are other options.
Not for me.
I...
I have an obligation to Heather and her late husband.
Matt, your only obligation is to Griffin and Ben.
You need to make sure they have constant and proper guidance.
And if I feel like you can't provide that while you're working 24-hour shifts, well, then I have to share my concerns with DCFS.
[Door opens] Hello?
Dawson?
- Hi.
- I'm sorry.
You are?
I'm Gabby Dawson.
I'm with Matt.
[Police radio chatter, static]
Ugh.
I'm sorry about that.
I'm sorry.
I'm still on duty.
Ugh.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Um...
This isn't like Griffin at all.
Obviously, he's acting out.
In a span of a year, he's lost his father, and his mother's been taken away.
But he'll get there.
He'll get there.
He just needs to know that we're here and that we love him and it's okay to feel whatever he's feeling right now.
Thank you.
That's, uh... that's just what I was about to tell Matt.
[School bell rings]
Boden's got a big mouth.
You didn't have to come.
But you're so glad I did.
Griffin, what are you doing?
You can't just go around hitting kids.
All right, we'll talk later.
I'm gonna pick you up early tomorrow.
You can't.
I have detention.
Griffin, it's not like I'm trying to drag you along to pick up my dry cleaning.
This is a big deal.
Later.
Matt, if you're gonna engage in a battle of wills with an 11-year-old, you're gonna lose.
So what?
I'm supposed to back down?
No.
No, just back off a little.
Let him come to you.
Oh, good afternoon, Chief.
[Both chuckle]
Ms. McLeod.
Come right in.
[Laughs]
Um, listen.
A Kevin Hadley was dismissed from your house earlier this year.
Is that correct?
Why is arson discussing ongoing investigations with an outside consultant?
The reasons for his transfer are vague.
Why'd you force him out?
I don't believe that's your business.
Chief, all due respect, if one of your former men is now setting fires all over this city, it doesn't exactly cast your leadership abilities in the most flattering light.
Kevin Hadley exhibited unacceptable behavior toward another fire fighter.
He couldn't remain in the house.
I showed him the door.
Without filing a grievance with human resources?
I opted not to report his behavior.
My aim was to get the man out of the house, not to ruin his career.
So you let his unacceptable behavior go unreported, and now he's targeting 51 with arson fires.
Okay.
Well, thank you, Chief.
I just needed to get some clarification on that.
You have a good day.
Yeah.
How's it going, Clarke?
Cruz.
So a bunch of us are going to Molly's tomorrow.
- You should join us.
- Yeah.
Sure, tip back a few beers, get to know us all a bit better.
What's a movie from 1985 starring Cher?
Four letters.
I don't know.
Addams Family?
Anyhow, maybe we'll see you at Molly's.
Your wife too.
Bring her along.
Hey, Capp.
Can I borrow you for a second?
Brian, just go slow.
If I feel a pinch, I'll speak up.
You're sure about this.
It's gonna destroy the ring.
Or maybe we can get it off with olive oil.
My wife moved out, back in August.
So I don't need the ring anymore.
Sorry to hear that.
Yeah, what are you gonna do?
[Alarm walls]
Keep that under your hat, huh?
- Ambulance 61...
- Yeah, sure.
2051 West Potomac.
So...
I just pretended to be Casey's girlfriend.
Um, anyway, it's kind of a long story.
But the point is, it wasn't a big deal.
I mean, I wasn't, like, nervous or awkward or anything.
I'm content just being his friend.
Wow.
You're really into this Jay guy, aren't you?
Yeah, I think I am.
Okay.
Here we go.
What are we looking at?
Over here.
My buddy Chris.
He's got a little... problem.
Yep, that's a problem.
Okay, one nail I get.
But four?
He disabled the safety on his nail gun so it'll shoot rapid fire.
- A real time saver.
- They're in pretty tight.
Hey, Dawson, should we call a truck?
I don't know.
He's already going into shock.
Do you have a saw?
- We need to cut this board free.
- Yeah, here.
Whoa!
Oh!
Aah!
Deep breaths, deep breaths.
There you go.
Cut it as short as you can.
Ooh, ooh, ooh...
[Saw grating] Oh!
It's vibrating!
Sorry, man!
Are you okay?
He won't be okay until we get him to a hospital.
- Keep cutting.
- I can't.
I can't!
We're not amputating an arm.
It's a piece of wood!
Give it to me.
Cover his eyes.
[Saw grating]
[Man screaming]
[Panting]
Aah!
Can you stand up?
Nice and easy.
Here you go.
Stay close to me.
Oh, and you guys should be wearing eye protection.
All right, this is an I.P.A.
It's a little hoppier than the last one.
Give it a taste.
It's not bad, right?
We got a whole slew of different...
I'm telling you, girl, you'd love Daft Punk.
"Get lucky." Oh, you're kidding me!
The guys with the crazy helmets!
[Foreign accent] Oh!
Is that the horsey-riding song?
The... [galloping]
- [Giggles]
- No?
God, no.
No.
You know what, girl?
You're about to have your horizons broadened.
I am gonna make you a mix CD.
Just you wait.
Hey, Cruz.
Mouch is here.
Time for the cinnamon challenge.
We're not really gonna do this thing, are we?
Are you kidding me?
I've been promoting it on my podcast.
I mean, people came out here to watch.
You know what?
I don't need the apartment that bad.
I'm out.
Look like it is down to you and me, Cruz.
May the best man win.
Dude, this is ground cumin.
[Container thuds] Oh, shoot.
Hey, they're right next to each other on the shelf!
Hey, Mouch.
I want you to meet my girl Isabella.
- Ah, the kingmaker, huh?
- [Laughs]
I've heard a lot about you.
And I about you.
Sounds like you could use some campaign help.
Nice.
Firm grip.
Nobody ever won an election with clammy hands.
The secret is:
I wipe my palm on my pants.
So talk to me about your campaign strategy.
Uh, we just started talking about what I should...
Oh, cute.
Indeed.
- [Laughs]
- Here, try this one.
Who is this guy?
Oh, that?
That's Jay.
He's sort of a regular now.
They're... they're just friends.
It's cool, Otis.
I can handle it.
[Low conversation]
She looks happy.
[Police siren whooping]
Who's in charge here?
He is.
Hey, how ya doin', officers?
Come back after shift and try the autumn ale.
We got a complaint from one of your neighbors.
You're kidding me.
Who complained?
You know I can't tell you that.
Look, I'm afraid you're gonna have to shut this booth down.
No, no, no, no...
I cleared this with the city, see?
I got a permit that says we can hold an outdoor event, see?
[Paper rustles] We're on the up and up.
This isn't about permits.
"Unlimited beer tasting, $10."
It's a violation of happy hour laws.
Can't serve unlimited alcohol for a set price.
Shut it down or get fined.
Right.
Game day.
Sorry, folks.
Gotta shut it down.
You wanna go to Defcon 5, Game Day?
I can go to Defcon 5.
Defcon 5 is actually the lowest level.
Shut up, Otis.
Okay.
What does that mean exactly,
"they put him on their list of suspects"?
Means that they're taking our suspicions seriously.
They'll dig into Hadley's background, maybe bring him in for questioning.
What they ought to do is keep an eye on him 24/7.
They need to catch him in the act.
Arson investigation doesn't have the manpower
- for that kind of surveillance.
- Hell, I got time on my hands.
I'll stake out his place.
Kelly, you start meddling with the investigation, and you could put their case on very shaky procedural grounds.
Please, just let A.I. handle it, okay?
Wow.
Hey.
This is a nice place you found here, Leslie.
Thank you.
And thanks so much for helping out.
I...
I feel bad.
You probably want to get back to Beth and the kids.
No, no, it's okay.
Anyway, Kelly needs me.
Well, come on.
Between these arson fires and Renee pulling the rug out from under you...
You're having trouble at home, aren't you?
Well, Beth and I are taking a little break right now.
- Oh, boy.
- No, no, it's gonna be fine.
I'm driving back to Kenosha every weekend.
It'll work out, okay?
Hey, can you give me a hand with the coffee table?
[Shay mutters]
We were doing pretty good there until officer friendly showed up.
After expenses, we cleared 62 bucks.
And remember, Arthur's gonna show up at the end of the week to collect his share of that.
Great.
Thanks for reminding me.
Arthur's this wannabe mobster who weaseled his way into a silent partnership.
Total leech.
[Drawer bangs]
Hey, go home, Herrmann.
You've been on your feet all day.
- I'll finish cleaning up.
- Thanks, Dawson.
Maybe I'll go pour myself a nice, big, tall glass of antifreeze.
[Keys jingle]
Good night.
[Click]
Do you want a hand with the glasses?
[Keys jingle]
Yeah, we could wash the glasses.
Or we could... let them soak awhile.
[Keys clatter]
You need anything, Gabby?
Sorry, what?
You want some toast or something?
Oh, no.
Sorry, I'm great.
Thanks.
- See, you just got re-tweeted.
- Amazing.
Dawson, I owe you big-time.
Isabella's a real find.
What's going on?
I set Randy up with a social media presence so he can reach out to the online CFD community.
Now he can gather endorsements electronically.
I only need 120 more signatures, and I'm on the ballot.
That's great.
Where's Herrmann?
He should see this. [Laughs]
- Thanks so much for doing this.
- Yeah, it's great practice.
And if I can get Randy elected union president that'll really help me establish myself in Chicago.
Yeah.
Plus it's no chore hanging around a firehouse, if you know what I mean.
I think Pete over there has a thing for me.
Oh, he's your ex?
Gabby, I didn't realize.
Don't worry, he's off-limits.
No, no.
Actually... you know what?
He's fair game.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
Can I have your attention, please?
As per discussion I have just had with our consultant friend Ms. McLeod, from here on out, anyone who must leave a shift for personal reasons, you need to submit a request and allow enough time for a relief to be brought in.
Absolutely no exceptions.
By the way...
Otis.
Cinnamon challenge.
Are you out of your mind?
Oh, it's cool, Chief.
We're gonna have a paramedic present.
You are a fire fighter with the city of Chicago, and you are promoting a dangerous stunt that has filled emergency rooms with victims who are stupid enough to try it!
Cinnamon challenge?
What cinnamon challenge?
We're not doing a cinnamon challenge.
I didn't think so.
How is she finding out all this stuff?
I know she doesn't subscribe to your podcast.
Can I have your attention, please?
I got an announcement to make too!
Just a heads up.
Lately we've been finding rat turds all over the house.
Seems that we have an infestation.
Finkus backstabberus... better known as the common snitch.
Not to fear, though.
These disgusting vermin don't typically last long at 51.
Something you wanna say to me, Herrmann?
Just puttin' it out there, Clarke.
A general warning.
Well, maybe I should give you a very specific warning.
Come on.
Come on!
Hey!
Enough.
Enough!
Enough of this.
You gotta be kidding me.
- Old 51.
I miss this place.
- Easy, Mills.
How's everyone been?
What are you doing here?
Just wanna buy a T-shirt.
Got to support the local firehouse, right?
Get out.
Before I carry you out.
Why?
So you can keep spreading lies about me?
What can we help you with, Hadley?
That's a laugh.
If I ever need help with anything, this is the last place I'll come looking for it.
Hey, buddy?
New guy.
Watch your back around here.
Word to the wise.
[Alarm walls]
Engine 51, Truck 81,
Squad 3, Ambulance 61, Battalion 25.
House fire.
South California and Madison.
[Sirens whooping]
[Horn blasting]
It's a condemned house.
Structurally unsound.
He's setting another trap for us, Chief.
Yeah, no doubt.
I'm gonna hold off.
Truck 81, Squad 3, stand down.
Engine 51, hit it with your water cannon.
Nobody goes inside.
We gonna let this one burn to the ground if we have to.
[Glass shatters]
[Man groans]
- Dawson, Shay!
- Hey, buddy.
Hey, buddy.
Hold still!
Hold still!
Don't move.
My girlfriend's inside.
I can't find her.
Send me and Capp in.
That fire's in the structure.
We'll do one rapid primary search, and we'll get out.
You got one minute.
Capp!
Come on, let's move.
Herrmann!
Mills!
Get 'em a straight ladder.
Got it.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy.
- My girlfriend is...
- Take it easy!
They're looking for her right now, okay?
If she's still up there, they'll find her.
No!
She's not... she's not upstairs!
- What?
- She woke me up.
Said she smelled something funny coming from the basement.
I think she went back down there!
Chief!
We got a problem!
Severide, get out of there.
She is not upstairs.
Get outta there now.
Copy that!
Capp!
Spellman, get a crew in the back door with a 1 3/4-inch hose.
Clear a path for truck to get into the basement.
- On it, chief.
- Mills!
- Yeah.
- With me.
Fire department!
Call out!
[Instrument blipping]
Lieutenant!
We got her!
[Creaking]
Chief!
We're cut off!
We're gonna need help getting out of the side window in sector four!
51!
Bring a ladder to sector four!
[Glass shattering]
Move!
They don't have long!
All right, ready?
Go!
Got her?
- She's breathing.
- Lift her up.
Mills, you first.
[Low chatter]
On "three." One, two, three.
We need saline and an IO drill and burn sheets...
lot's of 'em.
Severide.
Take it easy, Severide!
You almost killed that girl, you son of a bitch!
She could spend the next six months in the burn unit
- 'cause of you!
- Now, this is insanity.
Just followed you over here to watch you work.
- We know you started this fire!
- How could I?
I was at 51 when it happened.
You saw me.
Severide!
Severide.
You know what?
Keep your lousy T-shirt.
Let's go!
We got a fire to fight.
We're gonna go inside and sign us in.
Then we'll walk through a metal detector, just like at the airport.
They'll take us to a visiting room, then the guards will bring your mom in to sit and talk.
She'll be wearing kind of a funny jumpsuit and maybe she won't have on any makeup.
But she's still your mom.
- She still loves you.
- Can we just get on with it?
Griffin.
Listen to me, I've been where you are.
I know it's not easy to see your mom this way, but you have no idea what a great thing it is you're doing for her.
You two are all she has right now.
So keep being brave.
For her.
Okay.
All right.
Ready?
Yeah.
Okay, let's do it.
[Baby crying]
[Beep]
[Buzzer]
[Machinery beeping, buzzing, low chatter]
[Buzzer]
Mama!
Mama!
Mom!
Hey.
I missed you.
So I gotta sit there and listen to this guy Rome from arson and my old man lecture me about how I'm playing right into Hadley's hands.
That I'm giving him the attention he craves.
- What do they expect you to do?
- They want me to ignore him.
So he gets bolder, I guess...
I don't know... and slips up.
- What, or kill someone?
- That's... yes.
That's what I said.
I mean...
Hadley worked under me for two years.
I should have seen this coming.
Whoa.
Look, Kelly.
Don't put yourself through that.
It's not your fault.
I'm just sick and tired of waiting for bells to go off.
We need to stop reacting and start anticipating.
That's what we need to do.
No, what we need to do is let arson handle this.
And you and I need to go somewhere and get drunk.
Come on, I'm buying.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
Come on.
[Both laugh]
God, you cheap-ass!
Come on.
Come on, Otis, we got drinks to serve.
This'll only take a minute.
And you're gonna love it.
Trust me.
[Clicks tongue]
[Police radio chatter]
- Otis.
- Yes?
Did you call the fire marshal to report an over-capacity crowd at Game Day?
I don't know what you're talking about, Christopher.
What are you guys doing?
I think Otis just took us to Defcon 1.
Right this way, folks!
We got half-price drinks!
- Come on in and party!
- [Both laugh]
Go get 'em!
I'm getting outta here. [Chucking]
- Hey.
- Joe.
You burned me a CD?
Aw.
You are adorable.
[Kisses]
[Chuckles]
What's up, Cruz?
[Engine revving]
[Distant voices]
Everything all right?
He wants you to promise you won't go away.
Like mom and dad.
I'm right here, guys.
I'm not going anywhere.
[Loud overlapping chatter]
- Where's Zoya?
- No idea.
Okay, so...
Due to liability concerns, we had to IX-nay the cinnamon challenge.
But... but fear not.
for Joe Cruz and I... are going to attempt the saltine cracker challenge:
Where we will attempt to eat six crackers in under a minute with not a drop of water.
- [Random groans]
- No, no, no, no.
It's gonna be awesome.
Trust me.
Okay, here we go.
[Timer beeps]
[Muffled]
Oh.
You can take the third bedroom.
- I'm out.
- Reawy?
[Coughs]
Yeah!
Yeah-ah!
[Unimpressed comments] Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Ha ha ha!
- All I ask is that you don't sit idly by while Greg Sullivan runs unopposed.
Your signature will help put me on the ballot, make sure we have a real choice at the voting booth.
Thank you, Tony.
[Laughs]
He's like a new man.
Give me a lump of clay, and I'll mold it into a masterpiece.
Oof!
[Both chuckle]
We're about to get our last two signatures.
Um, do you want to celebrate later?
Yeah, it sounds like fun.
Uh, do you realize that Gabby and I...
Gabby and I talked.
She's cool with it.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Interesting.
We did it!
200 signatures.
We made the deadline.
I am on the ballot!
[Cheers and applause]
Hey, you and me, buddy!
We're going all the way!
Wow!
Well, well, well.
How about this crowd, huh?
Things are really looking up around here, huh?
So...
Hey, Dawson, get Arthur his dough... so he can be on his way.
Some kinda joke?
That's 1%, per our agreement.
What?
You want an audit?
No, tough guy.
I don't want an audit.
I wanna new deal.
See, my man Jay here... he's been assessing your business.
We'll talk numbers soon, huh?
So... when you said that you were...
You were working construction, you meant you were working for Arthur?
Look...
And you came here to spy on us?
Get outta my bar.
Now.
- Mills!
- Previously on Chicago fire...
Wasn't a kitchen fire, chief.
When I was looking at the dangerous buildings map, it hit me that all the arsonist's targets were on there.
It's a fire fighter.
Steady work has been pretty hard to come by.
Is that why you're setting the fires?
I guess you better prove it.
You get 1% all for doing nothing but walking away from our bar.
There is a scotch tasting happening
Friday night.
Would you want to join me?
I'd love to.
Allowing visitors to ride on any of the apparatus is a serious violation.
How does she know that?
There is a snitch in the house.
Fire's comin'!
I pled guilty to D.U.I. manslaughter.
Can you take care of Griffin and Ben?
I think you've outgrown these sneakers.
Griffin, please don't kick your backpack.
You're gonna smash your lunch.
You guys know the drill, right?
My sister Christie is gonna pick you up from school today and you'll stay at her house tonight while I'm on shift.
Tomorrow's our big day, so I'm going to pick you up from school early.
Try not to get too dirty at lunch.
I told you, I'm not going.
I know, Griffin.
But you have to.
Griffin!
I'm picking you up early tomorrow, and that's the end of it.
Now let's get going.
I'm already late.
Yes!
Where was it?
Right where you said.
In the console.
Thank you so much for driving it over.
- Thank you.
- No worries.
Are you rushing to get away from me again?
Uh...
Look, I was just in a relationship that... that fell apart.
So...
So I guess this is good-bye forever?
I owe you one.
A marker.
I like that.
What's it good for?
Come to Molly's tomorrow night and find out.
Severide...
Severide, hey.
- Hey, what's up, Otis?
- Nothing.
I was just talking to Shay, told me the good news.
- Good news?
- Your new apartment.
Sounds tight.
- Oh.
Yeah, thanks.
- Yeah, no, problem.
She did say it was a three-bedroom, and you guys might be looking for a third roommate to, uh... defray the costs.
- She said that?
- Hey!
Yo, Otis!
We agreed we were gonna to him together.
Why do you even need a new place, Cruz?
Your apartment isn't bad.
You spend a night in my neighborhood, lulled to sleep by gunfire!
You try living two doors down from my mother.
Now, Severide, this is exactly the kind of drama you won't have to deal with if you choose a mellow, mature roommate.
Guys, it's just an apartment.
You haven't even seen the place.
I can come by right after shift.
Me too.
Listen, this isn't cheerleader tryouts.
You guys need to work this out amongst yourselves.
Chief!
Hey!
- You got a minute?
- Just the one.
Hey.
I know who our arsonist is.
Who?
Hadley?
No way.
I'm not buying it.
Look, I don't want to believe it myself, but I got a real bad feeling about this.
My old man, he wants to take it arson, but... he'd like to get your blessing first.
You got any proof?
- No, but I...
- Look.
I had my issues with the man, but he's a fire fighter and a good one.
So you want to accuse him of starting fires, you'd better have more than a bad feeling.
Squad 3, Ambulance 61.
Car in water.
330 West Lower Wacker.
Driver lost control and barreled right through the guard rail.
- Anyone come up?
- Not since I got here.
- How many in the vehicle?
- No idea.
Give him a tug.
Something's wrong.
Try him again.
Rope's caught on something.
He's off line.
Damn it!
Shay, grab me the monitor.
What happened down there?
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Why are you two so eager to move in with Shay and Severide, anyway?
For the residual tail, Mouch.
The... the what now?
Okay, between Severide and Shay, think how many beautiful women are going to be parading through the apartment.
Severide is out at the bar, he's chatting up some babe.
She's got a friend.
The fun doesn't have to stop there.
All he has to say is,
"hey, let's take this back to my place where we can hang out with my awesome roommate, Joe."
- "Brian."
- Pathetic.
Okay, Mouch, why do you want to be their roommate?
I've been lonely since Mari left.
Oh, yeah.
That's not pathetic at all.
Great news, Otis.
I just got our beer distributor to comp us two kegs for the promotion.
Way to hustle, Herrmann.
Good beer or cheap beer?
Free beer.
Meanwhile, I still need 200 signatures to secure my nomination.
Relax, all right?
We'll get there.
Hey, you know, Mouch, you should meet my friend, Isabella.
She spent the last two years in D.C.
Working for some congressman.
And she's back home now trying to start up her own political consulting firm.
That's overkill, don't you think?
It's not like he's running for potus.
Thank you, Gabriela.
I would very much like to meet your friend.
Wait, hold on.
Is she hot?
She's straight.
Hey, Mills, um, you got a sec?
Yeah.
What's up, Lieutenant?
My pop's out on the apron.
He wants to come in but doesn't want to disrespect you.
So, if you want him to stay outside...
Yeah, tell him he can stay outside.
He's here to help out with the arson investigation.
Okay.
Where I come from, you get in a fight, you shake each other's hands afterwards... and you put it behind you.
I can do that if you can.
I like you, kid.
You remind me of...
This doesn't make us buddies.
Just find the son of a bitch who torched my mom's diner.
Okay?
Just tell me why you think I should give you my blessing to investigate Kevin Hadley.
There's a well-established psychological profile for fire fighter arsonists, and Hadley fits it to a tee.
They tend to be white and male.
They come from broken homes.
Hadley's father abandoned them when he was 13.
They're usually unmarried.
They lack stable interpersonal relationships.
I mean, Chief, you saw the way he blew everything up around here.
Benny, you're talking about half the fire fighters I know, including you.
Chief, it's Hadley right down the list.
So you think he's motivated by anger over getting kicked out of 51?
You told him he wasn't worthy of this house, so he's trying to prove you wrong...
Show you that he's smarter than you are.
And he isn't going to stop until someone's dead.
Chief, you should know that I...
I confronted Hadley about this.
Really?
What'd he say?
He said, "prove it."
- Hey, Pete.
- Yeah.
- How's your mom doing?
- Okay.
Trying to decide if she should rebuild or just call it quits.
Tell her we're going to take this arsonist down.
She knows.
Wedraw straws for the third bedroom.
No.
No, there is no way I am leaving this up to random chance.
It ought to be about who wants it most.
We should have a contest.
Dude...
The "Cinnamon challenge."
Where you try to eat a spoonful of cinnamon
- in under 60 seconds?
- Exactly.
You mean the Internet craze that lands people in the hospital with a collapsed lung?
- Yeah, that's the one.
- What are we, a bunch of frat boys all of a sudden?
It's cool.
Benny's got a solid reason to be here.
They told you about Hadley?
What about Hadley?
Kelly thinks Hadley's the one responsible for the arson fires.
What?
Shay, are you serious?
I'll talk to him.
This is Matt.
Yeah, why?
Chief, need a big favor.
I got to run out for half an hour.
After you were late this morning?
Yeah, I know, Chief, but can Herrmann cover as acting officer while I'm gone?
You need a Lieutenant to cover for you.
I need that paperwork on my desk.
Chief, it's half an hour.
There better be a damn good reason.
There is.
Thanks.
Believe me,
Griffin and I are gonna have a long talk the minute I get off shift.
This won't happen again.
I have to say, Matt, this whole child care situation doesn't exactly instill me with confidence.
We're making the best of it.
There are other options.
Not for me.
I...
I have an obligation to Heather and her late husband.
Matt, your only obligation is to Griffin and Ben.
You need to make sure they have constant and proper guidance.
And if I feel like you can't provide that while you're working 24-hour shifts, well, then I have to share my concerns with DCFS.
Hello?
Dawson?
- Hi.
- I'm sorry.
You are?
I'm Gabby Dawson.
I'm with Matt.
I'm sorry about that.
I'm sorry.
I'm still on duty.
- Hey.
- Hey.
This isn't like Griffin at all.
Obviously, he's acting out.
In a span of a year, he's lost his father, and his mother's been taken away.
But he'll get there.
He'll get there.
He just needs to know that we're here and that we love him and it's okay to feel whatever he's feeling right now.
Thank you.
That's, uh... that's just what I was about to tell Matt.
Boden's got a big mouth.
You didn't have to come.
But you're so glad I did.
Griffin, what are you doing?
You can't just go around hitting kids.
All right, we'll talk later.
I'm gonna pick you up early tomorrow.
You can't.
I have detention.
Griffin, it's not like I'm trying to drag you along to pick up my dry cleaning.
This is a big deal.
Later.
Matt, if you're gonna engage in a battle of wills with an 11-year-old, you're gonna lose.
So what?
I'm supposed to back down?
No.
No, just back off a little.
Let him come to you.
Oh, good afternoon, Chief.
Ms. McLeod.
Come right in.
Um, listen.
A Kevin Hadley was dismissed from your house earlier this year.
Is that correct?
Why is arson discussing ongoing investigations with an outside consultant?
The reasons for his transfer are vague.
Why'd you force him out?
I don't believe that's your business.
Chief, all due respect, if one of your former men is now setting fires all over this city, it doesn't exactly cast your leadership abilities in the most flattering light.
Kevin Hadley exhibited unacceptable behavior toward another fire fighter.
He couldn't remain in the house.
I showed him the door.
Without filing a grievance with human resources?
I opted not to report his behavior.
My aim was to get the man out of the house, not to ruin his career.
So you let his unacceptable behavior go unreported, and now he's targeting 51 with arson fires.
Okay.
Well, thank you, Chief.
I just needed to get some clarification on that.
You have a good day.
Yeah.
How's it going, Clarke?
Cruz.
So a bunch of us are going to Molly's tomorrow.
- You should join us.
- Yeah.
Sure, tip back a few beers, get to know us all a bit better.
What's a movie from 1985 starring Cher?
Four letters.
I don't know.
Addams Family?
Anyhow, maybe we'll see you at Molly's.
Your wife too.
Bring her along.
Hey, Capp.
Can I borrow you for a second?
Brian, just go slow.
If I feel a pinch, I'll speak up.
You're sure about this.
It's gonna destroy the ring.
Or maybe we can get it off with olive oil.
My wife moved out, back in August.
So I don't need the ring anymore.
Sorry to hear that.
Yeah, what are you gonna do?
Keep that under your hat, huh?
- Ambulance 61...
- Yeah, sure.
2051 West Potomac.
So...
I just pretended to be Casey's girlfriend.
Um, anyway, it's kind of a long story.
But the point is, it wasn't a big deal.
I mean, I wasn't, like, nervous or awkward or anything.
I'm content just being his friend.
Wow.
You're really into this Jay guy, aren't you?
Yeah, I think I am.
Okay.
Here we go.
What are we looking at?
Over here.
My buddy Chris.
He's got a little... problem.
Yep, that's a problem.
Okay, one nail I get.
But four?
He disabled the safety on his nail gun so it'll shoot rapid fire.
- A real time saver.
- They're in pretty tight.
Hey, Dawson, should we call a truck?
I don't know.
He's already going into shock.
Do you have a saw?
- We need to cut this board free.
- Yeah, here.
Deep breaths, deep breaths.
There you go.
Cut it as short as you can.
Oh!
It's vibrating!
Sorry, man!
Are you okay?
He won't be okay until we get him to a hospital.
- Keep cutting.
- I can't.
I can't!
We're not amputating an arm.
It's a piece of wood!
Give it to me.
Cover his eyes.
Can you stand up?
Nice and easy.
Here you go.
Stay close to me.
Oh, and you guys should be wearing eye protection.
All right, this is an I.P.A.
It's a little hoppier than the last one.
Give it a taste.
It's not bad, right?
We got a whole slew of different...
I'm telling you, girl, you'd love Daft Punk.
"Get lucky." Oh, you're kidding me!
The guys with the crazy helmets!
Oh!
Is that the horsey-riding song?
The...
No?
God, no.
No.
You know what, girl?
You're about to have your horizons broadened.
I am gonna make you a mix CD.
Just you wait.
Hey, Cruz.
Mouch is here.
Time for the cinnamon challenge.
We're not really gonna do this thing, are we?
Are you kidding me?
I've been promoting it on my podcast.
I mean, people came out here to watch.
You know what?
I don't need the apartment that bad.
I'm out.
Look like it is down to you and me, Cruz.
May the best man win.
Dude, this is ground cumin.
Oh, shoot.
Hey, they're right next to each other on the shelf!
Hey, Mouch.
I want you to meet my girl Isabella.
Ah, the kingmaker, huh?
I've heard a lot about you.
And I about you.
Sounds like you could use some campaign help.
Nice.
Firm grip.
Nobody ever won an election with clammy hands.
I wipe my palm on my pants.
So talk to me about your campaign strategy.
Uh, we just started talking about what I should...
Oh, cute.
Indeed.
Here, try this one.
Who is this guy?
Oh, that?
That's Jay.
He's sort of a regular now.
They're... they're just friends.
It's cool, Otis.
I can handle it.
She looks happy.
Who's in charge here?
He is.
Hey, how ya doin', officers?
Come back after shift and try the autumn ale.
We got a complaint from one of your neighbors.
You're kidding me.
Who complained?
You know I can't tell you that.
Look, I'm afraid you're gonna have to shut this booth down.
No, no, no, no...
I cleared this with the city, see?
I got a permit that says we can hold an outdoor event, see?
We're on the up and up.
This isn't about permits.
"Unlimited beer tasting, $10."
It's a violation of happy hour laws.
Can't serve unlimited alcohol for a set price.
Shut it down or get fined.
Right.
Game day.
Sorry, folks.
Gotta shut it down.
You wanna go to Defcon 5, Game Day?
I can go to Defcon 5.
Defcon 5 is actually the lowest level.
Shut up, Otis.
Okay.
What does that mean exactly,
"they put him on their list of suspects"?
Means that they're taking our suspicions seriously.
They'll dig into Hadley's background, maybe bring him in for questioning.
What they ought to do is keep an eye on him 24/7.
They need to catch him in the act.
Arson investigation doesn't have the manpower
- for that kind of surveillance.
- Hell, I got time on my hands.
I'll stake out his place.
Kelly, you start meddling with the investigation, and you could put their case on very shaky procedural grounds.
Please, just let A.I. handle it, okay?
Wow.
Hey.
This is a nice place you found here, Leslie.
Thank you.
And thanks so much for helping out.
I...
I feel bad.
You probably want to get back to Beth and the kids.
No, no, it's okay.
Anyway, Kelly needs me.
Well, come on.
Between these arson fires and Renee pulling the rug out from under you...
You're having trouble at home, aren't you?
Well, Beth and I are taking a little break right now.
- Oh, boy.
- No, no, it's gonna be fine.
I'm driving back to Kenosha every weekend.
It'll work out, okay?
Hey, can you give me a hand with the coffee table?
We were doing pretty good there until officer friendly showed up.
After expenses, we cleared 62 bucks.
And remember, Arthur's gonna show up at the end of the week to collect his share of that.
Great.
Thanks for reminding me.
Arthur's this wannabe mobster who weaseled his way into a silent partnership.
Total leech.
Hey, go home, Herrmann.
You've been on your feet all day.
- I'll finish cleaning up.
- Thanks, Dawson.
Maybe I'll go pour myself a nice, big, tall glass of antifreeze.
Good night.
Do you want a hand with the glasses?
Yeah, we could wash the glasses.
Or we could... let them soak awhile.
You need anything, Gabby?
Sorry, what?
You want some toast or something?
Oh, no.
Sorry, I'm great.
Thanks.
- See, you just got re-tweeted.
- Amazing.
Dawson, I owe you big-time.
Isabella's a real find.
What's going on?
I set Randy up with a social media presence so he can reach out to the online CFD community.
Now he can gather endorsements electronically.
I only need 120 more signatures, and I'm on the ballot.
That's great.
Where's Herrmann?
He should see this.
- Thanks so much for doing this.
- Yeah, it's great practice.
And if I can get Randy elected union president that'll really help me establish myself in Chicago.
Yeah.
Plus it's no chore hanging around a firehouse, if you know what I mean.
I think Pete over there has a thing for me.
Oh, he's your ex?
Gabby, I didn't realize.
Don't worry, he's off-limits.
No, no.
Actually... you know what?
He's fair game.
Yeah?
Can I have your attention, please?
As per discussion I have just had with our consultant friend Ms. McLeod, from here on out, anyone who must leave a shift for personal reasons, you need to submit a request and allow enough time for a relief to be brought in.
Absolutely no exceptions.
By the way...
Otis.
Cinnamon challenge.
Are you out of your mind?
Oh, it's cool, Chief.
We're gonna have a paramedic present.
You are a fire fighter with the city of Chicago, and you are promoting a dangerous stunt that has filled emergency rooms with victims who are stupid enough to try it!
Cinnamon challenge?
What cinnamon challenge?
We're not doing a cinnamon challenge.
I didn't think so.
How is she finding out all this stuff?
I know she doesn't subscribe to your podcast.
Can I have your attention, please?
I got an announcement to make too!
Just a heads up.
Lately we've been finding rat turds all over the house.
Seems that we have an infestation.
Finkus backstabberus... better known as the common snitch.
Not to fear, though.
These disgusting vermin don't typically last long at 51.
Something you wanna say to me, Herrmann?
Just puttin' it out there, Clarke.
A general warning.
Well, maybe I should give you a very specific warning.
Come on.
Come on!
Hey!
Enough.
Enough!
Enough of this.
You gotta be kidding me.
- Old 51.
I miss this place.
- Easy, Mills.
How's everyone been?
What are you doing here?
Just wanna buy a T-shirt.
Got to support the local firehouse, right?
Get out.
Before I carry you out.
Why?
So you can keep spreading lies about me?
What can we help you with, Hadley?
That's a laugh.
If I ever need help with anything, this is the last place I'll come looking for it.
Hey, buddy?
New guy.
Watch your back around here.
Word to the wise.
Engine 51, Truck 81,
Squad 3, Ambulance 61, Battalion 25.
House fire.
South California and Madison.
It's a condemned house.
Structurally unsound.
He's setting another trap for us, Chief.
Yeah, no doubt.
I'm gonna hold off.
Truck 81, Squad 3, stand down.
Engine 51, hit it with your water cannon.
Nobody goes inside.
We gonna let this one burn to the ground if we have to.
- Dawson, Shay!
- Hey, buddy.
Hey, buddy.
Hold still!
Hold still!
Don't move.
My girlfriend's inside.
I can't find her.
Send me and Capp in.
That fire's in the structure.
We'll do one rapid primary search, and we'll get out.
You got one minute.
Capp!
Come on, let's move.
Herrmann!
Mills!
Get 'em a straight ladder.
Got it.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy.
- My girlfriend is...
- Take it easy!
They're looking for her right now, okay?
If she's still up there, they'll find her.
No!
She's not... she's not upstairs!
- What?
- She woke me up.
Said she smelled something funny coming from the basement.
I think she went back down there!
Chief!
We got a problem!
Severide, get out of there.
She is not upstairs.
Get outta there now.
Copy that!
Capp!
Spellman, get a crew in the back door with a 1 3/4-inch hose.
Clear a path for truck to get into the basement.
- On it, chief.
- Mills!
- Yeah.
- With me.
Fire department!
Call out!
Lieutenant!
We got her!
Chief!
We're cut off!
We're gonna need help getting out of the side window in sector four!
51!
Bring a ladder to sector four!
Move!
They don't have long!
All right, ready?
Go!
Got her?
- She's breathing.
- Lift her up.
Mills, you first.
On "three." One, two, three.
We need saline and an IO drill and burn sheets...
lot's of 'em.
Severide.
Take it easy, Severide!
You almost killed that girl, you son of a bitch!
She could spend the next six months in the burn unit
- 'cause of you!
- Now, this is insanity.
Just followed you over here to watch you work.
- We know you started this fire!
- How could I?
I was at 51 when it happened.
You saw me.
Severide!
Severide.
You know what?
Keep your lousy T-shirt.
Let's go!
We got a fire to fight.
We're gonna go inside and sign us in.
Then we'll walk through a metal detector, just like at the airport.
They'll take us to a visiting room, then the guards will bring your mom in to sit and talk.
She'll be wearing kind of a funny jumpsuit and maybe she won't have on any makeup.
But she's still your mom.
- She still loves you.
- Can we just get on with it?
Griffin.
Listen to me, I've been where you are.
I know it's not easy to see your mom this way, but you have no idea what a great thing it is you're doing for her.
You two are all she has right now.
So keep being brave.
For her.
Okay.
All right.
Ready?
Yeah.
Okay, let's do it.
Mama!
Mama!
Mom!
Hey.
I missed you.
So I gotta sit there and listen to this guy Rome from arson and my old man lecture me about how I'm playing right into Hadley's hands.
That I'm giving him the attention he craves.
- What do they expect you to do?
- They want me to ignore him.
So he gets bolder, I guess...
I don't know... and slips up.
- What, or kill someone?
- That's... yes.
That's what I said.
I mean...
Hadley worked under me for two years.
I should have seen this coming.
Whoa.
Look, Kelly.
Don't put yourself through that.
It's not your fault.
I'm just sick and tired of waiting for bells to go off.
We need to stop reacting and start anticipating.
That's what we need to do.
No, what we need to do is let arson handle this.
And you and I need to go somewhere and get drunk.
Come on, I'm buying.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
Come on.
God, you cheap-ass!
Come on.
Come on, Otis, we got drinks to serve.
This'll only take a minute.
And you're gonna love it.
Trust me.
- Otis.
- Yes?
Did you call the fire marshal to report an over-capacity crowd at Game Day?
I don't know what you're talking about, Christopher.
What are you guys doing?
I think Otis just took us to Defcon 1.
Right this way, folks!
We got half-price drinks!
Come on in and party!
Go get 'em!
I'm getting outta here.
- Hey.
- Joe.
You burned me a CD?
Aw.
You are adorable.
What's up, Cruz?
Everything all right?
He wants you to promise you won't go away.
Like mom and dad.
I'm right here, guys.
I'm not going anywhere.
- Where's Zoya?
- No idea.
Okay, so...
Due to liability concerns, we had to IX-nay the cinnamon challenge.
But... but fear not.
for Joe Cruz and I... are going to attempt the saltine cracker challenge:
Where we will attempt to eat six crackers in under a minute with not a drop of water.
No, no, no, no.
It's gonna be awesome.
Trust me.
Okay, here we go.
Oh.
You can take the third bedroom.
- I'm out.
- Reawy?
Yeah!
Yeah-ah!
All I ask is that you don't sit idly by while Greg Sullivan runs unopposed.
Your signature will help put me on the ballot, make sure we have a real choice at the voting booth.
Thank you, Tony.
He's like a new man.
Give me a lump of clay, and I'll mold it into a masterpiece.
We're about to get our last two signatures.
Um, do you want to celebrate later?
Yeah, it sounds like fun.
Uh, do you realize that Gabby and I...
Gabby and I talked.
She's cool with it.
Really?
Interesting.
We did it!
200 signatures.
We made the deadline.
I am on the ballot!
Hey, you and me, buddy!
We're going all the way!
Wow!
Well, well, well.
How about this crowd, huh?
Things are really looking up around here, huh?
So...
Hey, Dawson, get Arthur his dough... so he can be on his way.
Some kinda joke?
That's 1%, per our agreement.
What?
You want an audit?
No, tough guy.
I don't want an audit.
I wanna new deal.
See, my man Jay here... he's been assessing your business.
We'll talk numbers soon, huh?
So... when you said that you were...
You were working construction, you meant you were working for Arthur?
Look...
And you came here to spy on us?
Get outta my bar.
Now.
(Cooing)
Good morning, Georgia.
So it's a big day.
It's a big, big day.
Um, your sisters are coming.
So I won't be around as much as usual because I'm gonna be helping your mama.
But I'm gonna make sure that your aunts and uncles stop by to see you.
So if you need anything, you know, just ask, okay?
(Continues cooing)
The babies are okay?
I got the NICU on standby.
Babies are fine.
Nobody needs to worry.
You know, they're still premature.
Yeah, but multiples usually are.
I mean, they're healthy enough for delivery now.
They're just not in any rush, you know?
We don't want to hurry things along with early babies.
- (Violet) So how long?
- Well, she's at 4 centimeters now, and she can't push until she's at 10, so she could be in labor for another day.
(Sam) Ooh.
Ooh.
Oh, God help us all.
(Amelia) Look on the bright side.
More time to vote on names.
Would you put Zoe on that board?
No, do not put Zoe on the board.
Wait.
Don't cross out Hannah.
I like Hannah.
"Hannah and her sisters"?
There'd be no end to the merciless teasing.
By whom, all the die-hard Woody Allen fans in preschool?
Someone put Autumn and Summer up there?
Come on, guys.
We're better than this.
With names like that, it's hard to keep your daughter off the pole.
Hey!
(Blows air)
(Panting) The only people who can vote on a name are Mason and those who provided genetic material.
So unless one of you looky-loos knows a way to fast-track this delivery, get the hell outta here.
(Panting)
(Chuckles)
(people get ready's "windy Cindy" playing)
Thanks.
Hi.
Can you make me some kind of basket with all these books and, I don't know, some little stuffed animal or something?
A gift basket... can you do that?
I'm the owner.
I can do whatever.
Whose the lucky baby?
They're triplets. (Laughs)
My best friend.
He's hav... well, his wife is having triplets.

Thank you.
So listen, I've got two more patients, and then I'm clear for the rest of the day.
Should Henry and I come by here and pick you up?
Well, actually, I was gonna go home and get him ready, but that depends on Charlotte.
Her babies are taking their sweet time.
Okay.
Well, when we're done with court, why don't we go to the park?
I think swings and ice cream is a perfect way to celebrate.
I've got a camera in the car.
The judge can take some pictures for us.
Mm.
What's that for?
For loving Henry... and me.
Thank you.
♪ You ♪
(Grunts) Good.
Breathe.
(Exhales) Shut...
Focus through it.
Oh, shut up.
(Panting)
Brought you some more ice chips.
Okay, let's take a look, see how you're doing.
Oh, I'm a hot air balloon about to pop.
Must be 6 centimeters by now. 5 at least.
Mm. 4 and a smidge.
80% effaced.
You sure you know what you're doing down there?
You are doing great, Charlotte.
Of course she is.
Ugh.
Don't touch me.
What the hell are you still doing here?
Mason has a half day of school, remember?
You need to pick him up.
I asked Amelia to pick him up.
Oh, I'd rather she were here with me and you were with Mason.
You're the one who got me into this mess.
If Addison leaves a sharp instrument laying around,
I just might stab you with it.
May I go?
(Lowered voice) It's gonna be another four hours... (Coughs) At least.
Oh.
All right.
I'll be back.
(Breathing heavily) I need some more juice.
Okay.
I'll have Brenda get you some.
Why Brenda?
I-I've been here all night.
I'm off the clock in ten minutes.
Well...
I'm sure you have a big day planned.
So go ahead.
Enjoy it.
Matter of fact, why don't you knock off early?
Just because you're the best labor and delivery nurse in this hospital, and you've been with me all through my pregnancy, and I hired you, there is no reason you should be here to help me get to the end.
Not everyone's able to see things through.
(Laughs)
One juice coming right up.
(Velcro crackles)
Subtle.
(Exhales) My middle name.
Hey.
Are the babies born yet?
Not yet.
It's gonna be a few more hours, which is making your mama extra cranky.
Hello.
Oh, hi.
Uh-huh.
Uh, today?
No, no, no.
It's great.
Yeah.
Bye. (Beep)
What?
Okay.
I put an offer in on a house...
Did they counter?
How do you know about counteroffers?
Natalie's mom's a real estate agent.
The seller doesn't want any more money, but another family put in the same offer.
She wants to meet both families and then decide.
So it's like sudden death.
Yeah, but it's gonna be like my death, because they want to do it now, but I can't do it now because Charlotte's in labor.
But if we don't do it now, we're not gonna have a place for this enormous family to live.
This is called a lose-lose.
If I'm not there for the birth of my babies,
Charlotte's gonna string me up by my toes in the living room.
Our living room isn't big enough.
Which is why we need a house, Mason!
Dad, take a deep breath.
(Exhales)
You're 10.
How'd you get so sensible?
Is the house near here?
It's not far.
(Starts engine)
All right.
Well, let's go win the house, then we'll go to the hospital and surprise mama.
Okay, if she yells at me... (Shifts gear)
I'm blaming you.
You know, you... (Chuckles) you are one lucky lady, you know that?
You've got your entire life ahead of you.
One big blank slate.
I mean, I'm kind of envious of you.
(Fussing)
You're brave, fearless.
I mean, you probably know what it took me years to figure out.
You gotta live your life to the fullest.
You can't be afraid to make mistakes.
And I'm trying to do that now.
I... (Sighs) I just hope it's not too late.
(Cooing)
(Sighs)
Okay.
Good talk.
Thanks.
Hey.
Did Charlotte have the babies?
Not even close.
She must be pissed.
You have no idea.
I've been walking the halls with her, trying to move the labor along.
You're hanging out with her?
Of course.
She's my friend.
Oh.
I just figured being around her would be hard for you, because of your history.
Oh.
No.
No, I'm fine.
It's-it's okay.
Good.
Mm.
I'm glad.
That's good.
What?
Nothing.
I was just...
I'm glad to hear you're doing fine.
So then... do you ever think about...
I mean, not right now, but... do you want to have kids?
Dr. Peterson, you've got a head lac in curtain two.
Be right there.
Keep me posted about Charlotte?
Sure.
Yeah.
(Laughter)
I have never once heard him say "quiet."
It's always "taciturn."
I caught him reading a dictionary in his office once. (Laughing)
(Laughing)
An expansive vocabulary is the bedrock of sagacity.
Yes, but if you actually want people to understand you, you might have to dumb it down a bit.
Ooh.
I like her, Sheldon.
Where'd you two meet?
At a vending machine.
She was having trouble with a chocolate bar, and I assisted her.
That's true.
He was very chivalrous with some loose change.
Thank you.
Oh, looks delicious.
(Charlotte) Tell me what I want to hear.
I know this has been unpleasant for you, but you are in the home stretch, and you've been... a real trooper these last several months.
I've been a trooper?
Honestly, no.
But I just wanted to say something nice to you.
(Chuckles) You're at 6 centimeters.
Ugh.
I hate you.
Hey.
Shouldn't you be getting Henry ready?
I can't leave yet.
It's today?
Henry's adoption hearing?
(Scoffs) Well, get the hell out.
Charlotte...
Don't "Charlotte" me.
First of all, Cooper's spawn aren't actually coming out until Henry's college graduation...
Charlotte, you are having your babies.
You are legally having your own baby today, too.
So go on.
Shoo.
All right, but if your labor starts to progress more rapidly...
I'll have Jake.
You didn't think you were both leaving, did you?
Of course not.
I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna walk Addison out.
So no swings or ice cream or pictures with the judge.
Well, we'll get the bailiff to take pictures with the judge, and there will be swings and ice cream, just later.
Listen, you have no idea how badly I wanted to be there, but we can't... we can't leave Charlotte with some poor, unsuspecting doctor.
She'll eat 'em alive.
I know.
I just...
I don't know.
I was just really looking forward to celebrating.
Well, listen, you and Henry and I have the rest of our lives to celebrate.
Your job right now is to go to court and bring back our son.
Jake... you just said "our son."
Damn right, I did.
Mm.
Go.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
Mm.
I shouldn't be surprised by his question.
(Cooing) I'm a woman.
I have the plumbing.
I love kids.
(Continues cooing)
But what if my body only makes brainless babies?
(Continues cooing)
I couldn't live through that again.
(Continues cooing)
And even if I was lucky enough to have a healthy child,
I know things now.
It doesn't matter how fiercely you love someone.
It's not enough.
The world can be terrifying, and bad things happen that you're powerless to prevent.
I'm done.
I don't want to have any more babies.
(Continues cooing)
(Charlotte) Ugh.
They are unbelievable.
Treating my uterus like it's some kind of airport V.I.P. lounge.
So let's see what's going on.
Oh, I need some good news, Jake.
All right.
And you're at 7 centimeters.
Oh, nice.
We're getting closer.
Closer my ass.
Come on.
I'm desperate.
Can't you charm 'em out or somethin'?
They're girls.
Girls like you.
Just get down there and say whatever it is you say to women that gets 'em all in a tizzy.
(Laughs)
(Sighs)
Your boyfriend's lurking.
Oh, go.
But be back in 15 minutes.
Underneath that awful exterior, you really are just a softie, aren't you?
Shh.
(Lowered voice) If they hear you, they'll never mind me.
(Chart and pen clatter)
Okay.
Look...
I need you on your best behavior, okay?
Look interested, pay attention, and if the nice lady asks you any questions at all, you...
No eye rolling, grunting, or nodding.
Use my words.
I got this.
Okay, I know you got it.
It's just...
I really want to win, okay?
We are gonna win.
We're so much better than the other family.
(Sam) Oh, I forgot.
(Stephanie) What?
You need to... (Laughs)
(Laughing)
(Laughing)
Ohh, mother of God.
(Crying)
(Panting) This is a bad one.
This is, uh, the double platinum of contractions.
Otherwise, I'd come help you.
I'm sorry.
I should be helping you.
I just...
I needed a place to hide.
I can't be crying in the middle of the hospital.
Oh, it's my hospital.
You can do whatever the...
Oh!
You can do whatever you damn well please.
It should be over in the next millennium, and I'll ask you what's wrong.
Oh, don't worry about me.
I'm fine.
I'm okay.
I just-I just can't... (Groaning)
I just can't stop crying.
Why won't it stop?
(Sobbing)
I've been asking my uterus that same thing, sister.
Aah!
(Cries)
Hello there, young man.
You must be Henry.
(Woman) He is, your honor.
And this is Dr. Addison Forbes Montgomery, the adoptive parent.
Oh, I see you work at St. Ambrose, Dr. Montgomery.
That's right.
But not so much that it would be a problem for Henry.
I... sorry.
I'm... (Laughs) I'm a little nervous.
No need.
Birth mother signed away parental rights.
Home visits completed.
What's going on?
Your honor?
Your social worker Mildred Clemons just faxed this letter.
It seems she has some concerns.
Wh-what concerns?
I don't understand.
I'm sorry, Dr. Montgomery.
I can't finalize Henry's adoption today.
I'm ordering further evaluation.
We'll set another court date, and I'll make a ruling then.
Wh-wh-what does that mean?
What just happened?
I don't know.
Normally this hearing is a formality.
Did something happen with Mildred?
No, I haven't seen her in months.
Was there anything unusual about her last visit?
No, no.
She-she just met with...
Jake.
Okay.
I'll talk to the judge and try and find out exactly what's going on and how we should proceed.
Wait, wait.
Is there a chance...
I mean, could I... could I lose Henry?
Try not to grow up too fast, okay?
Because little girls who grow up too fast end up running off with their college professors, which you and I both know is entirely inappropriate.
And we also know that cutting off communication with your father because he showed a little concern over your emotional well-being is, well... let's just say I'll be recommending a good private school to your mom and dad... one with only female teachers, possibly a convent.
(Cooper) It really is such an amazing home.
I just want whoever lives here next to cherish this place like we did, respect its history.
- Yeah.
- History's my favorite subject.
Do you know what started world war I?
Uh... (Chuckles)
The assassination of Archiduke Ferdinand.
- And his wife Sophie.
- Oh.
You are so darling.
(Chuckles) (Man) Hello?
Yoo-hoo.
Hi.
(Door closes)
Dan and Darlene Meyer.
I know we're early, but we got a call to serve food at the mission later, and we just didn't want to miss this opportunity.
- We love this house.
- Ohh.
Well, this is Dr. Freedman and his son Mason.
- Hi.
Cooper Freedman.
- Hi.
- Hi, Mason.
- Hi.
They're the other family that's bidding on the house.
- (Cooper) Nice to meet you...
- Oh.
And your pie.
(Chuckles) Apple pie?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, well...
It's not blueberry, but, you know...
Um...
So you're a doctor?
Yes.
Dr. Freedman.
Pediatrician.
Mm.
I just love helping children.
It's a calling, really.
Yeah, I was-I was premed.
Oh.
Yeah, but then I met Dan when we were volunteering at a women's shelter.
And I don't know.
Four years of medical school and internship, residency... it just felt like it would take too long to actually make a difference in the world.
Mm.
- You know?
- Yeah.
Well, that is so lovely. (Chuckles)
Walter and I like to go to children's hospital on the weekends and visit with the kids.
So inspiring.
We help out with their annual fund-raiser.
Mm-hmm.
Oh.
Oh!
You are that Dan and Darlene Meyer?
- That's us.
- Guilty.
Oh.
I have seen your names on the program.
- (Dan) Oh.
- (Woman) Yeah.
(Under breath) You've gotta be kidding me.
Well... (Chuckles) who would like a piece of pie?
(Laughs)
- Thank you.
Oh, I would.
- (Darlene) Yes.
You know the one good thing about dying of cancer?
I don't have to worry about sunscreen anymore.
(Chuckles) Oh, hilarious.
Yeah.
(Laughs)
So lunch wasn't so bad, right?
Violet's great.
If all your friends are that great, it makes me feel bad that we're lying to them.
Well, we did meet at a vending machine, right?
I'm not lying to Violet.
Sheldon...
I don't know how much time I have left, and I want to know that you're gonna be okay when I'm gone.
So you gotta talk to someone.
You gotta tell them about the cancer and about me.
I'm not ready to think about you being gone.

Well, I'm here.
Lay it on me.
Uh...
Well, I went to a-a bookstore this morning to get a present for the Cooplets, and, um, the owner of the bookstore was this very attractive man.
And, uh, he recognized me from my book.
Okay.
I wrote a book.
I don't get recognized very much, but, uh, it never gets old.
Right?
So he recognized me, and then he flirted with me.
Uh-oh.
(Laughs) And I...
I flirted...
I flirted back a little.
And then he asked me what happened to the guy in the book.
Pete.
And, Sam...
I forgot all about him. (Laughs)
For the three or four minutes I was flirting with this guy,
I just...
I forgot Pete ever existed.
I forgot he was dead.
I-I forgot-I forgot him.
Well, that's normal.
Right?
Isn't that a normal step in the grieving process?
Yeah.
Yeah.
But it was just so...
I mean, look,
Charlotte is having her babies today, and I was so happy for her.
I am.
I'm so happy for her and Cooper.
Mm-hmm.
But then I go to this bookstore, and I see my book about this super awesome time when a lady cut my baby out of my belly.
And then I remember Pete is dead.
And then I see you and Stephanie, and you guys are so sweet together.
And then Sheldon has found Miranda, and she's just lovely with him.
And then Addison and Jake, and it... everybody's living.
And I just keep having these waves where I start to cry and I can't stop.
And-and so I was at this bookstore with this attractive man.
And I had this moment, Sam, where I just...
I just knew...
I'm never gonna have another child.
My whole experience of having a child is Katie stealing my baby.
I'm never gonna get married again.
My entire experience of marriage was Pete, and that was so...
I mean, some of it was good, but most of it was pretty painful.
So that entire part of my life, it's... it's done.
And I want to forget him.
I was angry that I remembered him.
Because when I remember him, it feels like I'm dying, too.
So this is it.
This is my life.
This is who I am.
This is... this is all I get.
And I think, you know, is it... is it enough?
♪

You're not done.
All right?
You're-you're unfinished.
You're a work in progress.
I mean, if I had told you five years ago that you were gonna have Lucas the way that you did or that you were gonna marry Pete, you would've laughed in my face, right?
If I'd have told you two years ago that you'd be a widow, you would never have believed me.
Because you don't know what tomorrow brings.
You know, it could be anything.
I mean, absolutely anything.
It could be good.
It could be bad.
It, uh... it could be this hot bookstore owner guy or it could just be you and your amazing little boy.
But you don't know because you're not done.
I mean, you won't know the point of the book until it's written.
The-the book that is your life is a work in progress.
So you, Violet Turner, you're unfinished.
Yeah.
How was that?
That was really, really good.
Yes.
You should write a book.
(Both laugh)
What did you do?
I am Henry's mother.
You're not the problem.
It's your fiance that worries me.
He beat a man nearly to death.
A drug dealer.
When you feel threatened, you call 9-1-1.
Henry cannot live in an environment where violence is an acceptable solution.
Jake was trying to protect his family.
He's a good man.
He would never hurt anyone, Mildred.
Tell that to the man he threatened to kill.
No, no.
You misunderstood.
Jake's daughter is dating her much-older college professor, and he... he just got upset.
He was a good deal more than upset.
If this was an issue, why didn't you say something sooner?
Seeing you with Henry is what we dream about when we place children, so I approved the adoption.
But after meeting Dr. Reilly,
I thought I could get past my concerns.
I have to be dispassionate and consider what's best for the child.
I am what's best for Henry.
And if Henry were living with you alone,
I wouldn't have an objection.
(Voice breaking) Please.
I can't lose my son.
I'm sorry, Dr. Montgomery.
I've already made my recommendation.
Now it's up to the judge.
"And the brave prince"
"married the beautiful fairy princess,"
"and together, they lived happily ever after."
(Fusses)
I know.
I should've read the blue one about the trains.
(Cooing)
Fairy tales are just... well, they're just stupid, you know?
And people should not read them to their children.
It sets them up for false expectations.
It makes them think that happily ever after is the end of the story.
It's not like that, you know?
(Chuckles)
Real relationship stories... are messy.
Real relationship stories sometimes have a dead prince and a grieving princess who sobs in public.
And they don't end.
Sam says there's no ending, and I choose to believe him because a dead prince can't be the ending.
(Fussing)
God, you are so tiny.
I hope you never know what I'm talking about.
(Whispers) I hope you never have a dead prince.
(Continues fussing)
(Grunts) Ah!
Oh!
If you tell me I'm still at 7 centimeters,
I swear, I'll kill you.
Nope, you're at 10.
Page Addison, please.
You got it.
(Panting) Wait.
This is it?
Yep.
If you feel like it...
Ah!
You can start to push.
Oh, I can't.
I need Coop.
Amelia...
I know.
- (Chuckles) They're coming.
- I know.
(Laughs)
Oh, where the freakin' hell is my husband?
I'll find him.
Oh. (Inhales and hums)
Right from that first day, I knew that Darlene was the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.
(Darlene laughs)
Dr. Freedman, where did you meet your wife?
Wasn't it on a web site?
No.
No, we met at St. Ambrose hospital, where she is chief of staff.
(Dan) Hmm, that can't be easy.
There's so much bureaucracy in the practice of medicine.
Yeah, and price gouging. (Chuckles)
Price gouging?
Well, I'm sorry, Dr. Freedman.
Most people can't afford any kind of medical care.
Well, I treat my patients regardless.
But you don't practice for free, right?
Well, I save children.
(Cell phone vibrates) Uh, would you like to hear about the schools in the neighborhood?
(Beep)
Amelia.
Okay.
We're on our way.
We gotta go.
But we're totally winning.
Sorry.
Um, look, I... really want to buy this house for my wife as a surprise because I love it, she would love it.
And she's been through so much and she really deserves it.
And Mason and my girls, they could have a happy life here.
But as much as I want to live in this amazing house,
I cannot be here right now, um, because my wife is in labor with triplets, and I have to be there with her, okay?
So I mean, family is everything.
If we end up living in a tent by the stream, as long as we're together, it's gonna be fine.
So it was nice to meet you...
But we gotta go.
(Door opens)
(Door closes)
Hey there.
You feel like having some babies?
- No.
Not without Cooper.
- He's on his way.
So how'd it go?
Was it, uh, was it amazing?
It was fine.
You don't look like it was fine.
Well, I have two babies to deliver, so if you could move...
Okay.
Oh, yeah.
These babies aren't waiting for their daddy.
- I need Cooper.
- Well, you're gonna feel better once you start pushing, Charlotte.
No, I can't do it without him.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Totally explain.
Shut the hell up and hold my hand.
Thank God.
My hand is numb. (Exhales)
All righty.
Here we go.
Give me a push.
Aah!
Charlotte's delivering, huh?
Finally. (Chuckles)
She's been running Stephanie ragged all day.
(Chuckles)
So you and Stephanie are back on, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, good.
Good for you.
I'm seeing someone, too.
Her name is Miranda.
Oh, that's great, Sheldon.
Yeah.
Alright.
I met her at radiation.
I did eight weeks of treatment.
Now I gotta wait another six months before I know if it works, but, uh...
I'm hopeful.
How you feeling?
Pretty good for a guy whose prostate glows in the dark.
Well, I'm glad you got treatment.
Yeah, I have a friend who was a real pain in the ass about it.
So anyway, uh... thank you.
(Charlotte) Ohh.
Okay, Charlotte, I need you to push.
(Groaning)
Good.
Almost there.
Get them out!
You're so close.
Oh, don't tell me I'm close when I still got two babies inside me.
All right, Charlotte, I need you to keep pushing.
Now focus. (Inhales deeply)
Aah!
(Addison) Good. (Whimpers)
(Baby crying)
Ohh.
Ohh.
(Crying continues)
She's crying.
(Cries) She's okay?
She's perfect.
(Laughs)
(Crying continues)
(Panting)
(Laughs)
If this is, uh, if this is too hard for you... (Voice breaking) No.
It's amazing.
(Baby crying)
Aah!
Ohh!
Something's not right.
Addison, talk to me.
I can't feel the head.
(Panting)
Is she in breech?
No, she's not upside down.
She's sideways.
Can you just do a C-section?
It is an option, but I still feel like
I can deliver vaginally.
There are significant risks.
The baby is transverse.
Yeah, but there's risks with any procedure, including C-section.
Look, Charlotte, your body's been through enough trauma and so have the babies.
I still think I can deliver by doing an internal podalic version.
What the hell is that?
She rotates the baby until she can grab a foot, and then she delivers her as a breech.
Wait.
Is that...
I mean, can you even do that?
Yes, Cooper.
I can do it.
And is it safe?
Cooper, you know they couldn't be in better hands.
Charlotte, it's easier on your body than surgery and it won't take very long, but it's gonna hurt like hell.
Okay.
Just get on with it.
Yeah?
All right.
Let's get her ready.
(Stephanie) Okay.
I'll stabilize her legs.
Okay, now you can't push until I tell you, but you can scream.
And you can squeeze.
All right?
So on the count of three.
Mm-hmm.
One, two, three.
Squeeze.
(Screaming)
Oh, God!
Ohh!
(Whimpers)
Aah!
Aah!
Almost there.
Almost there.
I can't.
It's too much.
Okay, listen to me.
Listen to me.
You can do this, okay?
You can.
- I just want it to be over.
- It's about to be over.
You are so strong.
Our girls are gonna be just like you.
So come on.
You gotta do this right now.
Your little girl wants to meet you, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
I've got the baby turned.
Just give me a push now.
Aah!
Good.
All right.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
- No more pushing.
No more pushing.
- Is that good?
She's got the body, okay?
But the head is still inside.
Just give her a minute, okay?
(Crying) Please.
I'm so exhausted.
I know.
I know you are, but you're almost there.
(Addison) Just a few more seconds.
Okay, now.
Push.
Aah!
Okay.
Okay.
Good.
I got her.
(Panting)
Oh, God.
(Speaks indistinctly) Hi.
Hi, baby.
Let me see you.
- You want to cut the cord, Cooper?
- Yeah.
Hey, she's got your eyes.
(Laughs) Hi, sweetheart.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, baby girl.
(Crying)
(Addison chuckles) Okay.
(Laughs)
Okay.
Let me take her away now.
(Charlotte) Oh.
There we go.
She wants her mama.
(Laughs) You got her?
Got her.
(Baby crying)
(Laughing)
(Cries)
Hey.
So what happened in court?
Mildred happened.
At the last minute, she decided she couldn't...
She doesn't feel right about the adoption.
What?
I-I thought the hearing was just a formality.
Not anymore.
The judge decided he wanted to do further evaluation, and then he's going to decide... (Voice breaks) whether or not I get to keep my son.
I-I don't understand.
Why would she...
Oh, God.
No.
It's-it's me?
My arrest.
And the thing with Angela.
(Sighs deeply) Oh, Addison.
I'm so...
I'm so sorry.
Hey.
Don't.
Okay?
I just...
right now, I-I can't.
I just...
I know that this is...
this is not your fault.
I know that, but... the judge could take Henry from me, and... (Voice breaks) I can't.
Charlotte had the babies.
That's great.
Is everybody okay?
They're amazing.
(Crying) They're perfect.
Hey, hey, hey.
Wh-what's... what's going on?
- Yes.
- What?
The answer to your question is yes, I want babies.
I want a lot of babies.
And I'm really scared to want babies, so I-I told myself that I didn't, but I do.
Because it's a miracle.
And I really...
I really need a miracle.
So, yes, someday I want to have babies with you.
Someday.
If we get that far. (Laughs)
We'll get that far.
(Exhales)
(Both laugh)
You came back for your basket.
I came back for my basket.
I'm glad.
Oh...
Wow. (Laughs)
I added some extra books... uh, no charge... just to fill it out a little bit.
And then there's some books every child should have, so I threw those in, too.
You-you didn't have to... it's...
it's beautiful.
Thanks.
I felt bad.
I made you feel sad, and I didn't mean to.
No, no, no, it wasn't you.
It was just... it was me.
(Clicks)
Okay.
You were actually being really kind.
So would you like to get a cup of coffee sometime or-or a drink?
I can't go out with you.
I don't want to.
Okay.
I mean, no, it's not you.
I mean, you're lovely.
And I think if I was gonna go out with anybody, it would probably be you, but...
But?
But I'm...
I'm trying to be okay with just me right now.
And I don't wanna mess that up or cloud it or...
I understand.
You do?
I read your book five times.
(Laughs)
And you're a very good writer, so I understand perfectly.
We'll be friends.
All right.
Yeah, we'll be friends.
(Chuckles)
And thank you.
You know what?
I'm gonna write another book.
I just decided.
And you helped me decide, so thank you.
Well, congratulations.
- What are you gonna call it?
- What?
The book.
What's its title?
Oh.
Uh, I don't know yet.
It's, uh, it's a work in progress.
Well, good luck.
(Laughs)
(Typing)
Thank you.
Judge Harris, my name is Dr. Jake Reilly.
I'm engaged to...
Dr. Addison Forbes Montgomery.
I know who you are.
And I know why you're here.
But I haven't made my decision.
You can't decide what's best for Henry without the facts.
I have them, in a nice big red file.
That's not the whole story.
You can only get that from me.
30 seconds.
Lily, my wife, my... my late wife, was an addict.
She had a daughter...
Angela...
who became our daughter.
Lily's dealer was as close to the devil as... he would kill for money.
He would... he would kill for nothing.
And I had to protect my family, my... my child.
And all these years later?
I'm still protecting my child.
When you have a kid, it's-it's for life.
Doesn't matter how old they are.
I was trying to protect Angela, and I would do the same for Henry.
Consider yourself heard.
I'll leave her.
Addison loves that baby.
She... she loves Henry more than anything in the world, and I love her maybe even more than that, so if you're going to break them apart, then I'll leave her.
I'll walk away.
But they need to be together.
She's his mother.

Good morning, Georgia.
So it's a big day.
It's a big, big day.
Um, your sisters are coming.
So I won't be around as much as usual because I'm gonna be helping your mama.
But I'm gonna make sure that your aunts and uncles stop by to see you.
So if you need anything, you know, just ask, okay?
The babies are okay?
I got the NICU on standby.
Babies are fine.
Nobody needs to worry.
You know, they're still premature.
Yeah, but multiples usually are.
I mean, they're healthy enough for delivery now.
They're just not in any rush, you know?
We don't want to hurry things along with early babies.
- So how long?
- Well, she's at 4 centimeters now, and she can't push until she's at 10, so she could be in labor for another day.
Ooh.
Ooh.
Oh, God help us all.
Look on the bright side.
More time to vote on names.
Would you put Zoe on that board?
No, do not put Zoe on the board.
Wait.
Don't cross out Hannah.
I like Hannah.
"Hannah and her sisters"?
There'd be no end to the merciless teasing.
By whom, all the die-hard Woody Allen fans in preschool?
Someone put Autumn and Summer up there?
Come on, guys.
We're better than this.
With names like that, it's hard to keep your daughter off the pole.
Hey!
The only people who can vote on a name are Mason and those who provided genetic material.
So unless one of you looky-loos knows a way to fast-track this delivery, get the hell outta here.
Thanks.
Hi.
Can you make me some kind of basket with all these books and, I don't know, some little stuffed animal or something?
A gift basket... can you do that?
I'm the owner.
I can do whatever.
Whose the lucky baby?
They're triplets.
My best friend.
He's hav... well, his wife is having triplets.
Is there a total or...
Wait.
This is you.
Yes, it is.
Will you sign it?
Sure.
You must have an amazing memory for faces.
No.
I've, um... read the book five times.
It's incredible.
A real honest memoir.
It felt like poetry.
And I used to look at your picture on the back because, uh...
The scar, I know.
Everybody always looks at the scar.
No, it's... just that, after all you've been through, there was just... such a light in your eyes.
You were so beautiful.
Are so beautiful.
Wow.
Well, thank you.
Charles.
Thank you, Charles.
Your total...
Can I ask you, the... the husband that was in the book, are you and he still...
He's-he's dead.
I'm sorry for your loss.
I'm...
I'm gonna come back and...
and, uh, pick this up later.
So if you just want to put it into a basket,
I'll-I'll pick it up later.
Happy formal adoption hearing day.
And, yes, I get why there's no greeting card for that one.
Thank you.
So listen, I've got two more patients, and then I'm clear for the rest of the day.
Should Henry and I come by here and pick you up?
Well, actually, I was gonna go home and get him ready, but that depends on Charlotte.
Her babies are taking their sweet time.
Okay.
Well, when we're done with court, why don't we go to the park?
I think swings and ice cream is a perfect way to celebrate.
I've got a camera in the car.
The judge can take some pictures for us.
Mm.
What's that for?
For loving Henry... and me.
Thank you.
Good.
Breathe.
Shut...
Focus through it.
Oh, shut up.
Brought you some more ice chips.
Okay, let's take a look, see how you're doing.
Oh, I'm a hot air balloon about to pop.
Must be 6 centimeters by now. 5 at least.
Mm. 4 and a smidge.
80% effaced.
You sure you know what you're doing down there?
You are doing great, Charlotte.
Of course she is.
Ugh.
Don't touch me.
What the hell are you still doing here?
Mason has a half day of school, remember?
You need to pick him up.
I asked Amelia to pick him up.
Oh, I'd rather she were here with me and you were with Mason.
You're the one who got me into this mess.
If Addison leaves a sharp instrument laying around,
I just might stab you with it.
May I go?
It's gonna be another four hours...
At least.
Oh.
All right.
I'll be back.
I need some more juice.
Okay.
I'll have Brenda get you some.
Why Brenda?
I-I've been here all night.
I'm off the clock in ten minutes.
Well...
I'm sure you have a big day planned.
So go ahead.
Enjoy it.
Matter of fact, why don't you knock off early?
Just because you're the best labor and delivery nurse in this hospital, and you've been with me all through my pregnancy, and I hired you, there is no reason you should be here to help me get to the end.
Not everyone's able to see things through.
One juice coming right up.
Subtle.
My middle name.
Hey.
Are the babies born yet?
Not yet.
It's gonna be a few more hours, which is making your mama extra cranky.
Hello.
Oh, hi.
Uh-huh.
Uh, today?
No, no, no.
It's great.
Yeah.
Bye.
What?
Okay.
I put an offer in on a house...
Did they counter?
How do you know about counteroffers?
Natalie's mom's a real estate agent.
The seller doesn't want any more money, but another family put in the same offer.
She wants to meet both families and then decide.
So it's like sudden death.
Yeah, but it's gonna be like my death, because they want to do it now, but I can't do it now because Charlotte's in labor.
But if we don't do it now, we're not gonna have a place for this enormous family to live.
This is called a lose-lose.
If I'm not there for the birth of my babies,
Charlotte's gonna string me up by my toes in the living room.
Our living room isn't big enough.
Which is why we need a house, Mason!
Dad, take a deep breath.
You're 10.
How'd you get so sensible?
Is the house near here?
It's not far.
All right.
Well, let's go win the house, then we'll go to the hospital and surprise mama.
Okay, if she yells at me...
I'm blaming you.
You know, you... you are one lucky lady, you know that?
You've got your entire life ahead of you.
One big blank slate.
I mean, I'm kind of envious of you.
You're brave, fearless.
I mean, you probably know what it took me years to figure out.
You gotta live your life to the fullest.
You can't be afraid to make mistakes.
And I'm trying to do that now.
I...
I just hope it's not too late.
Okay.
Good talk.
Thanks.
Hey.
Did Charlotte have the babies?
Not even close.
She must be pissed.
You have no idea.
I've been walking the halls with her, trying to move the labor along.
You're hanging out with her?
Of course.
She's my friend.
Oh.
I just figured being around her would be hard for you, because of your history.
Oh.
No.
No, I'm fine.
It's-it's okay.
Good.
Mm.
I'm glad.
That's good.
What?
Nothing.
I was just...
I'm glad to hear you're doing fine.
So then... do you ever think about...
I mean, not right now, but... do you want to have kids?
Dr. Peterson, you've got a head lac in curtain two.
Be right there.
Keep me posted about Charlotte?
Sure.
Yeah.
I have never once heard him say "quiet."
It's always "taciturn."
I caught him reading a dictionary in his office once.
An expansive vocabulary is the bedrock of sagacity.
Yes, but if you actually want people to understand you, you might have to dumb it down a bit.
Ooh.
I like her, Sheldon.
Where'd you two meet?
At a vending machine.
She was having trouble with a chocolate bar, and I assisted her.
That's true.
He was very chivalrous with some loose change.
Thank you.
Oh, looks delicious.
Tell me what I want to hear.
I know this has been unpleasant for you, but you are in the home stretch, and you've been... a real trooper these last several months.
I've been a trooper?
Honestly, no.
But I just wanted to say something nice to you.
You're at 6 centimeters.
Ugh.
I hate you.
Hey.
Shouldn't you be getting Henry ready?
I can't leave yet.
It's today?
Henry's adoption hearing?
Well, get the hell out.
Charlotte...
Don't "Charlotte" me.
First of all, Cooper's spawn aren't actually coming out until Henry's college graduation...
Charlotte, you are having your babies.
You are legally having your own baby today, too.
So go on.
Shoo.
All right, but if your labor starts to progress more rapidly...
I'll have Jake.
You didn't think you were both leaving, did you?
Of course not.
I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna walk Addison out.
So no swings or ice cream or pictures with the judge.
Well, we'll get the bailiff to take pictures with the judge, and there will be swings and ice cream, just later.
Listen, you have no idea how badly I wanted to be there, but we can't... we can't leave Charlotte with some poor, unsuspecting doctor.
She'll eat 'em alive.
I know.
I just...
I don't know.
I was just really looking forward to celebrating.
Well, listen, you and Henry and I have the rest of our lives to celebrate.
Your job right now is to go to court and bring back our son.
Jake... you just said "our son."
Damn right, I did.
Mm.
Go.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
Mm.
I shouldn't be surprised by his question.
I'm a woman.
I have the plumbing.
I love kids.
But what if my body only makes brainless babies?
I couldn't live through that again.
And even if I was lucky enough to have a healthy child,
I know things now.
It doesn't matter how fiercely you love someone.
It's not enough.
The world can be terrifying, and bad things happen that you're powerless to prevent.
I'm done.
I don't want to have any more babies.
Ugh.
They are unbelievable.
Treating my uterus like it's some kind of airport V.I.P. lounge.
So let's see what's going on.
Oh, I need some good news, Jake.
All right.
And you're at 7 centimeters.
Oh, nice.
We're getting closer.
Closer my ass.
Come on.
I'm desperate.
Can't you charm 'em out or somethin'?
They're girls.
Girls like you.
Just get down there and say whatever it is you say to women that gets 'em all in a tizzy.
Your boyfriend's lurking.
Oh, go.
But be back in 15 minutes.
Underneath that awful exterior, you really are just a softie, aren't you?
Shh.
If they hear you, they'll never mind me.
Okay.
Look...
I need you on your best behavior, okay?
Look interested, pay attention, and if the nice lady asks you any questions at all, you...
No eye rolling, grunting, or nodding.
Use my words.
I got this.
Okay, I know you got it.
It's just...
I really want to win, okay?
We are gonna win.
We're so much better than the other family.
Oh, I forgot.
What?
You need to...
Ohh, mother of God.
This is a bad one.
This is, uh, the double platinum of contractions.
Otherwise, I'd come help you.
I'm sorry.
I should be helping you.
I just...
I needed a place to hide.
I can't be crying in the middle of the hospital.
Oh, it's my hospital.
You can do whatever the...
Oh!
You can do whatever you damn well please.
It should be over in the next millennium, and I'll ask you what's wrong.
Oh, don't worry about me.
I'm fine.
I'm okay.
I just-I just can't...
I just can't stop crying.
Why won't it stop?
I've been asking my uterus that same thing, sister.
Aah!
Hello there, young man.
You must be Henry.
He is, Your Honor.
And this is Dr. Addison Forbes Montgomery, the adoptive parent.
Oh, I see you work at St. Ambrose, Dr. Montgomery.
That's right.
But not so much that it would be a problem for Henry.
I... sorry.
I'm...
I'm a little nervous.
No need.
Birth mother signed away parental rights.
Home visits completed.
What's going on?
Your honor?
Your social worker Mildred Clemons just faxed this letter.
It seems she has some concerns.
Wh-what concerns?
I don't understand.
I'm sorry, Dr. Montgomery.
I can't finalize Henry's adoption today.
I'm ordering further evaluation.
We'll set another court date, and I'll make a ruling then.
Wh-wh-what does that mean?
What just happened?
I don't know.
Normally this hearing is a formality.
Did something happen with Mildred?
No, I haven't seen her in months.
Was there anything unusual about her last visit?
No, no.
She-she just met with...
Jake.
Okay.
I'll talk to the judge and try and find out exactly what's going on and how we should proceed.
Wait, wait.
Is there a chance...
I mean, could I... could I lose Henry?
Try not to grow up too fast, okay?
Because little girls who grow up too fast end up running off with their college professors, which you and I both know is entirely inappropriate.
And we also know that cutting off communication with your father because he showed a little concern over your emotional well-being is, well... let's just say I'll be recommending a good private school to your mom and dad... one with only female teachers, possibly a convent.
It really is such an amazing home.
I just want whoever lives here next to cherish this place like we did, respect its history.
- Yeah.
- History's my favorite subject.
Do you know what started world war I?
Uh...
The assassination of Archiduke Ferdinand.
- And his wife Sophie.
- Oh.
You are so darling.
Hello?
Yoo-hoo.
Hi.
Dan and Darlene Meyer.
I know we're early, but we got a call to serve food at the mission later, and we just didn't want to miss this opportunity.
- We love this house.
- Ohh.
Well, this is Dr. Freedman and his son Mason.
- Hi.
Cooper Freedman.
- Hi.
- Hi, Mason.
- Hi.
They're the other family that's bidding on the house.
- Nice to meet you...
- Oh.
And your pie.
Apple pie?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, well...
It's not blueberry, but, you know...
Um...
So you're a doctor?
Yes.
Dr. Freedman.
Pediatrician.
Mm.
I just love helping children.
It's a calling, really.
Yeah, I was-I was premed.
Oh.
Yeah, but then I met Dan when we were volunteering at a women's shelter.
And I don't know.
Four years of medical school and internship, residency... it just felt like it would take too long to actually make a difference in the world.
Mm.
- You know?
- Yeah.
Well, that is so lovely.
Walter and I like to go to children's hospital on the weekends and visit with the kids.
So inspiring.
We help out with their annual fund-raiser.
Mm-hmm.
Oh.
Oh!
You are that Dan and Darlene Meyer?
- That's us.
- Guilty.
Oh.
I have seen your names on the program.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
You've gotta be kidding me.
Well... who would like a piece of pie?
- Thank you.
Oh, I would.
- Yes.
You know the one good thing about dying of cancer?
I don't have to worry about sunscreen anymore.
Oh, hilarious.
Yeah.
So lunch wasn't so bad, right?
Violet's great.
If all your friends are that great, it makes me feel bad that we're lying to them.
Well, we did meet at a vending machine, right?
I'm not lying to Violet.
Sheldon...
I don't know how much time I have left, and I want to know that you're gonna be okay when I'm gone.
So you gotta talk to someone.
You gotta tell them about the cancer and about me.
I'm not ready to think about you being gone.
They're your friends.
Just...
let them in.
Okay?
Ohh.
Amelia, go get Jake.
You don't need Jake.
I'll decide what I need.
I'm the one having the freakin' contraction.
Stephanie just checked you.
You're, like, 7 centimeters.
Big whoop.
You're like the uterus that cried wolf.
Your... bedside manner sucks.
My bedside manner is awesome.
You're just not having those babies anytime soon.
Come here.
Sit back.
Ooh.
My God.
How did you know?
Jake did this for me when I was in labor.
I'm sorry.
I didn't...
Just lean back.
Hey.
Violet?
Violet?
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, my gosh.
Ooh.
Sorry about that.
Sorry.
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
You sure?
Well, I normally go to Cooper for these sorts of things, but he's a little busy.
Well, I'm here.
Lay it on me.
Uh...
Well, I went to a-a bookstore this morning to get a present for the Cooplets, and, um, the owner of the bookstore was this very attractive man.
And, uh, he recognized me from my book.
Okay.
I wrote a book.
I don't get recognized very much, but, uh, it never gets old.
Right?
So he recognized me, and then he flirted with me.
Uh-oh.
And I...
I flirted...
I flirted back a little.
And then he asked me what happened to the guy in the book.
Pete.
And, Sam...
I forgot all about him.
For the three or four minutes I was flirting with this guy,
I just...
I forgot Pete ever existed.
I forgot he was dead.
I-I forgot-I forgot him.
Well, that's normal.
Right?
Isn't that a normal step in the grieving process?
Yeah.
Yeah.
But it was just so...
I mean, look,
Charlotte is having her babies today, and I was so happy for her.
I am.
I'm so happy for her and Cooper.
Mm-hmm.
But then I go to this bookstore, and I see my book about this super awesome time when a lady cut my baby out of my belly.
And then I remember Pete is dead.
And then I see you and Stephanie, and you guys are so sweet together.
And then Sheldon has found Miranda, and she's just lovely with him.
And then Addison and Jake, and it... everybody's living.
And I just keep having these waves where I start to cry and I can't stop.
And-and so I was at this bookstore with this attractive man.
And I had this moment, Sam, where I just...
I just knew...
I'm never gonna have another child.
My whole experience of having a child is Katie stealing my baby.
I'm never gonna get married again.
My entire experience of marriage was Pete, and that was so...
I mean, some of it was good, but most of it was pretty painful.
So that entire part of my life, it's... it's done.
And I want to forget him.
I was angry that I remembered him.
Because when I remember him, it feels like I'm dying, too.
So this is it.
This is my life.
This is who I am.
This is... this is all I get.
And I think, you know, is it... is it enough?
Is it anything?
Mm.
Well...
I don't know...
I don't know what to say.
I don't have anything to say.
I mean, instead of saying, you know, some random cliche...
How about I just give you a hug?
No, I-I, you know, I'm just gonna cry again.
Well, then I get cried on.
Come on.
Give me a hug.
Oh, wait a minute.
I think I do have something to say, and it's not random... or cliched.
You-you want to hear it?
Okay.
Okay.
You're not done.
All right?
You're-you're unfinished.
You're a work in progress.
I mean, if I had told you five years ago that you were gonna have Lucas the way that you did or that you were gonna marry Pete, you would've laughed in my face, right?
If I'd have told you two years ago that you'd be a widow, you would never have believed me.
Because you don't know what tomorrow brings.
You know, it could be anything.
I mean, absolutely anything.
It could be good.
It could be bad.
It, uh... it could be this hot bookstore owner guy or it could just be you and your amazing little boy.
But you don't know because you're not done.
I mean, you won't know the point of the book until it's written.
The-the book that is your life is a work in progress.
So you, Violet Turner, you're unfinished.
Yeah.
How was that?
That was really, really good.
Yes.
You should write a book.
What did you do?
I am Henry's mother.
You're not the problem.
It's your fiance that worries me.
He beat a man nearly to death.
A drug dealer.
When you feel threatened, you call 9-1-1.
Henry cannot live in an environment where violence is an acceptable solution.
Jake was trying to protect his family.
He's a good man.
He would never hurt anyone, Mildred.
Tell that to the man he threatened to kill.
No, no.
You misunderstood.
Jake's daughter is dating her much-older college professor, and he... he just got upset.
He was a good deal more than upset.
If this was an issue, why didn't you say something sooner?
Seeing you with Henry is what we dream about when we place children, so I approved the adoption.
But after meeting Dr. Reilly,
I thought I could get past my concerns.
I have to be dispassionate and consider what's best for the child.
I am what's best for Henry.
And if Henry were living with you alone,
I wouldn't have an objection.
Please.
I can't lose my son.
I'm sorry, Dr. Montgomery.
I've already made my recommendation.
Now it's up to the judge.
"And the brave prince"
"married the beautiful fairy princess,"
"and together, they lived happily ever after."
I know.
I should've read the blue one about the trains.
Fairy tales are just... well, they're just stupid, you know?
And people should not read them to their children.
It sets them up for false expectations.
It makes them think that happily ever after is the end of the story.
It's not like that, you know?
Real relationship stories... are messy.
Real relationship stories sometimes have a dead prince and a grieving princess who sobs in public.
And they don't end.
Sam says there's no ending, and I choose to believe him because a dead prince can't be the ending.
God, you are so tiny.
I hope you never know what I'm talking about.
I hope you never have a dead prince.
Ah!
Oh!
If you tell me I'm still at 7 centimeters,
I swear, I'll kill you.
Nope, you're at 10.
Page Addison, please.
You got it.
Wait.
This is it?
Yep.
If you feel like it...
Ah!
You can start to push.
Oh, I can't.
I need Coop.
Amelia...
I know.
- They're coming.
- I know.
Oh, where the freakin' hell is my husband?
I'll find him.
Oh.
Right from that first day, I knew that Darlene was the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.
Dr. Freedman, where did you meet your wife?
Wasn't it on a web site?
No.
No, we met at St. Ambrose hospital, where she is chief of staff.
Hmm, that can't be easy.
There's so much bureaucracy in the practice of medicine.
Yeah, and price gouging.
Price gouging?
Well, I'm sorry, Dr. Freedman.
Most people can't afford any kind of medical care.
Well, I treat my patients regardless.
But you don't practice for free, right?
Well, I save children.
Uh, would you like to hear about the schools in the neighborhood?
Amelia.
Okay.
We're on our way.
We gotta go.
But we're totally winning.
Sorry.
Um, look, I... really want to buy this house for my wife as a surprise because I love it, she would love it.
And she's been through so much and she really deserves it.
And Mason and my girls, they could have a happy life here.
But as much as I want to live in this amazing house,
I cannot be here right now, um, because my wife is in labor with triplets, and I have to be there with her, okay?
So I mean, family is everything.
If we end up living in a tent by the stream, as long as we're together, it's gonna be fine.
So it was nice to meet you...
But we gotta go.
Hey there.
You feel like having some babies?
- No.
Not without Cooper.
- He's on his way.
So how'd it go?
Was it, uh, was it amazing?
It was fine.
You don't look like it was fine.
Well, I have two babies to deliver, so if you could move...
Okay.
Oh, yeah.
These babies aren't waiting for their daddy.
- I need Cooper.
- Well, you're gonna feel better once you start pushing, Charlotte.
No, I can't do it without him.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Totally explain.
Shut the hell up and hold my hand.
Thank God.
My hand is numb.
All righty.
Here we go.
Give me a push.
Aah!
Charlotte's delivering, huh?
Finally.
She's been running Stephanie ragged all day.
So you and Stephanie are back on, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, good.
Good for you.
I'm seeing someone, too.
Her name is Miranda.
Oh, that's great, Sheldon.
Yeah.
Alright.
I met her at radiation.
I did eight weeks of treatment.
Now I gotta wait another six months before I know if it works, but, uh...
I'm hopeful.
How you feeling?
Pretty good for a guy whose prostate glows in the dark.
Well, I'm glad you got treatment.
Yeah, I have a friend who was a real pain in the ass about it.
So anyway, uh... thank you.
Ohh.
Okay, Charlotte, I need you to push.
Good.
Almost there.
Get them out!
You're so close.
Oh, don't tell me I'm close when I still got two babies inside me.
All right, Charlotte, I need you to keep pushing.
Now focus.
Aah!
Good.
Ohh.
Ohh.
She's crying.
She's okay?
She's perfect.
If this is, uh, if this is too hard for you...
No.
It's amazing.
Aah!
Ohh!
Something's not right.
Addison, talk to me.
I can't feel the head.
Is she in breech?
No, she's not upside down.
She's sideways.
Can you just do a C-section?
It is an option, but I still feel like
I can deliver vaginally.
There are significant risks.
The baby is transverse.
Yeah, but there's risks with any procedure, including C-section.
Look, Charlotte, your body's been through enough trauma and so have the babies.
I still think I can deliver by doing an internal podalic version.
What the hell is that?
She rotates the baby until she can grab a foot, and then she delivers her as a breech.
Wait.
Is that...
I mean, can you even do that?
Yes, Cooper.
I can do it.
And is it safe?
Cooper, you know they couldn't be in better hands.
Charlotte, it's easier on your body than surgery and it won't take very long, but it's gonna hurt like hell.
Okay.
Just get on with it.
Yeah?
All right.
Let's get her ready.
Okay.
I'll stabilize her legs.
Okay, now you can't push until I tell you, but you can scream.
And you can squeeze.
All right?
So on the count of three.
Mm-hmm.
One, two, three.
Squeeze.
Oh, God!
Ohh!
Aah!
Aah!
Almost there.
Almost there.
I can't.
It's too much.
Okay, listen to me.
Listen to me.
You can do this, okay?
You can.
- I just want it to be over.
- It's about to be over.
You are so strong.
Our girls are gonna be just like you.
So come on.
You gotta do this right now.
Your little girl wants to meet you, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
I've got the baby turned.
Just give me a push now.
Aah!
Good.
All right.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
- No more pushing.
No more pushing.
- Is that good?
She's got the body, okay?
But the head is still inside.
Just give her a minute, okay?
Please.
I'm so exhausted.
I know.
I know you are, but you're almost there.
Just a few more seconds.
Okay, now.
Push.
Aah!
Okay.
Okay.
Good.
I got her.
Oh, God.
Hi.
Hi, baby.
Let me see you.
- You want to cut the cord, Cooper?
- Yeah.
Hey, she's got your eyes.
Hi, sweetheart.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, baby girl.
Okay.
Okay.
Let me take her away now.
Oh.
There we go.
She wants her mama.
You got her?
Got her.
Hey.
So what happened in court?
Mildred happened.
At the last minute, she decided she couldn't...
She doesn't feel right about the adoption.
What?
I-I thought the hearing was just a formality.
Not anymore.
The judge decided he wanted to do further evaluation, and then he's going to decide... whether or not I get to keep my son.
I-I don't understand.
Why would she...
Oh, God.
No.
It's-it's me?
My arrest.
And the thing with Angela.
Oh, Addison.
I'm so...
I'm so sorry.
Hey.
Don't.
Okay?
I just...
right now, I-I can't.
I just...
I know that this is... this is not your fault.
I know that, but... the judge could take Henry from me, and...
I can't.
Charlotte had the babies.
That's great.
Is everybody okay?
They're amazing.
They're perfect.
Hey, hey, hey.
Wh-what's...
what's going on?
- Yes.
- What?
The answer to your question is yes, I want babies.
I want a lot of babies.
And I'm really scared to want babies, so I-I told myself that I didn't, but I do.
Because it's a miracle.
And I really...
I really need a miracle.
So, yes, someday I want to have babies with you.
Someday.
If we get that far.
We'll get that far.
You came back for your basket.
I came back for my basket.
I'm glad.
Oh...
Wow.
I added some extra books... uh, no charge... just to fill it out a little bit.
And then there's some books every child should have, so I threw those in, too.
You-you didn't have to...
it's... it's beautiful.
Thanks.
I felt bad.
I made you feel sad, and I didn't mean to.
No, no, no, it wasn't you.
It was just... it was me.
Okay.
You were actually being really kind.
So would you like to get a cup of coffee sometime or-or a drink?
I can't go out with you.
I don't want to.
Okay.
I mean, no, it's not you.
I mean, you're lovely.
And I think if I was gonna go out with anybody, it would probably be you, but...
But?
But I'm...
I'm trying to be okay with just me right now.
And I don't wanna mess that up or cloud it or...
I understand.
You do?
I read your book five times.
And you're a very good writer, so I understand perfectly.
We'll be friends.
All right.
Yeah, we'll be friends.
And thank you.
You know what?
I'm gonna write another book.
I just decided.
And you helped me decide, so thank you.
Well, congratulations.
- What are you gonna call it?
- What?
The book.
What's its title?
Oh.
Uh, I don't know yet.
It's, uh, it's a work in progress.
Well, good luck.
Thank you.
Judge Harris, my name is Dr. Jake Reilly.
I'm engaged to...
Dr. Addison Forbes Montgomery.
I know who you are.
And I know why you're here.
But I haven't made my decision.
You can't decide what's best for Henry without the facts.
I have them, in a nice big red file.
That's not the whole story.
You can only get that from me.
30 seconds.
Lily, my wife, my... my late wife, was an addict.
She had a daughter...
Angela...
who became our daughter.
Lily's dealer was as close to the devil as... he would kill for money.
He would... he would kill for nothing.
And I had to protect my family, my... my child.
And all these years later?
I'm still protecting my child.
When you have a kid, it's-it's for life.
Doesn't matter how old they are.
I was trying to protect Angela, and I would do the same for Henry.
Consider yourself heard.
I'll leave her.
Addison loves that baby.
She... she loves Henry more than anything in the world, and I love her maybe even more than that, so if you're going to break them apart, then I'll leave her.
I'll walk away.
But they need to be together.
She's his mother.
How about Caroline?
Was that on the board?
No, but...
I think that's her name.
I love it.
Hi.
Addison says Georgia is well enough for a visit.
Hello, precious girl.
Look.
It's mama.
Hi, sweet girl.
Georgia, this is Caroline.
Say hi.
Is that all right?
Come here.
Thank you, daddy.
That is... that is perfect.
That leaves only one unnamed king-Freedman.
What will we call our little breech baby?
Rachel?
Georgia,
Caroline, Rachel.
Oh, I love it.
Oh, my God!
Cooper.
Oh!
We got the house.
What?
What house?
The perfect house.
Dad wanted to surprise you, but he didn't think we would get it.
So we had to beat the other couple even though they were perfect, and it's ours.
Oh, my God.
I bought a house.
We got a house.
I am sorry to break up the party, but we've gotta take the babies back to the nursery now.
Oh, can't we have 'em just a little longer?
Preemies need to be monitored.
And you'll see them again first thing in the morning.
They need to sleep right now, as do I.
We bought a house.
Well done, daddy.
Well, this has been a good day.
Your mom and dad officially have four kids.
I only want one.
I only want Henry.
I can't blame Mildred for wanting what's best for Henry.
We're both on the same side there.
But she's wrong about Jake.
Jake is... the best man I've ever known.
He... is the man of my dreams.
Oh, yes, little one.
Yeah.
I'm afraid the judge is gonna make me choose between my love for Jake and my love for Henry, but...
If that happens... there is no choice.
So... when do you want to get married?
Jake, were you not listening to me?
We can't get married.
We can't do anything.
The judge said...
I know what the judge said.
I just came from his chambers.
What... wait.
What?
We had a little talk.
Turns out he's got four daughters.
He told me to give this to you.
He's mine?
Henry's mine.
It's official.
It's official.
So... when do you want to get married?
Hmm?
Good morning, Georgia.
So it's a big day.
It's a big, big day.
Um, your sisters are coming.
So I won't be around as much as usual because I'm gonna be helping your mama.
But I'm gonna make sure that your aunts and uncles stop by to see you.
So if you need anything, you know, just ask, okay?
The babies are okay?
I got the NICU on standby.
Babies are fine.
Nobody needs to worry.
You know, they're still premature.
Yeah, but multiples usually are.
I mean, they're healthy enough for delivery now.
They're just not in any rush, you know?
We don't want to hurry things along with early babies.
- So how long?
- Well, she's at 4 centimeters now, and she can't push until she's at 10, so she could be in labor for another day.
Ooh.
Ooh.
Oh, God help us all.
Look on the bright side.
More time to vote on names.
Would you put Zoe on that board?
No, do not put Zoe on the board.
Wait.
Don't cross out Hannah.
I like Hannah.
"Hannah and her sisters"?
There'd be no end to the merciless teasing.
By whom, all the die-hard Woody Allen fans in preschool?
Someone put Autumn and Summer up there?
Come on, guys.
We're better than this.
With names like that, it's hard to keep your daughter off the pole.
Hey!
The only people who can vote on a name are Mason and those who provided genetic material.
So unless one of you looky-loos knows a way to fast-track this delivery, get the hell outta here.
Thanks.
Hi.
Can you make me some kind of basket with all these books and, I don't know, some little stuffed animal or something?
A gift basket... can you do that?
I'm the owner.
I can do whatever.
Whose the lucky baby?
They're triplets.
My best friend.
He's hav... well, his wife is having triplets.
Is there a total or...
Wait.
This is you.
Yes, it is.
Will you sign it?
Sure.
You must have an amazing memory for faces.
No.
I've, um... read the book five times.
It's incredible.
A real honest memoir.
It felt like poetry.
And I used to look at your picture on the back because, uh...
The scar, I know.
Everybody always looks at the scar.
No, it's... just that, after all you've been through, there was just... such a light in your eyes.
You were so beautiful.
Are so beautiful.
Wow.
Well, thank you.
Charles.
Thank you, Charles.
Your total...
Can I ask you, the...
the husband that was in the book, are you and he still...
He's-he's dead.
I'm sorry for your loss.
I'm...
I'm gonna come back and...
and, uh, pick this up later.
So if you just want to put it into a basket,
I'll-I'll pick it up later.
Happy formal adoption hearing day.
And, yes, I get why there's no greeting card for that one.
Thank you.
So listen, I've got two more patients, and then I'm clear for the rest of the day.
Should Henry and I come by here and pick you up?
Well, actually, I was gonna go home and get him ready, but that depends on Charlotte.
Her babies are taking their sweet time.
Okay.
Well, when we're done with court, why don't we go to the park?
I think swings and ice cream is a perfect way to celebrate.
I've got a camera in the car.
The judge can take some pictures for us.
Mm.
What's that for?
For loving Henry... and me.
Thank you.
Good.
Breathe.
Shut...
Focus through it.
Oh, shut up.
Brought you some more ice chips.
Okay, let's take a look, see how you're doing.
Oh, I'm a hot air balloon about to pop.
Must be 6 centimeters by now. 5 at least.
Mm. 4 and a smidge.
80% effaced.
You sure you know what you're doing down there?
You are doing great, Charlotte.
Of course she is.
Ugh.
Don't touch me.
What the hell are you still doing here?
Mason has a half day of school, remember?
You need to pick him up.
I asked Amelia to pick him up.
Oh, I'd rather she were here with me and you were with Mason.
You're the one who got me into this mess.
If Addison leaves a sharp instrument laying around,
I just might stab you with it.
May I go?
It's gonna be another four hours...
At least.
Oh.
All right.
I'll be back.
Why Brenda?
I-I've been here all night.
I'm off the clock in ten minutes.
Well...
I'm sure you have a big day planned.
So go ahead.
Enjoy it.
Matter of fact, why don't you knock off early?
Just because you're the best labor and delivery nurse in this hospital, and you've been with me all through my pregnancy, and I hired you, there is no reason you should be here to help me get to the end.
Not everyone's able to see things through.
One juice coming right up.
Subtle.
My middle name.
Hey.
Are the babies born yet?
Not yet.
It's gonna be a few more hours, which is making your mama extra cranky.
Hello.
Oh, hi.
Uh-huh.
Uh, today?
No, no, no.
It's great.
Yeah.
Bye.
What?
Okay.
I put an offer in on a house...
Did they counter?
How do you know about counteroffers?
Natalie's mom's a real estate agent.
The seller doesn't want any more money, but another family put in the same offer.
She wants to meet both families and then decide.
So it's like sudden death.
Yeah, but it's gonna be like my death, because they want to do it now, but I can't do it now because Charlotte's in labor.
But if we don't do it now, we're not gonna have a place for this enormous family to live.
This is called a lose-lose.
If I'm not there for the birth of my babies,
Charlotte's gonna string me up by my toes in the living room.
Our living room isn't big enough.
Which is why we need a house, Mason!
Dad, take a deep breath.
You're 10.
How'd you get so sensible?
Is the house near here?
It's not far.
All right.
Well, let's go win the house, then we'll go to the hospital and surprise mama.
Okay, if she yells at me...
I'm blaming you.
You know, you... you are one lucky lady, you know that?
You've got your entire life ahead of you.
One big blank slate.
I mean, I'm kind of envious of you.
You're brave, fearless.
I mean, you probably know what it took me years to figure out.
You gotta live your life to the fullest.
You can't be afraid to make mistakes.
And I'm trying to do that now.
I...
I just hope it's not too late.
Okay.
Good talk.
Thanks.
Hey.
Did Charlotte have the babies?
Not even close.
She must be pissed.
You have no idea.
I've been walking the halls with her, trying to move the labor along.
You're hanging out with her?
Of course.
She's my friend.
Oh.
I just figured being around her would be hard for you, because of your history.
Oh.
No.
No, I'm fine.
It's-it's okay.
Good.
Mm.
I'm glad.
That's good.
What?
Nothing.
I was just...
I'm glad to hear you're doing fine.
So then... do you ever think about...
I mean, not right now, but... do you want to have kids?
Dr. Peterson, you've got a head lac in curtain two.
Be right there.
Keep me posted about Charlotte?
Sure.
Yeah.
I have never once heard him say "quiet."
It's always "taciturn."
I caught him reading a dictionary in his office once.
An expansive vocabulary is the bedrock of sagacity.
Yes, but if you actually want people to understand you, you might have to dumb it down a bit.
Ooh.
I like her, Sheldon.
Where'd you two meet?
At a vending machine.
She was having trouble with a chocolate bar, and I assisted her.
That's true.
He was very chivalrous with some loose change.
Thank you.
Oh, looks delicious.
Tell me what I want to hear.
I know this has been unpleasant for you, but you are in the home stretch, and you've been... a real trooper these last several months.
I've been a trooper?
Honestly, no.
But I just wanted to say something nice to you.
You're at 6 centimeters.
Ugh.
I hate you.
Hey.
Shouldn't you be getting Henry ready?
I can't leave yet.
It's today?
Henry's adoption hearing?
Well, get the hell out.
Charlotte...
Don't "Charlotte" me.
First of all, Cooper's spawn aren't actually coming out until Henry's college graduation...
Charlotte, you are having your babies.
You are legally having your own baby today, too.
So go on.
Shoo.
All right, but if your labor starts to progress more rapidly...
I'll have Jake.
You didn't think you were both leaving, did you?
Of course not.
I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna walk Addison out.
So no swings or ice cream or pictures with the judge.
Well, we'll get the bailiff to take pictures with the judge, and there will be swings and ice cream, just later.
Listen, you have no idea how badly I wanted to be there, but we can't... we can't leave Charlotte with some poor, unsuspecting doctor.
She'll eat 'em alive.
I know.
I just...
I don't know.
I was just really looking forward to celebrating.
Well, listen, you and Henry and I have the rest of our lives to celebrate.
Your job right now is to go to court and bring back our son.
Jake... you just said "our son."
Damn right, I did.
Mm.
Go.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
Mm.
I shouldn't be surprised by his question.
I'm a woman.
I have the plumbing.
I love kids.
But what if my body only makes brainless babies?
I couldn't live through that again.
And even if I was lucky enough to have a healthy child,
I know things now.
It doesn't matter how fiercely you love someone.
It's not enough.
The world can be terrifying, and bad things happen that you're powerless to prevent.
I'm done.
I don't want to have any more babies.
Ugh.
They are unbelievable.
Treating my uterus like it's some kind of airport V.I.P. lounge.
So let's see what's going on.
Oh, I need some good news, Jake.
All right.
And you're at 7 centimeters.
Oh, nice.
We're getting closer.
Closer my ass.
Come on.
I'm desperate.
Can't you charm 'em out or somethin'?
They're girls.
Girls like you.
Just get down there and say whatever it is you say to women that gets 'em all in a tizzy.
Your boyfriend's lurking.
Oh, go.
But be back in 15 minutes.
Underneath that awful exterior, you really are just a softie, aren't you?
Shh.
If they hear you, they'll never mind me.
Okay.
Look...
I need you on your best behavior, okay?
Look interested, pay attention, and if the nice lady asks you any questions at all, you...
No eye rolling, grunting, or nodding.
Use my words.
I got this.
Okay, I know you got it.
It's just...
I really want to win, okay?
We are gonna win.
We're so much better than the other family.
Oh, I forgot.
What?
You need to...
Ohh, mother of God.
This is a bad one.
This is, uh, the double platinum of contractions.
Otherwise, I'd come help you.
I'm sorry.
I should be helping you.
I just...
I needed a place to hide.
I can't be crying in the middle of the hospital.
Oh, it's my hospital.
You can do whatever the...
Oh!
You can do whatever you damn well please.
It should be over in the next millennium, and I'll ask you what's wrong.
Oh, don't worry about me.
I'm fine.
I'm okay.
I just-I just can't...
I just can't stop crying.
Why won't it stop?
I've been asking my uterus that same thing, sister.
Aah!
Hello there, young man.
You must be Henry.
He is, your honor.
And this is Dr. Addison Forbes Montgomery, the adoptive parent.
Oh, I see you work at St. Ambrose, Dr. Montgomery.
That's right.
But not so much that it would be a problem for Henry.
I... sorry.
I'm...
I'm a little nervous.
No need.
Birth mother signed away parental rights.
Home visits completed.
What's going on?
Your honor?
Your social worker Mildred Clemons just faxed this letter.
It seems she has some concerns.
Wh-what concerns?
I don't understand.
I'm sorry, Dr. Montgomery.
I can't finalize Henry's adoption today.
I'm ordering further evaluation.
We'll set another court date, and I'll make a ruling then.
Wh-wh-what does that mean?
What just happened?
I don't know.
Normally this hearing is a formality.
Did something happen with Mildred?
No, I haven't seen her in months.
Was there anything unusual about her last visit?
No, no.
She-she just met with...
Jake.
Okay.
I'll talk to the judge and try and find out exactly what's going on and how we should proceed.
Wait, wait.
Is there a chance...
I mean, could I... could I lose Henry?
Try not to grow up too fast, okay?
Because little girls who grow up too fast end up running off with their college professors, which you and I both know is entirely inappropriate.
And we also know that cutting off communication with your father because he showed a little concern over your emotional well-being is, well... let's just say I'll be recommending a good private school to your mom and dad... one with only female teachers, possibly a convent.
It really is such an amazing home.
I just want whoever lives here next to cherish this place like we did, respect its history.
- Yeah.
- History's my favorite subject.
Do you know what started world war I?
Uh...
The assassination of Archiduke Ferdinand.
- And his wife Sophie.
- Oh.
You are so darling.
Hello?
Yoo-hoo.
Hi.
Dan and Darlene Meyer.
I know we're early, but we got a call to serve food at the mission later, and we just didn't want to miss this opportunity.
- We love this house.
- Ohh.
Well, this is Dr. Freedman and his son Mason.
- Hi.
Cooper Freedman.
- Hi.
- Hi, Mason.
- Hi.
They're the other family that's bidding on the house.
Nice to meet you...
- Oh.
And your pie.
Apple pie?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, well...
It's not blueberry, but, you know...
Um...
So you're a doctor?
Yes.
Dr. Freedman.
Pediatrician.
Mm.
I just love helping children.
It's a calling, really.
Yeah, I was-I was premed.
Oh.
Yeah, but then I met Dan when we were volunteering at a women's shelter.
And I don't know.
Four years of medical school and internship, residency... it just felt like it would take too long to actually make a difference in the world.
Mm.
- You know?
- Yeah.
Well, that is so lovely.
Walter and I like to go to children's hospital on the weekends and visit with the kids.
So inspiring.
We help out with their annual fund-raiser.
Mm-hmm.
Oh.
Oh!
You are that Dan and Darlene Meyer?
- That's us.
- Guilty.
Oh.
I have seen your names on the program.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
You've gotta be kidding me.
Well... who would like a piece of pie?
- Thank you.
Oh, I would.
- Yes.
You know the one good thing about dying of cancer?
I don't have to worry about sunscreen anymore.
Oh, hilarious.
Yeah.
So lunch wasn't so bad, right?
Violet's great.
If all your friends are that great, it makes me feel bad that we're lying to them.
Well, we did meet at a vending machine, right?
I'm not lying to Violet.
Sheldon...
I don't know how much time I have left, and I want to know that you're gonna be okay when I'm gone.
So you gotta talk to someone.
You gotta tell them about the cancer and about me.
I'm not ready to think about you being gone.
They're your friends.
Just...
let them in.
Okay?
Ohh.
Amelia, go get Jake.
You don't need Jake.
I'll decide what I need.
I'm the one having the freakin' contraction.
Stephanie just checked you.
You're, like, 7 centimeters.
Big whoop.
You're like the uterus that cried wolf.
Your... bedside manner sucks.
My bedside manner is awesome.
You're just not having those babies anytime soon.
Come here.
Sit back.
Ooh.
My God.
How did you know?
Jake did this for me when I was in labor.
I'm sorry.
I didn't...
Just lean back.
Hey.
Violet?
Violet?
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, my gosh.
Ooh.
Sorry about that.
Sorry.
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
You sure?
Well, I normally go to Cooper for these sorts of things, but he's a little busy.
Well, I'm here.
Lay it on me.
Uh...
Well, I went to a-a bookstore this morning to get a present for the Cooplets, and, um, the owner of the bookstore was this very attractive man.
And, uh, he recognized me from my book.
Okay.
I wrote a book.
I don't get recognized very much, but, uh, it never gets old.
Right?
So he recognized me, and then he flirted with me.
Uh-oh.
And I...
I flirted...
I flirted back a little.
And then he asked me what happened to the guy in the book.
Pete.
And, Sam...
I forgot all about him.
For the three or four minutes I was flirting with this guy,
I just...
I forgot Pete ever existed.
I forgot he was dead.
I-I forgot-I forgot him.
Well, that's normal.
Right?
Isn't that a normal step in the grieving process?
Yeah.
Yeah.
But it was just so...
I mean, look,
Charlotte is having her babies today, and I was so happy for her.
I am.
I'm so happy for her and Cooper.
Mm-hmm.
But then I go to this bookstore, and I see my book about this super awesome time when a lady cut my baby out of my belly.
And then I remember Pete is dead.
And then I see you and Stephanie, and you guys are so sweet together.
And then Sheldon has found Miranda, and she's just lovely with him.
And then Addison and Jake, and it... everybody's living.
And I just keep having these waves where I start to cry and I can't stop.
And-and so I was at this bookstore with this attractive man.
And I had this moment, Sam, where I just...
I just knew...
I'm never gonna have another child.
My whole experience of having a child is Katie stealing my baby.
I'm never gonna get married again.
My entire experience of marriage was Pete, and that was so...
I mean, some of it was good, but most of it was pretty painful.
So that entire part of my life, it's... it's done.
And I want to forget him.
I was angry that I remembered him.
Because when I remember him, it feels like I'm dying, too.
So this is it.
This is my life.
This is who I am.
This is... this is all I get.
And I think, you know, is it... is it enough?
Is it anything?
Mm.
Well...
I don't know...
I don't know what to say.
I don't have anything to say.
I mean, instead of saying, you know, some random cliche...
How about I just give you a hug?
No, I-I, you know, I'm just gonna cry again.
Well, then I get cried on.
Come on.
Give me a hug.
Oh, wait a minute.
I think I do have something to say, and it's not random... or cliched.
You-you want to hear it?
Okay.
Okay.
You're not done.
All right?
You're-you're unfinished.
You're a work in progress.
I mean, if I had told you five years ago that you were gonna have Lucas the way that you did or that you were gonna marry Pete, you would've laughed in my face, right?
If I'd have told you two years ago that you'd be a widow, you would never have believed me.
Because you don't know what tomorrow brings.
You know, it could be anything.
I mean, absolutely anything.
It could be good.
It could be bad.
It, uh... it could be this hot bookstore owner guy or it could just be you and your amazing little boy.
But you don't know because you're not done.
I mean, you won't know the point of the book until it's written.
The-the book that is your life is a work in progress.
So you, Violet Turner, you're unfinished.
Yeah.
How was that?
That was really, really good.
Yes.
You should write a book.
What did you do?
I am Henry's mother.
You're not the problem.
It's your fiance that worries me.
He beat a man nearly to death.
A drug dealer.
When you feel threatened, you call 9-1-1.
Henry cannot live in an environment where violence is an acceptable solution.
Jake was trying to protect his family.
He's a good man.
He would never hurt anyone, Mildred.
Tell that to the man he threatened to kill.
No, no.
You misunderstood.
Jake's daughter is dating her much-older college professor, and he... he just got upset.
He was a good deal more than upset.
If this was an issue, why didn't you say something sooner?
Seeing you with Henry is what we dream about when we place children, so I approved the adoption.
But after meeting Dr. Reilly,
I thought I could get past my concerns.
I have to be dispassionate and consider what's best for the child.
I am what's best for Henry.
And if Henry were living with you alone,
I wouldn't have an objection.
(Voice breaking) Please.
I can't lose my son.
I'm sorry, Dr. Montgomery.
I've already made my recommendation.
Now it's up to the judge.
"And the brave prince"
"married the beautiful fairy princess,"
"and together, they lived happily ever after."
I know.
I should've read the blue one about the trains.
Fairy tales are just... well, they're just stupid, you know?
And people should not read them to their children.
It sets them up for false expectations.
It makes them think that happily ever after is the end of the story.
It's not like that, you know?
Real relationship stories... are messy.
Real relationship stories sometimes have a dead prince and a grieving princess who sobs in public.
And they don't end.
Sam says there's no ending, and I choose to believe him because a dead prince can't be the ending.
God, you are so tiny.
I hope you never know what I'm talking about.
I hope you never have a dead prince.
Ah!
Oh!
If you tell me I'm still at 7 centimeters,
I swear, I'll kill you.
Nope, you're at 10.
Page Addison, please.
You got it.
Wait.
This is it?
Yep.
If you feel like it...
Ah!
You can start to push.
Oh, I can't.
I need Coop.
Amelia...
I know.
- They're coming.
- I know.
Oh, where the freakin' hell is my husband?
I'll find him.
Oh.
Right from that first day, I knew that Darlene was the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.
Dr. Freedman, where did you meet your wife?
Wasn't it on a web site?
No.
No, we met at St. Ambrose hospital, where she is chief of staff.
Hmm, that can't be easy.
There's so much bureaucracy in the practice of medicine.
Yeah, and price gouging.
Price gouging?
Well, I'm sorry, Dr. Freedman.
Most people can't afford any kind of medical care.
Well, I treat my patients regardless.
But you don't practice for free, right?
Well, I save children.
Uh, would you like to hear about the schools in the neighborhood?
Amelia.
Okay.
We're on our way.
We gotta go.
But we're totally winning.
Sorry.
Um, look, I... really want to buy this house for my wife as a surprise because I love it, she would love it.
And she's been through so much and she really deserves it.
And Mason and my girls, they could have a happy life here.
But as much as I want to live in this amazing house,
I cannot be here right now, um, because my wife is in labor with triplets, and I have to be there with her, okay?
So I mean, family is everything.
If we end up living in a tent by the stream, as long as we're together, it's gonna be fine.
So it was nice to meet you...
But we gotta go.
Hey there.
You feel like having some babies?
- No.
Not without Cooper.
- He's on his way.
So how'd it go?
Was it, uh, was it amazing?
It was fine.
You don't look like it was fine.
Well, I have two babies to deliver, so if you could move...
Okay.
Oh, yeah.
These babies aren't waiting for their daddy.
- I need Cooper.
- Well, you're gonna feel better once you start pushing, Charlotte.
No, I can't do it without him.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Totally explain.
Shut the hell up and hold my hand.
Thank God.
My hand is numb. (Exhales)
All righty.
Here we go.
Give me a push.
Aah!
Charlotte's delivering, huh?
Finally.
She's been running Stephanie ragged all day.
So you and Stephanie are back on, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, good.
Good for you.
I'm seeing someone, too.
Her name is Miranda.
Oh, that's great, Sheldon.
Yeah.
Alright.
I met her at radiation.
I did eight weeks of treatment.
Now I gotta wait another six months before I know if it works, but, uh...
I'm hopeful.
How you feeling?
Pretty good for a guy whose prostate glows in the dark.
Well, I'm glad you got treatment.
Yeah, I have a friend who was a real pain in the ass about it.
So anyway, uh... thank you.
Ohh.
Okay, Charlotte, I need you to push.
Good.
Almost there.
Get them out!
You're so close.
Oh, don't tell me I'm close when I still got two babies inside me.
All right, Charlotte, I need you to keep pushing.
Now focus.
Aah!
Good.
Ohh.
Ohh.
She's crying.
She's okay?
She's perfect.
If this is, uh, if this is too hard for you...
No.
It's amazing.
Aah!
Ohh!
Something's not right.
Addison, talk to me.
I can't feel the head.
Is she in breech?
No, she's not upside down.
She's sideways.
Can you just do a C-section?
It is an option, but I still feel like
I can deliver vaginally.
There are significant risks.
The baby is transverse.
Yeah, but there's risks with any procedure, including C-section.
Look, Charlotte, your body's been through enough trauma and so have the babies.
I still think I can deliver by doing an internal podalic version.
What the hell is that?
She rotates the baby until she can grab a foot, and then she delivers her as a breech.
Wait.
Is that...
I mean, can you even do that?
Yes, Cooper.
I can do it.
And is it safe?
Cooper, you know they couldn't be in better hands.
Charlotte, it's easier on your body than surgery and it won't take very long, but it's gonna hurt like hell.
Okay.
Just get on with it.
Yeah?
All right.
Let's get her ready.
Okay.
I'll stabilize her legs.
Okay, now you can't push until I tell you, but you can scream.
And you can squeeze.
All right?
So on the count of three.
Mm-hmm.
One, two, three.
Squeeze.
Oh, God!
Ohh!
Aah!
Aah!
Almost there.
Almost there.
I can't.
It's too much.
Okay, listen to me.
Listen to me.
You can do this, okay?
You can.
- I just want it to be over.
- It's about to be over.
You are so strong.
Our girls are gonna be just like you.
So come on.
You gotta do this right now.
Your little girl wants to meet you, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
I've got the baby turned.
Just give me a push now.
Aah!
Good.
All right.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
- No more pushing.
No more pushing.
- Is that good?
She's got the body, okay?
But the head is still inside.
Just give her a minute, okay?
Please.
I'm so exhausted.
I know.
I know you are, but you're almost there.
Just a few more seconds.
Okay, now.
Push.
Aah!
Okay.
Okay.
Good.
I got her.
Oh, God.
Hi.
Hi, baby.
Let me see you.
- You want to cut the cord, Cooper?
- Yeah.
Hey, she's got your eyes.
Hi, sweetheart.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, baby girl.
Okay.
Okay.
Let me take her away now.
Oh.
There we go.
She wants her mama.
You got her?
Got her.
Hey.
So what happened in court?
Mildred happened.
At the last minute, she decided she couldn't...
She doesn't feel right about the adoption.
What?
I-I thought the hearing was just a formality.
Not anymore.
The judge decided he wanted to do further evaluation, and then he's going to decide... whether or not I get to keep my son.
I-I don't understand.
Why would she...
Oh, God.
No.
It's-it's me?
My arrest.
And the thing with Angela.
Oh, Addison.
I'm so...
I'm so sorry.
Hey.
Don't.
Okay?
I just...
right now, I-I can't.
I just...
I know that this is...
this is not your fault.
I know that, but... the judge could take Henry from me, and... (Voice breaks) I can't.
Charlotte had the babies.
That's great.
Is everybody okay?
They're amazing.
They're perfect.
Hey, hey, hey.
Wh-what's... what's going on?
- Yes.
- What?
The answer to your question is yes, I want babies.
I want a lot of babies.
And I'm really scared to want babies, so I-I told myself that I didn't, but I do.
Because it's a miracle.
And I really...
I really need a miracle.
So, yes, someday I want to have babies with you.
Someday.
If we get that far.
We'll get that far.
You came back for your basket.
I came back for my basket.
I'm glad.
Oh...
Wow.
I added some extra books... uh, no charge... just to fill it out a little bit.
And then there's some books every child should have, so I threw those in, too.
You-you didn't have to... it's...
it's beautiful.
Thanks.
I felt bad.
I made you feel sad, and I didn't mean to.
No, no, no, it wasn't you.
It was just... it was me.
Okay.
You were actually being really kind.
So would you like to get a cup of coffee sometime or-or a drink?
I can't go out with you.
I don't want to.
Okay.
I mean, no, it's not you.
I mean, you're lovely.
And I think if I was gonna go out with anybody, it would probably be you, but...
But?
But I'm...
I'm trying to be okay with just me right now.
And I don't wanna mess that up or cloud it or...
I understand.
You do?
I read your book five times.
And you're a very good writer, so I understand perfectly.
We'll be friends.
All right.
Yeah, we'll be friends.
And thank you.
You know what?
I'm gonna write another book.
I just decided.
And you helped me decide, so thank you.
Well, congratulations.
- What are you gonna call it?
- What?
The book.
What's its title?
Oh.
Uh, I don't know yet.
It's, uh, it's a work in progress.
Well, good luck.
Thank you.
Judge Harris, my name is Dr. Jake Reilly.
I'm engaged to...
Dr. Addison Forbes Montgomery.
I know who you are.
And I know why you're here.
But I haven't made my decision.
You can't decide what's best for Henry without the facts.
I have them, in a nice big red file.
That's not the whole story.
You can only get that from me.
30 seconds.
Lily, my wife, my... my late wife, was an addict.
She had a daughter...
Angela...
who became our daughter.
Lily's dealer was as close to the devil as... he would kill for money.
He would... he would kill for nothing.
And I had to protect my family, my... my child.
And all these years later?
I'm still protecting my child.
When you have a kid, it's-it's for life.
Doesn't matter how old they are.
I was trying to protect Angela, and I would do the same for Henry.
Consider yourself heard.
I'll leave her.
Addison loves that baby.
She... she loves Henry more than anything in the world, and I love her maybe even more than that, so if you're going to break them apart, then I'll leave her.
I'll walk away.
But they need to be together.
She's his mother.
How about Caroline?
Was that on the board?
No, but...
I think that's her name.
I love it.
Hi.
Addison says Georgia is well enough for a visit.
Hello, precious girl.
Look.
It's mama.
Hi, sweet girl.
Georgia, this is Caroline.
Say hi.
Is that all right?
Come here.
Thank you, daddy.
That is... that is perfect.
That leaves only one unnamed king-Freedman.
What will we call our little breech baby?
Rachel?
Georgia,
Caroline, Rachel.
Oh, I love it.
Oh, my God!
Cooper.
Oh!
We got the house.
What?
What house?
The perfect house.
Dad wanted to surprise you, but he didn't think we would get it.
So we had to beat the other couple even though they were perfect, and it's ours.
Oh, my God.
I bought a house.
We got a house.
I am sorry to break up the party, but we've gotta take the babies back to the nursery now.
Oh, can't we have 'em just a little longer?
Preemies need to be monitored.
And you'll see them again first thing in the morning.
They need to sleep right now, as do I.
We bought a house.
Well done, daddy.
Well, this has been a good day.
Your mom and dad officially have four kids.
I only want one.
I only want Henry.
I can't blame Mildred for wanting what's best for Henry.
We're both on the same side there.
But she's wrong about Jake.
Jake is... the best man I've ever known.
He... is the man of my dreams.
Oh, yes, little one.
Yeah.
d The fullness in her stare d
I'm afraid the judge is gonna make me choose between my love for Jake and my love for Henry, but...
If that happens... there is no choice.
So... when do you want to get married?
Jake, were you not listening to me?
We can't get married.
We can't do anything.
The judge said...
I know what the judge said.
I just came from his chambers.
What... wait.
What?
We had a little talk.
Turns out he's got four daughters.
He told me to give this to you.
d
He's mine?
Henry's mine.
It's official.
It's official.
So... when do you want to get married?
Hmm?
We're going on NH4!
Because that's the shortest route from Chennai to Bangalore.
Hoskote junction, very important junction in this route.
Because this is 3 way exit point to cross Bangalore.
If we take right, we can reach Hosur, Tamil Nadu via Malur.
If they know we're taking the road, they'll block all the roads.
They'll not leave any vehicle, they'll check bikes, cars and bus.
It'll be very difficult to get out of Bangalore.
But I'm sure they'll not search in the bus to small town Chinthamani.
We can safely reach Hoskote from Bangalore.
From there straight to Palamaner, Andhra Pradesh.
Buddy, we mustn't spare him, we must give him double what we got.
It's easy for us to bring her after the last exam.
After that she'll not be in Bangalore.
I'll go to rest room.
The door isn't opening.
- What happened?
It's latched from inside.
- ls it?
Please step aside.
They broke the window and kidnapped madam.
Shall I inform police?
- No!
Matter of my daughter's life.
How can we find her without informing police, sir?
Sir, please leave me.
I'll not tell your name in court, sir.
Call AC Manoj!
Came to know now, sir.
A night three months ago, I heard some sound and looked out, my security people had caught few young men,
after inquiring them we came to know, they're my daughter's class mates, it seems they were ragging my daughter in college in every day.
Still I can't speak Kannada so... lt's a year since you took charge in this state, still didn't pick up the language?
There's English, Hindi and Telugu to communicate here.
They've been torturing my daughter for quite long time.
They reached my home too.
My daughter cried and refused to go college.
Only then I came to know she had so many problems in college.
They did this without knowing who her father is!
They were taken to police station and got thrashed.
I feared they would take revenge on my daughter for this.
That's why I security men follow her everywhere.
But still they managed to kidnap my daughter.
In 2 hours, I'll save your daughter, sir.
Just give a complaint.
If it's normal, okay.
But my daughter is with him now.
If I lodge complaint, what if he takes photos of my daughter and uploads on Internet.
So, nobody must know about this, everything must be unofficial.
Once my daughter reaches home safely, all of them must die.
That's why I called you.
I'll save your daughter in one hour, sir.
By now he would've informed the police.
In 30 minutes, all routes would be blocked.
We must leave before that.
Buddy, I've the train tickets.
- Keep it with you.
Few Telugu boys are involved, already eve teasing case had been booked against them with Sanjay Nagar police, talk to the lnspector there and take their local address.
Do it unofficial, don't file the case.
I'll send the girl's mobile number, contact the network and get immediately 3 months call list.
Home, sir?
- No.
Go to station first, I've some work there.
Where's Prabhu?
- Who are you?
Where's Prabhu?
- Who are you?
How dare you ask who am I!
Don't beat me, I don't know anything sir.
Tell me!
What happened?
After eve teasing case PG house owner threw them out, sir.
Prabhu of Ananthapur in that case...
- Get his background.
Got phone call from home?
Buy sweets, buy a chocolate cake with lot of cream, and six candles too!
My son's birthday!
Cake must have happy birthday Arjun !
Never tolerate such kidnap cases.
- Yes sir.
After saving the girl, let's encounter all the boys involved in it.
Yes sir, only then it'll instill fear.
Got the call details of the girl?
- Yes sir.
Give the numbers of the boys and ask the network to track them.
It's very slow process sir, it'll take 5 hours.
You talk to them directly, they'll speed up.
Voice the person we're searching is enough,
Chittoor Shekhar Babu says we can find him anywhere in this world.
He has a software.
- Take help from a criminal?
Even lb is giving him tracking of big cases.
This is to save a girl's life, right sir?
Don't you've the confidence of handling 4 boys?
I do, sir.
How far the Deepak inquiry has come?
I don't know, sir...
- Will you tell or not?
You please go out.
Where have they taken the kidnapped girl?
Which girl, sir?
- Don't you know?
Remember now?
- Rithika?
Look, I'll save the girl in one hour, after that I'll kill Prabhu and others in encounter.
Not one of them would be alive.
If you cooperate, I'll leave you as not involved in this case.
My sweet little son !
Did you buy Benton gift for me?
I've got your Benton gift, I've a surprize gift also!
What's that surprize gift, daddy?
I'm little busy now, I'll come home early.
Like a Superman, okay?
Hang up the phone.
Now they've introduced Benton drawers, many varieties.
You too can wear, your son would love it.
Tell me.
None of them are my friends, sir.
I got them PG accommodation saying they're Telugu boys from Ananthapur.
Now they got me into this and escaped.
Rithika is my girl friend, Prabhu tried a lot to break us up.
But he failed.
That's why he kidnapped her.
Prabhu is very dangerous man.
He smokes marijuana and is always with girls.
I told you to tell the truth, why are you telling lies?
I'm telling you the truth, sir.
Tell me exactly what had happened, okay?
Tell me!
Sir, Rithi and I...
- Sit properly.
Tell me now.
I and Rithi studied together from school.
She always sat next to me.
Everyone used to say we're made for each other since our school days.
Everything was fine and we were happy till Prabhu came into our lives.
His English is like us!
- infact better than us!
May be convent educated!
I can't speak in English.
I studied in Telugu medium.
Can I speak in Telugu?
My name is Prabhu, I'm from Chennai.
Many here said they scored 70% and -80% in plus two exams, I too worked very hard and got 42%!
Buddy, I think he's an intelligent student.
He scored high percentage.
I joined B.Sc. majoring Physics, but I couldn't complete it, to tell more about me, I play cricket, captain of university boxing team, I'm a jack of all trades but master of none.
To say in simple words, I'm not great in anything.
Good, you spoke in Telugu, if not you'd have died hearing my English.
Where's your native place?
- Ananthapur.
From our place!
Would you like to smoke?
The day he entered college, he formed a gang of Telugu boys.
Buddy, look there!
Buddy, they're from our class, right?
Yellow T-shirt!
Calling you !
Staying in different places.
You speak in Telugu, we know Telugu.
He's a Telugu from Nellore.
Will you arrange a room?
It'll be fine if we stay together.
Came here to have fun drinking and dating girls.
Now I'm staying with my sister.
I can't do anything.
First stop talking butler English !
It's a torture!
Look, girls have run away in fear.
- Making fun of us?
We want to stay together in one place and sought your help, why are you behaving highhandedly?
You shut up, the girls with him are okay, right?
We can understand your level from the way you appear.
Isn't it simple for you to arrange a room?
I'll arrange PG in my place.
No problem if you pay less advance.
- PG means?
Its very difficult to get girls if you behave like this.
I'll teach you how to move!
I told you about them, aunty, they're my friends.
They're from my place.
I gave you PG advance, right?
It's for them.
I'm allowing then because they're your friends, no drinks here please.
What is she saying?
- She says no drinks.
I can give up studies, how can I give up drinks, buddy?
I'm here for that only.
No smoking.
- No smoking!
Come home by 8 pm!
Don't bring any guests to home.
Gate will be closed by 10 pm!
My father is better than her.
We wouldn't have come here if you'd told us the rules first.
Why did I join here paying a million donation?
To drink!
If I'm not allowed to drink, I'll go back to Ananthapur.
Aunty will say like that and we too must tell her like that only.
Lost the advance!
Not getting kick even after couple of Beers.
This is draught beer, it's very smooth.
That's why girls too have this and go home without fear.
Why are you dull, Murali?
What happened?
Our parents are struggling to put us in college, we're drinking and enjoying here without any responsibility.
Feelings?
If he's with us, our image will get damaged.
Are you mad?
- Go out and sit with security man.
I can't waste money foolishly like you, instead of buy a beer for Rs.350 here, if we buy a quarter for Rs.70 outside, we can save money!
This dance won't suit us.
Isn't it seen?
- lt is seen !
It's worth Rs.1000, how can I hide it
Win over the night...
Have a blast with wine... I know well, that girl in red shorts studied with me till tenth class.
Shred and throw away the calendar...
Raise down the clock tower...
Kick and open the door to heaven...
Drink to your fun...
The place we never dreamed of, we're entering it involuntarily...
The world curses one who says he has no thirst for anything...
Let's rewrite Einstein's energy theory differently...
Let's share dreams, wine and fun...
RBC is rushing to enter the flood of wine...
WBC is liberated when it takes a holy dip in river of Vodka...
Even chill weather is making me sweat, buddy.
The night is growing cold...
my heart is pouring out poems...
Youth is on high and let's have fun in the sky...
We stayed away from city life due to shyness...
We gained confidence and started monkeying around...
That night I decided not to take Ananthapur boys to any place.
But they started coming on their own to all the places.
From then on I started to avoid them.
The came to every pub I visited on their own and tried to talk to me.
I avoided them.
One of the boys asked Rithi to dance.
I tried to stop him.
But he came with other boys and created trouble.
If you want, come this side.
They went away as soon as he told, I think Prabhu had set them up.
No use in coming to pub with girl, must be brave enough to save her.
First learn that, you can teach us to trap girls later.
Before they come back from toilet, leave the pub with her.
Enough of watching, just go.
Rithika started showing more interest in Prabhu after that incident.
I can't do this.
I grew up much better than this.
They can't do anything with me.
I could've taught you here but... I've a doubt in this lesson.
How do you know this?
Prabhu is in Facebook.
No problem.
How long should we stand here and watch others entering?
Aren't you coming inside?
- Waiting for the shoes.
Karthik has gone to bring it.
I told you to come wearing shoes, right?
You told us come in shoes but didn't tell us they won't allow without shoes.
Prabhu, I've sent you friend request in FB, add me.
Rithika tried out of way to get closer to him.
I took her out to warn about facing problems.
She came with me.
But she said it would be nice if Prabhu joins us and brought him too.
Buddy, you go, I'll park the car.
You don't know where to park, I'll park it, you carry on.
But that day, St.Marks Road, Church road, Museum road, parking was full in all places.
- Just 5 minutes only.
When I went after parking the car, they weren't there, sir.
I called them form the coffee shop.
Rithi will not answer unknown numbers.
So I called Prabhu.
He switched off the phone.
I went home and logged into FB to send her a message, I feared that he would ruin her life, sir.
Now he has done it.
- Where did you go away?
I must ask you that.
Do you know how long l had waited for you near coffee shop?
We went to the next coffee shop as this was full.
We called you on phone and it was switched off.
Rithika said you know the place and you'd come not finding us there.
Why did you switch off your mobile?
Why would I do so?
Battery down !
We waited some time for you, you didn't turn up, I dropped her at home in an auto.
Actually I didn't come with a plan.
- Plan?
Yes, buddy.
They always roam with boys, they stay with them at nights, such girls won't set well for our Telugu culture.
Till now I enjoyed, you tow hereafter.
I must get rid of her using you as a bait.
Why are you sitting here?
I want to stay closer to him and get know his likes.
What would you do by knowing his likes?
You didn't come yesterday, I talked to him for long time.
He has good command over all the subjects.
I'm also good in all the subjects.
Boo!
You failed in 6 out of 8 subjects.
Are you going to teach me?
I got irritated hearing Rithika praising him so much.
I got really angry.
The girl is foolish !
Why is everyone laughing?
I'm much better than her, buddy.
I was watching Gorilla picture in the book and I...
What would he think about me?
Are you worried about what would he think of you?
That's why girls are called mad!
- What?
Why are you getting angry?
He played a scene in pub that day, will you consider him as a hero?
He knows only two things about Bangalore,
Girls and wine!
Do you know what was the bet he had with me?
- What?
That he'd trap and have you...
You're lying.
It's my duty to warn as your friend.
If you're still interested in him... I'll not talk to him anymore.
I was very happy that day.
Because she believed everything I told about Prabhu.
At that time, I got a call that my mother isn't well.
I left to my hometown that night.
I came back to Bangalore after few days.
I was in a hurry to leave my bag in PG and propose to Rithika.
How could she fall for him?
That's what I too don't know sir.
- Did you come just now?
Yes.
You could've knocked the door, right?
I could take everything easily but he asked me to knock the door, that I couldn't digest so easily.
- You carry on.
I don't know what he did with her in the gap I wasn't in town, the girl who said she won't talk to him was saying I love to him.
Even after this, why did you still support him?
Whatever it may be, Rithi is my girl friend.
So I tried to be closer to them and separate them.
One night Prabhu came home after getting wet in rain.
I told you to come home on time for dinner.
You go aunty, I'll eat.
If you come late again, no food and I'll not open the gate too.
Did you enjoy with your girl...
- What happened?
That day his face...
Prabhu came home that night with severely hurt face.
I thought it was some serious problem.
But what that problem was...
Looking the Facebook updates, I'm sure it's love matter.
There was a case pending on him, it's over now.
Checked his family, sir.
His sister's husband is a criminal lawyer in Chennai.
He beat an Sl, he was slapped with a case.
Sl?
It was closed 4 months ago.
What are you saying?
Why didn't you tell your daughter loved and eloped with him?
I don't know what you are telling...
Can't I know this if you don't tell me?
I lost precious time because you lied to me.
Still I can't forget that press meet.
Don't talk without proof.
- Look at this proof, sir!
Entire media turned against me after beating up a reporter.
If they come to know that my daughter has eloped with a boy in this situation.
Fearing press would use it against me, I lied to you.
I made a mistake, you must help me out of this, that's all.
3 months ago, one night I was coming back from a meeting.
It was pouring!
I couldn't see anything clearly on road.
A boy asked lift then !
Stop the car.
I and my girl friend were coming, my bike broke down.
if you give us lift till that junction, I don't mind if I'm alone, my girl friend is with me!
Okay, get in.
My father!
I wanted to kill him there itself!
I didn't want to do anything before my daughter and left him.
I made a mistake.
I thought of sending Rithika to my sister's place.
My sister said she would take her after the exams.
Today is the last exam.
I wanted to send her there today evening.
Mean while this happened.
You must catch her before noon !
- Before noon?
Why?
My daughter would complete I told you it was kidnap so that you'd take immediate action.
Why are you worried, sir?
You can do anything if you decide.
If this matter leaks out, though she's my daughter, if I keep her locked in home, press will mar my political career and social reputation, that's why!
You file the case.
- No, do it secretly.
This is not kidnap but your personal issue.
I saved you from false encounter case.
I can get the same encounter case reopened.
I want my daughter back.
Blocked all roads between Bangalore and Tamil Nadu.
Check all the vehicles going to Tamil Nadu.
Keep a watch on all the vehicles.
Keep our man near ticket counter.
Check all reserved train tickets.
Those boys have booked tickets to Brindavan express.
There's a girl known as Rithika with them.
Keep our men all around the station.
In civil dress.
I thought they would've made a big plan after kidnapping your daughter.
But kids don't know they would get caught for booking tickets on their names.
What happened?
One of our men is standing near book shop, he's in civil dress, two officers are on platform 4 in uniform.
Remove all officers in uniform.
Officers in civil dress carry on.
Check all the passengers of that age group.
How much more time is there for the train to start?
Just 8 more minutes only.
How much more time is left?
- Just 5 minutes only.
But those boys haven't yet turned up here.
They may come in at the last moment.
4 boys resembling the suspects are entering from other side.
Go!
When are you coming?
- Shortly!
Uncle has brought a cake.
- Give the phone to your mother.
Come quickly.
- Give the phone to your mother.
Mother!
- Tell me, don't run, Arjun !
How many times I've told you not to let him call me on phone?
He did it on his own, where are you?
- l'm on duty.
You went on getting call from Avinash...
- How can I foresee things?
It was an emergency, I had to do it.
Okay, don't get tensed, when are you coming back?
I can't tell.
He would get disappointed if you fail to come.
My son's birthday is important to me also.
Will you come before his friends come, right?
He's asking, when will you come home?
I'll come after finishing my duty.
If they don't go by train, how would they go, sir?
Buddy!
Give me your phone, Rithika.
Sit inside.
Sl took your husband, right?
- Yes.
How can he deny now?
Okay, I'll take care of it.
Why do you always pick up fight with police?
I can spend my life without going to police station, but he must come to the court every week, right?
He must be scared.
You don't worry.
Your husband will in home by evening.
- Okay sir.
Brother-in-law...
- What happened?
I'm bringing her.
- Where are you now?
In a tea stall in Hoskote junction.
First come out of that state.
We'll take Malur road and reach Hosur road.
That's long route, right?
- No, brother-in-law, they would've come to know we're not travelling by train, so they would search all the roads thoroughly.
Everyone knows NH4 is the shortest route.
So, they would check thoroughly there.
They wouldn't bother about Hosur road, they wouldn't expect we would take that road.
Had you shown this intelligence in studies, it would've been better!
I didn't hear properly, brother-in-law.
I said had you shown this intelligence in studies, it would've been better!
Okay, come carefully.
Alert the Hosur check post.
Inform Hoskote police station.
MMS the photos of these four boys to patrol inspectors.
Keep tracking this number.
He's constable Adhi!
He got an award for discipline from Commissioner.
Buddy, let's go.
It's not good to stay here for long.
Sit, they switched off the phone.
They'll switch it on again like they did now, keep tracking.
They changed the sim but they don't know we can track with lMl number.
Little boys!
Hey idiot, don't give me a running commentary.
Trace their whereabouts.
SMS me their new number.
We got trapped!
Be silent, don't get tensed.
Before police find them, many get caught in fear.
They would've many other things to do than catching us.
Be casual.
What?
- Trying to be casual.
Do you've Nokia charger?
- Charge it there.
Why are you doing this?
If he's casual, we'll get caught.
Let's go.
This cell is in Hoskote junction.
I'll find the exact address and inform you, sir.
Whose bike is that?
- Mine sir.
They would've tapped your phone by now.
They would've tightened checking in Malur road.
Nh4 would be empty.
We can get away safely.
Even if we change the sim, they'll track phone with lMl number.
That's why I changed the sim and left the phone in tea shop.
Track with lMl number.
We can find the handset number with sim.
Every handset has a unique number.
That is lMl number, sir.
If we've the lMl number, we can find all the numbers of sims used in it.
We can find the present handset number with sim card number.
We can find numbers of sims used in it.
Call history of incoming and outgoing calls are in the registry.
It's like a chain reaction, sir.
Within hours, we can track his friends, relatives' numbers.
Got the number?
I got 28 numbers tracking lMl number of that sim.
4 of them are Chennai numbers.
One number was activated just 30 minutes ago.
Someday your father has to accept it.
You don't worry.
Who knows this number, buddy?
Let's switch off the phone, buddy.
Congratulations for buying a new sim.
I'm ACP Manoj!
Tell me,
- You know what would happen if you kidnap an underage girl?
7 years in jail!
Sir is very near the criminal's cell id!
His father has lodged a complaint.
If he lodges a complaint with police, everyone would know his daughter has eloped with someone.
So, I'm sure her father wouldn't have lodged a complaint.
Sir and accused are in same cell id.
Without a complaint, without an fir, tapping a girl's phone, tracing my phone, I think you know it's a crime!
Don't get into trouble in trying to save him.
If you leave the girl now... lf not I'll catch you.
First catch me, then think about spoiling my life.
You and accused are in the same cell id, sir.
Where exactly he is?
- Just 300 metres ahead of you, sir.
Signal is coming from the same spot for quite some time.
Police are catching accused by tracing the mobile.
If we don't switch off the phone, we're in trouble.
He switched it off.
Nobody can track us anymore.
I've kept the alarm at midnight 12 pm.
After that it's 1 am!
Dhananjay from Hoskote sir.
I saw the boys you had sent the photos.
Did you catch the,?
- No, I didn't get the MMS by then.
Did you note down their bike numbers?
B ot bike, they went in a car, sir.
-Car?
Yes, black colour, Sedan type car.
Tamil Nadu registration.
Inform highway patrol.
Block the roads.
They tracked our new number, they know we're on NH4.
Our boys are going on bikes, right?
Tell them to inform if there's any checking.
Stop that black car and check the documents.
They're checking only black cars, buddy.
May be they know about the car.
- Check if the phone is on.
Karthik has sent a message.
They're stopping all black cars and checking on highway.
Umesh is in his home, right?
- Yes.
Message him to come to Bangarapet bus stand.
A message has been sent to Bangarapet from the cell l'm tracking.
It says buddy, come immediately to Bangarapet bus stand.
Those boys...inform patrol, I'm reaching there.
You don't worry, there won't be any problem.
If you're with me, I'll not face any problem in life, I know it.
Umesh is here!
Get down and take the bike.
We've stopped the car, sir.
- Those boys?
There was only one boy in it.
Tell sir, where are the others?
I don't know sir, even if I know why should I tell you, sir?
Tell me!
- Don't beat me!
Tell me...
- Don't beat me, sir.
I don't know where did they go?
Please don't beat me, sir.
I know sir...
I know...
I'll tell you.
Ajay sent me a message an hour ago, sir.
Told me to come to Bangarapet bus stand.
They gave me the car, Prabhu and Rithika boarded the train, sir.
Which train?
- l don't know sir.
Brindavan express!
They're travelling in unreserved compartment.
is that Brindavan express?
- Yes sir.
Which is the next station?
- Kuppam sir, 18 kms!
All friends help if it's love.
This is not just love, there's a lot behind this.
One day Prabhu came home completely getting wet in rain.
What happened, buddy?
Bike broke down and he asked lift from her father.
What about Rithi?
- Let's see.
We'll know if she comes to college tomorrow.
If her father doesn't let her to go to college.
I don't think so.
What do you know about her father?
He's very dangerous man.
I'm sure he won't let Rithika attend college.
Do you know how well l looked after till she was my friend?
Now, her life is ruined because of you.
Hey ulcer!
Shut up!
Whatever it is, let's face it, let's see what he's up to!
If he reacts overly, let's take away the girl, okay?
Are you drunk?
- Not much.
As Deepak said Rithika's father didn't allow her to attend college.
Prabhu was upset.
Why are you dull, buddy?
Why?
Our team has won !
His girl is locked in her house, how can he be happy?
What?
That's why we're sad!
- lsn't it?
Shall we've drinks?
I'll sponsor the drinks today.
- You?
Prabhu got drunk that day.
- Buddy, please listen to me.
Celebrating his birthday today is resident of Srirampuram, man of steel...our lion...
S P Ramachandran !
MLC!
We wish him a long life... a shocking news to the younger brothers of big brother!
Drinks are free!
idiot!
Did you bring us so far for this?
How can I be silent if drinks are free?
Never waste your parents' hard earned money, buddy
She's scratching me with her eyes...
The girl with mischievous eyes...
She looking on me like a rainbow...
She's a smashing sultry siren... ln her youth...
in the size of exotic sweet...
When she walks, men fall flat in dozens...
On the road to Gajuwaka chimes of her anklets...
She's sending messages with her silver anklets...
Under the beam of light house, she's baiting with her beauty...
He's killing us!
- l'll abuse him wildly.
He's giving us free drinks, be silent, boys.
She's trapping me with the bait of her beauty...
A beautiful angel from the heaven...
She's dazzling me like the magical deer...
She's an epitome of beauty...
Girl from Kothapeta who charmed me...
Bloody!
My friend is sad here with love failure, are you boasting about your love story?
What's your friend's name?
- Prabhu !
Why?
Give me his complete details.
She trapped Prabhu with her eyes...
She's now trapped in a cage...
He's not able to see her...
Her silver anklets have gone silent...
The love for her is taking his life...
Her heart is in pain without her lover...
Nobody can stop the meeting of two hearts...
You're happy if you forget your sorrows... I'll unite you both, you enjoy your drink...
What?
- You're drunk!
Rithika called, she says she'll die if she won't see me now.
She's crying.
I'm very sad.
I must see her now, buddy.
Buddy, you don't feel, I'll take you to her.
Buddy, I'll unite you both.
If we get caught, we'll be in deep trouble.
You'll get the stick.
If you're a friend, help his love.
I'll not come, if you want you carry on. I'll not come.
But don't worry because it's tall.
I'll lift you up!
All the best, buddy!
Buddy, we had too many drinks, let's go to our room.
I'm not drunk.
- Buddy has gone alone.
We're his support.
We're unable to stand, how can we support him?
I'll never again drink.
Buddy!
Did you talk to her?
- Don't shout.
He's giving flying kiss, he's very happy.
Tell sister to be brave!
Did you tell sister that I've promised to unite you both?
Good omen !
Lights are switched on !
- Get down !
Catch them!
- Someone is there, catch him!
Look there!
For him room or road is same.
I think we'll get thrashed, buddy!
Do you need this?
Can't you attend college and go home silently?
Why do you befriend such guys?
Okay, go home.
All other were beaten up by police except me.
Go home!
Go home l say!
I didn't enter your college, right?
On Rithika's father's orders, all the boys were humiliated and made to stand at college gate in briefs!
is my pot belly seen, buddy?
You should be ashamed to support such wastrels.
Because didn't work out for 4 days, so...
College management tried to stop this.
But Inspector didn't listen.
I informed Prabhu's brother-in-law and asked him to come.
He's a famous lawyer in Chennai.
I'm leaving because Magistrate told me, if not it would've been a big case.
You must enter the city only to write exam, if you stay back even for a day, I may have to arrest you.
I know all that, You complete the formalities.
Tell them to sign this.
It says he has no connection with that girl.
Thank God, you signed, I feared you'd say love is more important like in films.
They would've thrashed us again.
Push him out of the running car.
- What happened?
is he a friend?
Her father used his power to ruin their education, threatened the house owner and got them vacated the place, how can we spare him easily?
Instead of supporting, why is he making fun of him?
Prabhu !
Does she love you?
Tell me.
If not why would she call him to home at 2 am, sister.
Elope with her, let's face the problem later.
Yes sister, only if he elopes with the girl, her father would get...
He's already not in good mood, are you making things worse?
You saw how they thrashed my brother, didn't you?
For that if he elopes with her, will that be enough?
Just now I got the old cases against him closed.
Are you inciting him again?
- What do you say, Prabhu?
They're facing problems because of me, sister.
Leave it.
Forget it, let's get her.
Buddy, we mustn't spare him.
He must get back double what we got!
Brother-in-law, Puneet is going back to Bangalore.
I'm going back, uncle.
- Okay.
I've decided to bring her.
- Don't talk mad.
We solved what could've become a big issue, forget the girl.
- She threatens to die without me.
I promised to stand by her through thick and thin.
Do you want to me give up now?
- lf not what can you do?
Do you've the capacity to look after her?
You haven't yet finished your studies.
There won't be a foolish man than me if I do that.
Whatever you say is wrong, don't mistake me for hurting you.
You're still a dependent on me, ls it necessary to bring that girl and marry her?
He says he'll bring her, did he say he'll marry now and have kids?
After this year's exam, they're sending her to another place.
She's safe if we bring her here before that happens.
She'll be a guest here till he settles.
After that we friends planned to take Rithika to Chennai.
Friends?
Train is slowing down for signal.
- ls it?
Watch him, don't let him call his friends.
How to reach unreserved compartment?
- You can't go sir.
Can we cut and open the AC compartment?
Next station?
- Two
Will this stop?
- lt will stop sir.
What happened?
Arrange a vehicle in Kuppam Railway station.
Kuppam railway station?
Your daughter is travelling with them in Brindavan express.
You said they're in centre, now you say they're in train, you want me to arrange a vehicle in Kuppam station, what's this?
- l'm also in the same train, I'll come with your daughter as soon as train stops.
Vehicle must be there in 15 minutes.
- Manoj, do anything, but keep it away from public attention.
If a girl is taken away, there will public attention.
You can't understand the seriousness...
Do whatever you can but my daughter must come home.
That's all!
Someone please come here.
Who is there in Kuppam?
Venkat Rao, sir.
Send a vehicle immediately to Kuppam station, AC is arriving.
Give the vehicle to him.
Isn't your home near Kuppam station?
- Yes, first left opposite the station.
My vehicle will be parked outside.
Send the vehicle to station.
- lt'll be there in 2 minutes, sir.
Don't get tensed, we can get away.
Prabhu, I'm thirsty.
Leave my hand.
- Who are you?
Where are you taking me?
- Leave my hand.
If you call him, I'll kill him.
Who are you?
Where are you taking the girl?
I'll not go to my home.
I'll be happy with him.
I'll do anything, who are you to stop me?
No, I'll stay with him only, leave me.
If you pull it'll hurt your hand but not open.
If I don't hand cuff you, you'd try to escape or fall down.
You may hurt yourself.
How could this happen, buddy?
- Don't know who took her?
He appeared like a police man.
I'm sure he was sent by her father.
Buddy, whichever route from here touches AP in 20 kms.
It's difficult if we don't do anything, buddy.
Your father would be worried, I'll tell him we're coming home.
Don't you know this?
Both brothers are fools.
What happened?
Your daughter is with me, talk to her.
Rithi, my child!
I've switched on the speaker, talk to her.
Why don't you talk to me, child?
No!
No, my dear.
I did this for you...
This is common for next few days.
At this age you feel love is more important.
You'd take any risk for it.
You'd regret for what you did now.
Because you wish for status in society then.
You've to plan the future of your children.
You need money for it.
I'm not saying he won't earn well.
But the life your father gave you, he can't afford in his life.
If you'd eloped with him, your father's political life would've got ruined.
I don't know why people become selfish in love?
It's not your mistake to select your life partner.
But it needs age and maturity to decide.
He couldn't protect you, he left as easily as I caught you.
He will come for me.
You don't believe truth but believe dreams that will never come true.
Your friend Deepak told me different things.
Trusting that idiot Deepak's words I avoided Prabhu.
Deepak went to his hometown at that time.
Will you pay my fee too?
Long queue.
I'm not a betrayer!
Only we Telugu boys come to party without girl friends.
We're changing history, let's impress any girl today.
What do you say, buddy?
Don't worry about it, come, drink and enjoy!
Nothing short is advices.
Don't stop me from drinking...
looks like 'Patalabhairavi' film set.
Don't forget, you're not drinking today.
Okay?
- Have drinks.
Why?
- Have it.
- No.
have it.
I told you not to drink, right?
Cheap creep!
Buddy, drinks are great the day you don't drink.
That's why I told you !
He comes wherever I go.
Health is wealth.
- Drink silently.
Everyone's enjoying but I am...
Deepak told me about you, how cheap you are!
Let's talk tomorrow, you're drunk.
Who?
Me?
- Yes.
Go.
But health is wealth, you mustn't drink, okay?
Okay, go.
You know well...
- You'll fall!
I've fallen already.
This angle is better.
You're also drunk.
Go home.
I made a mistake trusting you to be a good boy.
What would've happened if I didn't have a friend like Deepak?
Are you mad?
Then?
We met about 10 times in 6 months, you believed I'm a good man in this short period, someone told you something and you believed him also, if not mad what else should I call you then?
You came to me and talked to me.
I didn't come to you and talked to you.
Go!
I'll go out for a smoke.
Health is wealth, you mustn't drink, okay?
Don't kill me, buddy.
Do you've match box?
Tell me, aunty.
Where you, Rithika?
- Check all the pubs.
I'm in Nisha's house.
- Good, you're not outside, right?
No, why are you asking, aunty?
Just like that, come home quickly.
Tomorrow I'm going to hit headlines.
You say health is wealth every 5 minutes.
How concerned you're about his health, buddy?
Get lost!
Rs.5000 spot fine for drunken driving.
He must drive the bike.
If he drinks and drives the bike, I've to pay the fine.
If he doesn't drink, I'll save my money.
His health is my wealth.
Got it?
Give me the peg.
Go out...go out...
All of you go out!
Do I've to tell you individually?
- All of you leave the place!
Be silent, don't go out.
- Go!
Stop the music!
Who the hell is that talking about police?
No drinks here!
What are you looking at?
Get going!
Go...go...go out!
I've a small peg.
Aren't you ashamed?
Boys are going out leaving drinks.
Are you so special?
Go out!
How dare you beat me!
I'll strip her!
How dare she beats me!
Don't touch girls, it's wrong.
Get out!
Take them out.
Bring them.
Bring all of them.
I don't care who you are, shut up!
You must be as we like you to be in our place!
Block all the entrances.
Don't let anyone to escape.
Bring all of them here.
Stay here till media people arrive.
Tie the knot or else tie a rakhi.
How dare you beat me and escape!
Come on, beat me now!
Nisha, come!
wait, I'll also come with you.
They're my father's party men.
If they see me here, I'll be in trouble.
Emergency is here!
That side!
No police case, please doctor.
It's an emergency case, I must submit accident case report.
Call her parents.
We went to the party without informing parents.
You ruin girls' lives by teaching all this for your advantage.
Call her parents.
- Her parents...
She's Avinash Patel's daughter.
- What?
Politician Avinash Patel's daughter!
Children are the biggest problems of vip's.
He says can't tell anything till an hour.
Why are you standing here?
Sit down.
Tell me.
- l've brought the car.
Have you come?
I'm waiting at a tea shop opposite the hospital.
I'm coming.
Would you like to have tea or coffee?
It's hot, be careful.
They wouldn't have started the treatment if I hadn't told your father's name.
That's why I used it.
It's good at least for once his name is used for doing good.
How much?
I liked the way he handled the situation that night.
Presence of mind?
Do you know how many problems your father faced for that?
Thank God, you were there!
Had you not been there, don't know what would've happened to us!
I'll never again go to such places in my life.
Life is bore without these things, right?
Nothing is wrong if you're within limits.
Are you always like this?
- Like this?
Balanced and matured!
Like a professor.
Tell me, aunt.
I'm coming with Nisha from her house, aunt.
You ruined my image and then lying!
Ask her where did she go?
I was in Nisha's house, aunt.
Lie...she's lying!
- Why are you getting so angry?
She'll not stay here, take her back to your place.
Let her finish the studies.
- ls she studying?
Failed in all subjects.
Did I ever tell you I wanted to study engineering?
You got me admitted fearing it's an insult to you.
Why are you arguing with him?
What has happened now to get so angry?
You keep quiet.
Children are like that now.
Press man was attacked for asking questions.
I've the proof!
Change the channel.
Last night your daughter got arrested in last night's raid.
She was admitted in hospital and got treated for drug overdose.
Don't accuse without any proof!
Attacking a press person made media to turn against him.
On the occasion of Valentine's day, condemning the celebrations in Bangalore, workers of the party attacked celebrations in many places.
When a reporter asked about his daughter getting admitted for drug overdose, unable to control himself, he attacked the reporter.
Let's see the report sent by our reporter.
- No aunty!
They didn't allow my friend in hospital.
So, I used dad's name.
I advice everyone how to raise children, I've a good for nothing daughter.
If she stays here, I can't be in politics.
Take her with you to village.
- Just another year only.
She must have a degree at least for namesake on wedding invitation.
Let her finish the studies.
He was more concerned about his political career than me.
Why?
Nisha wanted to talk to you.
Nisha wants to go out with you.
- Let's go.
Let's go together.
Not with me, she wants to go out with you alone.- ls it?
I told her you won't go out with others except me.
What do you want me to do now?
You do whatever you feel like.
- Where is she?
I told Prabhu to do whatever he feels like doing.
But when he went to talk to Nisha...
Because Nisha is very out spoken girl.
Because there's a good chance she'd like Prabhu.
Who are you?
Are you breathe that I don't see?
You won over this girl...
I like you...
Why?
- l forced you to lie.
I can't say it's a lie.
I mean what you told her...
- Why I told her is true!
Have you trapped the girl?
- Get lost!
Carry on !
If boy and girl talks, they'll blabber nonsense.
Your eyes are pulling me...
drowning me in your love... lt has made me walk along with you as your shadow...
Are you a gentle rain in mild sun?
Are you fire to warm in chill winter?
Are you my first love?
Let's meet tomorrow.
I've special class, inform dad.
My driver hasn't come, can you give me lift?
You be on your job, we'll be on our job.
Wherever I fly in sky, I'm always with you...
Let me make your heart my permanent residence... I'll never go away from you...
- Our hearts came closer slowly...
Your fingers made friends with my fingers...
Today is my mother's death anniversary.
13th year!
When she died, it seems I slept near her body thinking she's sleeping.
Her body was very cold.
I don't remember her smell, her words or anything about her.
I'm still scared when I think about it.
Finding it difficult to raise me without mother, dad put me in international boarding school
In that school, chillness that reminds me of my mother, insecure feeling of not having mother, though there were many, I always felt I'm alone and scared.
To get out of that fear, I created a friend Teddy.
Though I had friends like Deepak...
Nobody else gave it.
You've given me that feeling of security now.
I feel I'll not face any problem in life if you're with me.
Sometimes I feel like I'm talking to myself when I talk to you.
I don't know if you like me or not.
Am I spending so much time without liking you?
You told me how much you like me.
But I can't tell how much I like you or how important you're to me.
I'll look after you that you'll never feel insecure again in life.
Come what so ever it may!
I'll be with you only!
When your breathe touched me, it smashed my shyness...
When your fragrance reached me, my thoughts went berserk...
My heart has become a boat...
- lt moved as water agitates..
Whether it reaches shore or your lap, where would it go...
You came for me only, you protected me like eye lid...
You won over me, I like you...
You go, I'll come with my friend.
Come in, Rithika.
Won't your PG owner raise objections?
No, she won't, come in.
I told you many times not to bring guests, Prabhu.
In these past few days, I'm getting strange thoughts.
I'm thinking about you only all the time.
If you're with me, my life...
- l must throw out these PG boys.
Just four of them are enough.
Wait for 5 minutes, I'll change and come.
Let's go out and talk.
You're emotional, it's not good to stay here.
Let's go out.
- l'm not here just to talk to you.
I desire to do that more than you.
But...
You always advice!
But this boring person is the man I like most in this world.
You've to know much about me.
When my friend's father was building a house with his retirement benefits, that area's Sl tortured him for bribe, friend's father attempted suicide,
one day I and my friend together bashed up that Sl!
my friend's family completed the house, but the case filed by Sl is carrying on, I'll go to court every 2 months, I don't know when the case will end.
You don't need to tell me this but you told me.
That's why I like you !
If you're with me... I can understand that.
But we mustn't regret in future what we do now.
That's why I'm telling you.
What happened?
Why are you crying?
I would've done anything for him that moment.
Prabhu too knew this.
But he never wanted to take advantage of the situation.
He explained to me everything clearly.
Come in, buddy!
Have you come just now?
- Yes.
You could've knocked the door, right?
Okay, I'll wait outside.
Don't meet him, he has told me very bad about you.
He's very bad man.
He likes you so much, unable to express it, he tells lies.
Basically he's good man.
You're a good man !
From what you said about him, I don't think he loves you.
He's trying to exploit you.
If what you say is true, when I told him to take me away from here...
After my exams, dad is sending me to my aunt's house.
But today he gave my passport to someone and was talking about visa.
Please take me away from here.
I'm scared I may never see you again in life.
I'm not here to take you with me.
You threatened to die if you don't see me, so I'm here.
If you die, I'll not die.
But it'll hurt me all my life.
is that okay to you?
I wish to be with you and be happy all my life.
I'll always be with you.
But never do anything in haste.
He told me to wait for few days and went out.
My father and his men handed him over to police.
He sent me message of taking me with him on after last exam.
Got scared?
Come.
He planned everything.
That's why I'm telling you, he'll surely take me away from you.
Girls can never understand this!
Do you think boy friend is superhero?
He'll definitely come.
Move!
No sir!
Leave him sir!
Get in, I'll not harm you.
Fix the stepney!
Fix it!
He's my dad's henchman, he won't harm me.
You don't worry.
is it?
Fix it!
You're a boy!
How dare you beat me!
Hardly the size of my finger how dare you make me run from state to state!
He'll not die, he'll be okay after sometime.
Then, you've to worry about him.
Where are you?
Tried a little while ago but got switched off message.
What happened?
I was in Kuppam.
- Kuppam?
What are you doing there?
Avinash sir...
it's big love story here.
Like us?
- No, not like us.
Kids!
Why should we bother?
They'll take care of themselves.
Don't tell Arjun about the surprize gift.
I'll not tell him, you come home and tell him.
Okay, I'll come.
Blade is also very small!
But the power is in where it is placed!
Release her.
You need at least 30 seconds to pick gun and shoot me.
But I need just 3 seconds to cut your neck.
Bring it here.
Hand cuff him.
You're making a mistake.
You go!
Don't go with him!
Brother, come here!
Call Chittoor Shekhar Babu and tell him to track Prabhu's voice.
Why should we do that sir?
He's a criminal, sir.
He threatened me with a blade on my neck.
Why should he give you a shave now, sir?
Shut up!
Do what I say!
Tell Shekhar Babu to track Prabhu's voice immediately.
I don't hear you, sir.
Bloody idiot!
- Now I can hear you sir.
Tell Shekhar to track Prabhu's voice.
I'll tell him, sir.
Tell me, sir.
- You've to track a voice.
No sir, I don't do that, sir.
Don't lie to me because I'm on phone.
Very urgent, why would I ask you if not?
AC sir wants you to do it immediately.
How can I do it immediately, sir?
I'll ask my man and tell you, sir.
Give me little time, sir.
Need to track a voice, how much time it would take?
If we've the voice sample, we can do it in 2 hours.
Send me voice sample, I'll do it in 2 hours.
Send your mail lD, I'll send the voice sample.
Tell me, Parvathi!
We're ready here.
We can start if you come.
I'll come quickly.
Are his friends there?
They are here for an hour now.
Arjun is waiting for you near gate.
You start, I'll join you.
If you'd told me you're not coming, I would've prepared him mentally for this.
He told his friends that he would cut cake after you come...
Give the phone to Arjun !
Daddy!
It seems he won't talk to you on phone.
he wants you in home immediately.
At least try to keep up the promise you made to him.
No Parvathi, actually... I've set it, sir.
we can catch him if talks from anywhere in this world.
What happened, Rithika?
Relative would've come to know this by now.
My family is facing a big problem because of me.
Do you want to talk to them?
- With my aunt!
Won't you answer my calls?
Even if I bring your daughter, I'm not sure she'll stay with you.
What are you saying?
He's not leaving her.
- Tell me clearly.
Your daughter has run away with him again.
She was with you, right?
Yes, but not now.
Tell me if you can't do it, I'll deal it differently.
You don't get tensed, sir.
You can't understand this, Come with my daughter.
If you can't kill my daughter too along with that boy.
Her death is acceptable to me than her living with a boy from there.
Give me little time, sir.
I'll call you later.
I'm Prabhu here!
One minute!
Rithika wants to talk to you.
- We've located the boy, sir.
He's around here only, sir.
You inform local station and send men.
This is unofficial deal, finish it with your men.
Aunty... lt's here, brother!
Brother!
Brother!
- Look at these photos.
No aunty...he'll look after me very well, aunt!
Don't cry, you wanted to talk to her, right?
He's here.
Where did you go away?
How long should we've to wait for you?
I got cheap liquor on the way, I had few pegs.
What's this drinking without seriousness?
We drink to be jolly, right?
Stop...stop...
- Why?
Aren't they those boys?
Yes...yes...
- Let's go, we're in trouble.
Rithika, come!
Go quickly!
Go left...go left...
Go quickly!
Hit them!
Go fast!
Take right!
- He mustn't escape!
They're going away, go fast!
Hit...hit them!
They're going away!
- Let's enter the town !
Go...go fast!
Where's Murali?
Call AC!
He's calling!
Tell me, buddy!
Give the phone to Prabhu !
- Prabhu?
Your friend Murali has met with an accident.
He's with me now.
His condition is very serious.
Must start the treatment immediately.
Whether he lives or dies is in your hands.
If you do as I say, he would live.
Buddy, that crook is lying!
He beat Murali and took his phone to cheat us.
Where are you going?
What will you do?
I'll check him, he followed us, right?
If you do as I say, it's good for you.
I want the girl.
Hand over her to me and take your friend.
That girl or your friend?
What happened?
- Tell me.
Buddy...bike...
- What happened?
Bike is smashed to pieces!
Murali's blood is all over the road!
All vehicles are passing over it.
Don't know what has happened to him, buddy?
Nobody is there to inquire.
They threw away the bike on road side.
I'm scared, what should we do if he's really hurt?
Murali has net with an accident, brother-in-law.
Oh no!
Did you call the ambulance?
Did you check if there's any hospital nearby?
I don't know.
The police officer called me.
Murali is with him.
He wants me to come to Chittoor bypass road immediately with Rithika.
You stay there, I'll send someone to you.
What if anything happens to Murali by then?
Nothing will happen to him.
Don't go alone to the place he has called.
Friends are with me, brother-in-law.
Whatever it is, let's do it after midnight.
Don't waste time, go with her.
We'll take care of Murali.
All of you're in trouble because of us.
Enough !
Are you going to hand over Rithika to him?
Did we take all risk for this?
- He made us stand in briefs!
He go it published in paper and embarrassed us.
He must know that pain !
If people come to know his daughter has eloped with one of us, his political career would end!
He can't do anything after that.
We took this risk for that not for your love.
Rithika, don't mistake us.
Your love too is important to us...
You don't get worried, carry on, we'll take care of Murali.
I'll go back, Prabhu !
I came with you to live happily all my life.
If we go away and if anything happens to Murali...
We've to spend all our lives with that guilt.
I'll go back.
Stop Prabhu !
There will be another way to reach main road.
It's dark, we can't see anything.
Look there!
- They're here!
I'll call you later, Parvathi!
I'm busy!
You made Arjun cry on his birthday, what's so important work?
Don't talk without knowing the seriousness, it's very important work.
is it that important to catch two lovers?
You wasted an entire day...
You don't understand, he's not a good boy.
My father too said the same thing about you.
Leave...
leave...
leave me...
He tried to kill me.
How can I leave him?
They're doing what we did when we were young!
is it right if you love and wrong if others do it?
Leave me!
I don't have time to hear your lecture, I'll call you later.
Please listen to me... I'm scared!
Nothing will happen to you !
Come.
No other way, we must take Hosur road.
Come, let's go!
What happened, Prabhu?
Come, let's go.
He's here!
Come Prabhu !
Come, let's go!
No need to run anymore, she has completed eighteen.- ls it?
Shouldn't I do anything if she has completed eighteen?
I'll kill you here branding you as a terrorist.
If you want to kill, do it.
I know you can't kill me.
If you wanted to kill, you'd have done it long back.
Do you know why you're unable to kill me?
Because you know I'm not doing anything wrong.
Come with my daughter.
If you can't kill my daughter too along with that boy.
Mad man !
Your father will kill anyone for power!
But he's ready to die for you.
Go away!
Don't think it's happy ending if you elope with a girl?
You'll face unknown problems!
Without parents' support and without education, try living in this society!
You'll know then...
That's why they say don't drink and drive!
First time you've said
A pull
- DDR Presentation
We are going on NH4!
Because that is the shortest route from Chennai to Bangalore.
Hoskote junction, Very important junction in this route.
Because this is 3 way exit point to cross Bangalore.
If we take right, we can reach Hosur, Tamil Nadu via Malur.
If they know we are taking the road, They will block all the roads.
They will not leave any vehicle, They will check bikes, Cars and bus.
It will be very difficult to get out of Bangalore.
But I am sure they will not search in the bus to small town Chinthamani.
We can safely reach Hoskote from Bangalore.
From there straight to Palamaner, Andhra Pradesh.
Buddy, we must not spare him, We must give him double what we got.
It is easy for us to bring her after the last exam.
After that she will not be in Bangalore.
I will go to rest room.
The door is not opening.
- What happened?
It is latched from inside.
- Is it?
Please step aside.
They broke the window and kidnapped madam.
Shall I inform police?
- No!
Matter of my daughter life.
How can we find her without informing police, Sir?
Sir, please leave me.
I will not tell your name in court, Sir.
Call AC Manoj!
Came to know now, Sir.
A night three months ago.
I heard some sound and looked out.
My security people had caught few young men.
After inquiring them we came to know.
They are my daughter class mates.
It seems they were ragging my daughter in college in every day.
Still I cannot speak Kannada so.
It is a year since you took charge in this state.
Still did not pick up the language?
There is English, Hindi and Telugu to communicate here.
They have been torturing my daughter for quite long time.
They reached my home too.
My daughter cried and refused to go college.
Only then I came to know she had so many problems in college.
They did this without knowing who her father is!
They were taken to police station and got thrashed.
I feared they would take revenge on my daughter for this.
That is why I security men follow her everywhere.
But still they managed to kidnap my daughter.
In 2 hours, I will save your daughter, Sir.
Just give a complaint.
If it is normal, Okay.
But my daughter is with him now.
If I lodge complaint.
What if he takes photos of my daughter and uploads on Internet.
So, nobody must know about this, Everything must be unofficial.
Once my daughter reaches home safely, All of them must die.
That is why I called you.
I will save your daughter in one hour, Sir.
By now he would have informed the police.
In 30 minutes, All routes would be blocked.
We must leave before that.
Buddy, I have the train tickets.
- Keep it with you.
Few Telugu boys are involved.
Already eve teasing case had been booked against them with Sanjay Nagar police.
Talk to the inspector there and take their local address.
Do it unofficial, Do not file the case.
I will send the girl mobile number.
Contact the network and get immediately 3 months call list.
Home, Sir?
- No.
Go to station first, I have some work there.
Where is Prabhu?
- Who are you?
Where is Prabhu?
- Who are you?
How dare you ask who am I!
Do not beat me, I do not know anything sir.
Tell me!
What happened?
After eve teasing case PG house owner threw them out, Sir.
Prabhu of Ananthapuram in that case.
- Get his background.
Got phone call from home?
Buy sweets, Buy a chocolate cake with lot of cream.
And six candles too!
My son birthday!
Cake must have happy birthday Arjun!
Never tolerate such kidnap cases.
- Yes sir.
After saving the girl, Let us encounter all the boys involved in it.
Yes sir, only then it will install fear.
Got the call details of the girl?
- Yes sir.
Give the numbers of the boys and ask the network to track them.
It is very slow process sir, It will take 5 hours.
You talk to them directly, They will speed up.
Voice the person we are searching is enough.
Chittoor Shekar Babu says we can find him anywhere in this world.
He has a software.
- Take help from a criminal?
Even LB is giving him tracking of big cases.
This is to save a girl life, Right sir?
Do not you have the confidence of handling 4 boys?
I do, Sir.
How far the Deepak inquiry has come?
I do not know, Sir...
- Will you tell or not?
You please go out.
Where have they taken the kidnapped girl?
Which girl, Sir?
- Do not you know?
Remember now?
- Rithika?
Look, I will save the girl in one hour.
After that I will kill Prabhu and others in encounter.
Not one of them would be alive.
If you cooperate, I will leave you as not involved in this case.
My sweet little son!
Did you buy Benton gift for me?
I have got your Benton gift, I have a surprise gift also!
What is that surprize gift, Daddy?
I am little busy now, I will come home early.
Like a Superman, Okay?
Hang up the phone.
Now they have introduced Benton drawers, Many varieties.
You too can wear, Your son would love it.
Tell me.
None of them are my friends, Sir.
I got them PG accommodation saying they are Telugu boys from Ananthapuram.
Now they got me into this and escaped.
Rithika is my girlfriend, Prabhu tried a lot to break us up.
But he failed.
That is why he kidnapped her.
Prabhu is very dangerous man.
He smokes marijuana and is always with girls.
I told you to tell the truth, Why are you telling lies?
I am telling you the truth, Sir.
Tell me exactly what had happened, Okay?
Tell me!
Sir, Rithi and I.
- Sit properly.
Tell me now.
I and Rithi studied together from school.
She always sat next to me.
Everyone used to say we are made for each other since our school days.
Everything was fine and we were happy till Prabhu came into our lives.
His English is like us!
- In fact better than us!
May be convent educated!
I cannot speak in English.
I studied in Telugu medium.
Can I speak in Telugu?
My name is Prabhu, I am from Chennai.
Many here said they scored 70% and - 80% in plus two exams.
I too worked very hard and got 42%!
Buddy, I think he is an intelligent student.
He scored high percentage.
I joined B.Sc. majoring Physics, But I could not complete it.
To tell more about me, I play cricket.
Captain of university boxing team.
I am a jack of all trades but master of none.
To say in simple words, I am not great in anything.
Good, you spoke in Telugu.
If not you would have died hearing my English.
Where is your native place?
- Ananthapuram.
From our place!
Would you like to smoke?
The day he entered college, He formed a gang of Telugu boys.
Buddy, Look there!
Buddy, they are from our class, Right?
Yellow T-shirt!
Calling you!
Staying in different places.
You speak in Telugu, We know Telugu.
He is a Telugu from Nellore.
Will you arrange a room?
It will be fine if we stay together.
Came here to have fun drinking and dating girls.
Now I am staying with my sister.
I cannot do anything.
First stop talking butler English!
It is a torture!
Look, Girls have run away in fear.
- Making fun of us?
We want to stay together in one place and sought your help.
Why are you behaving highhandedly?
You shut up, the girls with him are okay, Right?
We can understand your level from the way you appear.
Is not it simple for you to arrange a room?
I will arrange PG in my place.
No problem if you pay less advance.
- PG means?
It is very difficult to get girls if you behave like this.
I will teach you how to move!
I told you about them, Aunty, They are my friends.
They are from my place.
I gave you PG advance, Right?
It is for them.
I am allowing then because they are your friends, No drinks here please.
What is she saying?
- She says no drinks.
I can give up studies, How can I give up drinks, Buddy?
I am here for that only.
No smoking.
- No smoking!
Come home by 8 pm!
Do not bring any guests to home.
Gate will be closed by 10 pm!
My father is better than her.
We would not have come here if you had told us the rules first.
Why did I join here paying a million donation?
To drink!
If I am not allowed to drink, I will go back to Ananthapuram.
Aunty will say like that and we too must tell her like that only.
Lost the advance!
Not getting kick even after couple of Beers.
This is draught beer, It is very smooth.
That is why girls too have this and go home without fear.
Why are you dull, Murali?
What happened?
Our parents are struggling to put us in college.
We are drinking and enjoying here without any responsibility.
Feelings?
If he is with us, Our image will get damaged.
Are you mad?
- Go out and sit with security man.
I cannot waste money foolishly like you.
Instead of buy a beer for Rs.350 here.
If we buy a quarter for Rs.70 outside.
We can save money!
This dance will not suit us.
Is not it seen?
- It is seen!
It is worth Rs.1000, How can I hide it?
Win over the night.
Have a blast with wine.
I know well, that girl in red shorts studied with me till tenth class.
Shred and throw away the calendar.
Raise down the clock tower.
Kick and open the door to heaven.
Drink to your fun.
The place we never dreamed of, We are entering it involuntarily.
The world curses one who says he has no thirst for anything.
Let us rewrite Einstein energy theory differently.
Let us share dreams, Wine and fun.
RBC is rushing to enter the flood of wine.
WBC is liberated when it takes a holy dip in river of Vodka.
Even chill weather is making me sweat, Buddy.
The night is growing cold my heart is pouring out poems.
Youth is on high and let us have fun in the sky.
We stayed away from city life due to shyness.
We gained confidence and started monkeying around.
That night I decided not to take Ananthapuram boys to any place.
But they started coming on their own to all the places.
From then on I started to avoid them.
The came to every pub I visited on their own and tried to talk to me.
I avoided them.
One of the boys asked Rithi to dance.
I tried to stop him.
But he came with other boys and created trouble.
If you want, come this side.
They went away as soon as he told, I think Prabhu had set them up.
No use in coming to pub with girl, Must be brave enough to save her.
First learn that, you can teach us to trap girls later.
Before they come back from toilet, Leave the pub with her.
Enough of watching, just go.
Rithika started showing more interest in Prabhu after that incident.
I cannot do this.
I grew up much better than this.
They cannot do anything with me.
I could have taught you here but.
I have a doubt in this lesson.
How do you know this?
Prabhu is in Facebook.
No problem.
How long should we stand here and watch others entering?
Are not you coming inside?
- Waiting for the shoes.
Karthik has gone to bring it.
I told you to come wearing shoes, Right?
You told us come in shoes but did not tell us they will not allow without shoes.
Prabhu, I have sent you friend request in FB, Add me.
Rithika tried out of way to get closer to him.
I took her out to warn about facing problems.
She came with me.
But she said it would be nice if Prabhu joins us and brought him too.
Buddy, you go.
I will park the car.
You do not know where to park, I will park it, you carry on.
But that day, St. Marks Road, Church road, Museum road.
Parking was full in all places.
- Just 5 minutes only.
When I went after parking the car.
They were not there, Sir.
I called them form the coffee shop.
Rithi will not answer unknown numbers.
So I called Prabhu.
He switched off the phone.
I went home and logged into FB to send her a message.
I feared that he would ruin her life, Sir.
Now he has done it.
- Where did you go away?
I must ask you that.
Do you know how long I had waited for you near coffee shop?
We went to the next coffee shop as this was full.
We called you on phone and it was switched off.
Rithika said you know the place and you had come not finding us there.
Why did you switch off your mobile?
Why would I do so?
Battery down!
We waited some time for you, You did not turn up.
I dropped her at home in an auto.
Actually I did not come with a plan.
- Plan?
Yes, Buddy.
They always roam with boys, They stay with them at nights.
Such girls will not set well for our Telugu culture.
Till now I enjoyed, You tow hereafter.
I must get rid of her using you as a bait.
Why are you sitting here?
I want to stay closer to him and get know his likes.
What would you do by knowing his likes?
You did not come yesterday, I talked to him for long time.
He has good command over all the subjects.
I am also good in all the subjects.
Boo!
You failed in 6 out of 8 subjects.
Are you going to teach me?
I got irritated hearing Rithika praising him so much.
I got really angry.
The girl is foolish!
Why is everyone laughing?
I am much better than her, Buddy.
I was watching Gorilla picture in the book and I...
What would he think about me?
Are you worried about what would he think of you?
That is why girls are called mad!
- What?
Why are you getting angry?
He played a scene in pub that day, Will you consider him as a hero?
He knows only two things about Bangalore.
Girls and wine!
Do you know what was the bet he had with me?
- What?
That he had trap and have you.
You are lying.
It is my duty to warn as your friend.
If you are still interested in him.
I will not talk to him anymore.
I was very happy that day.
Because she believed everything I told about Prabhu.
At that time, I got a call that my mother is not well.
I left to my hometown that night.
I came back to Bangalore after few days.
I was in a hurry to leave my bag in PG and propose to Rithika.
How could she fall for him?
That is what I too do not know sir.
- Did you come just now?
Yes.
You could have knocked the door, Right?
I could take everything easily but he asked me to knock the door.
That I could not digest so easily.
- You carry on.
I do not know what he did with her in the gap I was not in town.
The girl who said she will not talk to him was saying I love to him.
Even after this, Why did you still support him?
Whatever it may be, Rithi is my girlfriend.
So I tried to be closer to them and separate them.
One night Prabhu came home after getting wet in rain.
I told you to come home on time for dinner.
You go aunty, I will eat.
If you come late again, No food and I will not open the gate too.
Did you enjoy with your girl.
- What happened?
That day his face.
Prabhu came home that night with severely hurt face.
I thought it was some serious problem.
But what that problem was.
Looking the Facebook updates, I am sure it is love matter.
There was a case pending on him, It is over now.
Checked his family, Sir.
His sister's husband is a criminal lawyer in Chennai.
He beat an SI, He was slapped with a case.
SI?
It was closed 4 months ago.
What are you saying?
Why did not you tell your daughter loved and eloped with him?
I do not know what you are telling.
Cannot I know this if you do not tell me?
I lost precious time because you lied to me.
Still I cannot forget that press meet.
Do not talk without proof.
- Look at this proof, Sir!
Entire media turned against me after beating up a reporter.
If they come to know that my daughter has eloped with a boy in this situation.
Fearing press would use it against me, I lied to you.
I made a mistake, you must help me out of this, That is all.
3 months ago, one night I was coming back from a meeting.
It was pouring!
I could not see anything clearly on road.
A boy asked lift then!
Stop the car.
I and my girlfriend were coming, My bike broke down.
If you give us lift till that junction.
I do not mind if I am alone, My girlfriend is with me!
Okay, Get in.
My father!
I wanted to kill him there itself!
I did not want to do anything before my daughter and left him.
I made a mistake.
I thought of sending Rithika to my sister place.
My sister said she would take her after the exams.
Today is the last exam.
I wanted to send her there today evening.
Meanwhile this happened.
You must catch her before noon!
- Before noon?
Why?
My daughter would complete
I told you it was kidnap so that you had taken immediate action.
Why are you worried, Sir?
You can do anything if you decide.
If this matter leaks out.
Though she is my daughter, If I keep her locked in home.
Press will mar my political career and social reputation.
That is why!
You file the case.
- No, Do it secretly.
This is not kidnap but your personal issue.
I saved you from false encounter case.
I can get the same encounter case reopened.
I want my daughter back.
Blocked all roads between Bangalore and Tamil Nadu.
Check all the vehicles going to Tamil Nadu.
Keep a watch on all the vehicles.

I thought they would have made a big plan after kidnapping your daughter.
But kids do not know they would get caught for booking tickets on their names.
What happened?
One of our men is standing near book shop.
He is in civil dress.
Two officers are on platform 4 in uniform.
Remove all officers in uniform.
Officers in civil dress carry on.
Check all the passengers of that age group.
How much more time is there for the train to start?
Just 8 more minutes only.
How much more time is left?
- Just 5 minutes only.
But those boys have not yet turned up here.
They may come in at the last moment.
4 boys resembling the suspects are entering from other side.
Go!
When are you coming?
- Shortly!
Uncle has brought a cake.
- Give the phone to your mother.
Come quickly.
- Give the phone to your mother.
Mother!
- Tell me, do not run, Arjun!
How many times I have told you not to let him call me on phone?
He did it on his own, Where are you?
- I am on duty.
You went on getting call from Avinash.
- How can I foresee things?
It was an emergency, I had to do it.
Okay, do not get tensed, When are you coming back?
I cannot tell.
He would get disappointed if you fail to come.
My son birthday is important to me also.
Will you come before his friends come, Right?
He is asking, When will you come home?
I will come after finishing my duty.
If they do not go by train, How would they go, Sir?
Buddy!
Give me your phone, Rithika.
Sit inside.
SI took your husband, Right?
- Yes.
How can he deny now?
Okay, I will take care of it.
Why do you always pick up fight with police?
I can spend my life without going to police station.
But he must come to the court every week, Right?
He must be scared.
You do not worry.
Your husband will in home by evening.
- Okay sir.
Brother-in-law.
- What happened?
I am bringing her.
- Where are you now?
In a tea stall in Hoskote junction.
First come out of that state.
We will take Malur road and reach Hosur road.
That is long route, Right?
- No, Brother-in-law.
They would have come to know we are not travelling by train.
So they would search all the roads thoroughly.
Everyone knows NH4 is the shortest route.
So, they would check thoroughly there.
They would not bother about Hosur road.
They would not expect we would take that road.
Had you shown this intelligence in studies, It would have been better!
I did not hear properly, Brother-in-law.
I said had you shown this intelligence in studies, It would have been better!
Okay, come carefully.
Alert the Hosur check post.
Inform Hoskote police station.
MMS the photos of these four boys to patrol Inspectors.
Keep tracking this number.
He is constable Adhi!
He got an award for discipline from Commissioner.
Buddy, Let us go.
It is not good to stay here for long.
Sit, they switched off the phone.
They will switch it on again like they did now, Keep tracking.
They changed the SIM but they do not know we can track with IMI number.
Little boys!
Hey idiot, do not give me a running commentary.
Trace their where about.
SMS me their new number.
We got trapped!
Be silent, do not get tensed.
Before police find them, Many get caught in fear.
They would have many other things to do than catching us.
Be casual.
What?
- Trying to be casual.
Do you have Nokia charger?
- Charge it there.
Why are you doing this?
If he is casual, we will get caught.
Let us go.
This cell is in Hoskote junction.
I will find the exact address and inform you, Sir.
Whose bike is that?
- Mine sir.
They would have tapped your phone by now.
They would have tightened checking in Malur road.
Nh4 would be empty.
We can get away safely.
Even if we change the SIM, they will track phone with IMI number.
That is why I changed the SIM and left the phone in tea shop.
Track with IMI number.
We can find the handset number with SIM.
Every handset has a unique number.
That is IMI number, Sir.
If we have the IMI number, we can find all the numbers of sim's used in it.
We can find the present handset number with SIM card number.
We can find numbers of SIMs used in it.
Call history of incoming and outgoing calls are in the registry.
It is like a chain reaction, Sir.
Within hours, we can track his friends, Relatives numbers.
Got the number?
I got 28 numbers tracking IMI number of that SIM.
4 of them are Chennai numbers.
One number was activated just 30 minutes ago.
Someday your father has to accept it.
You do not worry.
Who knows this number, Buddy?
Let us switch off the phone, Buddy.
Congratulations for buying a new SIM.
I am ACP Manoj!
Tell me.
- You know what would happen if you kidnap an underage girl?
7 years in jail!
Sir is very near the criminal cell ID!
His father has lodged a complaint.
If he lodges a complaint with police.
Everyone would know his daughter has eloped with someone.
So, I am sure her father would not have lodged a complaint.
Sir and accused are in same cell ID.
Without a complaint, Without an FIR.
Tapping a girl phone, Tracing my phone.
I think you know it is a crime!
Do not get into trouble in trying to save him.
If you leave the girl now.
If not I will catch you.
First catch me, then think about spoiling my life.
You and accused are in the same cell ID, Sir.
Where exactly he is?
- Just 300 metres ahead of you, Sir.
Signal is coming from the same spot for quite some time.
Police are catching accused by tracing the mobile.
If we do not switch off the phone, We are in trouble.
He switched it off.
Nobody can track us anymore.
I have kept the alarm at midnight 12 pm.
After that it is 1 am!
Dhananjay from Hoskote sir.
I saw the boys you had sent the photos.
Did you catch the...
- No, I did not get the MMS by then.
Did you note down their bike numbers?
Not bike, they went in a car, Sir.
- Car?
Yes, Black colour, Sedan type car.
Tamil Nadu registration.
Inform highway patrol.
Block the roads.
They tracked our new number, They know we are on NH4.
Our boys are going on bikes, Right?
Tell them to inform if there is any checking.
Stop that black car and check the documents.
They are checking only black cars, Buddy.
May be they know about the car.
- Check if the phone is on.
Karthik has sent a message.
They are stopping all black cars and checking on highway.
Umesh is in his home, Right?
- Yes.
Message him to come to Bangarapet bus stand.
A message has been sent to Bangarapet from the cell I am tracking.
It says buddy, Come immediately to Bangarapet bus stand.
Those boys...inform patrol, I am reaching there.
You do not worry, There will not be any problem.
If you are with me, I will not face any problem in life, I know it.
Umesh is here!
Get down and take the bike.
We have stopped the car, Sir.
- Those boys?
There was only one boy in it.
Tell sir, Where are the others?
I do not know sir, Even if I know why should I tell you, Sir?
Tell me!
- Do not beat me!
Tell me...
- Do not beat me, Sir.
I do not know where did they go?
Please do not beat me, Sir.
I know sir...
I know...
I will tell you.
Ajay sent me a message an hour ago, Sir.
Told me to come to Bangarapet bus stand.
They gave me the car, Prabhu and Rithika boarded the train, Sir.
Which train?
- I do not know sir.
Brindavan express!
They are travelling in unreserved compartment.
Is that Brindavan express?
- Yes sir.
Which is the next station?
- Kuppam sir, 18 Kms!
All friends help if it is love.
This is not just love, there is a lot behind this.
One day Prabhu came home completely getting wet in rain.
What happened, Buddy?
Bike broke down and he asked lift from her father.
What about Rithi?
- Let us see.
We will know if she comes to college tomorrow.
If her father does not let her to go to college.
I do not think so.
What do you know about her father?
He is very dangerous man.
I am sure he will not let Rithika attend college.
Do you know how well I looked after till she was my friend?
Now, her life is ruined because of you.
Hey ulcer!
Shut up!
Whatever it is, Let us face it, Let us see what he is up to!
If he reacts overly, Let us take away the girl, Okay?
Are you drunk?
- Not much.
As Deepak said Rithika father did not allow her to attend college.
Prabhu was upset.
Why you are dull, buddy?
Why?
Our team has won!
His girl is locked in her house, How can he be happy?
What?
That is why we are sad!
- ls not it?
Shall we have drinks?
I will sponsor the drinks today.
- You?
Prabhu got drunk that day.
- Buddy, Please listen to me.
Celebrating his birthday today is resident of Srirampuram.
Man of steel...
Our lion...
S P Ramachandran!
MLC!
We wish him a long life...
A shocking news to the younger brothers of big brother!
Drinks are free!
Idiot!
Did you bring us so far for this?
How can I be silent if drinks are free?
Never waste your parents hard earned money, Buddy
She is scratching me with her eyes...
The girl with mischievous eyes...
She looking on me like a rainbow...
She is a smashing sultry siren...
In her youth...
In the size of exotic sweet...
When she walks, Men fall flat in dozens...
On the road to Gajuwaka chimes of her anklets...
She is sending messages with her silver anklets...
Under the beam of light house, She is baiting with her beauty...
He is killing us!
- I will abuse him wildly.
He is giving us free drinks, Be silent, Boys.
She is trapping me with the bait of her beauty...
A beautiful angel from the heaven...
She is dazzling me like the magical deer...
She is an epitome of beauty...
Girl from Kothapeta who charmed me...
Bloody!
My friend is sad here with love failure.
Are you boasting about your love story?
What is your friend name?
- Prabhu!
Why?
Give me his complete details.
She trapped Prabhu with her eyes...
She is now trapped in a cage...
He is not able to see her...
Her silver anklets have gone silent...
The love for her is taking his life...
Her heart is in pain without her lover...
Nobody can stop the meeting of two hearts...
You are happy if you forget your sorrows...
I will unite you both, You enjoy your drink...
What?
- You are drunk!
Rithika called, she says she will die if she will not see me now.
She is crying.
I am very sad.
I must see her now, Buddy.
Buddy, you do not feel, I will take you to her.
Buddy, I will unite you both.
If we get caught, We will be in deep trouble.
You will get the stick.
If you are a friend, Help his love.
I will not come, if you want you carry on.
I will not come.
But do not worry because it is tall.
I will lift you up!
All the best, Buddy!
Buddy, we had too many drinks, Let us go to our room.
I am not drunk.
- Buddy has gone alone.
We are his support.
We are unable to stand, How can we support him?
I will never again drink.
Buddy!
Did you talk to her?
- Do not shout.
He is giving flying kiss, He is very happy.
Tell sister to be brave!
Did you tell sister that I have promised to unite you both?
Good omen!
Lights are switched on!
- Get down!
Catch them!
- Someone is there, Catch him!
Look there!
For him room or road is same.
I think we will get thrashed, Buddy!
Do you need this?
Cannot you attend college and go home silently?
Why do you befriend such guys?
Okay, go home.
All other were beaten up by police except me.
Go home!
Go home I say!
I did not enter your college, Right?
On Rithika father orders.
All the boys were humiliated and made to stand at college gate in briefs!
Is my pot belly seen, Buddy?
You should be ashamed to support such wastrels.
Because did not work out for 4 days, So...
College management tried to stop this.
But Inspector did not listen.
I informed Prabhu brother-in-law and asked him to come.
He is a famous lawyer in Chennai.
I am leaving because Magistrate told me, If not it would have been a big case.
You must enter the city only to write exam.
If you stay back even for a day, I may have to arrest you.
I know all that, You complete the formalities.
Tell them to sign this.
It says he has no connection with that girl.
Thank God, You signed.
I feared you would say love is more important like in films.
They would have thrashed us again.
Push him out of the running car.
- What happened?
Is he a friend?
Her father used his power to ruin their education.
Threatened the house owner and got them vacated the place.
How can we spare him easily?
Instead of supporting, Why is he making fun of him?
Prabhu!
Does she love you?
Tell me.
If not why would she call him to home at 2 am, Sister.
Elope with her, Let us face the problem later.
Yes sister, only if he elopes with the girl, Her father would get...
He is already not in good mood, Are you making things worse?
You saw how they thrashed my brother, Did not you?
For that if he elopes with her, Will that be enough?
Just now I got the old cases against him closed.
Are you inciting him again?
- What do you say, Prabhu?
They are facing problems because of me, Sister.
Leave it.
Forget it, Let us get her.
Buddy, we must not spare him.
He must get back double what we got!
Brother-in-law, Puneet is going back to Bangalore.
I am going back, Uncle.
- Okay.
I have decided to bring her.
- Do not talk mad.
We solved what could have become a big issue.
Forget the girl.
- She threatens to die without me.
I promised to stand by her through thick and thin.
Do you want to me give up now?
- If not what can you do?
Do you have the capacity to look after her?
You have not yet finished your studies.
There will not be a foolish man than me if I do that.
Whatever you say is wrong, Do not mistake me for hurting you.
You are still a dependent on me.
Is it necessary to bring that girl and marry her?
He says he will bring her.
Did he say he will marry now and have kids?
After this year exam, They are sending her to another place.
She is safe if we bring her here before that happens.
She will be a guest here till he settles.
After that we friends planned to take Rithika to Chennai.
Friends?
Train is slowing down for signal.
- Is it?
Watch him, do not let him call his friends.
How to reach unreserved compartment?
- You cannot go sir.
Can we cut and open the AC compartment?
Next station?
- Two.
Will this stop?
- It will stop sir.
What happened?
Arrange a vehicle in Kuppam Railway station.
Kuppam railway station?
Your daughter is travelling with them in Brindavan express.
You said they are in centre, Now you say they are in train.
You want me to arrange a vehicle in Kuppam station.
What is this?
- I am also in the same train.
I will come with your daughter as soon as train stops.
Vehicle must be there in 15 minutes.
- Manoj, Do anything.
But keep it away from public attention.
If a girl is taken away, There will public attention.
You cannot understand the seriousness.
Do whatever you can but my daughter must come home.
That is all!
Someone please come here.
Who is there in Kuppam?
Venkat Rao, Sir.
Send a vehicle immediately to Kuppam station, AC is arriving.
Give the vehicle to him.
Is not your home near Kuppam station?
- Yes, First left opposite the station.
My vehicle will be parked outside.
Send the vehicle to station.
- It will be there in 2 minutes, Sir.
Do not get tensed, We can get away.
Prabhu, I am thirsty.
Leave my hand.
- Who are you?
Where are you taking me?
- Leave my hand.
If you call him, I will kill him.
Who are you?
Where are you taking the girl?
I will not go to my home.
I will be happy with him.
I will do anything, Who are you to stop me?
No, I will stay with him only, Leave me.
If you pull it will hurt your hand but not open.
If I do not hand cuff you, you would try to escape or fall down.
You may hurt yourself.
How could this happen, Buddy?
- Do not know who took her?
He appeared like a police man.
I am sure he was sent by her father.
Buddy, whichever route from here touches AP in 20 Kms.
It is difficult if we do not do anything, Buddy.
Your father would be worried, I will tell him we are coming home.
Do not you know this?
Both brothers are fools.
What happened?
Your daughter is with me, Talk to her.
Rithi, My child!
I have switched on the speaker, Talk to her.
Why do not you talk to me, Child?
No!
No, My dear.
I did this for you...
This is common for next few days.
At this age you feel love is more important.
You would take any risk for it.
You would regret for what you did now.
Because you wish for status in society then.
You have to plan the future of your children.
You need money for it.
I am not saying he will not earn well.
But the life your father gave you, He cannot afford in his life.
If you had eloped with him.
Your father political life would have got ruined.
I do not know why people become selfish in love?
It is not your mistake to select your life partner.
But it needs age and maturity to decide.
He could not protect you, He left as easily as I caught you.
He will come for me.
You do not believe truth but believe dreams that will never come true.
Your friend Deepak told me different things.
Trusting that idiot Deepak's words I avoided Prabhu.
Deepak went to his hometown at that time.
Will you pay my fee too?
Long queue.
I am not a betrayer!
Only we Telugu boys come to party without girlfriends.
We are changing history, Let us impress any girl today.
What do you say, Buddy?
Do not worry about it, come, Drink and enjoy!
Nothing short is advices.
Do not stop me from drinking...
Looks like 'Patalabhairavi' film set.
Do not forget, you are not drinking today.
Okay?
- Have drinks.
Why?
- Have it.
- No.
Have it.
I told you not to drink, Right?
- Cheap creep!
Buddy, Drinks are great the day you do not drink.
That is why I told you!
He comes wherever I go.
Health is wealth.
- Drink silently.
Everyone enjoying but I am...
Deepak told me about you, How cheap you are!
Let us talk tomorrow, You are drunk.
Who?
Me?
- Yes, go.
But health is wealth, You must not drink, Okay?
Okay, go.
You know well.
- You will fall!
I have fallen already.
This angle is better.
You are also drunk.
Go home.
I made a mistake trusting you to be a good boy.
What would have happened if I did not have a friend like Deepak?
Are you mad?
Then?
We met about 10 times in 6 months.
You believed I am a good man in this short period.
Someone told you something and you believed him also.
If not mad what else should I call you then?
You came to me and talked to me.
I did not come to you and talked to you.
Go!
I will go out for a smoke.
Health is wealth, you must not drink, Okay?
Do not kill me, Buddy.
Do you have match box?
Tell me, Aunty.
Where you, Rithika?
- Check all the pubs.
I am in Nisha house.
- Good, You are not outside, Right?
No, why are you asking, Aunty?
Just like that, come home quickly.
Tomorrow I am going to hit headlines.
You say health is wealth every 5 minutes.
How concerned you are about his health, Buddy?
Get lost!
Rs.5000 spot fine for drunken driving.
He must drive the bike.
If he drinks and drives the bike, I have to pay the fine.
If he does not drink, I will save my money.
His health is my wealth.
Got it?
Give me the peg.
Go out...
Go out...
All of you go out!
Do I have to tell you individually?
- All of you leave the place!
Be silent, do not go out.
- Go!
Stop the music!
Who the hell is that talking about police?
No drinks here!
What are you looking at?
Get going!
Go...
Go...
Go out!
I have a small peg.
Are not you ashamed?
Boys are going out leaving drinks.
Are you so special?
Go out!
How dare you beat me!
I will strip her!
How dare she beats me!
Do not touch girls, It is wrong.
Get out!
Take them out.
Bring them.
Bring all of them.
I do not care who you are, Shut up!
You must be as we like you to be in our place!
Block all the entrances.
Do not let anyone to escape.
Bring all of them here.
Stay here till media people arrive.
Tie the knot or else tie a Rakhi.
How dare you beat me and escape!
Come on, Beat me now!
Nisha, Come!
Wait, I will also come with you.
They are my father party men.
If they see me here, I will be in trouble.
Emergency is here!
That side!
No police case, Please doctor.
It is an emergency case, I must submit accident case report.
Call her parents.
We went to the party without informing parents.
You ruin girls' lives by teaching all this for your advantage.
Call her parents.
- Her parents.
She is Avinash Patel daughter.
- What?
Politician Avinash Patel daughter!
Children are the biggest problems of VIP.
He says cannot tell anything till an hour.
Why are you standing here?
Sit down.
Tell me.
- I have brought the car.
Have you come?
I am waiting at a tea shop opposite the hospital.
I am coming.
Would you like to have tea or coffee?
It is hot, Be careful.
They would not have started the treatment if I had not told your father name.
That is why I used it.
It is good at least for once his name is used for doing good.
How much?
I liked the way he handled the situation that night.
Presence of mind?
Do you know how many problems your father faced for that?
Thank God, You were there!
Had you not been there, do not know what would have happened to us!
I will never again go to such places in my life.
Life is bore without these things, Right?
Nothing is wrong if you are within limits.
Are you always like this?
- Like this?
Balanced and matured!
Like a professor.
Tell me, Aunt.
I am coming with Nisha from her house, Aunt.
You ruined my image and then lying!
Ask her where did she go?
I was in Nisha house, Aunt.
Lie...
She is lying!
- Why are you getting so angry?
She will not stay here, Take her back to your place.
Let her finish the studies.
- Is she studying?
Failed in all subjects.
Did I ever tell you I wanted to study engineering?
You got me admitted fearing it is an insult to you.
Why are you arguing with him?
What has happened now to get so angry?
You keep quiet.
Children are like that now.
Press man was attacked for asking questions.
I have the proof!
Change the channel.
Last night your daughter got arrested in last night raid.
She was admitted in hospital and got treated for drug overdose.
Do not accuse without any proof!
Attacking a press person made media to turn against him.
On the occasion of Valentine day.
Condemning the celebrations in Bangalore.
Workers of the party attacked celebrations in many places.
When a reporter asked about his daughter getting admitted for drug overdose.
Unable to control himself, He attacked the reporter.
Let us see the report sent by our reporter.
- No aunty!
They did not allow my friend in hospital.
So, I used dad name.
I advise everyone how to raise children, I have a good for nothing daughter.
If she stays here, I cannot be in politics.
Take her with you to village.
- Just another year only.
She must have a degree at least for namesake on wedding invitation.
Let her finish the studies.
He was more concerned about his political career than me.
Why?
Nisha wanted to talk to you.
Nisha wants to go out with you.
- Let us go.
Let us go together.
Not with me, she wants to go out with you alone.
- Is it?
I told her you will not go out with others except me.
What do you want me to do now?
You do whatever you feel like.
- Where is she?
I told Prabhu to do whatever he feels like doing.
But when he went to talk to Nisha...
Because Nisha is very out spoken girl.
Because there is a good chance she would like Prabhu.
Who are you?
Are you breathe that I do not see?
You won over this girl...
I like you...
Why?
- I forced you to lie.
I cannot say it is a lie.
I mean what you told her.
- Why I told her is true!
Have you trapped the girl?
- Get lost!
Carry on!
If boy and girl talks, They will blabber nonsense.
Your eyes are pulling me...
Drowning me in your love...
It has made me walk along with you as your shadow.
Are you a gentle rain in mild sun?
Are you fire to warm in chill winter?
Are you my first love?
Let us meet tomorrow.
I have special class, Inform dad.
My driver has not come, Can you give me lift?
You be on your job, We will be on our job.
Wherever I fly in sky, I am always with you...
Let me make your heart my permanent residence...
I will never go away from you...
- Our hearts came closer slowly...
Your fingers made friends with my fingers.
Today is my mother death anniversary.
13th year!
When she died, it seems I slept near her body thinking she is sleeping.
Her body was very cold.
I do not remember her smell, Her words or anything about her.
I am still scared when I think about it.
Finding it difficult to raise me without mother.
Dad put me in International boarding school
In that school, Chillness that reminds me of my mother.
Insecure feeling of not having mother.
Though there were many, I always felt I am alone and scared.
To get out of that fear, I created a friend Teddy.
Though I had friends like Deepak...
Nobody else gave it.
You have given me that feeling of security now.
I feel I will not face any problem in life if you are with me.
Sometimes I feel like I am talking to myself when I talk to you.
I do not know if you like me or not.
Am I spending so much time without liking you?
You told me how much you like me.
But I cannot tell how much I like you or how important you are to me.
I will look after you that you will never feel insecure again in life.
Come what so ever it may!
I will be with you only!
When your breathe touched me, It smashed my shyness...
When your fragrance reached me, My thoughts went berserk...
My heart has become a boat...
- It moved as water agitates..
Whether it reaches shore or your lap, Where would it go...
You came for me only, You protected me like eye lid...
You won over me, I like you...
You go, I will come with my friend.
Come in, Rithika.
Wont your PG owner raise objections?
No, she will not, Come in.
I told you many times not to bring guests, Prabhu.
In these past few days, I am getting strange thoughts.
I am thinking about you only all the time.
If you are with me, my life...
- I must throw out these PG boys.
Just four of them are enough.
Wait for 5 minutes, I will change and come.
Let us go out and talk.
You are emotional, It is not good to stay here.
Let us go out.
- I am not here just to talk to you.
I desire to do that more than you.
But,
You always advice!
But this boring person is the man I like most in this world.
You have to know much about me.
When my friend father was building a house with his retirement benefits.
That area is SI tortured him for bribe.
Friend father attempted suicide.
One day I and my friend together bashed up that SI!
My friend family completed the house.
But the case filed by SI is carrying on.
I will go to court every 2 months.
I do not know when the case will end.
You do not need to tell me this but you told me.
That is why I like you!
If you are with me.
I can understand that.
But we must not regret in future what we do now.
That is why I am telling you.
What happened?
Why are you crying?
I would have done anything for him that moment.
Prabhu too knew this.
But he never wanted to take advantage of the situation.
He explained to me everything clearly.
Come in, Buddy!
Have you come just now?
- Yes.
You could have knocked the door, Right?
Okay, I will wait outside.
Do not meet him, He has told me very bad about you.
He is very bad man.
He likes you so much, Unable to express it, He tells lies.
Basically he is good man.
You are a good man!
From what you said about him, I do not think he loves you.
He is trying to exploit you.
If what you say is true.
When I told him to take me away from here.
After my exams, Dad is sending me to my aunt house.
But today he gave my passport to someone and was talking about visa.
Please take me away from here.
I am scared I may never see you again in life.
I am not here to take you with me.
You threatened to die if you donot see me, So I am here.
If you die, I will not die.
But it will hurt me all my life.
Is that okay to you?
I wish to be with you and be happy all my life.
I will always be with you.
But never do anything in haste.
He told me to wait for few days and went out.
My father and his men handed him over to police.
He sent me message of taking me with him on after last exam.
Got scared?
Come.
He planned everything.
That is why I am telling you, He will surely take me away from you.
Girls can never understand this!
Do you think boyfriend is superhero?
He will definitely come.
Move!
No sir!
Leave him sir!
Get in, I will not harm you.
Fix the Stepney!
Fix it!
He is my dad henchman, He will not harm me.
You do not worry.
Is it?
Fix it!
You are a boy!
How dare you beat me!
Hardly the size of my finger how dare you make me run from state to state!
He will not die, He will be okay after sometime.
Then, you have to worry about him.
Where are you?
Tried a little while ago but got switched off message.
What happened?
I was in Kuppam.
- Kuppam?
What are you doing there?
Avinash sir.
It is big love story here.
Like us?
- No, Not like us.
Kids!
Why should we bother?
They will take care of themselves.
Do not tell Arjun about the surprize gift.
I will not tell him, You come home and tell him.
Okay, I will come.
Blade is also very small!
But the power is in where it is placed!
Release her.
You need at least 30 seconds to pick gun and shoot me.
But I need just 3 seconds to cut your neck.
Bring it here.
Hand cuff him.
you are making a mistake.
You go!
Do not go with him!
Brother, Come here!
Call Chittoor Shekar Babu and tell him to track Prabhu voice.
Why should we do that sir?
He is a criminal, Sir.
He threatened me with a blade on my neck.
Why should he give you a shave now, Sir?
Shut up!
Do what I say!
Tell Shekar Babu to track Prabhu voice immediately.
I do not hear you, Sir.
Bloody idiot!
- Now I can hear you sir.
Tell Shekar to track Prabhu voice.
I will tell him, Sir.
Tell me, Sir.
- You have to track a voice.
No sir, I do not do that, Sir.
Do not lie to me because I am on phone.
Very urgent, Why would I ask you if not?
AC sir wants you to do it immediately.
How can I do it immediately, Sir?
I will ask my man and tell you, Sir.
Give me little time, Sir.
Need to track a voice, how much time it would take?
If we have the voice sample, We can do it in 2 hours.
Send me voice sample, I will do it in 2 hours.
Send your mail ID, I will send the voice sample.
Tell me, Parvathi!
we are ready here.
We can start if you come.
I will come quickly.
Are his friends there?
They are here for an hour now.
Arjun is waiting for you near gate.
You start, I will join you.
If you had told me you are not coming.
I would have prepared him mentally for this.
He told his friends that he would cut cake after you come.
Give the phone to Arjun!
Daddy!
It seems he will not talk to you on phone.
He wants you in home immediately.
At least try to keep up the promise you made to him.
No Parvathi, Actually.
I have set it, Sir.
We can catch him if talks from anywhere in this world.
What happened, Rithika?
Relative would have come to know this by now.
My family is facing a big problem because of me.
Do you want to talk to them?
- With my aunt!
Will you not answer my calls?
Even if I bring your daughter, I am not sure she will stay with you.
What are you saying?
He is not leaving her.
- Tell me clearly.
Your daughter has run away with him again.
She was with you, Right?
Yes, but not now.
Tell me if you cannot do it, I will deal it differently.
You do not get tensed, Sir.
You cannot understand this, Come with my daughter.
If you cannot Kill my daughter too along with that boy.
Her death is acceptable to me than her living with a boy from there.
Give me little time, Sir.
I will call you later.
I am Prabhu here!
One minute!
Rithika wants to talk to you.
- We have located the boy, Sir.
He is around here only, Sir.
You inform local station and send men.
This is unofficial deal, Finish it with your men.
Aunty.
It is here, Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
- Look at these photos.
No aunty, He will look after me very well, Aunt!
Do not cry, you wanted to talk to her, Right?
He is here.
Where did you go away?
How long should we have to wait for you?
I got cheap liquor on the way, I had few pegs.
What is this drinking without seriousness?
We drink to be jolly, Right?
Stop...
Stop...
- Why?
Are not they those boys?
Yes...
Yes...
- Let us go, we are in trouble.
Rithika, Come!
Go quickly!
Go left...
Go left.
Go quickly!
Hit them!
Go fast!
Take right!
- He must not escape!
They are going away, Go fast!
Hit...
Hit them!
They are going away!
- Let us enter the town!
Go...
Go fast!
Where is Murali?
Call AC!
He is calling!
Tell me, Buddy!
Give the phone to Prabhu!
- Prabhu?
Your friend Murali has met with an accident.
He is with me now.
His condition is very serious.
Must start the treatment immediately.
Whether he lives or dies is in your hands.
If you do as I say, He would live.
Buddy, that crook is lying!
He beat Murali and took his phone to cheat us.
Where are you going?
What will you do?
I will check him, he followed us, Right?
If you do as I say, It is good for you.
I want the girl.
Hand over her to me and take your friend.
That girl or your friend?
What happened?
- Tell me.
Buddy...
Bike...
- What happened?
Bike is smashed to pieces!
Murali blood is all over the road!
All vehicles are passing over it.
Do not know what has happened to him, Buddy?
Nobody is there to inquire.
They threw away the bike on road side.
I am scared, what should we do if he is really hurt?
Murali has net with an accident, Brother-in-law.
Oh no!
Did you call the ambulance?
Did you check if there is any hospital nearby?
I do not know.
The police officer called me.
Murali is with him.
He wants me to come to Chittoor bypass road immediately with Rithika.
You stay there, I will send someone to you.
What if anything happens to Murali by then?
Nothing will happen to him.
Do not go alone to the place he has called.
Friends are with me, Brother-in-law.
Whatever it is, Let us do it after midnight.
Do not waste time, Go with her.
We will take care of Murali.
All of you are in trouble because of us.
Enough!
Are you going to hand over Rithika to him?
Did we take all risk for this?
- He made us stand in briefs!
He go it published in paper and embarrassed us.
He must know that pain!
If people come to know his daughter has eloped with one of us.
His political career would end!
He cannot do anything after that.
We took this risk for that not for your love.
Rithika, Do not mistake us.
Your love too is important to us.
You do not get worried, Carry on, We will take care of Murali.
I will go back, Prabhu!
I came with you to live happily all my life.
If we go away and if anything happens to Murali.
We have to spend all our lives with that guilt.
I will go back.
Stop Prabhu!
There will be another way to reach main road.
It is dark, we cannot see anything.
Look there!
- They are here!
I will call you later, Parvathi!
I am busy!
You made Arjun cry on his birthday, What is so important work?
Do not talk without knowing the seriousness, It is very important work.
Is it that important to catch two lovers?
You wasted an entire day.
You do not understand, He is not a good boy.
My father too said the same thing about you.
Leave...
Leave...
Leave me...
He tried to kill me.
How can I leave him?
They are doing what we did when we were young!
Is it right if you love and wrong if others do it?
Leave me!
I do not have time to hear your lecture, I will call you later.
Please listen to me.
I am scared!
Nothing will happen to you!
Come.
No other way, We must take Hosur road.
Come, Let us go!
What happened, Prabhu?
Come, Let us go.
He is here!
Come Prabhu!
Come, Let us go!
No need to run anymore, She has completed eighteen.
- Is it?
Should not I do anything if she has completed eighteen?
I will kill you here branding you as a terrorist.
If you want to kill, Do it.
I know you cannot kill me.
If you wanted to kill, You would have done it long back.
Do you know why you are unable to kill me?
Because you know I am not doing anything wrong.
Come with my daughter.
If you cannot Kill my daughter too along with that boy.
Mad man!
Your father will kill anyone for power!
But he is ready to die for you.
Go away!
Do not think it is happy ending if you elope with a girl?
You will face unknown problems!
Without parents support and without education.
Try living in this society!
You will know then.
That is why they say do not drink and drive!
First time you have said.
Previously on Defiance...
- Is it Saint Louis?
- Once.
Now we call it Defiance.
This town, it's a nice place to live.
So I keep hearing.
So my lawkeeper told me that he found you and the irathient girl in the Badlands.
She's my daughter.
Your daughter?
I have to thank the owner of McCawley mines,
Rafe McCawley, and his children,
Luke, Quentin, and Christie.
[Cheers and applause]
I'm going to gather up some muscle and pay Rafe McCawley a visit.
Our son is in love with the McCawley girl.
Would it not be something if Alak and Christie actually got married?
What's going on, Luke?
What do you got going?
I'll be home for dinner, okay?
[Impact]
Luke was murdered?
Whoever did this, we'll find 'em.
You killed my son!
- No!
Hey!
- Everybody needs to leave.
They're coming.
They're planning to attack right after dark.
[Laser shots]
Fire!
[Gunfire]
[Speaking native language]
Yeah!
How many dead?
41.
[Panting and whimpering]
[Indistinct chatter]
[Speaking native language]
[Speaking native language]
[Eerie animal calls]
[Screams]
[Speaking native language]
[Indistinct chatter]
[Chanting in native language]
[All chanting in native language]
[Speaking native language]
[Speaking native language]
[Chanting in native language]
What are they doing?
It's a Casti cleansing ceremony.
Looks like torture.
Yeah.
Thought we left that stuff behind in the Badlands.
[Chanting in native language]
[Screams]
Okay.
All right.
That's enough.
That's it.
You've had your fun.
Now you cut this man down.
This man is a deserter.
He threw down arms and ran from the Volge.
This man was brave to pick up arms in the first place.
Plenty of men lose their nerve the first time in combat.
Not Castithans.
In the laws of our God Rayetso, running from battle reflects upon the brothers of your liro, or caste.
This man Elah Bandik has taken the honor of every Castithan in Defiance.
This man?
This little man has taken the honor of every Castithan in Defiance?
Not that my people have to explain our religion.
But we do this for Bandik's own good.
- I'm sure.
- Without this ritual, his fesho will be denied passage to the afterlife.
I don't care.
I'm shutting it down.
No, don't, please.
I have no choice.
I must do this for my family.
[Speaking native language]
You cut that man down, or I'm dragging every one of you in.
And I'm starting with you.
What's going on here?
Madame Mayor.
I hope you've come to put a muzzle on your new lawkeeper.
Our understanding with your predecessor dates back to the founding of this town.
Do you intend to dismantle that understanding... three weeks into the job?
[Speaking alien language]
Keep this ceremony confined to the hollows.
Of course, Amanda.
Call me Mayor.
Put your gun away.
Come with me.
[Chanting in native language]
I'm sorry.
You seemed upset.
I've seen worse.
They're not bickering over the price of a roller.
They're torturing a man to death.
Nolan, you're from the outside.
I can imagine what this looks like.
I'm not sure you can.
You ever wonder why we have so few Irathients in Defiance?
What the hell does that have to do with anything?
Eight years ago, when Defiance was first founded, we had well over 1,000.
But for some reason they didn't believe in vaccinating their kids.
Mayor Nicky saw irathient kids dying for no good reason.
So they wrote mandatory vaccinations into the town charter.
Deputies went from house to house inoculating irathient children by force.
Irathients took up arms, and there was an uprising.
What happened?
They had clubs.
We had Vo-tech blasters.
What do you think happened?
Some were killed, and the rest left.
After that, the town council informally decided to allow the eight races to honor the traditional values of their own people.
All right.
You look me in the eye, you tell me you think what's going on back there is right.
It's necessary.
[Chanting in native language]
[Moans]
You're not gonna stop this?
- No, I am not.
- [Groans]
I'm not prepared to shoot up an entire town to rescue a man who says he doesn't want to be saved.
Besides, the lady Mayor promised she'd try and fix it.
Promises are shtako.
Yeah, well, it depends on the person making the promise.
Let's just take a beat, see what the lady Mayor's word is worth.
[All chanting in native language]
Time to wake up, Ben.
[Gasps]
[Shouting]
Vri-Tex?
You could have killed me with this.
My priority was to keep you from talking.
I wouldn't have betrayed you.
That's good, given what would happen to your family if you did.
Or if you fail a second time.
[Gasps]
Okay.
A second time?
I did everything you said.
I blew up the stasis net.
And yet the Volge were defeated, and the town is still standing.
They beat the Volge?
- How?
- Doesn't matter.
You remember the old plan?
The mines.
But couldn't that destroy the very thing you're trying to find?
I have faith.
You do as you're told.
No, no, no, I can't go through this again.
I didn't sign up for this.
You signed up for whatever it takes, Ben.
[Groaning]
[door opens]
[Door shuts]
[Pan clatters]
Hey, dad.
Decided to come home?
I saw you at the service for Luke yesterday.
I didn't know what to say, so I ducked you.
That was wrong.
With Luke gone, we need to set aside the small stuff and pull together.
Oh, you agreeing to marry Datak's kid, that's the small stuff I'm supposed to put aside?
Come on, dad.
Accept the olive branch.
Let's eat.
How am I supposed to eat when all I can see is that haint...
- Don't use that word.
- That Castithan putting his hands all over you?
You think that's what your dead brother would have wanted?
What he wanted doesn't matter anymore.
It's about what we want.
I'm in love with Alak Tarr, and I want to marry him.
Yeah?
Well, I want you to call off this wedding and come home.
And if I don't?
If you walk out that door again,
- there's no coming back.
- Dad.
[Door shuts]
Since mom died,
Christie's the only one been holding this family together, and, the one time she does something you don't like, you turn on her?
- Oh, but Luke...
- What about Luke?
Your brother was a good man.
Then why was he meeting alone in the woods with Ben Daris, guy who brought the Volge down on us?
[Hailer buzzes]
McCawley.
I'll be right there.
Quentin, get the roller.
There's been an explosion at the mine.
Your deputy's gonna be fine, but there's no sign of Ben Daris.
Took a hell of a chance busting him out in broad daylight.
Well, whoever jump-started him us Vri-Tex.
Dangerous drug used in combat medicine.
Could be ex-military.
Quentin McCawley just hailed.
There's been an explosion at the mine.
There you are.
Your friend Ben Daris attacked one of my guards, and stole a bunch of Gulanite, and went underground.
He blew the I-9 shaft behind him so we couldn't follow.
This is on you, Amanda, and you.
Let my son's murderer get loose.
We'll get him back.
How many miners did you have in the shaft?
None.
The shaft's abandoned.
Leads down to old St. Louis.
Old St. Louis?
When the alien Terraformers went crazy, most American cities were obliterated, but something strange happened to St. Louis.
The terraformed earth folded over the city and hardened before crushing it.
Some sections of the city are still intact, more or less.
Something's still not right.
What do you mean?
Well, with the stasis net down, what was to stop Ben escaping through the pass?
Why trap himself underground?
Well, he stole 20 kilos of Gulanite.
Wouldn't take more than two to blow that tunnel.
All right, so that's 18 kilos left.
That's enough to make a big bomb.
Not enough to do anything to Defiance.
Not from down there anyway.
He can tell us who's behind the Volge attack.
We need to go after him.
So how long to clear this?
Four hours minimum.
No, too long.
We need another way down.
Here.
- What's that?
- Rat's nest.
It's a maze down there.
Not to mention razor-sharp rocks and steep drop-offs.
Nobody bothered to map it since the I-9's always bigger and safer.
The map's in my head.
I discovered the rat's nest.
It's our best chance to get ahead of Ben Daris.
Quentin, go find Nak and Levon and a couple others and break out some rappelling gear.
No way.
Absolutely not.
Mm-mmm.
It's my tunnels, my men...
Yeah, how do I know you're not gonna find Ben
- and shoot him?
- My word.
Or is that all of a sudden not good enough for you?
I'll tag along with him, keep him honest.
No, no, no.
Listen, you're no miner.
It's too dangerous.
I'm not gonna get saddled with some topside flatfoot.
No offense, but I've done rougher descents during the war looking for underground bunkers.
20 scrip says my boots hit the ground first.
It's your ass.
No matter what, you gotta make sure that he doesn't kill Ben.
Man did kill his son.
- Had it been me...
- I know.
But we need him alive for questioning.
Our first priority is protecting this town.
I'll bring Ben back alive, I promise.
Nolan, don't risk your life for these people.
They're not worth it.
Oh, some of them are.
I need you to stay here and help Tommy figure out who set our fugitive free.
And you are to stay far, far away from Elah Bandik.
You hear me?
[Speaking native language]
[Speaking native language]
The humans find this sort of thing unseemly.
I don't care what the humans think.
But their opinions matter.
If they're against us, we'll never be able to take control of the McCawley mines.
I'm thinking about our son's future.
[Sighs]
Think of your life back on Casti.
You were at the bottom layer of the lowest caste.
Your life was degradation and poverty.
Is the Castithan way really something you're eager to preserve?
[Chuckles]
[Speaking native language]
What's going on?
It's Christie.
Rafe McCawley's messing with her mind.
I don't know what's gonna happen.
We may have to cancel the wedding.
Oh, honey.
Rafe McCawley needs a bullet in the head.
- Dad!
- He doesn't mean it.
Oh, I do.
You know what the hot water does to your father's disposition.
Mother will take care of everything.
Oh.
[Device beeping]
You got a fix on that Gulanite he's carrying?
Yeah, I do.
And he's not far.
Let's go and nail the bastard.
[Growls]
Welcome to old St. Louis.
It's about time I got my clutter out of here, give you a chance to put your stamp on this office.
And now that I'm retired,
I'm thinking of taking up golf.
Oh, I once had a three handicap.
And no one can say I didn't, because there's no one around except me who remembers the damn rules.
[Cries out]
Poor bastard.
He's been up there for three hours, hasn't he?
I hate this, Nicky.
I really do.
We have a town charter, and we haven't followed it for years.
It has to stop.
Castithans are tricky.
They're obsessive about their past, who their ancestors were, what liro they were born into.
They build their lives around ancient traditions that may once have had a purpose, but...
None of them can agree on what it was.
They sound a lot like us.
They've lost their past.
Blew up when their planet did.
These sad little displays in the street, that's all they've got left.
You try to take that away, it'll be the Iraths all over again.
I don't believe that.
Defiance has changed a lot in the past five years.
Look, we came together to fight the Volge and won.
I think we're building a bigger identity that's greater than human or Irath or Casti.
[Chuckles]
I'm going to miss you.
[Indistinct chatter]
Birch.
Did chivalry die in the Volge attack?
What's Ben's status?
He's underground and on his way.
We need to leave town now.
It should only take him two more hours to reach the target.
Well, he was injured.
He may fail.
He's motivated.
I made sure of that.
[Speaks alien language]
I take your word.
Before we leave, there are a couple of folks I want to say good-bye to.
You let yourself get too close to these people.
I grew up with them.
I saw their babies being born, saw them raised.
What I do I do for the benefit of all of us and because it must be done.
I take no pleasure in this, birch.
You know that.
- I know.
- [Engine turns over]
I just ran out of time, that's all.
No matter how much you get, it's never enough.
You okay there, old timer?
I'm fine.
All right, let's take a break.
Yeah, well, don't stop on my account.
I need water.
All right, everybody.
Take five.
Jefferson Park.
Hell, I haven't been here since I was nine.
- You were a local?
- Yeah.
I got to admit, though, it's all a bit hazy.
I do get the feeling my folks and I used to eat around here somewhere.
Probably golden's on the far side of the park.
That sounds right.
Best toasted ravioli in the state.
Pretty good gooey butter cake too.
Now that I remember.
[Chuckles] Right up there with penicillin for the world's greatest inventions.
I used to take Luke there when he was maybe three.
So what about your family?
What did they do before arkfall?
Dog food.
Dog food?
My family made dog food.
Wait, McCawley.
Your old man was...
Yes.
"Chow down" Brown McCawley.
How did that jingle go?
- I ain't singing it for you.
- [Laughs]
♪ Healthy pups can't get enough ♪
♪ they never wear a frown ♪
Forget it.
It's not happening.
♪ 'Cause it's chow down time ♪
♪ chow down time, it's always chow down time ♪
[Laughs]
Man, I cannot see you in the dog food business.
Oh, I wanted to be a photographer.
Sports stuff.
Some bikini stuff just for fun.
Why didn't you stick with it?
Well, I shot terraformed landscapes for a while, but I gave it up.
It was too depressing.
All it did was remind me of everything that the aliens took away.
Yeah.
So look, Rafe, I want to be clear.
This Votan we're chasing...
The one that killed my boy?
Is that the Votan we're talking about?
We need to bring him back alive.
- You know that, right?
- I don't know any such thing.
Predicting the future's a sucker's game.
You don't believe me?
Just take a look around you.

Wherever he is, he's close.
I don't remember those towers.
It's a nuclear plant.
Went up during the war.
[Mechanical sounds]
If Ben detonated the Gulanite in one of those reactors...
Radiation would get up through the tunnels in the rat's nest.
Radiation would kill everybody.

Penny for your thoughts.
That is what you humans say, yes?
My brother collected pennies.
The very old kind.
[Pouring]
Said the copper used to be worth more than the coins themselves.
You were just thinking of him, weren't you?
It is our duty to live our lives to the fullest... to honor those who have passed.
Which is why I was surprised to hear you're having second thoughts about the wedding.
I just want to slow down, take a pause.
Your father's putting that much pressure on you, is he?
He's sort of a jackass.
[Chuckles]
Most men are.
It's a characteristic that transcends species.
You can fight him if you want to.
I don't think I can.
Just before I left my home world, my parents went to great lengths to insure that I married a man that they deemed suitable.
At my side was a stranger, not very handsome.
But he came from the highest liro.
And he was a man of great honor.
My parents believed this man of great honor would keep me safe.
What happened?
I met someone else.
He was a scruffy young nobody, beautiful, dangerous, a wicked smile.
He'd won passage to Earth as payment for a gambling debt.
Datak.
He pursued me aggressively.
My betrothed was furious.
He challenged Datak to a Castithan blood duel.
So they fought?
They never got a chance.
On his way to the duel, my man of great honor was accidentally flushed out of an airlock.
It was a tragic accident.
How do you get accidentally...
Datak was a man I knew loved me beyond scope of reason.
He was a survivor, a man who would stop at nothing to keep us both safe.
I understood the man I needed in a way my parents could not.
Is this a true story?
[Giggles]
It's going to be a beautiful wedding.
Watch your step.
Keep your eyes open.
That's it.
Stay together.
I haven't been in here in a long time.
Still nothing?
[Gunfire]
[Moans]
[Device beeping]
Uh-uh.
That's it.
- Bomb's deactivated.
- Good.
Hey.
Hey.
We need this guy alive if we're ever gonna find out who the hell is behind all this.
You want to avenge Luke, I get it.
Rafe, you got Christie and you got Quentin sitting at home, and someone is doing their damnedest to destroy
- the town they live in.
- You know, Luke begged for his life like a little girl.
Hey, we need answers from this guy.
- I know what I'm doing, lawman.
- Do you want to know
- why he was helping me?
- Hey!
What, you trying to die for the cause?
It was because he needed money so he could get away from Defiance
- and get away from you.
- Rafe.
That's what's so laughable about all this.
You came down here to avenge poor, old Luke, and he hated your guts.
I mean, after what you did to his mother.
- Shut up!
- Hey.
Now you can do the right thing by your dead child or you can do the right thing by the two living ones, but you cannot do both.
Now you make your choice.
Right now.
[Gunshot]
Tell Amanda I'm sorry.
It's pretty quiet out there.
The Mayor said she'll be right over.
Maybe we'll be all right.
They'll come for him.
This was a mistake.
You were stupid to help me.
You made a move, and I backed you up.
That's what lawkeepers do.
Clancy taught me that.
You were stupid to listen to him.
Shtako.
How many?
I can see Datak and that bio-man.
You go around the side.
Hand over the coward.
I'm afraid we can't do that, Favi Tarr.
This is a Castithan matter and will be handled by Castithans.
If you take another step, my first bullet kills you.
Charming girl.
Now we can go around you or through you.
The choice is yours.
[Approaching vehicles]
All right, get Levon into the doctor.
All right, Rafe.
That's enough, Datak.
Irisa and Tommy were acting under my orders.
I've decided to pardon Elah Bandik of all violations of Castithan law.
Well, you don't have that power.
Well, if you take him, you're gonna have to shoot up this office and kill me.
What do you suppose is going on in there?
Nothing good.
Nak, you better come with us.
- It's not your fight, Rafe.
- Oh, yeah?
I owe you one, Nolan.
So what's it gonna be, Datak?
Pointless bloodshed or are we gonna work out our differences together, peacefully?
Madame Mayor, your passion has touched my heart.
We are indeed one community.
Enough blood has been spilled.
Tonight let us bury our dead with dignity.
And later, who knows?
Perhaps we can revisit these cultural differences with cooler heads.
[Speaking native language]
I'll see you at the wedding.
Appreciate the help, Rafe.
That could have gone badly.
Would have been cleaner if it had.
I gotta go and check on my man.
Amanda.
Let's go, Nak.
[Door opens and shuts]
Come on.
I'll walk you home.
You know it's not over with Datak.
I know.
Where's Ben?
Dead.
He did say to tell you he's sorry.
Aren't we all?
Town's safe for the moment.
I'll take it.
You can give me the details later.
But for now I've got 41 people to bury.
So what'd you do?
Bust him out?
I don't like chains.
You did the right thing.
Amanda helped.
Wow, so we were right to trust her.
Are we ever gonna make it to Antarctica?
Antarctica's not real, kid.
- You sure of that?
- No.
But this town is.
I'm sure of that.
Tonight we gather to honor the 41 souls who gave their lives to save this town.
They were our mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters.
But to us they were heroes.

- Is this St Louis?
- Once.
Now we call it "Defiance."
This town, it's a nice place to live.
So I keep hearing.
So, my lawkeeper told me that he found you and the Irathient girl in the Badlands.
She's my daughter.
Your daughter?
I have to thank the owner of McCawley Mines,
Rafe McCawley, and his children, Luke, Quentin and Christie.
I'm going to gather up some muscle and pay Rafe McCawley a visit.
Our son is in love with the McCawley girl.
Would it not be something if Alak and Christie actually got married?
What's going on, Luke?
What have you got going?
I'll be home for dinner, okay?
Luke was murdered?
Whoever did this, we'll find him.
You killed my son!
No!
Hey!
Everybody needs to leave.
They're coming.
They're planning to attack right after dark.
Fire!
Shtako!
Yeah!
How many dead?
Forty-one.
Seal the bridge.
You shtako-coward!
Elah Bandik of Yuke liro.
The honourable Datak Tarr of Shanje liro accuses you of cowardice.
Do you deny this charge?
I do not.
Seeming is being.
How I act is how my liro is perceived.
Then your cleansing ceremony will begin now.
What are they doing?
It's a Casti cleansing ceremony.
It looks like torture.
Yeah.
I thought we left that stuff behind in the Badlands.
Okay!
All right, that's enough.
That's it.
You've had your fun, now you cut this man down.
This man is a deserter.
He threw down arms and ran from the Volge.
This man was brave to pick up arms in the first place.
Plenty of men lose their nerves the first time in combat.
Not Castithans.
In the laws of our god RA-yet-so, running from battle reflects upon the brothers of your liro, or caste.
This man, Elah Bandik, has taken the honour of every Castithan in Defiance.
This man?
This little man has taken the honour of every Castithan in Defiance?
Not that my people have to explain our religion, but we do this for Bandik's own good.
I'm sure.
Without this ritual, his FE-sho will be denied passage to the afterlife.
I don't care.
I'm shutting it down.
No.
Don't...
Please.
I have no choice.
I must do this for my family.
Now, you cut that man down or I'm dragging every one of you in!
- And I'm starting with you.
- What's going on here?
Madame Mayor.
I hope you've come to put a muzzle on your new lawkeeper.
Our understanding with your predecessor dates back to the founding of this town.
Do you intend to dismantle that understanding three weeks into the job?
I respect Castithan tradition much as Mayor Nicky did.
Keep this ceremony confined to the Hollows.
Of course, Amanda.
Call me Mayor.
Put your gun away.
Come with me.
I'm sorry.
You seemed upset.
I've seen worse.
They're not dickering over the price of a roller, they're torturing a man to death!
Nolan.
You're from the outside.
I can imagine what this looks like.
I'm not sure you can.
Do you ever wonder why we have so few Irathients in Defiance?
What the hell does that have to do with anything?
About eight years ago, when Defiance was first founded, we had well over a thousand.
But for some reason, they didn't believe in vaccinating their kids.
Mayor Nicky saw Irathient kids dying for no good reason.
So they wrote mandatory vaccinations into the town charter.
Deputies went from house to house inoculating Irathient children by force.
The Irathients took up arms and there was an uprising.
What happened?
They had clubs, we had Vo-Tech blasters.
What do you think happened?
Some were killed and the rest left.
After that, the town council informally decided to allow the eight races to honour the traditional values of their own people.
All right.
You look me in the eye.
You tell me you think what's going on back there is right.
It's necessary.
You're not gonna stop this?
No, I am not.
I'm not prepared to shoot up an entire town to rescue a man who says he doesn't want to be saved.
Besides, the Lady Mayor promised she'd try and fix it.
Promises are shtako.
Well, it depends on the person making the promise.
Let's just take a beat, see what the Lady Mayor's word is worth.
Time to wake up, Ben.
Vri-tex?
You could have killed me with this!
My priority was to keep you from talking.
I wouldn't have betrayed you.
Well, that's good, given what would happen to your family if you did...
Yeah.
Or if you fail a second time.
Ah.
Okay.
A second time?
I did everything you said.
I blew up the stasis net.
And yet the Volge were defeated and the town is still standing.
They beat the Volge?
- How?
- It doesn't matter.
Do you remember the old plan?
Uh...
The mines?
But couldn't that destroy the very thing you're trying to find?
I have faith.
You do as you're told.
No, no, no.
I can't go through this again.
I didn't sign up for this!
You signed up for whatever it takes, Ben.
Hey, Dad.
Decided to come home?
I saw you at the service for Luke yesterday.
I didn't know what to say, so I ducked you.
That was wrong.
With Luke gone, we need to set aside the small stuff and pull together.
Oh.
You agreeing to marry Datak's kid, that's the small stuff I'm supposed to put aside?
Come on, Dad.
Accept the olive branch.
Let's eat.
How am I supposed to eat when all I can see is that haint...
Don't use that word.
That Castithan putting his hands all over you?
You think that's what your dead brother would have wanted?
What he wanted doesn't matter any more.
It's about what we want.
I'm in love with Alak Tarr and I want to marry him.
Yeah?
Well, I want you to call off this wedding and come home.
And if I don't?
If you walk out that door again, there's no coming back.
Dad...
Since Mom died, Christie's the only one been holding this family together.
And the one time she does something you don't like, you turn on her.
- Oh, but Luke...
- What about Luke?
Your brother was a good man.
Then why was he meeting alone in the woods with Ben Daris?
The guy who brought the Volge down on us?
McCawley.
I'll be right there.
Quentin!
Get the roller.
There's been an explosion at the mine!
Your deputy's gonna be fine.
But there's no sign of Ben Daris.
They took a hell of a chance busting him out in broad daylight.
Whoever jump started him used Vri-tex, dangerous drug, used in combat medicine.
Could be ex-military.
Mmm-hmm.
Quentin McCawley just hailed.
There's been an explosion at the mine.
There you are!
Your friend Ben Daris attacked one of my guards and stole a bunch of gulanite and went underground.
He blew the L-9 shaft behind him so we couldn't follow.
This is on you, Amanda.
And you let my son's murderer get loose.
We'll get him back.
How many miners did you have in the shaft?
None.
This shaft's abandoned.
It leads down to Old St Louis.
Old St Louis?
When the alien terraformers went crazy, most American cities were obliterated.
But something strange happened with St Louis.
The terraformed earth folded over the city, and hardened before crushing it.
Some sections of the city are still intact, more or less.
Something's still not right.
What do you mean?
Well, with the stasis net down, what was to stop Ben escaping through the pass?
Why trap himself underground?
Well, he stole 20 kilos of gulanite.
Wouldn't take more than two to blow that tunnel.
All right, so that's 18 kilos left.
That's enough to make a big bomb.
Yeah, not enough to do anything to Defiance.
Not from down there, anyway.
He can tell us who's behind the Volge attack.
We need to go after him.
So how long to clear this?
- Four hours, minimum.
- No, too long.
We need another way down.
- Here.
What's that?
- The Rat's Nest.
It's a maze down there, not to mention razor-sharp rocks and steep dropoffs.
Nobody bothered to map it since the L-9's always bigger and safer.
The map's in my head.
I discovered the Rat's Nest.
It's our best chance to get ahead of Ben Daris.
Quentin, go find Nak, and Levon, and a couple others, and break out some rappelling gear.
No way.
Absolutely not.
Mmm-mmm.
It's my tunnels.
It's my men.
It's my rules...
Yeah, how do I know you're not gonna find Ben and shoot him?
My word.
Or is that all of a sudden not good enough for you?
I'll tag along with him and keep him honest.
No, no, no, no, no.
Listen, you're no miner.
It's too dangerous.
I'm not gonna get saddled with some topside flatfoot.
No offense, but I've done rougher descents during the war looking for underground bunkers.
Twenty scrip says my boots hit the ground first.
It's your ass.
No matter what, you've gotta make sure that he doesn't kill Ben.
The man did kill his son.
If it had been me...
I know, but we need him alive for questioning.
Our first priority is protecting this town.
I'll bring Ben back alive, I promise.
Nolan!
Don't risk your life for these people.
They're not worth it.
Some of them are.
I need you to stay here and help Tommy figure out who set our fugitive free.
And you are to stay far, far away from Elah Bandik.
You hear me?
Everyone's talking about the Elah Bandik situation.
Don't start with me, Stahma.
It's one of our old laws.
It's a new world.
A new world.
The humans find this sort of thing unseemly.
I don't care what the humans think.
But their opinions matter.
If they're against us, we'll never be able to take control of the McCawley Mines.
I'm thinking about our son's future.
Think of your life back on Casti.
You were at the bottom liro, the lowest caste.
Your life was degradation and poverty.
Is the Castithan way really something you're eager to preserve?
It is now that I'm standing on top pissing on those below!
What's going on?
It's Christie.
Rafe McCawley's messing with her mind.
I don't know what's gonna happen.
We may have to cancel the wedding.
Oh, honey.
Rafe McCawley needs a bullet in the head.
- Dad!
- He doesn't mean it.
Oh, I do.
You know what the hot water does to your father's disposition.
Mother will take care of everything.
Oh.
You got a fix on that gulanite he's carrying?
Yeah, I do and he's not far.
Let's go and nail the bastard.
Welcome to Old St Louis.
It's about time I got my clutter out of here, give you a chance to put your stamp on this office.
And now that I'm retired,
I'm thinking of taking up golf.
Oh, I once had a three handicap and no one can say I didn't because there's no one around except me who remembers the damn rules.
Poor bastard.
He's been up there for three hours, hasn't he?
I hate this, Nicky.
I really do.
We have a town charter and we haven't followed it for years.
It has to stop.
Castithans are tricky.
They're obsessive about their past, who their ancestors were, what liro they were born into.
And they build their lives around ancient traditions that may once have had a purpose,
but none of them can agree on what it was.
They sound a lot like us.
They've lost their past.
It blew up when their planet did.
These sad little displays in the street, it's all they've got left.
You try to take that away, it'll be the I-raths all over again.
I don't believe that.
Defiance has changed a lot in the last five years.
Look, we came together to fight the Volge and won.
Now, I think we're building a bigger identity that's greater than human or I-rath or Casti.
I'm going to miss you.
Birch...
Did chivalry die in the Volge attack?
What's Ben's status?
He's underground and on his way.
We need to leave town now.
It should only take him two more hours to reach the target.
Well, he was injured.
He may fail.
He's motivated.
I made sure of that when I woke him up.
I'll take your word.
But before we leave, there are a couple of folks I want to say goodbye to.
You let yourself get too close to these people.
I grew up with them.
I saw their babies being born.
Saw them raised.
What I do, I do for the benefit of all of us.
And because it must be done.
I take no pleasure in this, Birch.
You know that.
I know.
I just ran out of time, that's all.
No matter how much you get, it's never enough.
- You okay there, old timer?
- I'm fine.
All right, let's take a break.
Yeah, well, don't stop on my account.
I need water.
All right, everybody, take five.
Jefferson Park.
I haven't been here since I was...
Nine?
You were a local?
Yeah.
I gotta admit, though, it's all a bit hazy.
I do get the feeling my folks and I used to eat around here somewhere.
Probably Golden's, on the far side of the park.
That sounds right.
Best toasted ravioli in the state.
Yeah.
Pretty good gooey butter cake, too.
Now that I remember.
Right up there with penicillin for the world's greatest inventions.
I used to take Luke there when he was...
Maybe three.
So, what about your family?
What did they do before Arkfall?
Dog food.
Dog food?
My family made dog food.
Wait.
McCawley.
Your old man was...
- Yes.
- ...
Chow Down Brown McCawley.
How did that jingle go?
I ain't singing it for you.
Healthy pups can't get enough
They never wear a frown...
Forget it.
It's not happening.
'Cause it's Chow Down time
Chow Down time It's always Chow Down time...
Man, I cannot see you in the dog food business.
Well, I wanted to be a photographer.
Sports stuff.
Some bikini stuff, just for fun.
Why didn't you stick with it?
Well, I shot terraformed landscapes for a while, but gave it up.
Too depressing.
All it did was remind me of everything that the aliens took away.
Yeah.
So, look, Rafe, I wanna be clear.
This Votan we're chasing...
The one that killed my boy?
Is that the Votan we're talking about?
We need to bring him back alive.
You know that, right?
I don't know any such thing.
Predicting the future's a sucker's game.
You don't believe me, just take a look around you.
This is no place for a child.
I-rath!
Bitch!
Elah Bandik is under arrest.
For what?
Loitering.
The signal's getting stronger.
Wherever he is, he's close.
I don't remember those towers.
It's a nuclear plant.
Went up during the war.
If Ben detonated the gulanite in one of those reactors...
The radiation would get up through the tunnels in the Rat's Nest.
The radiation would kill everybody.
Penny for your thoughts?
That is what you humans say, yes?
My brother collected pennies.
The very old kind.
He said the copper used to be worth more than the coins themselves.
You were just thinking of him, weren't you?
It is our duty to live our lives to the fullest, to honour those who have passed.
Which is why I was surprised to hear you're having second thoughts about the wedding.
I just want to slow down.
Take a pause.
Your father's putting that much pressure on you, is he?
He's sort of a jackass.
Most men are.
It's a characteristic that transcends species.
You can fight him if you want to.
I don't think I can.
Just before I left my home world, my parents went to great lengths to ensure that I married a man that they deemed suitable.
At my side was a stranger.
Not very handsome, but he came from the highest liro and he was a man of great honour.
My parents believed this man of great honour would keep me safe.
What happened?
I met someone else.
He was a scruffy young nobody, beautiful, dangerous, a wicked smile.
He'd won passage to Earth as payment for a gambling debt.
Datak.
He pursued me.
Aggressively.
My betrothed was furious.
He challenged Datak to a Castithan blood duel.
So they fought.
They never got a chance.
On his way to the duel, my man of great honour was accidentally flushed out of an airlock.
It was a tragic accident.
How do you get accidentally...
Datak was a man I knew loved me beyond scope of reason.
He was a survivor.
A man who would stop at nothing to keep us both safe.
I understood the man I needed in a way my parents could not.
Is this a true story?
It's going to be a beautiful wedding.
- Watch your step.
- Keep your eyes open.
That's it.
Stay together.
- I haven't been here in a long time.
- Still nothing?
Uh-uh.
- Is that it?
- That's it.
Bomb's deactivated.
- Good.
- Hey!
Hey!
We need this guy alive if we're ever gonna find out who the hell is behind all this.
You want to avenge Luke, I get it.
Rafe, you've got Christie and you've got Quentin sitting at home and someone is doing their damnedest to destroy the town they live in.
You know Luke begged for his life like a little girl.
- Hey, we need answers from this guy.
- I know what I'm doing, lawman.
Do you wanna know why he was helping me?
Hey!
What?
You trying to die for the cause?
It was because he needed money so he could get away from Defiance and get away from you.
- Rafe...
- That's what's so laughable about all this.
You came down here to avenge poor ole Luke and he hated your guts!
I mean, after what you did to his mother...
- Shut up!
- Hey!
Now, you can do the right thing by your dead child or you can do the right thing by the two living ones.
But you cannot do both!
Now, you make your choice right now!
Tell Amanda
I'm sorry.
It's pretty quiet out there.
The Mayor said she'll be right over.
Maybe we'll be all right.
They'll come for him.
This was a mistake.
You were stupid to help me.
You made a move and I backed you up.
That's what lawkeepers do.
Clancy taught me that.
You were stupid to listen to him.
Shtako.
- How many?
- I can see Datak and that Bio-man.
You, go around the side.
Hand over the coward.
I'm afraid we can't do that, FA-vi Tarr.
This is a Castithan matter and will be handled by Castithans.
If you take another step, my first bullet kills you.
Charming girl.
Now, we can go around you or through you.
The choice is yours.
All right, get Levon in to the doctor.
All right, Rafe.
That's enough, Datak.
Irisa and Tommy are acting under my orders.
I've decided to pardon Elah Bandik of all violations of Castithan law.
Well, you don't have that power.
Well, if you take him, you're going to have to shoot up this office and kill me.
What do you suppose is going on in there?
Nothing good.
Nak, you'd better come with us.
- It's not your fight, Rafe.
- I owe you one, Nolan.
So, what's it gonna be, Datak?
Pointless bloodshed, or are we going to work out our differences together, peacefully?
Madame Mayor, your passion has touched my heart.
We are indeed one community.
Enough blood has been spilled.
Tonight, let us bury our dead with dignity.
And later, who knows?
Perhaps we can revisit these cultural differences with cooler heads.
I'll see you at the wedding.
Appreciate the help, Rafe.
That could've gone badly.
It would've been cleaner if it had.
I gotta go check on my man.
Amanda.
Let's go, Nak.
Come on, I'll walk you home.
You know it's not over with Datak.
I know.
Where's Ben?
Dead.
He did say to tell you he's sorry.
Aren't we all?
The town's safe, for the moment.
I'll take it.
You can give me the details later.
But for now, I've got 41 people to bury.
So, what'd you do, bust him out?
I don't like chains.
You did the right thing.
Amanda helped.
Wow.
So we were right to trust her.
Are we ever gonna make it to Antarctica?
Antarctica's not real, kid.
- You sure of that?
- Nope.
No.
But this town is.
I'm sure of that.
Tonight we gather to honour the 41 souls who gave their lives to save this town.
They were our mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters.
But to us, they were heroes.
Thank you.
For letting me have some time with my family.
Of course.
What you're doing is brave and honourable.
Previously on Defiance...
- Is it Saint Louis?
- Once.
Now we call it Defiance.
This town, it's a nice place to live.
So I keep hearing.
So my lawkeeper told me that he found you and the irathient girl in the Badlands.
She's my daughter.
Your daughter?
I have to thank the owner of McCawley mines,
Rafe McCawley, and his children,
Luke, Quentin, and Christie.
[Cheers and applause]
I'm going to gather up some muscle and pay Rafe McCawley a visit.
Our son is in love with the McCawley girl.
Would it not be something if Alak and Christie actually got married?
What's going on, Luke?
What do you got going?
I'll be home for dinner, okay?
[Impact]
Luke was murdered?
Whoever did this, we'll find 'em.
You killed my son!
- No!
Hey!
- Everybody needs to leave.
They're coming.
They're planning to attack right after dark.
[Laser shots]
Fire!
[Gunfire]
[Speaking native language]
Yeah!
How many dead?
41.
[Panting and whimpering]
[Indistinct chatter]
[Speaking native language]
[Speaking native language]
[Eerie animal calls]
[Screams]
[Speaking native language]
[Indistinct chatter]
[Chanting in native language]
[All chanting in native language]
[Speaking native language]
[Speaking native language]
[Chanting in native language]
What are they doing?
It's a Casti cleansing ceremony.
Looks like torture.
Yeah.
Thought we left that stuff behind in the Badlands.
[Chanting in native language]
[Screams]
Okay.
All right.
That's enough.
That's it.
You've had your fun.
Now you cut this man down.
This man is a deserter.
He threw down arms and ran from the Volge.
This man was brave to pick up arms in the first place.
Plenty of men lose their nerve the first time in combat.
Not Castithans.

This man?
This little man has taken the honor of every Castithan in Defiance?
Not that my people have to explain our religion.
But we do this for Bandik's own good.
- I'm sure.
- Without this ritual, his fesho will be denied passage to the afterlife.
I don't care.
I'm shutting it down.
No, don't, please.
I have no choice.
I must do this for my family.
[Speaking native language]
You cut that man down, or I'm dragging every one of you in.
And I'm starting with you.
What's going on here?
Madame Mayor.
I hope you've come to put a muzzle on your new lawkeeper.
Our understanding with your predecessor dates back to the founding of this town.
Do you intend to dismantle that understanding... three weeks into the job?
[Speaking alien language]
Keep this ceremony confined to the hollows.
Of course, Amanda.
Call me Mayor.
Put your gun away.
Come with me.
[Chanting in native language]
I'm sorry.
You seemed upset.
I've seen worse.
They're not bickering over the price of a roller.
They're torturing a man to death.
Nolan, you're from the outside.
I can imagine what this looks like.
I'm not sure you can.
You ever wonder why we have so few Irathients in Defiance?
What the hell does that have to do with anything?
Eight years ago, when Defiance was first founded, we had well over 1,000.
But for some reason they didn't believe in vaccinating their kids.
Mayor Nicky saw irathient kids dying for no good reason.
So they wrote mandatory vaccinations into the town charter.
Deputies went from house to house inoculating irathient children by force.
Irathients took up arms, and there was an uprising.
What happened?
They had clubs.
We had Vo-tech blasters.
What do you think happened?
Some were killed, and the rest left.
After that, the town council informally decided to allow the eight races to honor the traditional values of their own people.
All right.
You look me in the eye, you tell me you think what's going on back there is right.
It's necessary.
[Chanting in native language]
[Moans]
You're not gonna stop this?
- No, I am not.
- [Groans]
I'm not prepared to shoot up an entire town to rescue a man who says he doesn't want to be saved.
Besides, the lady Mayor promised she'd try and fix it.
Promises are shtako.
Yeah, well, it depends on the person making the promise.
Let's just take a beat, see what the lady Mayor's word is worth.
[All chanting in native language]
Time to wake up, Ben.
[Gasps]
[Shouting]
Vri-Tex?
You could have killed me with this.
My priority was to keep you from talking.
I wouldn't have betrayed you.
That's good, given what would happen to your family if you did.
Or if you fail a second time.
[Gasps]
Okay.
A second time?
I did everything you said.
I blew up the stasis net.
And yet the Volge were defeated, and the town is still standing.
They beat the Volge?
- How?
- Doesn't matter.
You remember the old plan?
The mines.
But couldn't that destroy the very thing you're trying to find?
I have faith.
You do as you're told.
No, no, no, I can't go through this again.
I didn't sign up for this.
You signed up for whatever it takes, Ben.
[Groaning]
[door opens]
[Door shuts]
[Pan clatters]
Hey, dad.
Decided to come home?
I saw you at the service for Luke yesterday.
I didn't know what to say, so I ducked you.
That was wrong.
With Luke gone, we need to set aside the small stuff and pull together.
Oh, you agreeing to marry Datak's kid, that's the small stuff I'm supposed to put aside?
Come on, dad.
Accept the olive branch.
Let's eat.
How am I supposed to eat when all I can see is that haint...
- Don't use that word.
- That Castithan putting his hands all over you?
You think that's what your dead brother would have wanted?
What he wanted doesn't matter anymore.
It's about what we want.
I'm in love with Alak Tarr, and I want to marry him.
Yeah?
Well, I want you to call off this wedding and come home.
And if I don't?
If you walk out that door again,
- there's no coming back.
- Dad.
[Door shuts]
Since mom died,
Christie's the only one been holding this family together, and, the one time she does something you don't like, you turn on her?
- Oh, but Luke...
- What about Luke?
Your brother was a good man.
Then why was he meeting alone in the woods with Ben Daris, guy who brought the Volge down on us?
[Hailer buzzes]
McCawley.
I'll be right there.
Quentin, get the roller.
There's been an explosion at the mine.
Your deputy's gonna be fine, but there's no sign of Ben Daris.
Took a hell of a chance busting him out in broad daylight.
Well, whoever jump-started him us Vri-Tex.
Dangerous drug used in combat medicine.
Could be ex-military.
Quentin McCawley just hailed.
There's been an explosion at the mine.
There you are.
Your friend Ben Daris attacked one of my guards, and stole a bunch of Gulanite, and went underground.
He blew the I-9 shaft behind him so we couldn't follow.
This is on you, Amanda, and you.
Let my son's murderer get loose.
We'll get him back.
How many miners did you have in the shaft?
None.
The shaft's abandoned.
Leads down to old St. Louis.
Old St. Louis?
When the alien Terraformers went crazy, most American cities were obliterated, but something strange happened to St. Louis.
The terraformed earth folded over the city and hardened before crushing it.
Some sections of the city are still intact, more or less.
Something's still not right.
What do you mean?
Well, with the stasis net down, what was to stop Ben escaping through the pass?
Why trap himself underground?
Well, he stole 20 kilos of Gulanite.
Wouldn't take more than two to blow that tunnel.
All right, so that's 18 kilos left.
That's enough to make a big bomb.
Not enough to do anything to Defiance.
Not from down there anyway.
He can tell us who's behind the Volge attack.
We need to go after him.
So how long to clear this?
Four hours minimum.
No, too long.
We need another way down.
Here.
- What's that?
- Rat's nest.
It's a maze down there.
Not to mention razor-sharp rocks and steep drop-offs.
Nobody bothered to map it since the I-9's always bigger and safer.
The map's in my head.
I discovered the rat's nest.
It's our best chance to get ahead of Ben Daris.
Quentin, go find Nak and Levon and a couple others and break out some rappelling gear.
No way.
Absolutely not.
Mm-mmm.
It's my tunnels, my men...
Yeah, how do I know you're not gonna find Ben
- and shoot him?
- My word.
Or is that all of a sudden not good enough for you?
I'll tag along with him, keep him honest.
No, no, no.
Listen, you're no miner.
It's too dangerous.
I'm not gonna get saddled with some topside flatfoot.
No offense, but I've done rougher descents during the war looking for underground bunkers.
20 scrip says my boots hit the ground first.
It's your ass.
No matter what, you gotta make sure that he doesn't kill Ben.
Man did kill his son.
- Had it been me...
- I know.
But we need him alive for questioning.
Our first priority is protecting this town.
I'll bring Ben back alive, I promise.
Nolan, don't risk your life for these people.
They're not worth it.
Oh, some of them are.
I need you to stay here and help Tommy figure out who set our fugitive free.
And you are to stay far, far away from Elah Bandik.
You hear me?
[Speaking native language]
[Speaking native language]
The humans find this sort of thing unseemly.
I don't care what the humans think.
But their opinions matter.
If they're against us, we'll never be able to take control of the McCawley mines.
I'm thinking about our son's future.
[Sighs]
Think of your life back on Casti.
You were at the bottom layer of the lowest caste.
Your life was degradation and poverty.
Is the Castithan way really something you're eager to preserve?
[Chuckles]
[Speaking native language]
What's going on?
It's Christie.
Rafe McCawley's messing with her mind.
I don't know what's gonna happen.
We may have to cancel the wedding.
Oh, honey.
Rafe McCawley needs a bullet in the head.
- Dad!
- He doesn't mean it.
Oh, I do.
You know what the hot water does to your father's disposition.
Mother will take care of everything.
Oh.
[Device beeping]
You got a fix on that Gulanite he's carrying?
Yeah, I do.
And he's not far.
Let's go and nail the bastard.
[Growls]
Welcome to old St. Louis.
It's about time I got my clutter out of here, give you a chance to put your stamp on this office.
And now that I'm retired,
I'm thinking of taking up golf.
Oh, I once had a three handicap.
And no one can say I didn't, because there's no one around except me who remembers the damn rules.
[Cries out]
Poor bastard.
He's been up there for three hours, hasn't he?
I hate this, Nicky.
I really do.
We have a town charter, and we haven't followed it for years.
It has to stop.
Castithans are tricky.
They're obsessive about their past, who their ancestors were, what liro they were born into.
They build their lives around ancient traditions that may once have had a purpose, but...
None of them can agree on what it was.
They sound a lot like us.
They've lost their past.
Blew up when their planet did.
These sad little displays in the street, that's all they've got left.
You try to take that away, it'll be the Iraths all over again.
I don't believe that.
Defiance has changed a lot in the past five years.
Look, we came together to fight the Volge and won.
I think we're building a bigger identity that's greater than human or Irath or Casti.
[Chuckles]
I'm going to miss you.
[Indistinct chatter]
Birch.
Did chivalry die in the Volge attack?
What's Ben's status?
He's underground and on his way.
We need to leave town now.
It should only take him two more hours to reach the target.
Well, he was injured.
He may fail.
He's motivated.
I made sure of that.
[Speaks alien language]
I take your word.
Before we leave, there are a couple of folks I want to say good-bye to.
You let yourself get too close to these people.
I grew up with them.
I saw their babies being born, saw them raised.
What I do I do for the benefit of all of us and because it must be done.
I take no pleasure in this, birch.
You know that.
- I know.
- [Engine turns over]
I just ran out of time, that's all.
No matter how much you get, it's never enough.
You okay there, old timer?
I'm fine.
All right, let's take a break.
Yeah, well, don't stop on my account.
I need water.
All right, everybody.
Take five.
Jefferson Park.
Hell, I haven't been here since I was nine.
- You were a local?
- Yeah.
I got to admit, though, it's all a bit hazy.
I do get the feeling my folks and I used to eat around here somewhere.
Probably golden's on the far side of the park.
That sounds right.
Best toasted ravioli in the state.
Pretty good gooey butter cake too.
Now that I remember.
[Chuckles] Right up there with penicillin for the world's greatest inventions.
I used to take Luke there when he was maybe three.
So what about your family?
What did they do before arkfall?
Dog food.
Dog food?
My family made dog food.
Wait, McCawley.
Your old man was...
Yes.
"Chow down" Brown McCawley.
How did that jingle go?
- I ain't singing it for you.
- [Laughs]
♪ Healthy pups can't get enough ♪
♪ they never wear a frown ♪
Forget it.
It's not happening.
♪ 'Cause it's chow down time ♪
♪ chow down time, it's always chow down time ♪
[Laughs]
Man, I cannot see you in the dog food business.
Oh, I wanted to be a photographer.
Sports stuff.
Some bikini stuff just for fun.
Why didn't you stick with it?
Well, I shot terraformed landscapes for a while, but I gave it up.
It was too depressing.
All it did was remind me of everything that the aliens took away.
Yeah.
So look, Rafe, I want to be clear.
This Votan we're chasing...
The one that killed my boy?
Is that the Votan we're talking about?
We need to bring him back alive.
- You know that, right?
- I don't know any such thing.
Predicting the future's a sucker's game.
You don't believe me?
Just take a look around you.

For what?
Loitering.
Signal's getting stronger.
Wherever he is, he's close.
I don't remember those towers.
It's a nuclear plant.
Went up during the war.
[Mechanical sounds]
If Ben detonated the Gulanite in one of those reactors...
Radiation would get up through the tunnels in the rat's nest.
Radiation would kill everybody.

♪
Penny for your thoughts.
That is what you humans say, yes?
My brother collected pennies.
The very old kind.
[Pouring]
Said the copper used to be worth more than the coins themselves.
You were just thinking of him, weren't you?
It is our duty to live our lives to the fullest... to honor those who have passed.
Which is why I was surprised to hear you're having second thoughts about the wedding.
I just want to slow down, take a pause.
Your father's putting that much pressure on you, is he?
He's sort of a jackass.
[Chuckles]
Most men are.
It's a characteristic that transcends species.
You can fight him if you want to.
I don't think I can.
Just before I left my home world, my parents went to great lengths to insure that I married a man that they deemed suitable.
At my side was a stranger, not very handsome.
But he came from the highest liro.
And he was a man of great honor.
My parents believed this man of great honor would keep me safe.
What happened?
I met someone else.
He was a scruffy young nobody, beautiful, dangerous, a wicked smile.
He'd won passage to Earth as payment for a gambling debt.
Datak.
He pursued me aggressively.
My betrothed was furious.
He challenged Datak to a Castithan blood duel.
So they fought?
They never got a chance.
On his way to the duel, my man of great honor was accidentally flushed out of an airlock.
It was a tragic accident.
How do you get accidentally...
Datak was a man I knew loved me beyond scope of reason.
He was a survivor, a man who would stop at nothing to keep us both safe.
I understood the man I needed in a way my parents could not.
Is this a true story?
[Giggles]
It's going to be a beautiful wedding.
Watch your step.
Keep your eyes open.
That's it.
Stay together.
I haven't been in here in a long time.
Still nothing?
[Gunfire]
[Moans]
[Device beeping]
Uh-uh.
That's it.
- Bomb's deactivated.
- Good.
Hey.
Hey.
We need this guy alive if we're ever gonna find out who the hell is behind all this.
You want to avenge Luke, I get it.
Rafe, you got Christie and you got Quentin sitting at home, and someone is doing their damnedest to destroy
- the town they live in.
- You know, Luke begged for his life like a little girl.
Hey, we need answers from this guy.
- I know what I'm doing, lawman.
- Do you want to know
- why he was helping me?
- Hey!
What, you trying to die for the cause?
It was because he needed money so he could get away from Defiance
- and get away from you.
- Rafe.
That's what's so laughable about all this.
You came down here to avenge poor, old Luke, and he hated your guts.
I mean, after what you did to his mother.
- Shut up!
- Hey.
Now you can do the right thing by your dead child or you can do the right thing by the two living ones, but you cannot do both.
Now you make your choice.
Right now.
[Gunshot]
Tell Amanda I'm sorry.
It's pretty quiet out there.
The Mayor said she'll be right over.
Maybe we'll be all right.
They'll come for him.
This was a mistake.
You were stupid to help me.
You made a move, and I backed you up.
That's what lawkeepers do.
Clancy taught me that.
You were stupid to listen to him.
Shtako.
How many?
I can see Datak and that bio-man.
You go around the side.
Hand over the coward.
I'm afraid we can't do that, Favi Tarr.
This is a Castithan matter and will be handled by Castithans.
If you take another step, my first bullet kills you.
Charming girl.
Now we can go around you or through you.
The choice is yours.
[Approaching vehicles]
All right, get Levon into the doctor.
All right, Rafe.
That's enough, Datak.
Irisa and Tommy were acting under my orders.
I've decided to pardon Elah Bandik of all violations of Castithan law.
Well, you don't have that power.
Well, if you take him, you're gonna have to shoot up this office and kill me.
What do you suppose is going on in there?
Nothing good.
Nak, you better come with us.
- It's not your fight, Rafe.
- Oh, yeah?
I owe you one, Nolan.
So what's it gonna be, Datak?
Pointless bloodshed or are we gonna work out our differences together, peacefully?
Madame Mayor, your passion has touched my heart.
We are indeed one community.
Enough blood has been spilled.
Tonight let us bury our dead with dignity.
And later, who knows?
Perhaps we can revisit these cultural differences with cooler heads.
[Speaking native language]
I'll see you at the wedding.
Appreciate the help, Rafe.
That could have gone badly.
Would have been cleaner if it had.
I gotta go and check on my man.
Amanda.
Let's go, Nak.
[Door opens and shuts]
Come on.
I'll walk you home.
You know it's not over with Datak.
I know.
Where's Ben?
Dead.
He did say to tell you he's sorry.
Aren't we all?
Town's safe for the moment.
I'll take it.
You can give me the details later.
But for now I've got 41 people to bury.
So what'd you do?
Bust him out?
I don't like chains.
You did the right thing.
Amanda helped.
Wow, so we were right to trust her.
Are we ever gonna make it to Antarctica?
Antarctica's not real, kid.
- You sure of that?
- No.
But this town is.
I'm sure of that.
Tonight we gather to honor the 41 souls who gave their lives to save this town.
They were our mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters.
But to us they were heroes.

Previously on Defiance...
- Is it Saint Louis?
- Once.
Now we call it Defiance.
This town, it's a nice place to live.
So I keep hearing.
So my lawkeeper told me that he found you and the irathient girl in the Badlands.
She's my daughter.
Your daughter?
I have to thank the owner of McCawley mines,
Rafe McCawley, and his children,
Luke, Quentin, and Christie.
I'm going to gather up some muscle and pay Rafe McCawley a visit.
Our son is in love with the McCawley girl.
Would it not be something if Alak and Christie actually got married?
What's going on, Luke?
What do you got going?
I'll be home for dinner, okay?
Luke was murdered?
Whoever did this, we'll find 'em.
You killed my son!
- No!
Hey!
- Everybody needs to leave.
They're coming.
They're planning to attack right after dark.
Fire!
Yeah!
How many dead?
41.
_
_ 1x02 Down in the Ground Where the Dead Men Go

What are they doing?
It's a Casti cleansing ceremony.
Looks like torture.
Yeah.
Thought we left that stuff behind in the Badlands.
Okay.
All right.
That's enough.
That's it.
You've had your fun.
Now you cut this man down.
This man is a deserter.
He threw down arms and ran from the Volge.
This man was brave to pick up arms in the first place.
Plenty of men lose their nerve the first time in combat.
Not Castithans.
In the laws of our God Rayetso, running from battle reflects upon the brothers of your liro, or caste.
This man Elah Bandik has taken the honor of every Castithan in Defiance.
This man?
This little man has taken the honor of every Castithan in Defiance?
Not that my people have to explain our religion.
But we do this for Bandik's own good.
- I'm sure.
- Without this ritual, his fesho will be denied passage to the afterlife.
I don't care.
I'm shutting it down.
No, don't, please.
I have no choice.
I must do this for my family.
You cut that man down, or I'm dragging every one of you in.
- And I'm starting with you.
- What's going on here?
Madame Mayor.
I hope you've come to put a muzzle on your new lawkeeper.
Our understanding with your predecessor dates back to the founding of this town.
Do you intend to dismantle that understanding... three weeks into the job?

I'll tag along with him, keep him honest.
No, no, no.
Listen, you're no miner.
It's too dangerous.
I'm not gonna get saddled with some topside flatfoot.
No offense, but I've done rougher descents during the war looking for underground bunkers.
20 scrip says my boots hit the ground first.
It's your ass.
No matter what, you gotta make sure that he doesn't kill Ben.
Man did kill his son.
- Had it been me...
- I know.
But we need him alive for questioning.
Our first priority is protecting this town.
I'll bring Ben back alive, I promise.
Nolan, don't risk your life for these people.
They're not worth it.
Oh, some of them are.
I need you to stay here and help Tommy figure out who set our fugitive free.
And you are to stay far, far away from Elah Bandik.
You hear me?
_
_
_
_
The humans find this sort of thing unseemly.
I don't care what the humans think.
But their opinions matter.
If they're against us, we'll never be able to take control of the McCawley mines.
I'm thinking about our son's future.
Think of your life back on Casti.
You were at the bottom layer of the lowest caste.
Your life was degradation and poverty.
Is the Castithan way really something you're eager to preserve?
_
_
_
What's going on?
It's Christie.
Rafe McCawley's messing with her mind.
I don't know what's gonna happen.
We may have to cancel the wedding.
Oh, honey.
Rafe McCawley needs a bullet in the head.
- Dad!
- He doesn't mean it.
Oh, I do.
You know what the hot water does to your father's disposition.
Mother will take care of everything.
Oh.
You got a fix on that Gulanite he's carrying?
Yeah, I do.
And he's not far.
Let's go and nail the bastard.
Welcome to old St. Louis.
It's about time I got my clutter out of here, give you a chance to put your stamp on this office.
And now that I'm retired,
I'm thinking of taking up golf.
Oh, I once had a three handicap.
And no one can say I didn't, because there's no one around except me who remembers the damn rules.
Poor bastard.
He's been up there for three hours, hasn't he?
I hate this, Nicky.
I really do.
We have a town charter, and we haven't followed it for years.
It has to stop.
Castithans are tricky.
They're obsessive about their past, who their ancestors were, what liro they were born into.
They build their lives around ancient traditions that may once have had a purpose, but...
None of them can agree on what it was.
They sound a lot like us.
They've lost their past.
Blew up when their planet did.
These sad little displays in the street, that's all they've got left.
You try to take that away, it'll be the Iraths all over again.
I don't believe that.
Defiance has changed a lot in the past five years.
Look, we came together to fight the Volge and won.
I think we're building a bigger identity that's greater than human or Irath or Casti.
I'm going to miss you.
Birch.
Did chivalry die in the Volge attack?
What's Ben's status?
He's underground and on his way.
We need to leave town now.
It should only take him two more hours to reach the target.
Well, he was injured.
He may fail.
He's motivated.
I made sure of that.
I take your word.
Before we leave, there are a couple of folks I want to say good-bye to.
You let yourself get too close to these people.
I grew up with them.
I saw their babies being born, saw them raised.
What I do I do for the benefit of all of us and because it must be done.
I take no pleasure in this, birch.
You know that.
I know.
I just ran out of time, that's all.
No matter how much you get, it's never enough.
You okay there, old timer?
I'm fine.
All right, let's take a break.
Yeah, well, don't stop on my account.
I need water.
All right, everybody.
Take five.
Jefferson Park.
Hell, I haven't been here since I was nine.
- You were a local?
- Yeah.
I got to admit, though, it's all a bit hazy.
I do get the feeling my folks and I used to eat around here somewhere.
Probably golden's on the far side of the park.
That sounds right.
Best toasted ravioli in the state.
Pretty good gooey butter cake too.
Now that I remember.
Right up there with penicillin for the world's greatest inventions.
I used to take Luke there when he was maybe three.
So what about your family?
What did they do before arkfall?
Dog food.
Dog food?
My family made dog food.
Wait, McCawley.
Your old man was...
Yes.
"Chow down" Brown McCawley.
How did that jingle go?
I ain't singing it for you.
♪ Healthy pups can't get enough
♪ they never wear a frown ♪
Forget it.
It's not happening.
♪ 'Cause it's chow down time ♪
♪ Chow down time, it's always chow down time ♪
Man, I cannot see you in the dog food business.
Oh, I wanted to be a photographer.
Sports stuff.
Some bikini stuff just for fun.
Why didn't you stick with it?
Well, I shot terraformed landscapes for a while, but I gave it up.
It was too depressing.
All it did was remind me of everything that the aliens took away.
Yeah.
So look, Rafe, I want to be clear.
This Votan we're chasing...
The one that killed my boy?
Is that the Votan we're talking about?
We need to bring him back alive.
- You know that, right?
- I don't know any such thing.
Predicting the future's a sucker's game.
You don't believe me?
Just take a look around you.
_
_
_
Elah Bandik is under arrest.
For what?
Loitering.
Signal's getting stronger.
Wherever he is, he's close.
I don't remember those towers.
It's a nuclear plant.
Went up during the war.
If Ben detonated the Gulanite in one of those reactors...
Radiation would get up through the tunnels in the rat's nest.
Radiation would kill everybody.
Penny for your thoughts.
That is what you humans say, yes?
My brother collected pennies.
The very old kind.
Said the copper used to be worth more than the coins themselves.
You were just thinking of him, weren't you?
It is our duty to live our lives to the fullest... to honor those who have passed.
Which is why I was surprised to hear you're having second thoughts about the wedding.
I just want to slow down, take a pause.
Your father's putting that much pressure on you, is he?
He's sort of a jackass.
Most men are.
It's a characteristic that transcends species.
You can fight him if you want to.
I don't think I can.
Just before I left my home world, my parents went to great lengths to insure that I married a man that they deemed suitable.
At my side was a stranger, not very handsome.
But he came from the highest liro.
And he was a man of great honor.
My parents believed this man of great honor would keep me safe.
What happened?
I met someone else.
He was a scruffy young nobody, beautiful, dangerous, a wicked smile.
He'd won passage to Earth as payment for a gambling debt.
Datak.
He pursued me... aggressively.
My betrothed was furious.
He challenged Datak to a Castithan blood duel.
So they fought?
They never got a chance.
On his way to the duel, my man of great honor was accidentally flushed out of an airlock.
It was a tragic accident.
How do you get accidentally...
Datak was a man I knew loved me beyond scope of reason.
He was a survivor, a man who would stop at nothing to keep us both safe.
I understood the man I needed in a way my parents could not.
Is this a true story?
It's going to be a beautiful wedding.
Watch your step.
Keep your eyes open.
That's it.
Stay together.
I haven't been in here in a long time.
Still nothing?
Uh-uh.
That's it.
- Bomb's deactivated.
- Good.
Hey.
Hey.
We need this guy alive if we're ever gonna find out who the hell is behind all this.
You want to avenge Luke, I get it.
Rafe, you got Christie and you got Quentin sitting at home, and someone is doing their damnedest to destroy
- the town they live in.
- You know, Luke begged for his life like a little girl.
Hey, we need answers from this guy.
- I know what I'm doing, lawman.
- Do you want to know
- why he was helping me?
- Hey!
What, you trying to die for the cause?
It was because he needed money so he could get away from Defiance
- and get away from you.
- Rafe.
That's what's so laughable about all this.
You came down here to avenge poor, old Luke, and he hated your guts.
I mean, after what you did to his mother.
- Shut up!
- Hey.
Now you can do the right thing by your dead child or you can do the right thing by the two living ones, but you cannot do both.
Now you make your choice.
Right now.
Tell Amanda I'm sorry.
It's pretty quiet out there.
The Mayor said she'll be right over.
Maybe we'll be all right.
They'll come for him.
This was a mistake.
You were stupid to help me.
You made a move, and I backed you up.
That's what lawkeepers do.
Clancy taught me that.
You were stupid to listen to him.
Shtako.
How many?
I can see Datak and that bio-man.
You go around the side.
Hand over the coward.
I'm afraid we can't do that, Favi Tarr.
This is a Castithan matter and will be handled by Castithans.
If you take another step, my first bullet kills you.
Charming girl.
Now we can go around you or through you.
The choice is yours.
All right, get Levon into the doctor.
All right, Rafe.
That's enough, Datak.
Irisa and Tommy were acting under my orders.
I've decided to pardon Elah Bandik of all violations of Castithan law.
Well, you don't have that power.
Well, if you take him, you're gonna have to shoot up this office and kill me.
What do you suppose is going on in there?
Nothing good.
Nak, you better come with us.
- It's not your fight, Rafe.
- Oh, yeah?
I owe you one, Nolan.
So what's it gonna be, Datak?
Pointless bloodshed or are we gonna work out our differences together, peacefully?
Madame Mayor, your passion has touched my heart.
We are indeed one community.
Enough blood has been spilled.
Tonight let us bury our dead with dignity.
And later, who knows?
Perhaps we can revisit these cultural differences with cooler heads.
I'll see you at the wedding.
Appreciate the help, Rafe.
That could have gone badly.
Would have been cleaner if it had.
I gotta go and check on my man.
Amanda.
Let's go, Nak.
Come on.
I'll walk you home.
You know it's not over with Datak.
I know.
Where's Ben?
Dead.
He did say to tell you he's sorry.
Aren't we all?
Town's safe for the moment.
I'll take it.
You can give me the details later.
But for now I've got 41 people to bury.
So what'd you do?
Bust him out?
I don't like chains.
You did the right thing.
Amanda helped.
Wow, so we were right to trust her.
Are we ever gonna make it to Antarctica?
Antarctica's not real, kid.
- You sure of that?
- No.
But this town is.
I'm sure of that.
Tonight we gather to honor the 41 souls who gave their lives to save this town.
They were our mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters.
But to us they were heroes.

AMANDA:
Irathients and humans, they don't have the best relations in this area.

(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
I see you made some new friends.
I figured they hate the Volge more than they hate humans.

When you're done trading, meet back here.
(LAUGHING)
(BARKS, LAUGHS)
(WHIMPERS)
Thanks.
Enjoy that.
Cheers.
Mmm.
Ah, ah, ah, ah.
You touch it, you buy it.
I don't wanna poison my customers.
I lost a brother to that plague you people brought.
Next one finds an eye.
Did the Little Wolf think we were in danger?
No.
He was.
Right about that.
Cute badge, Little Wolf.
I wear it for Nolan.
(SCOFFS)
Nolan is soft.
He's blind to this town.
These people.
My offer still stands, Little Wolf.
You should spend time with your own kind.
(RADIO BEEPING)
What?
NOLAN:
Grab Tommy and meet me at Bissel Pass.
We got a dead body.
Trackers said they heard a scream, but they didn't see anything.
The torso's chewed up pretty bad.
Can't tell if it's male or female.
Male.
Behind the tree.
The bones are all cracked.
Marrow's been sucked clean.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
- You okay?
- (SNIFFLES) I'm fine.
I know these shoes.
Guy's name is Dalton Taggart.
He traded with scavengers for things like this.
What else you know about him?
He ran a bakery, kept to himself...
And he liked to run.
He should've run faster.
SUKAR:
Isn't this interesting?
Indogene.
Castithan.
Liberata.
Sensoth.
Gulanee.
Even Volge.
All the Votan races represented.
Almost.
If you'd like to contribute an Irathient item...
- I would not.
- (SIGHS)
We've had some complaints since the Spirit Riders started coming into town on a regular basis.
Do they say we are stealing their children and fornicating with their livestock?
(CHUCKLES)
I need you to stop provoking people.
Our mere presence is a provocation.
Your Spirit Riders helped us fight the Volge.
As long as I'm mayor, you're welcome here.
That may not be for long.
I hear you're up for re-election soon.
Does everyone have to tell me that?
There are good people here.
If you try to assimilate, they will meet you halfway.
Most of them, anyway.
Let's put the past behind us.
The past is never behind us.
Irzu's path flows through it and forward.
But I will do as you ask.
My people will assimilate.
We will smile as we eat your food and buy your goods.
That is, of course, until your people turn on us again.
But by then we'll be ready.
We'll know where you keep your food stores, your weapons.
Perhaps then I'll bring you a handful of dirt for this clean glass case, a reminder that the soil of Defiance is soaked with Irathient blood.
Yeah!
Feed me.
- Yeah?
- That's it.
Bring it close.
Hmm.
You like my cooking, don't you?
Just shut up and feed me, bitch.
- Hey.
- (GROANS)
That is the wrong answer.

- Ooh.
Ah.
Ooh.

Do you know our safe word?

DOC:
Their saliva contains Votoformic acid.
Nasty stuff.
Lets them chew through anything.
That's right, kids.
We're dealing with Scylla Formicidae.
Hellbugs?
Well, that explains the weird bite marks.
They eat marrow.
Line their nests with flesh.
How do we get rid of them?
Kill the matron.
The rest of them turn docile, stop hunting and killing.
Eventually...
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Irisa?
It's all the blood.
You expect me to believe you got woozy over a little blood?
This was one of your episodes, wasn't it?
I thought you told me they'd stopped.
I just stopped talking about them.
They've been getting stronger since we came here.
- You know they're not real.
- I know.
- They're posttraumatic stress.
- I know.
- And given your history...
- I said I know!
Found something weird around back.
What is it?
It's an empty hellbug egg purse.
You don't find them outside the nest.
DOC:
Unless someone planted it.
Guess what I found on your girlfriend's bed sheets, besides the usual?
An organic compound, also present on Bowen's clothes and Taggart's red shoes.
- Attack pheromones?
- Ding, ding, ding.
What exactly are attack pheromones?
Chemical markers that the bugs spray to guide the hive.
You think someone's directing these attacks?
DOC:
It's the only theory that makes sense.
We've got a killer out there, and his weapon of choice is hellbug.
STAHMA:
That smells wonderful, Christie.
I just hope I didn't overcook it.
Nonsense.
It's perfect.
Mmm.
Isn't it, Datak?
Votan river otter is a very difficult dish to master.
(CHUCKLES) As I, unfortunately, can attest.
You lay a beautiful table, Christie.
The least I can do for letting me stay here.
I was hoping my dad would join us, but I guess he was busy at the mines.
I'm sure he was.
I'd be busy, too, if I had to choke on this otter.
Datak.
It's a Castithan saying.
It means...
Excuse me.
She's been learning to speak Castithan, too.
Thanks, Dad.
Well, that was unfortunate.
Well, her presence is intolerable.
She insists on bathing alone.
Who does that, I ask you?
- Humans.
- Well, it's not right for a proper Castithan household, for a proper Castithan wife.
Alak must show that he can control her.
And he will.
But first we need to secure his marriage, which means healing the rift between Christie and her father.
Hey. (SIGHS)
My dad can be a GI-cho.
At least he's here for you.

No, we have to go back.
- No, we have to go back!
- Alak, wait!
(DATAK CLEARS THROAT)
Perhaps we should dine out.
Oh, Datak.
Christie.
- What is it?
- (TEARFULLY) Dad!
STAHMA:
And dear, brave Alak, he risked his life to rescue Christie.
A moving testament to true love.
Thank you.
Thank you for protecting my...
My baby girl.
I'd give my life for her, sir.
Christie, you should stay here with your father for a while.
It would be good for both of you.
(DOORBELL RINGS)
- Is that all right?
- (DOOR OPENS)
Why, of course.
NOLAN:
Bertie, we need to speak to Rafe right away.
I missed you.
BERTIE:
We've got company.
- Doc...
- DOC:
Hold still, everyone.
RAFE:
What's this about, Nolan?
(DEVICE BEEPING)
Christie, you need to get yourself in the shower and scrub yourself raw, and somebody burn those clothes.
- Why?
- Someone's been using hellbug pheromones to paint targets on intended victims.
Your clothes are drenched in them.
But I just washed them.
I left them out hanging to dry.
That's probably when they did it.
I've heard enough.
All of you, upstairs, now.
Move!
Why Christie?
Why my daughter?
Maybe because she is your daughter.
What can you tell me about Boyd Bowen and Dalton Taggart?
What the hell do they have to do with this?
I'd ask them, but they're dead.
So I'm asking you.
- Nothing that leaps out.
- No?
Nothing?
Well, let's wait till they go after your son.
Maybe that'll jog your memory.
He's at the mines.
Have a deputy bring him here.
- I need you to...
- Bowen, Taggart.
All right, I knew 'em...
I guess.
They were wildcatters.
They sold me some land that they bought up, but that was nearly a dozen years ago.
No dealing since?
They went their way, and I went mine.
This property deal, you got any documentation?
(SIGHS)
Bertie, we're gonna need a lot of coffee.
NOLAN:
No disrespect, Mr McCawley, but this is one hell of a filing system you've got here.
Well, you try running a major mining enterprise for a dozen years without a computer, let alone a decent database programme.
Ha!
I shot these when Defiance was still a tent city.
Wildcatters all looking for that big strike.
There they are.
Bowen and Taggart.
Scruffy-looking bastards.
(GASPS)
Where's this?
That's, uh, west valley, near the lake.
- NOLAN:
Where are you going?
- I need some air.
RAFE:
Hang on, I think I just found the deeds.
Let me see that.
Go keep an eye on her.
- Help yourself.
- Got it.
Irisa!
Hold up!
Okay.
So this deed matches that photo, right?
RAFE:
Yeah, they bought it from some Irathient homesteader named Guzukus or something.
Julluh Grisu.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
What?
Don't imagine a dozen years ago there were too many Irathient homesteaders who signed their names in English.
It was a clean buy.
They all were.
What'd you do to verify it?
I hired a bunch of powerful Wall Street lawyers, and we all surfed the Internet together, looking for a chain of title.
What do you think I did?
Where's Irisa?
She threw me off the roller.
(GROANS)
You look after yours.
I'll look after mine.
(GASPS)
Hide!
Irisa?
Hide.
Hide!
(SCREAMS)
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(GASPS)
(SCREAMS)
Whoa.
Hey.
Come here, talk to me.
(WHIMPERING)
(CRYING)
Come on.
Come on.
You're okay.
- (SOBBING)
- Shh.
It's over.
Hey!
Come on, kiddo.
We should go see the doctor.
You see her.
- You just had a seizure.
- I know what I'm doing.
Please?
Okay.
Another, please.
Where's the girl?
She's behind the hellbug attacks.
What girl?
The Rider with the facial scar.
Rynn.
I couldn't tell you.
Is that why you're still here?
You're waiting for her, helping her with these killings?
I don't know anything about any killings.
What about the ones in the past?
You took her in when she was scared.
After Julluh and Ket were killed, you gave her a new name to keep her safe.
What do you know of the past?
I saw it.
By Irzu's shadow.
I need you to tell me where she is.
You've been touched.
I knew Rynn's parents had been killed.
She said she didn't see who did it.
But sometimes when you are younger, you make yourself forget things.
If Rynn is behind these killings, we need to find her before anybody else gets hurt.
I don't know where Rynn is.
But she may.
If she opens her heart, I can show her the way.
What do you say, Little Wolf?
Gods of our fathers, help this one find the eye that does not blink.
Set her feet on the path to see what others cannot.
Help this one find the eye that does not blink.
Gods of our fathers, help this one find the eye that does not blink.
Set her feet on the path to see what others cannot.
(KET SPEAKING IRATHIENT)
Where are you?
At the farm.
Julluh's farm.
What do you see?
Rynn's mother.
She's telling her to call her father to dinner.
Her father traps insects, studies them.
He's a scientist.
Or was.
Someone's coming.
- It's them.
- SUKAR:
Who?
IRISA:
Taggart.
And Bowen.
JULLUH:
I told you, we're not selling.
YOUNG BOWEN:
Well, we're not buying.
(GASPING)
(GAGGING)
IRISA:
They're killing them.
(SCREAMS)
I wanna help, but I can't move.
SUKAR:
The past cannot be changed.
Yours is only to witness.
Calm yourself.
Calm yourself.
YOUNG BOWEN:
Ah!
She's running away.
You see young Rynn.
Now see the woman.
(GROANS)
(GRUNTING)
(PANTING)
I know where she is.
WOMAN:
That one right there.
Yeah, that one.
I owe you an apology.
Look, I can't explain what you did back there, okay?
Now, these visions of yours, if they are somehow connected to...
If?
They are real!
It was never posttraumatic stress anything.
I'm not like you.
(TEARFULLY) I'm an alien.
And you made me afraid of that!
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Look, when this is over, let's sit down.
We'll get to the bottom of this gift or this curse or whatever the hell this is.
- You're too late.
- Kiddo.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Let's go get Rynn before she kills somebody else.
NOLAN:
Okay.
If we find Rynn, we find the hellbugs.
The plan is we set those thermobaric charges and we get the hell out of Dodge before they blow.
I helped you find Rynn because it's what the gods seem to want, but I will not see her harmed.
Then you better make her stand down.
One does not make an Irathient child do anything.
A fit father would understand.
(DEVICE BEEPING)
Infrared's going nuts.
They must be down at the bottom.
Turn it off.
Do hellbugs have ears?
No, but Rynn does.
(METAL CLANGING)
This is the bottom?
I don't think so.
(SNIFFS)
TOMMY:
What is it, attack pheromones?
Shit.
Hellbug shtako.
Ugh.
They see by smell.
This'll mask our odour.
Come on, get some of this.
Okay.
These things must still be below us, otherwise we'd be seeing a hell of a lot more of them.
Come on.
Tommy, try that controller again.
Well, that doesn't look...
ALL:
Whoa!
- IRISA:
Oh!
- (NOLAN GROANS)
(ALL GROAN)
(DEVICE BEEPING)
NOLAN:
Everyone okay?
- Tommy?
- I didn't touch it, I swear.
(HELLBUGS SCREECHING)
NOLAN:
Easy.
(ROARS)
NOLAN:
Okay, it's working.
If she can't smell us, she can't see us.
Nobody move.
(ROARS)
Looks like we fell into Hellbug Central.
That elevator's our only way out.
The controller must've short-circuited.
- Tommy, get it working.
- On it.
Irisa, let's get those charges set.
We have to find Rynn first.
Yeah?
You got five minutes.
Tommy!
Circuit's fried, but I think I could rewire it.
- (GUNSHOT) - (GROANS)
Don't!
(GROANING)
I toss these pheromones, you all die.
Drop your weapons!
Now!
Rynn, that nest gets any bigger, it's gonna kill everybody in town.
Is that what you really want?
You said we were one spirit.
We are.
Then why did you lead them here?
The Little Wolf led us.
The gods have given her the sight.
Her?
I don't believe it.
You and your useless gods.
See if they protect you from hellbug pheromones.
No!
Your vengeance is fulfilled, sister.
Your parents' killers are dead.
And soon the rest of these humans will join them.
I was there.
At your farm.
I saw what happened.
I saw them.
Your father.
Your mother.
How they looked at you.
The love in their eyes.
Is this how you honour them?
Yes!
NOLAN:
Grenade!
TOMMY:
Nolan, what are you doing?
Getting the babies to attack mama!
Rynn, let's go.
- NOLAN:
Come on!
- (GRUNTS)
(ROARING)
- NOLAN:
Tommy.
- Got it.
All right.
Irisa, get it inside.
(SUKAR GROANS)
(GRUNTS)
All right.
- IRISA:
Kill it!
- NOLAN:
Got it.
Get it going, Tommy.
I'll blow up manually.
TOMMY:
We'll be clear in a second.
Hold on.
AMANDA:
The land in the west valley will become the legal property of the original Irathient settlers or their descendants.
They in turn have agreed to lease the land back to McCawley mines.
But most importantly, with these two bold signatures,
Defiance takes its first steps towards righting an old wrong and honouring the values which we've come to stand for.
(ALL APPLAUDING)
I'm proud of you.
You shot me.
You survived.
I thought I taught you to shoot better than that.
Your parents can dance with their ancestors.
They'd dance more freely if you hadn't let them stop me.
The Little...
Yes.
The Little Wolf has the sight.
So what?
So the gods touched her, and she in turn showed me what needs to happen next.
I'm going to prison!
How can that be the correct path?
I don't know, precious daughter.
Sadly, I lack the sight.
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
(GROANING)
Previously on Defiance...
- Is it Saint Louis?
- Once.
Now we call it Defiance.
This town, it's a nice place to live.
So I keep hearing.
So my lawkeeper told me that he found you and the irathient girl in the Badlands.
She's my daughter.
Your daughter?
I have to thank the owner of McCawley mines,
Rafe McCawley, and his children,
Luke, Quentin, and Christie.
I'm going to gather up some muscle and pay Rafe McCawley a visit.
Our son is in love with the McCawley girl.
Would it not be something if Alak and Christie actually got married?
What's going on, Luke?
What do you got going?
I'll be home for dinner, okay?
Luke was murdered?
Whoever did this, we'll find 'em.
You killed my son!
- No!
Hey!
- Everybody needs to leave.
They're coming.
They're planning to attack right after dark.
Fire!
Yeah!
How many dead?
41.
What are they doing?
It's a Casti cleansing ceremony.
Looks like torture.
Yeah.
Thought we left that stuff behind in the Badlands.
Okay.
All right.
That's enough.
That's it.
You've had your fun.
Now you cut this man down.
This man is a deserter.
He threw down arms and ran from the Volge.
This man was brave to pick up arms in the first place.
Plenty of men lose their nerve the first time in combat.
Not Castithans.
In the laws of our God Rayetso, running from battle reflects upon the brothers of your liro, or caste.
This man Elah Bandik has taken the honor of every Castithan in Defiance.
This man?
This little man has taken the honor of every Castithan in Defiance?
Not that my people have to explain our religion.
But we do this for Bandik's own good.
- I'm sure.
- Without this ritual, his fesho will be denied passage to the afterlife.
I don't care.
I'm shutting it down.
No, don't, please.
I have no choice.
I must do this for my family.
You cut that man down, or I'm dragging every one of you in.
And I'm starting with you.
What's going on here?
Madame Mayor.
I hope you've come to put a muzzle on your new lawkeeper.
Our understanding with your predecessor dates back to the founding of this town.
Do you intend to dismantle that understanding... three weeks into the job?
Keep this ceremony confined to the hollows.
Of course, Amanda.
Call me Mayor.
Put your gun away.
Come with me.
I'm sorry.
You seemed upset.
I've seen worse.
They're not bickering over the price of a roller.
They're torturing a man to death.
Nolan, you're from the outside.
I can imagine what this looks like.
I'm not sure you can.
You ever wonder why we have so few Irathients in Defiance?
What the hell does that have to do with anything?
Eight years ago, when Defiance was first founded, we had well over 1,000.
But for some reason they didn't believe in vaccinating their kids.
Mayor Nicky saw irathient kids dying for no good reason.
So they wrote mandatory vaccinations into the town charter.
Deputies went from house to house inoculating irathient children by force.
Irathients took up arms, and there was an uprising.
What happened?
They had clubs.
We had Vo-tech blasters.
What do you think happened?
Some were killed, and the rest left.
After that, the town council informally decided to allow the eight races to honor the traditional values of their own people.
All right.
You look me in the eye, you tell me you think what's going on back there is right.
It's necessary.
You're not gonna stop this?
No, I am not.
I'm not prepared to shoot up an entire town to rescue a man who says he doesn't want to be saved.
Besides, the lady Mayor promised she'd try and fix it.
Promises are shtako.
Yeah, well, it depends on the person making the promise.
Let's just take a beat, see what the lady Mayor's word is worth.
Time to wake up, Ben.
Vri-Tex?
You could have killed me with this.
My priority was to keep you from talking.
I wouldn't have betrayed you.
That's good, given what would happen to your family if you did.
Or if you fail a second time.
Okay.
A second time?
I did everything you said.
I blew up the stasis net.
And yet the Volge were defeated, and the town is still standing.
They beat the Volge?
- How?
- Doesn't matter.
You remember the old plan?
The mines.
But couldn't that destroy the very thing you're trying to find?
I have faith.
You do as you're told.
No, no, no, I can't go through this again.
I didn't sign up for this.
You signed up for whatever it takes, Ben.
Hey, dad.
Decided to come home?
I saw you at the service for Luke yesterday.
I didn't know what to say, so I ducked you.
That was wrong.
With Luke gone, we need to set aside the small stuff and pull together.
Oh, you agreeing to marry Datak's kid, that's the small stuff I'm supposed to put aside?
Come on, dad.
Accept the olive branch.
Let's eat.
How am I supposed to eat when all I can see is that haint...
- Don't use that word.
- That Castithan putting his hands all over you?
You think that's what your dead brother would have wanted?
What he wanted doesn't matter anymore.
It's about what we want.
I'm in love with Alak Tarr, and I want to marry him.
Yeah?
Well, I want you to call off this wedding and come home.
And if I don't?
If you walk out that door again,
- there's no coming back.
- Dad.
Since mom died,
Christie's the only one been holding this family together, and, the one time she does something you don't like, you turn on her?
- Oh, but Luke...
- What about Luke?
Your brother was a good man.
Then why was he meeting alone in the woods with Ben Daris, guy who brought the Volge down on us?
McCawley.
I'll be right there.
Quentin, get the roller.
There's been an explosion at the mine.
Your deputy's gonna be fine, but there's no sign of Ben Daris.
Took a hell of a chance busting him out in broad daylight.
Well, whoever jump-started him us Vri-Tex.
Dangerous drug used in combat medicine.
Could be ex-military.
Quentin McCawley just hailed.
There's been an explosion at the mine.
There you are.
Your friend Ben Daris attacked one of my guards, and stole a bunch of Gulanite, and went underground.
He blew the I-9 shaft behind him so we couldn't follow.
This is on you, Amanda, and you.
Let my son's murderer get loose.
We'll get him back.
How many miners did you have in the shaft?
None.
The shaft's abandoned.
Leads down to old St. Louis.
Old St. Louis?
When the alien Terraformers went crazy, most American cities were obliterated, but something strange happened to St. Louis.
The terraformed earth folded over the city and hardened before crushing it.
Some sections of the city are still intact, more or less.
Something's still not right.
What do you mean?
Well, with the stasis net down, what was to stop Ben escaping through the pass?
Why trap himself underground?
Well, he stole 20 kilos of Gulanite.
Wouldn't take more than two to blow that tunnel.
All right, so that's 18 kilos left.
That's enough to make a big bomb.
Not enough to do anything to Defiance.
Not from down there anyway.
He can tell us who's behind the Volge attack.
We need to go after him.
So how long to clear this?
Four hours minimum.
No, too long.
We need another way down.
Here.
- What's that?
- Rat's nest.
It's a maze down there.
Not to mention razor-sharp rocks and steep drop-offs.
Nobody bothered to map it since the I-9's always bigger and safer.
The map's in my head.
I discovered the rat's nest.
It's our best chance to get ahead of Ben Daris.
Quentin, go find Nak and Levon and a couple others and break out some rappelling gear.
No way.
Absolutely not.
Mm-mmm.
It's my tunnels, my men...
Yeah, how do I know you're not gonna find Ben
- and shoot him?
- My word.
Or is that all of a sudden not good enough for you?
I'll tag along with him, keep him honest.
No, no, no.
Listen, you're no miner.
It's too dangerous.
I'm not gonna get saddled with some topside flatfoot.
No offense, but I've done rougher descents during the war looking for underground bunkers.
20 scrip says my boots hit the ground first.
It's your ass.
No matter what, you gotta make sure that he doesn't kill Ben.
Man did kill his son.
- Had it been me...
- I know.
But we need him alive for questioning.
Our first priority is protecting this town.
I'll bring Ben back alive, I promise.
Nolan, don't risk your life for these people.
They're not worth it.
Oh, some of them are.
I need you to stay here and help Tommy figure out who set our fugitive free.
And you are to stay far, far away from Elah Bandik.
You hear me?
The humans find this sort of thing unseemly.
I don't care what the humans think.
But their opinions matter.
If they're against us, we'll never be able to take control of the McCawley mines.
I'm thinking about our son's future.
Think of your life back on Casti.
You were at the bottom layer of the lowest caste.
Your life was degradation and poverty.
Is the Castithan way really something you're eager to preserve?
What's going on?
It's Christie.
Rafe McCawley's messing with her mind.
I don't know what's gonna happen.
We may have to cancel the wedding.
Oh, honey.
Rafe McCawley needs a bullet in the head.
- Dad!
- He doesn't mean it.
Oh, I do.
You know what the hot water does to your father's disposition.
Mother will take care of everything.
Oh.
You got a fix on that Gulanite he's carrying?
Yeah, I do.
And he's not far.
Let's go and nail the bastard.
Welcome to old St. Louis.
It's about time I got my clutter out of here, give you a chance to put your stamp on this office.
And now that I'm retired,
I'm thinking of taking up golf.
Oh, I once had a three handicap.
And no one can say I didn't, because there's no one around except me who remembers the damn rules.
Poor bastard.
He's been up there for three hours, hasn't he?
I hate this, Nicky.
I really do.
We have a town charter, and we haven't followed it for years.
It has to stop.
Castithans are tricky.
They're obsessive about their past, who their ancestors were, what liro they were born into.
They build their lives around ancient traditions that may once have had a purpose, but...
None of them can agree on what it was.
They sound a lot like us.
They've lost their past.
Blew up when their planet did.
These sad little displays in the street, that's all they've got left.
You try to take that away, it'll be the Iraths all over again.
I don't believe that.
Defiance has changed a lot in the past five years.
Look, we came together to fight the Volge and won.
I think we're building a bigger identity that's greater than human or Irath or Casti.
I'm going to miss you.
Birch.
Did chivalry die in the Volge attack?
What's Ben's status?
He's underground and on his way.
We need to leave town now.
It should only take him two more hours to reach the target.
Well, he was injured.
He may fail.
He's motivated.
I made sure of that.
I take your word.
Before we leave, there are a couple of folks I want to say good-bye to.
You let yourself get too close to these people.
I grew up with them.
I saw their babies being born, saw them raised.
What I do I do for the benefit of all of us and because it must be done.
I take no pleasure in this, birch.
You know that.
I know.
I just ran out of time, that's all.
No matter how much you get, it's never enough.
You okay there, old timer?
I'm fine.
All right, let's take a break.
Yeah, well, don't stop on my account.
I need water.
All right, everybody.
Take five.
Jefferson Park.
Hell, I haven't been here since I was nine.
- You were a local?
- Yeah.
I got to admit, though, it's all a bit hazy.
I do get the feeling my folks and I used to eat around here somewhere.
Probably golden's on the far side of the park.
That sounds right.
Best toasted ravioli in the state.
Pretty good gooey butter cake too.
Now that I remember.
Right up there with penicillin for the world's greatest inventions.
I used to take Luke there when he was maybe three.
So what about your family?
What did they do before arkfall?
Dog food.
Dog food?
My family made dog food.
Wait, McCawley.
Your old man was...
Yes.
"Chow down" Brown McCawley.
How did that jingle go?
I ain't singing it for you.
♪ Healthy pups can't get enough ♪
♪ they never wear a frown ♪
Forget it.
It's not happening.
♪ 'Cause it's chow down time ♪
♪ chow down time, it's always chow down time ♪
Man, I cannot see you in the dog food business.
Oh, I wanted to be a photographer.
Sports stuff.
Some bikini stuff just for fun.
Why didn't you stick with it?
Well, I shot terraformed landscapes for a while, but I gave it up.
It was too depressing.
All it did was remind me of everything that the aliens took away.
Yeah.
So look, Rafe, I want to be clear.
This Votan we're chasing...
The one that killed my boy?
Is that the Votan we're talking about?
We need to bring him back alive.
- You know that, right?
- I don't know any such thing.
Predicting the future's a sucker's game.
You don't believe me?
Just take a look around you.
Elah Bandik is under arrest.
For what?
Loitering.
Signal's getting stronger.
Wherever he is, he's close.
I don't remember those towers.
It's a nuclear plant.
Went up during the war.
If Ben detonated the Gulanite in one of those reactors...
Radiation would get up through the tunnels in the rat's nest.
Radiation would kill everybody.
♪
Penny for your thoughts.
That is what you humans say, yes?
My brother collected pennies.
The very old kind.
Said the copper used to be worth more than the coins themselves.
You were just thinking of him, weren't you?
It is our duty to live our lives to the fullest... to honor those who have passed.
Which is why I was surprised to hear you're having second thoughts about the wedding.
I just want to slow down, take a pause.
Your father's putting that much pressure on you, is he?
He's sort of a jackass.
Most men are.
It's a characteristic that transcends species.
You can fight him if you want to.
I don't think I can.
Just before I left my home world, my parents went to great lengths to insure that I married a man that they deemed suitable.
At my side was a stranger, not very handsome.
But he came from the highest liro.
And he was a man of great honor.
My parents believed this man of great honor would keep me safe.
What happened?
I met someone else.
He was a scruffy young nobody, beautiful, dangerous, a wicked smile.
He'd won passage to earth as payment for a gambling debt.
Datak.
He pursued me aggressively.
My betrothed was furious.
He challenged Datak to a Castithan blood duel.
So they fought?
They never got a chance.
On his way to the duel, my man of great honor was accidentally flushed out of an airlock.
It was a tragic accident.
How do you get accidentally...
Datak was a man I knew loved me beyond scope of reason.
He was a survivor, a man who would stop at nothing to keep us both safe.
I understood the man I needed in a way my parents could not.
Is this a true story?
It's going to be a beautiful wedding.
Watch your step.
Keep your eyes open.
That's it.
Stay together.
I haven't been in here in a long time.
Still nothing?
Uh-uh.
That's it.
- Bomb's deactivated.
- Good.
Hey.
Hey.
We need this guy alive if we're ever gonna find out who the hell is behind all this.
You want to avenge Luke, I get it.
Rafe, you got Christie and you got Quentin sitting at home, and someone is doing their damnedest to destroy
- the town they live in.
- You know, Luke begged for his life like a little girl.
Hey, we need answers from this guy.
- I know what I'm doing, lawman.
- Do you want to know
- why he was helping me?
- Hey!
What, you trying to die for the cause?
It was because he needed money so he could get away from Defiance
- and get away from you.
- Rafe.
That's what's so laughable about all this.
You came down here to avenge poor, old Luke, and he hated your guts.
I mean, after what you did to his mother.
- Shut up!
- Hey.
Now you can do the right thing by your dead child or you can do the right thing by the two living ones, but you cannot do both.
Now you make your choice.
Right now.
Tell Amanda I'm sorry.
It's pretty quiet out there.
The Mayor said she'll be right over.
Maybe we'll be all right.
They'll come for him.
This was a mistake.
You were stupid to help me.
You made a move, and I backed you up.
That's what lawkeepers do.
Clancy taught me that.
You were stupid to listen to him.
Shtako.
How many?
I can see Datak and that bio-man.
You go around the side.
Hand over the coward.
I'm afraid we can't do that, Favi Tarr.
This is a Castithan matter and will be handled by Castithans.
If you take another step, my first bullet kills you.
Charming girl.
Now we can go around you or through you.
The choice is yours.
All right, get Levon into the doctor.
All right, Rafe.
That's enough, Datak.
Irisa and Tommy were acting under my orders.
I've decided to pardon elah Bandik of a violations of Castithan law.
Well, you don't have that power.
Well, if you take him, you're gonna have to shoot up this office and kill me.
What do you suppose is going on in there?
Nothing good.
Nak, you better come with us.
- It's not your fight, Rafe.
- Oh, yeah?
I owe you one, Nolan.
So what's it gonna be, Datak?
Pointless bloodshed or are we gonna work out our differences together, peacefully?
Madame Mayor, your passion has touched my heart.
We are indeed one community.
Enough blood has been spilled.
Tonight let us bury our dead with dignity.
And later, who knows?
Perhaps we can revisit these cultural differences with cooler heads.
I'll see you at the wedding.
Appreciate the help, Rafe.
That could have gone badly.
Would have been cleaner if it had.
I gotta go and check on my man.
Amanda.
Let's go, nak.
Come on.
I'll walk you home.
You know it's not over with Datak.
I know.
Where's Ben?
Dead.
He did say to tell you he's sorry.
Aren't we all?
Town's safe for the moment.
I'll take it.
You can give me the details later.
But for now I've got 41 people to bury.
So what'd you do?
Bust him out?
I don't like chains.
You did the right thing.
Amanda helped.
Wow, so we were right to trust her.
Are we ever gonna make it to Antarctica?
Antarctica's not real, kid.
- You sure of that?
- No.
But this town is.
I'm sure of that.
Tonight we gather to honor the 41 souls who gave their lives to save this town.
They were our mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters.
But to us they were heroes.
[Beatles Christmas recording, 1963]
?
[Christmas song]
Hello, this is John speaking with his voice.
We're all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic.
This record reaches you at the end of a really dear year for us, and it's all due to you.
I'd like to say thank you to all of the Beatle people who have written to me during the year.
I'd love to reply personally to everyone, but I just haven't enough pens.
This is Paul here.
We're all dead pleased by the way you've treated us in 1963, and we're trying to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we write and record next year.
Well, I'm running out of my time and people are telling me to stop-- [all] Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop shouting those animals!
So I'll finish now with wishing everyone
Happy Crimble, and a merry new year.
Ya Ringo!
Hello, Ringo here.
As you know,
I was the last member to join The Beatles.
I started to play gongs in the group 1962.
?
[singing]
Thank you Ringo, thank you Ringo.
We'll phone you.
?
[George Harrison singing] [laughter] I'm George Harrison!
Nobody else has said anything yet about our secretary, Freda Kelly in Liverpool.
Good old Freda!
So on behalf of us all, I'd just like to say a great big "thank you"--
?
[singing together]
[Freda] I was just a secretary then, and, funny enough, I'm still a secretary now, and who would want to hear the secretary's story?
?
[music]
[Freda] Millions of girls around the world wanted this dream job:
they wanted to be the secretary.
She epitomized all their dreams and all their hopes, and all these girls wanted to be Freda Kelly and to be that close to The Beatles.
Well, I didn't expect to talk, maybe grab one of them, but I wouldn't hurt 'em, I wouldn't hurt 'em,
I'd just talk to them maybe, but I wouldn't, you know, grab-- like, everybody says they're gonna cut their hair and everything-- we wouldn't do that.
[Bill Kinsley] If you look at what is history now,
The Beatles were together ten years.
Freda worked for The Beatles for eleven.
She was there right before they made it, and right after they finished, so that says it all, basically.
Tell me, when you hear a Beatles record, what thoughts run through your mind?
Beauty, sheer beauty.
The Beatles bring joy into the world:
they're happiness; we forget our cares when we hear Beatle records.
[old man] Freda was far more than a secretary to the Beatles;
she was a family member.
She's never had the same recognition that a number of people within the inner circle have had, simply because she never pushed herself, she never wrote a book, she never agreed to do interviews, she's always kept a very very confidential existence.
[fan girl] We came here at 6 o'clock in the morning, 5:30, to see them, and all they do is push you farther and farther away and then they don't even let you see them!
A lot of people didn't take these girls seriously, but I did, because, you know,
I was one of them -- I was a fan me self.
So I knew where they were coming from.
We grew up with them.
You know, they started when they were younger and we were younger.
And all through these years, we've just developed with them and grown up with them, and they belong to us, you know?
But there could never be another Beatles.
Never.
[old woman] She's one of the last survivors of the whole Beatles era, and you know, this story of Freda Kelly's will be, surely, one of the last true stories of the Beatles
that you'll ever really hear.
[Freda] I've been a secretary for half a century, fifty years, and that's quite frightening.
This job is interesting, but it's not as exciting as my last job.
I don't get the phone calls that I did in the 60's, like, you know, an invite to a premiere, you know, "Roy Orbison's having a party and we've managed to get a few tickets,
do you want to come to that Fre?"
And I'm like "Yeah, okay, I'm on the next train!"
[Good Ol' Freda]
?
[xylophone music]
I left school when I was sixteen, and my first job was at a firm called Prince's.
I was in the middle of a typing pool, which is rows of secretaries just typing away.
The lads from different levels of law would come down and give me work to do, but most of my day was just spent typing contracts, typing letters -- it wasn't the most glamorous of jobs,
but I was a working woman now.
?
[indie rock music]
[Freda] One day, two guys from upstairs came down and came over to my desk and just said "Come on Freda, we're going to take you out for lunch."
I didn't know where I was going, and I ended up in The Cavern.
Now, I'd never been to The Cavern before,
I didn't even know what I was going into, because it was a cellar.
It had a unique smell:
there was no ventilation, and sometimes the toilets overflowed, and it was opposite a fruit market, so it was probably a mixture of disinfectant, rotten fruit, and sweat all rolled into one.
There was three archways, and in the middle archway was wooden seats, all different types of wooden seats, they weren't all in rows and all the same.
There was a little wooden stage at the back, and The Beatles were playing on the stage when I first walked in.
And I'd never experienced anything like that -- it was everything about them, it was just the way they dressed, with all this leather gear, they were larking about, and dancing on stage, and mucking about with the audience,
and on top of everything else, there was the music.
It was just unlike anything I'd ever heard.
I was hooked.
I just was amazed by everything I saw, and I thought "That's it, I'm going to go tomorrow."
Well I think it's put down that they played something silly like 294 times.
Out of that, I would say, I probably saw them about 190 times.
?
[rock music]
[Bill Kinsley] Freda was definitely a staple of The Cavern, she was always there, and she always sat in the same seat.
[Freda] I used to like the second arch on the left hand side, because it was just that handy.
You could pop in and out the band room all the time.
There was about two rows in the front, they would leave their rollers in until before the lads would come onstage, and then they'd take their rollers out and doll theirselves up and everything.
It was conversation all the time with the audience.
Somebody came in, a different hairstyle, they'd pick on them.
They'd go "Have you been the hairdresser's?"
or "Who got you up this morning?" [laughter]
But he answered them back.
They liked the razzmatazz between you and them.
People used to write down a number, give it to them, and ask them would they right play that number.
Now, if you gave it to John, Paul always went over to John and leaned over his shoulder and read the request out.
I thought "Can John read, or--?"
He looked pretty arrogant, to be honest-- he'd look at the crowd like that as if he was going to kill everyone in the crowd.
And then I mentioned it to somebody and they said "Oh, no, no, John's as blind as a bat.
He wears glasses and he never wears his glasses, so he can't see further than his nose."
I liked George singing Three Cool Cats, I loved that one.
Or The Sheik of Araby, because he used to do a little dance and I liked him doing the little dance.
He used to sort of kick his feet along the stage.
[laughter]
A few times I rang Paul up, because one of my friends fancied him and I wanted him to sing for her.
We used to just dial Garston and then the number 6922.
He'd say "Hello," and you'd go, "Oh hi Paul, it's Freda.
It's Linda Shepherd's birthday on such-and-such a day, can you play Love of the Loved for her?"
"Yeah, okay."
I got to know them personally through just talking to them, going in the band room, because when they came off-stage, they used to either sit in the band room, talking to different people who ever came in,
and then you would just sit by them, and you would just ask them where they were playing, or how come you weren't here yesterday.
Paul was always nice and always friendly, and any time you'd ask Paul to sing something, he would do it.
John... a man of many moods.
It depended on what side of the bed he got out in in the morning.
He could be really grumpy, but he was always himself, he never put an act on.
People say George was the quiet Beatle, and I suppose he was in one way, but he was never quiet with me.
He was more quietly-spoken, I think, than the others.
He was very thoughtful.
Ringo hadn't joined the group yet;
Pete Bass was on the drums.
Pete was very shy, and he was also very handsome, so he had a big following around town, from the girls.
They loved Pete.
They all lived my way home, on the south side of Liverpool, and Paul and George had cars, and then they'd say "Do you want a lift home?"
My father wasn't keen on them, he saw them and what he saw he didn't like.
If they'd had suits on, or somebody had a suit with a collar and tie, he probably would've approved of them, but he didn't approve of The Beatles.
?
[worn vinyl sensual music]
But I was always late back from work,
I was always pushing and puffing and panting and sitting down and starting to type.
I couldn't say I was somewhere else or I got held up in a restaurant or trying to get some food because I had the Cavern smell on me, so they knew exactly where I'd been.
The girls in the typing pool had photographs up on the wall of Pat Boone and Elvis and Tommy Steele and Cliff Richard, and I didn't like any of them, so I found a little picture of The Beatles,
but it was only dead small, and I remember putting it up on the wall, and the personnel manager caught me when I was putting it up on the wall, Mr. Mold, and he said,
"Oh, what are you doing, who are they?"
and I said "Oh, they're The Beatles,"
and he went "Who's The Beatles?"
and I said "They're a Liverpool group,"
and he went "Never heard of them,"
and I said "Oh, you will one day."
Bobbie Brown was the girl who went to The Cavern and started a fan club for The Beatles.
Now, I couldn't understand why The Beatles had a fan club, because they were just a local group, but I eventually ended up helping Bobbie, and then Bobbie got a boyfriend and lost interest in running the Beatles fan club,
so I took over from there.
I was buying stamps and salve in the beginning, and I remember being in the band room one day lunch time and saying to Paul, "You owe me seven six for stamps,"
and he went "I haven't any money."
And then Bob Waller paid them, and I sat in the band room until Bob Waller paid them, and I said "You've now got money."
So he give him his due and paid me.
I just had this faith -- and there wasn't just me -- you just knew they were going to be famous one day, but I couldn't visualize the fame that they got.
To me, being famous was playing on The Empire, having a record in the charts.
Cliff Richard was big in those days, and being as big as Cliff Richard, that was as far as my vision went.
[Billy] Everything was new, nobody knew what was going to happen.
People who ever say to you, "We knew they were going to be a success,"
they're lying through their teeth.
Nobody knew it was going to be the world phenomenon that it became.
?
[music]
I got to know Brian Epstein through The Beatles.
I was going to see The Beatles all the time, and then Brian Epstein started to come to see them and that's how we became friendly.
Everybody in Liverpool knew who he was, because he was manager of NEMS Ltd., the biggest record shop in the north of England.
I do remember it was by St. Barnabas's Hall in Penny Lane, it was a Saturday night, I walked in,
I just know Eppy coming up to me, and he then told me that he was signing The Beatles and he was starting his own firm and he needed a secretary.
Then he said, did I want to come and work for them, and I said "Oh, go on then." I just remember saying, "Oh go on then."
And I was so excited because I was starting my dream job, working for The Beatles.
[Tony Barrow] I think what Brian Epstein saw was somebody who was a fan without being an over-the-top fanatic.
I would call her more of an admirer;
she appreciated The Beatles, and that fitted perfectly, I mean,
Freda was there on the scene and ready to take over.
We had a lot of respect for Brian, obviously, we thought he was really posh, you know, we were all Liverpool screw-offs really, but Brian was very posh, and for him to choose Freda to be the secretary,
we thought "Hey, wow, she must have something,"
you know, he could have picked anybody.
That's when I had to tell home, 'cos I didn't want to tell home, 'cos I just knew the reaction.
My mother died when I was eighteen months, and she died of cancer.
I had a good relationship with my father, but also he was very protective towards me because I was his only child.
I was 17, so I managed to pluck up the courage this particular night at tea time, and I just said casually "I'm starting a new job on Monday."
And I do remember him saying "Has it got anything to do with The Beatles?"
and I just blanked it, I must have turned it back 'cos I know I didn't lie, but I didn't answer the question, and all I remember was the teapot going down with a big slam.
[Freda] We used to call him Daddy Eppy;
he was Brian Epstein's father, and it was his business.
We were on the top floor of his shop.
The first floor was what we used to call the "white goods":
it was televisions and washing machines and things like that, and then on the second floor, that was Brian Epstein's office, and then there was a store room behind his office, so I worked in the store room.
They changed that into an office for me.
In the beginning, the lads were in the office nearly every single day, you know, they just popped in and out.
They would sit by my desk for a chat or while they were waiting to go into Eppy's office, so I got to know them more.
I was 17, so naturally I did have crushes on them.
The way I describe it, and this is the truth, if Paul looked nice or sang a song for me or something,
I was in love with Paul that day, I fancied him that day, but then the following day, if Ritchie asked me how me dogs were
(because he knew I had Yorkshire Terriers, he'd say "Oh, how are the dogs?")
I'd think "Oh, yeah, I fancy Ritchie,"
and then I think, if George offered me a lift home from work,
I'd be in love with George that day, and I'd think "Yeah, yeah, I definitely fancy George."
But then if John came in and started talking about various things,
I'd think "I like his nose, I like the Roman nose,"
but it would only be for a day or two.
Did you go out with any of them?
No.
Pass.
No stories there?
Oh, there is stories, but I don't want anybody's hair falling out or turning curly.
That's personal.
It was the end of a working day, and Eppy just came in and said,
"Come on Freda, put your coat on,
I'm going to take you somewhere."
I had no idea where.
And next minute we were at The Empire, and then next minute we were in the box,
I'd never been in the box of The Empire.
It was this one on the left.
He'd managed to get The Beatles a spot on the Little Richard show, and I think somebody was sick or something and he'd managed to get them on.
And I remember sitting in the box, it was just Eppy and I, and I was to the left, and then I looked down on the stage and the whole theatre and the stage were in darkness,
except for this light shining on Paul's face, and he was singing A Taste of Honey.
I don't cry, but my eyes sort of filled up and I just couldn't believe that The Beatles were on The Empire, the biggest theatre in Liverpool, and I thought "This is it.
They've made it.
They're going to be famous one day."
?
[harmonica music]
The Beatles' first hit, as far as I'm concerned, was Love Me Do, I mean,
I was one of the ones that bought it, and I didn't have a record player, and there was loads of girls like me that didn't have record players, but we bought it just to boost the sales.
You didn't have pop stations then, but we had one station called Radio Luxembourg, and they used to do the charts, and I remember staying up late, sitting by the radio, holding the knob,
trying to keep it on the same wavelength, and waiting to hear The Beatles' record.
And when it got to 17, that was amazing.
I know it only stayed the week, I think, but it didn't matter.
They were in the charts.
I was working for Brian Epstein, doing a normal day-job, but I also had to do the fan club overnight.
Silly me, I gave out my home address as the fan club address.
The postman knocked on the door and he said to me, "Who gave this address out?
You've got 200 letters here."
And I said, "Sorry, won't do it again time."
Little did he know, within the next few months The Beatles became more famous, and instead of just 200 letters, they were coming in bundles, and those bundles came in sacks, so the van rolled up.
My father wasn't keen on The Beatles anyway, and his own personal mail, you know, your telephone bill, electricity bill, your gas bill, all in the fan mail.
So he just looked at me and said,
"You've got to put a stop to this.
What possessed you to give our home address out?"
I didn't think at the time.
My mother has never played the fame game.
If she had, things would be completely different now, and she might not be working six days a week
9 'til 5 o'clock at night, very stressed, when other people have retired, and she hasn't got that joy.
These are all Christmas decorations.
Oh, success.
I kept a couple of scrapbooks with theatre tickets in, and newspaper cuttings in.
A few fan club letters.
Yeah, they're old.
I think it's records, and, oh, me scrapbook.
Yeah.
Cuttings book.
I mean I have a lot of these.
I don't know.
Forty years since Rachel was born.
I could have been a very very wealthy woman, could be a millionairess if I'd have kept everything.
I had loads of autographs, photographs, all the fan club stuff, Apple stuff, fan club records, but over a period of time, I gave it all away.
But I don't regret that, because I know when I gave the majority of the stuff away,
I gave it in 1974, and I actually handed the stuff to Beatle fans myself, so I knew the Beatle fans got all the fan club stuff that was left.
I've got these four boxes anyway.
I didn't even think I had four boxes.
As I'm flicking through, there are so many memories coming back to me.
I'll just pick something up, and I'll remember that day.
Oh, this is George Harrison's real hair.
?
[rock and roll music]
A few months after Love Me Do, the lads had their first number one hit, which was Please Please Me.
We were gradually getting letters, from 50 a day, 200 a day, to my home, and then it worked up to about 800 a day, and then eventually we didn't even count them, we just threw the mail in the corner.
I would put loads of photographs in front of them, and they would go in to Eppy, and they would take the photographs in with them, and while they were talking to Eppy, they were all signing.
But they never complained about signing things, never ever.
I think it was because it was early days and they were all excited by it all, so nothing was a problem.
Out of all The Beatles, I'd say George was the best one for signing things.
He would come in and he'd go,
"Do you want me to sign anything?
What have you got in your cupboard?"
The Beatles called him Eppy, we all did, but to his face, he asked us to call him Mr. Brian in the office.
He was the boss so it was Mister.
He had an aura about him.
I know he was probably only 27 then, but he was old.
Ten years was a big difference in those days, where I'm 17, he's 27.
He came from a well-off family and he had nice clothes and spoke with a posh accent, so you had respect for him.
He threw a few tantrums in the office, and you just kept out of his way.
Well, I did.
Probably that's why I lasted ten years.
Some people didn't, or retaliated, and they were sacked on the spot.
He was the boss, and he was the boss.
Brian Epstein was notorious for his dreadful tantrums.
He would hire and re-fire his top executives at the drop of a hat.
Freda was sort of immune, if you like, to the temper tantrums.
She was never hurt by them.
?
[music]
We had a new dictaphone, and he gave me this tape to do while he was out, and I'd done about two letters and the tape got stuck.
So Neil Aspinall came in and I said,
"Oh God, I've got this tape and I've got it stuck, and there's a load of work on it."
We pressed two things, and we erased all the work.
He came in the office, and I just saw John at the back of him, and he went to hang up the coat, and he said, "Have you finished the tape?"
and I just said "No.
I'm sorry, no.
I've wiped it by mistake."
He just looked at me, and then shouted "You stupid girl!"
and John Lennon saved the day, because he was behind me, and he must have seen how shaken I was, and Eppy about to erupt.
He started laughing, and going "Oh, what have you done, Kelly?"
and when a Beatle laughed, Eppy laughed.
But it wasn't a proper laugh.
He wasn't amused at all.
And I just remember looking at him and saying "I'll stay late to do it."
and he said, "I know you will, you'll definitely stay late, until all this work is done."
I was very naive for my age;
I just came into the music business when I was 17, up until I was 16, I'm camping with the Guides and things like that.
Once I joined the Beatles organization,
I grew up overnight in more ways than one, and I remember saying to John,
"You know what?
I don't know what it is about him--"
I said "I can't put me finger on it,"
and I know I was rabbiting on for England, and John started laughing, and then he went "Have you no idea?"
and I said, "No idea about what?"
He put it to me very innocently, and I always respect him for that, he said, "Well let's say this, Fre, if you're on a desert island with him, you'd be safe."
And the penny dropped.
Where nowadays it's legal, and quite rightly so, but in those days they had a lot to put up with.
Probably that had a lot to do with his mood-swings as well, and trying to keep it from his parents and other people.
The music industry was a man's industry in the '60s.
In The Beatles' circle, there wasn't any high-ranking women.
Women, or girls, worked on the admin side, but the highest you can go in admin is just be secretary to the main guy.
I was secretary to Brian Epstein, but there wasn't a hard road to climb, you just had to stay there.
There was a lot to get done, so anybody that came into the office,
I would put them to work.
I would get them slicing' the envelopes, tearin' the foreign stamps off, stickin' photographs in envelopes, and groups around town
-- because they never had any money, musicians around town -- they used to come into my office for a free cup of tea, or if it was raining, or to hear the records, so while they were sitting there,
nobody sat there doing nothing.
They all used to help out.
I bumped into the lead singer of
The Cryin' Shames, Ritchie Routledge, and he had a big post bag on his back, and I said "Where are you going?"
he said, "I'm going to the post office,"
I said "What for?", he said, "I've got all The Beatles' vinyl stuff in the bag, Freda told me -- not asked me, told me -- to go and post it."
She just had this way about her, a bit like a schoolteacher really.
You know, you had to do what the schoolteacher said, and you had to do what Freda said, really.
Well, you didn't have to do it, you wanted to do it for her, 'cause she'd just give you a little smile, and you did it.
When Ringo first joined the band
-
- I think he was only in the band about two weeks or something --
I came into the office, he said
"I'm getting letters to my house, and if I bring them in, will you do them?"
And I went "No, I won't," I said, "I've got too much to do."
I said "Get your mother to do it, you know all the other parents do,"
and he went "Oh, me mum doesn't know what to do."
He put the sad eyes on, and just like
"Oh, go on, please?
You know, I don't get many."
To shut him up I went "Oh go on then, bring them in."
He brought about nine letters in this little poly bag, and he actually put the answers to the questions that they'd asked in the letters on the top of the letter to help me, 'cos he said to me, "If you don't know the answers
I've put the answers down for you and everything."
He must have thought I was terrible, 'cos I looked at him and I said to him "Is this all you get?"
I couldn't believe-- he must have wanted to shoot me, and I went, "You've only got nine letters."
He said, "Will you help me?
Will you come and show me mum what to do?"
I ended up going 'round, knocking on 10 Admiral Grove, and Elsie opened the door, and I said, "I'm Freda from the office,"
and she went, "Oh, thank God for that, come in, love, come in."
And I said, "Well, I've just brought stuff for you, to show you what to do."
She said, "Have you had any tea?"
And I said "No," and she went, "Would you like egg and chips?"
and I said, "Oh, I'd love egg and chips, yeah."
And then we started talking, and we got on like a house on fire.
Every week, for years, I went to that house.
Will the neighbors not become envious of all the wealth that's been accumulated by the Beatles?
No, not the neighbors 'round here, they're all very good and all quite proud.
Comin' back now, just everything is flashing in me head about just how much joy and happiness and laughter went on in this house.
I had a great time here.
I loved it,
I loved coming here every week.
It's probably...
I haven't been in this house for about 46 years.
I spent a lot of my life here.
I used to stay 'til about 1 or 2 in the morning, going through the mail, and talking, and laughing, things about my life as well, and who I was going out with at the time.
And it's not one of The Beatles, before you start.
Elsie'd give me advice, motherly advice.
She was very jolly, very outgoing, and a really strong laugh.
I told her all my secrets when I was a teenager.
Maybe she looked on the daughter that she didn't have, maybe she looked on me as that.
She decided I wasn't getting enough money, wages, and she was at a party, and Eppy was there, and then she, few drinks down, and then she starts in on him and said "You don't know what you've got there,
you've got a good worker there."
And she was going on and on, and I was going "Well, shut up."
And she was going, "You should pay her some more money, you know.
You don't pay her enough money.
You should give her a rise."
I really got a rise, two weeks later.
His words were, "We've reviewed your wages, Freda, and we've decided to give you a rise."
Well, you asked me about a mother figure before -- she was the nearest to a mother figure for me.
I just adored her.
Once The Beatles were in London and criss-crossing the globe,
Freda became probably the link between the Beatles' families in Liverpool and each individual Beatle.
I was surprised when I met her, because I thought, to have taken on this mammoth, ridiculous job, she must have been some 50-year-old, settled-in-her-ways old secretary with bad feet and a large bosom, but she was anything but:
she was vivacious and fun and just a snip of a teenager, this young, thin girl.
I suppose you could say that The Beatles saw her as a sister, and the families saw her as a daughter.
NEMS used to close on a Wednesday afternoon, but I never told home that I was off on a Wednesday afternoon.
We used to go out with Paul's dad, we used to call him Uncle Jim, we used to go to a place called the Bassnett Bar.
He was trying to educate me on the cures and cheeses and coffee and things like that.
Well, I would stay there and get sozzled, you know, 'cos I'd be trying all these different things with them, and then they would just put me in a taxi and I'd go home and go straight to bed.
Now, John's family...
he only had Mimi.
Mimi was John's aunt.
She took John in when he was about five, when his parents split up.
Mimi didn't let anybody in that house;
very few people got in.
You had to go 'round the back, you know, like the tradesmen's entrance, but I actually went up and knocked on the front door, and I got in the front door.
It wasn't that you were frightened of Mimi, you just watched your Ps and Qs.
To me, Mimi was like my father, she was old-school.
Any time I saw her with John, which wasn't very often, she was quite stern but he did obey her.
I think the Harrisons enjoyed the fame more than any of the other parents.
Mr. and Mrs. Harrison loved it.
They took to it more.
She was excellent with the fans, would let them into her house, would give them a cup of tea, you know, every day, she just sat down and wrote letters to all these kids.
But they were very protective of George, maybe it was because he was the youngest Beatle.
Mr. Harrison -
- Harry Harrison -- was always saying to me,
"You should learn to dance properly,"
and I said "I don't wanna learn ballroom dancing, I don't really like it,"
and he said "No, I'm going to teach you."
He would get me up to dance and show me how to do the quick-step and the waltz and everything.
So we were like there-- I was really self-conscious about it,
I just did not want to learn to ballroom dance.
You know, all the families and all the boys believed in her.
She was 'good old Freda' to them, in other words.
?
[music]
Seeing them on a regular basis, coming in and out the office, going to their homes, it didn't hit me how big they were or worshipped they were until the civic reception, which was at the Town Hall in Liverpool.
The only people that were invited really were The Beatles themselves and The Beatles' families, and that was it, but Ritchie's family put me down as one of their family.
We were picked up in a car from the counsel, we must have come in the back way, and the lads were already here, and we had a meal, so we were all relaxed and everything,
and then next minute, they then had to go out onto the balcony and, just as they opened these doors, the noise hit us, with the shouts and the screaming, [crowd screaming] and then I came to behind the door here
and I just couldn't believe Castle Street.
?
[music] [crowd screaming]
It was just full of people;
as far as the eye could see was people, everywhere.
I mean, the noise was deafening, there was chaos in the street, girls were wriggling and pushing to get through the crowd, and they were fainting, and the ambulance men and police were just passing them over the crowds
to get them into the ambulance.
It was unbelievable.
[crowd screaming and chanting]
I think the penny actually dropped with me then, how big they were, 'cos it hadn't really hit home until I saw that amount of people, it was about 200,000 people -- I couldn't even visualize 200,000 people
until I saw it that day.
I think now, and I think the parents must have been so proud of 'em, that their sons were out on the balcony, and Liverpool was reacting to them.
I'm very proud that I worked for them.
[interviewer] So what was Beatlemania to you at the height of it, when it was its busiest, what, 1964, '65?
[Freda] No sleep with all the mail.
[interviewer] How many letters a week were you getting, roughly?
[Freda] Oh, God, thousands, two to three thousand a day.
Must have sat up 'til 4, 5 o'clock in the morning just answering -- I used to do all what we call detail letters --
I used to just bring all them home and then go back to work with me little parcel the next day.
I don't know how I lived.
?
[music]
In the wake of the outbreak of Beatlemania, there was a very very sudden increase in interest amongst fans, people writing in, asking for autographs, asking to join the Beatles fan club, etc.
Brian Epstein decided that we would have a stamp.
It looked like a proper signature.
And I remember, sometimes, I would roll it across the autograph book, and only half of it would turn out, or it would smudge.
I ruined so many kids' autograph books.
And of course, I'm a Beatle fan, so I'm thinking the way they're thinking, and I thought "I'd go mad if that was me."
I know I was against them and John Lennon was against them as well,
I think he thought because of the falseness.
I remember John coming in, and I asked him to sign something, and he said, "I did that,"
"You don't normally sign it that way,"
and he said "I've decided to sign that way from now on,"
and I said, "Is that because our stamps look like you wrote the signature?"
He went "Yeah."
In the end, I thought, "Oh, I'm dumping them."
I never told Eppy, I just thought, "Right,
I'll just keep all these autograph books and photographs in the cupboard, and when the lads come in, I'll still carry on."
I would know when they were staying at home in their own houses,
I would know in advance that, oh, George is coming home tonight, so I'll nab him, I'll go from the office straight to Mackets Lane, so I would go 'round and get them to sign stuff in their own house,
say, "Oh, while you're sitting there, watching the telly, do us a favor.
Can you just sign that bagful?"
So, if some of the fans, especially in the foreign countries, they didn't have the address of the fan club, so they just knew that they lived in England somewhere, so they would just put 'To Paul McCartney'
or 'To George Harrison, England,' but it would come through the system.
The post office, give them their due, were very good, they just knew where the fan club existed.
?
[music]
The type of questions kids would ask in the fan club letters was, you know,
'Can I have a piece of Paul's shirt?
' or 'If I send you a map, can you ask
Paul to come 'round at 6 o'clock?
Because I'm having a party and I'd like him to come.'
But then it got a bit out of hand, because then people wanted hair, and it was the same barber that cut their hair, it was always this one guy.
I mean, it was their hair, they'd probably do DNA on it now.
He would have a mat down on the floor or something, and cut their hair... 'cos he thought I was mental.
And he'd just say "There you go, do you want that bit?"
I'd go "Yeah, yeah, thanks."
Somebody sent a pillowcase in and said "Can you get Ritchie to sleep on this pillowcase and then send it back to me and get him to sign it?"
I must have known that he was going to be home for three days, so I just threw that in the bag and took it to his house and said, "Will you sleep on that tonight and sign it then?"
And I remember saying to Elsie -- that was his mum --
"Can you make sure he sleeps on it?"
Anyway, he brought it in, just said "Here,"
and then I just sent it out again-- whether she believed me or not that he'd slept on it, but he did, he put his head on that pillow.
Honestly, if I could do it, I would do it, 'cos I was one of them, I was a fan me self, so I knew where they were coming from.
There was one particular fan that stowed away on a ship from America to Liverpool docks, finished up on our doorstep.
Freda had many episodes like that to deal with, of fans that were just crazy.
?
[music]
They would just open the mail and flip through the mail, and go "Oh, this kid wants such and such,"
or "This girl wants a piece of my shirt,"
they'd just laugh, and I said, "Oh, just leave it there, 'cos I've got a bit of your shirt," and they'd go "Good."
When I typed the wages, the balance went in the bank Fordham, and they all got 50 pound in an envelope, cash, for them to play around with whatever way they wanted.
Now, I used to take that money sometimes:
if they didn't come in that week, Eppy'd just say to me,
"Now you go to one of the bookings."
I knew they were playing at The Empire and I was trying to get through the crowd, and in those days, policemen were always big, and this guy was a big guy and he was on a horse
and I was trying to wriggle through the crowd, and I just said to him, "I need to get into The Empire."
He just blanked me.
And I said "No, no, I work for them, honestly, I've got their wages,
I need to get into The Empire."
And he went, "You and thousands of others.
Hop it."
Which one is this?
Oh, it's a Beatle one.
My mum is the most private person I've ever met in my life.
She would never sit down and put dinner on the table and discuss just idle chitter-chatter about what's gone on with The Beatles in the past, or anything like that.
That's just not her nature.
You know, Freda, unless you knew her, you would never know what she's done, 'cos she never tells anybody at all.
We did a gig the other month in New Brighton and Freda was in the audience.
I saw her come in, and I was on the microphone,
I said "I'd like to welcome Freda Kelly, The Beatles' secretary,"
and she just turned around and walked straight out, so nobody knew who she was, they're all looking 'round but she wasn't there;
she'd walked out.
A lot of people in my mother's life don't even know her previous life, so to speak, i.e. her job, and she's always kept it like that.
It was a time of her life, and things changed, and then she became a mother so things moved on, so if they do happen to find out, they are rather surprised, to say the least.
You know, some things are very personal, and I do respect the word privacy.
I like my own privacy, and I think even The Beatles, they're entitled to part of their lives that really people shouldn't invade.
?
[acoustic guitar and birds chirping] ?
Ritchie started going out with a girl called Mo Cox who was from Liverpool, she was a hairdresser, and we just got on very well together, Mo and I.
I think it was because she was just an ordinary girl from Liverpool.
Mo and Ritchie got married in '65, and then she had Zak in the September, I think.
I happened to be in London the day he was born, and I was in the office, and Ritchie called into the office, and he said, "I'm going to see Mo now, and Zak.
Do you wanna come with me?"
and I went "Oh yeah, yeah,"
So I think I was the second person to see Zak, soon after he was born.
John's girlfriend -- well, she was his wife when I got to know Cynthia -- she was out of the picture, she was very low key.
We were told -- but that we weren't to say anything -- that John was married.
Brian Epstein was sitting on it for as long as he could.
I even had a friend that was going out with John, and she would go to bookings and he would take her home, but I couldn't tell her that, "Oh please, end this now.
It's not gonna go anywhere."
You really want to say something.
You're dying to say something, because it is your friend, but you work for a company that have asked you not to say things, so you have given your word.
Freda had this Liverpool trait of loyalty in her love life and other people's love lives.
Relationships were amongst the top priorities of being personal things that you did not publicize.
You certainly did not kiss and tell.
I was out with Paul, walking somewhere, maybe he gave me a lift home or he walked me to the bus stop, somebody saw us, and then it was, you know, I was marrying Paul,
and then they got a quote
"Well, Paul McCartney is not marrying Freda Kelly."
When it was released that Paul had got married, because people didn't know that he was getting married, phone call after phone call was all Paul fans, crying down the phone,
"Why didn't you tell us he was getting married?"
"We didn't know he was getting married!"
and, oh, some of them that wanted to kill themselves, and "Oh, I'll never be a Paul McCartney fan again!
He's gone and married somebody else!"
so you just had to calm them down and say, "Well, you know, he's still Paul McCartney, he'll still be making his records,"
and they'd be "No no no, but he's got married now and it's not the same."
I do remember the guy from one of the papers.
He lived near me, you know, he knew what my job was -- that I was working for The Beatles -- and I remember him saying to me, could I tell him anything?
"Freda, you just have to put an envelope through my door with things written on it, and then there will be an envelope through your door."
This was just before George got married, 'cos I thought "Well I ain't telling ya that George is going to get married,"
but I just looked at him, and then I just said, "Oh no, I wouldn't do that."
Everybody needs money, and we all like money, or we'd like to have more money than we have, but not to that extent.
I'm not prepared to sell me soul to the devil for a few pounds.
That's just me though, isn't it?
You know everybody doesn't think like me.
Maybe some people think I'm silly or stupid or...
She was a girl and then a woman with absolute integrity and faithfulness.
So many otherpeople have, over the years, told, I would say, dirt digging type stories, and Freda never did do that and never would.
In the beginning, you know, I was just a fan and everything like that, but once I started working for them, the loyalty set in.
It wasn't there from day one, 'cos I'm just a seventeen-year-old, but then, as I'm maturing with them, the loyalty is setting in, and you don't break loyalty.
I think if you're loyal to something, you should stay loyal.
If she had to be tough, she would certainly be tough;
if she had to be sweet, she was sweet anyway, and she was intent on getting the facts right all the time, and lo and behold, if you didn't get the facts right, you were in her bad books,
and I wouldn't like to be in Freda's bad books.
I think that Freda's motto in life was "I'll be nice to you, but don't cross me.
I'll not deal with you, in fact, if you're trying to tell lies about my boys."
?
[music]
I was quite nervous around Freda, 'cos to me she was like an idol.
I was about 14, there was three of us worked together, oh it was just absolutely an amazing thing to do at the time, you know, to think that one of The Beatles could possibly walk in,
it was just-- oh, I just can't explain it now.
It was amazing at the time.
[Freda] They would put photographs in envelopes and they would open certain letters, and then bring the letters in for me to answer, and I would really frank in the mail, and this particular day, one of the envelopes
that I put through the franking machine was a bit bulky, so I opened it, and when I opened it, there was hair fell out, and the girls were still in the office, and I just said, "What's going on here?"
She was absolutely livid.
I mean, being the innocent party,
I didn't know nothing about it, and then my friend Lorraine, she owned up and said it was her.
It materialized that she'd cut her sister's hair and put her sister's hair in the envelope and pretended it was going to be Paul's, and I just said, "Well, I just can't trust you after this."
I still remember thinking, "I've done nothing wrong, it wasn't my fault!"
I just done a clean sweep, didn't just sack the girl that done it,
I said, "That's it, sorry.
Can't trust you anymore."
That was the only time I've been sacked.
Wouldn't wanna live that day again, that's for sure.
It was horrible... awful day.
The thing about Freda is that if she found out that somebody was telling lies about somebody, it'd just be "Come here you," in front of everybody and she would castigate them right down the banks,
and so she's a bit judgmental, if you like, but so?
That's Freda.
The bottom line was, I had to run a tight ship --
I had to answer to Apple and to The Beatles, and if anything went wrong, it was my head that went on the chopping block, nobody else's.
?
[rock and roll]
It was August 1965, and The Beatles were playing on The Empire, and The Moody Blues were also on the bill, with them.
I had popped in to see the lads,
I just opened the door slightly and their band room was just full of relations, so I thought, "Oh, I'm never going to get in here,"
so, I was involved with one of The Moodys at the time, so I went into their dressing room, which was next door, that was just them and they had alcohol and drinks, so I decided to stay there for a drink,
but probably I stayed a bit longer than I shoulda done, and then I realized that I had to get autographs signed and photographs signed, so anyway,
I came back, knocked on the door, and I just walked in.
And as I walked in, John said to me, "Where have you been?"
And I said, "Oh, I've been next door,
I've been in the Moodys' dressing room,"
and he went, "Whose fan club secretary are you?"
and I went "What are you talking about?"
I said, "I'm your fan club secretary,"
and he went "Not anymore."
He said, "You might as well go back to The Moodys and be their fan club secretary,"
and I said "What are you talking about?" and he went "You're sacked."
And then I looked at the other three, so I said, "Are you sacking me as well?"
and they went, "No, we're not sacking you."
So I got on my high horse then, probably because of the drink, and I looked at him and I said,
"Well, I'll just work for the other three;
I won't do your mail anymore."
He said "Oh, I was only joking," I went, "No you weren't,"
and he went "Oh, I'm begging you, come back!"
and I said, "Well, I'll tell you what, get down on your two knees and beg me to come back, you dumped me."
He said, "If I get down on one knee?"
and I said, "Go on then, get down on one knee,"
and he did, and I said, "Oh, all right, I'll come back to you."
There has been quite a degree of loss in her lifetime which not many people have gone through, so, obviously, her mother dying when she was very young, my brother dying, then my mum and dad getting divorced...
A lot of people have gone under for less, and she hasn't.
She's a strong character, and she's come out fighting every time.
Over a period of time, people have said "Oh, why don't you do a book?"
or "You know, you should do a book,"
and my son did ask me -
- Timothy did ask me -- to do a few things, and I just-- it was because I never talked about The Beatles, or my past, and then something would come on the television and it would jog my memory, and I would say, "Oh, I went to that,"
or, "Oh, I remember the civic reception,"
or "I remember this," and Timothy used to say,
"But mum, you never talk about it,"
and I said, "Timothy, I haven't got time to talk about it.
I'm more interested in going to shops and thinking what to put on the table tonight for dinner, not to sit down and talk to you about The Beatles."
And he just shook it off, and then, when my grandson came along, I thought
"Well, I didn't do it for Timothy,"
and then Timothy passed away a few years ago, and then when Nial came along,
I thought, "Well, I'm definitely going to do it now."
Shh, I can hear the birdies singing, yeah, can you hear them singing?
You know, because one of these days, he might just look at me in the corner with the shawl and the grey hair and a cat sitting on me knee, and probably think, "Oh, you know,
she never done anything, or..."
I would like him to be proud of me and see how exciting my life was in the '60s, and the fun I had.
If I hadn't 'a done it now -- and this is the truth --
If I hadn't 'a done it now, I know I wouldn't ever have done it.
She could always say tomorrow, tomorrow, and she'll never sit down and sort it out.
When Nial was born, things definitely changed, and I think that when anybody has a child in that respect, it does open a lot of doors for people and changes their position in life in general, and you can suddenly reinvent yourself to a degree,
because Timothy isn't around now, and you don't know what tomorrow brings.
When they came back from America,
Brian Epstein decided then that we had to move to London, and you did, because in those days everything happened in London, wasn't happening up north.
We were planning on where we were going to live and what we were gonna do, and what clubs we would visit, and we were just -- all the excitement and the adrenaline was, ooh, we're going to the big city, the capital city.
So I went home and said, "Oh, well, I'm going to London, the fam's going to London, and I'm going to London with the fam and everything,"
and I'm all bubbly, and me father, he just sat in the chair and he was just listening, and he said, "London is a city of vice.
You're not going."
I knew I could go, you know, he couldn't stop me going, but when I started looking in me own mind, he wasn't very well at the time, so that's when I thought "No, I can't do this to me father.
A job's a job, even if it is The Beatles, a job's a job."
And that's why I handed in my notice.
He had a beautiful desk in the office, really big desk, he didn't even look up when I walked in,
I just stood in front of him, and I said, very quietly,
"I want to hand in my notice please."
He'd never heard that before, and he went,
"Don't you want to come to London?"
I said, "Oh, I desperately want to come to London,
I'd love to come to London,"
and I said, "But I can't come to London, 'cos me father won't allow me."
I know for a fact that Brian Epstein was seriously concerned, and I also know that the individual Beatles were most upset that she wasn't coming to London.
And then Eppy sent for me.
He said, "I've had a talk with the lads, and we don't want to you leave."
And I was just stunned.
He said, "I've had a word with your father, and you can come to London on a regular basis.
You stay up here."
And he said, "You can go back to NEMS, let me see it done, you can have my old offices in White Chapel."
?
[music]
And that was how I didn't leave.
[She's the girl the Beatles had to leave behind]
Before they moved to London, I wanted to get their autographs, so, George was in this day, and I had autograph book upon autograph book for him to sign, and I slipped mine in the middle.
So he's signing them, and I'm saying, you know, "That's to Rita, that's to Barbara, that's to Steve, and he gets to mine, and he said
"Who's this to?" and I said, "Well, just sign that,"
'cos I just wanted it out of the way, and he went, "Well, no, who's it to?"
and I think it was because I was going,
"Oh, it doesn't matter, just sign it,"
and I remember saying to him, "Oh, just sign the book, just sign the book,"
and he flicked it to the front, and he went, "Is this yours?"
and I went, "Yeah, I haven't got your autograph,
I just want your autograph before you go to London."
So he signed it, and he pocketed it, he took it, and I went, "What are you doing with me book?"
and he went, "I'll get the others for ya."
And then next time he came in, he just threw it on the table, he went, "There you go." And they'd all put little comments in it.
Oh, Beatles Monthly.
Before the days of the internet and
Twitter and Facebook and everything, the way we got news to the fans was through the Beatles Monthlys.
I would get information from their parents, little gossipy snippets, I would also ask them what was going on, and little bits of juicy information from them, and I would put it in my newsletter, that was, in The Beatles Monthly.
Dear Beatle People,
I'd really like to thank each and every one of you who have sent presents for John's birthday.
John was really pleased that so many of you remembered him.
During his 10-day trip to America,
Paul looked in on a Beach Boys recording session.
Tarrah for now, Freda Kelly.
?
[rock and roll]
Dear Beatle People, July 1964 will go down in Beatle history as a hard day's month.
At last the first feature film starring our fabulous foursome is ready for showing, and will be coming to your local cinema quite soon.
At the beginning of March, you will see, Beatles at Shea Stadium Show, filmed in New York last August, when the boys starred in the largest-ever concert of their career before 57,000 fans.
Thank goodness the rumors about Paul are over.
Paul is still with us, and is likely to be with us for a long time.
Congratulations to Ringo and Maureen, who are expecting their second baby shortly after Maureen's next birthday.
George has been to the dentist again.
Dear Beatle People, after nearly four months of solid session work, the new LP, called
Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, is ready.
Beatles are hoping to acquire their own private recording studios at a secret location in central London.
New Beatles recording every week.
In one short period of just over four months, The Beatles have released no less than sixteen new recordings.
John hated his passport photograph so much that he tore it up and had a new picture taken.
Dear Beatle People, quite a lot of letters sent in discussed John, Cynthia, and Yoko Ono.
At least as many members have written about Paul and Jane.
Everyone has dozens of questions to ask, and many of you have only been too ready to put forward your opinions.
Here at the fan club, we believe that The Beatles deserve their separate and individual private lives, which should remain their business, and no other people's.
I am sure both John and Paul will work out their problems in their own ways, and I think they should be allowed to do so without the help or hindrance from millions of Beatle People.
Tarrah for now, Freda Kelly.
[thump]

[acoustic guitar music]
Over the years, we could see the effect that his job was having on Eppy.
It was taking its toll.
The odd time that I went to London and saw him, he was just changing, you know, you could just see things weren't right.
He became obsessed with trying out, initially, experimenting with drugs, and then becoming very reliant upon them, and becoming more and more of a mess.
The 27th of August, 1967, I was at home.
There was something up with our phone, and I know I had to use a neighbor's phone, and the neighbor came over to me and said, "There's a call for you, there's a girl, Pat, wants to talk to you,"
and Pat said, "Oh, have you heard about
Brian, have you heard about Brian?
He's just been found dead."
The media were on this one that he committed suicide, and I just didn't believe that he committed suicide.
Somebody said that he choked on his vomit, and I tend to believe that tale.
The Beatles were actually in Wales, they'd gone there to see the Maharishi, and they were informed there, and I just remember John, out of all of them, he was the one that was sorta stunned.
Although I was still young me self, I could still visualize the devastation that it was going to cause.
He was the anchor for everything, and it was just...
where do we all go from here?
What happens now?
So Paul had this meeting set for September the 1st, within a couple of days of Brian Epstein's very tragic, premature death, and when I got there, nobody else had arrived yet, and he said, "Before the others get here, I just want to tell you,
I think that if The Beatles do not get together and work together very very quickly now, the group is going to disintegrate."
?
[music]
Magical Mystery tour, it wasn't the best-organized thing, well, it wasn't organized, because Paul had a rough idea, but just a very rough idea.
This coach rolled up, and there was all different types of people milling around, like a guy dressed up as a bit of a clown, and he had a spotty, funny-type suit, and I thought "What's going on?"
and then this man -
- I didn't know him, I found out his name then, it was called Ivor Cutler -- and he come over to me and he just said to me, "You've got a nice-shaped head."
We all eventually got on the bus, and I dived for the back,
I thought, "Well, I'll go on the back seat, and, you know, you're not really seen on the back seat,"
and then Paul eventually got on the bus, and he sat by the driver, and then he called my name, and he went, "Freda, where are you?"
and I went, "I'm here, I'm on the back,"
and he went, "Can you come up the front?"
and I went, "Do I have to?" and he went, "Come up the front."
I thought, "Well, he's getting severe here now, do as you're told."
You couldn't book the hotels in The Beatles' names because they wouldn't have you, so you always had to book them under false names, and Neil was doing some of the hotels, and I said to him, "Why don't you book it in the Women's Institute
or the Catholic Women's League or something like that?"
and he went, "Oh, that's a good idea,"
so I had to go up to the counter in the hotel and say, "Hello, you've got a reservation in the name of the Women's Institute,"
and then they went, "Oh fine," I said, "Well, we're just come in now."
The shock on people's faces when we all trooped in -- because it was The Beatles, it was people dressed weird -- it was a very mixed bunch, very odd bunch, and I was one of them.
But where, I think, Paul was decided to do it there and then was 'cos it was so quickly after Brian Epstein's death.
He thought it might hold us all together, or hold them all together, but I don't think it worked.
That's just my opinion.
You know, you don't wanna think about that, you can be big-headed, and say,
"Yeah, we're gonna last ten years,"
but as soon as you've said that, you think
"We're lucky if we last three months."
Well obviously, we can't keep playing the same sort of music until we're about 40.
When I as at 40, we may not know how to write songs anymore.
I hope to have enough money to go into a business of my own by the time we do flop.
I've always fancied having a ladies' hairdresser.
I string them, in fact, and strut 'round in me stripes and me tails, you know, "Like a cup of tea, madam?"
The Beatles stopped touring in roughly 1966, I think, then Brian Epstein died in '67, and
Magical Mystery Tour was in '67, and Apple had started by then.
In the beginning, when Apple first opened, it was great:
the fun and the madness and all different nationalities in the press office.
People didn't act as if they were working in an office or a business, and then it became more settled down, more normal, and there wasn't as much fun.
I loved the beginning part of it, 'cos it was fun in the beginning, and it was fun for them, they enjoyed it so much.
Every group wants to be in the charts, or wants a hit record, or...
Everything was exciting in the beginning:
they got a number one, and then they were asked to appear on the Royal Command Performance, and they saw the queen, and they were a hit in America, and the civic reception, and it was all these landmarks,
and... where does it stop?
You can't keep carrying on like that, can you?
Towards the end of the '60s, it wasn't what The Beatles were doing as a group anymore, it was what they were doing individually.
I know Paul's was-- he was bringing out his own LP,
John and Yoko were doing the peace movement, and George was doing things, I think with Clapton, I can't remember,
Ritchie had two sons by then, and he was more interested in, sort of, a family life.
And then the penny was dropping with me, that we aren't gonna be Beatles as a group anymore.
Are you still the Beatles' fan club secretary?
How's business?
Fine, except for the post day.
They don't have a group anymore.
Well they've still got four members, haven't they?
I don't like to lie, but it was trying to bend the truth, when people were asking you questions about what was going on, you had to more or less say, "Well yes,
The Beatles are still together, and everything's great," but it wasn't great.
And now, what's the arrangement today?
Well last August, Paul rang me up and said he didn't want people to be writing about him as a Beatle, which I was doing, and he wanted to split this word, Beatles, up.
They are four individual people now, recording and everything, and we'll write all about Apple artists, so we're still writing about the four Beatles 'cos Paul is still an Apple artist.
Is the atmosphere today anything like it was ten years ago?
No, no.
What's missing?
The closeness.
It was all fun when we were teenagers, but your life changes, and my life had changed, I was then 27, I mean,
I was married now, had a baby son, and I wanted more children, and I was, we'll say, concentrating on that.
I then found out I was pregnant.
I'd been trying to get pregnant for a while;
I desperately wanted this baby, and I just wanted to make sure that everything was gonna be all right, so that was more important to me than my job, was my married life, my son, and the baby on the way,
and then that's when I thought, "Well, I'm out here."
?
[music]
I went to London, had a discussion with Neil Aspinall, the head of Apple, who was their road manager in the beginning, and George and Ritchie were there;
it was just-- that was all, I remember we were 'round a table.
I told them that I was pregnant, and they said,
"Well, do you think you would be going back to work?"
and I said, "I won't be going back to work, you know, I'll have two children then."
And then George finally spoke up and said, "Freda, you were there in the beginning, you're there at the end, let's call it a day.
Let's end the fan club."
You're still involved in the fan club?
Well, I'm sorta trying to wind it up.
This is what I wrote:
"Well, this is it.
John, Paul, George, and Ringo have each gone their separate ways, and they are no longer collectively an item.
There it is.
Eleven years.
Eleven years in which we have become a very strong, happy, and close circle of friends.
There will not be another official fan club for The Beatles as individual artists.
Please do not write again.
Yours faithfully, Freda Kelly."
I haven't read that since it went out.
I actually felt quite sad, reading it.
With me being a Beatle fan myself,
I just knew that this is going to break a lot of girls' hearts, so I musta put a lot of lights out for people.
Well, the lights went out, didn't they?
At the back of all this, I am still
-- or was -- am still a Beatle fan, so I do think the way they think.
We were still getting a lot of letters every day.
I took them all home with me, 'cos I couldn't leave them in the office, and although I said I wouldn't write again and I wouldn't answer any letters, between running my home and doing
the normal things a mother does,
I did answer the letters.
Slowly.
You know, I'd maybe do three one night,
I might do none the next night,
I might do five on the Saturday.
But it took me, on average, about three years to answer all those letters.
?
[acoustic guitar solo]
Once I ended the fan club, that was it.
I was then not Freda Kelly anymore, and I just lived a normal life like everybody else, nothing to do with The Beatles anymore.
When I look back, it is shocking how many people that have gone that I knew from those days.
Well, we lost Eppy first of all.
You've got the main two-- you've got John and George, you've got two wives-- Mo Cox, Linda McCartney, you've got all the parents, you've got Neil Aspinall,
Derek Taylor, my friend Laurie McCaffrey... it brings it home to me.
I think fame and money doesn't mean anything.
All the wealth doesn't cure cancer, does it?
I worked with a lot of good people, I did, I loved them.
?
[music and singing]
Giving a job like that, to what became the biggest band in the world, to a girl of 17, that was an unbelievable thing to do, and she never let 'em down.
The tide washes the sea in every day.
Freda was the tide -- you saw the effects of the tide like you see the effects of Freda -- but you never actually see a tide as such, it just happens to be there, and Freda was, so tell the story.
I don't know why Eppy picked me.
Maybe it was just fate.
And I was taken along for this ten-year, exciting ride, and then dropped off on the corner where I started it.
You know, I'm not famous, I'm not wealthy,
I'm still working for a living, I'm still a Beatle fan, so although there's a 50-year gap since I started it,
I still like to think that I'm back where I was in the beginning.
I don't ever have to tell this tale again.
It's down now, on record, isn't it?
End of.
Peace and love.
My name is Ringo, and this is a message to all of Freda Kelly's grandchildren.
Freda was a great friend to The Beatles, she was the fan club leader, and we've known her for a long time.
Anyway, we all loved Freda.
She was great, and Freda was like part of the family, and she knew all our families, she was just one of the best.
Peace and love.
Peace and love.

[Beatles Christmas recording, 1963]
?
[Christmas song]
Hello, this is John speaking with his voice.
We're all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic.
This record reaches you at the end of a really dear year for us, and it's all due to you.
I'd like to say thank you to all of the Beatle people who have written to me during the year.
I'd love to reply personally to everyone, but I just haven't enough pens.
This is Paul here.
We're all dead pleased by the way you've treated us in 1963, and we're trying to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we write and record next year.
Well, I'm running out of my time and people are telling me to stop-- [all] Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop shouting those animals!
So I'll finish now with wishing everyone
Happy Crimble, and a merry new year.
Ya Ringo!
Hello, Ringo here.
As you know,
I was the last member to join The Beatles.
I started to play gongs in the group 1962.
?
[singing]
Thank you Ringo, thank you Ringo.
We'll phone you.
?
[George Harrison singing] [laughter] I'm George Harrison!
Nobody else has said anything yet about our secretary, Freda Kelly in Liverpool.
Good old Freda!
So on behalf of us all, I'd just like to say a great big "thank you"--
?
[singing together]
[Freda] I was just a secretary then, and, funny enough, I'm still a secretary now, and who would want to hear the secretary's story?
?
[music]
[Freda] Millions of girls around the world wanted this dream job:
they wanted to be the secretary.
She epitomized all their dreams and all their hopes, and all these girls wanted to be Freda Kelly and to be that close to The Beatles.
Well, I didn't expect to talk, maybe grab one of them, but I wouldn't hurt 'em, I wouldn't hurt 'em,
I'd just talk to them maybe, but I wouldn't, you know, grab-- like, everybody says they're gonna cut their hair and everything-- we wouldn't do that.
[Bill Kinsley] If you look at what is history now,
The Beatles were together ten years.
Freda worked for The Beatles for eleven.
She was there right before they made it, and right after they finished, so that says it all, basically.
Tell me, when you hear a Beatles record, what thoughts run through your mind?
Beauty, sheer beauty.
The Beatles bring joy into the world:
they're happiness;
we forget our cares when we hear Beatle records.
[old man] Freda was far more than a secretary to the Beatles;
she was a family member.
She's never had the same recognition that a number of people within the inner circle have had, simply because she never pushed herself, she never wrote a book, she never agreed to do interviews, she's always kept a very very confidential existence.
[fan girl] We came here at 6 o'clock in the morning, 5:30, to see them, and all they do is push you farther and farther away and then they don't even let you see them!
A lot of people didn't take these girls seriously, but I did, because, you know,
I was one of them -- I was a fan me self.
So I knew where they were coming from.
We grew up with them.
You know, they started when they were younger and we were younger.
And all through these years, we've just developed with them and grown up with them, and they belong to us, you know?
But there could never be another Beatles.
Never.
[old woman] She's one of the last survivors of the whole Beatles era, and you know, this story of Freda Kelly's will be, surely, one of the last true stories of the Beatles
that you'll ever really hear.
[Freda] I've been a secretary for half a century, fifty years, and that's quite frightening.
This job is interesting, but it's not as exciting as my last job.
I don't get the phone calls that I did in the 60's, like, you know, an invite to a premiere, you know, "Roy Orbison's having a party and we've managed to get a few tickets,
do you want to come to that Fre?"
And I'm like "Yeah, okay, I'm on the next train!"
[Good Ol' Freda]
?
[xylophone music]
I left school when I was sixteen, and my first job was at a firm called Prince's.
I was in the middle of a typing pool, which is rows of secretaries just typing away.
The lads from different levels of law would come down and give me work to do, but most of my day was just spent typing contracts, typing letters -- it wasn't the most glamorous of jobs,
but I was a working woman now.
?
[indie rock music]
[Freda] One day, two guys from upstairs came down and came over to my desk and just said "Come on Freda, we're going to take you out for lunch."
I didn't know where I was going, and I ended up in The Cavern.
Now, I'd never been to The Cavern before,
I didn't even know what I was going into, because it was a cellar.
It had a unique smell:
there was no ventilation, and sometimes the toilets overflowed, and it was opposite a fruit market, so it was probably a mixture of disinfectant, rotten fruit, and sweat all rolled into one.
There was three archways, and in the middle archway was wooden seats, all different types of wooden seats, they weren't all in rows and all the same.
There was a little wooden stage at the back, and The Beatles were playing on the stage when I first walked in.
And I'd never experienced anything like that -- it was everything about them, it was just the way they dressed, with all this leather gear, they were larking about, and dancing on stage, and mucking about with the audience,
and on top of everything else, there was the music.
It was just unlike anything I'd ever heard.
I was hooked.
I just was amazed by everything I saw, and I thought "That's it, I'm going to go tomorrow."
Well I think it's put down that they played something silly like 294 times.
Out of that, I would say, I probably saw them about 190 times.
?
[rock music]
[Bill Kinsley] Freda was definitely a staple of The Cavern, she was always there, and she always sat in the same seat.
[Freda] I used to like the second arch on the left hand side, because it was just that handy.
You could pop in and out the band room all the time.
There was about two rows in the front, they would leave their rollers in until before the lads would come onstage, and then they'd take their rollers out and doll theirselves up and everything.
It was conversation all the time with the audience.
Somebody came in, a different hairstyle, they'd pick on them.
They'd go "Have you been the hairdresser's?"
or "Who got you up this morning?" [laughter]
But he answered them back.
They liked the razzmatazz between you and them.
People used to write down a number, give it to them, and ask them would they right play that number.
Now, if you gave it to John, Paul always went over to John and leaned over his shoulder and read the request out.
I thought "Can John read, or--?"
He looked pretty arrogant, to be honest-- he'd look at the crowd like that as if he was going to kill everyone in the crowd.
And then I mentioned it to somebody and they said "Oh, no, no, John's as blind as a bat.
He wears glasses and he never wears his glasses, so he can't see further than his nose."
I liked George singing Three Cool Cats, I loved that one.
Or The Sheik of Araby, because he used to do a little dance and I liked him doing the little dance.
He used to sort of kick his feet along the stage.
[laughter]
A few times I rang Paul up, because one of my friends fancied him and I wanted him to sing for her.
We used to just dial Garston and then the number 6922.
He'd say "Hello," and you'd go, "Oh hi Paul, it's Freda.
It's Linda Shepherd's birthday on such-and-such a day, can you play Love of the Loved for her?"
"Yeah, okay."
I got to know them personally through just talking to them, going in the band room, because when they came off-stage, they used to either sit in the band room, talking to different people who ever came in,
and then you would just sit by them, and you would just ask them where they were playing, or how come you weren't here yesterday.
Paul was always nice and always friendly, and any time you'd ask Paul to sing something, he would do it.
John... a man of many moods.
It depended on what side of the bed he got out in in the morning.
He could be really grumpy, but he was always himself, he never put an act on.
People say George was the quiet Beatle, and I suppose he was in one way, but he was never quiet with me.
He was more quietly-spoken, I think, than the others.
He was very thoughtful.
Ringo hadn't joined the group yet;
Pete Bass was on the drums.
Pete was very shy, and he was also very handsome, so he had a big following around town, from the girls.
They loved Pete.
They all lived my way home, on the south side of Liverpool, and Paul and George had cars, and then they'd say "Do you want a lift home?"
My father wasn't keen on them, he saw them and what he saw he didn't like.
If they'd had suits on, or somebody had a suit with a collar and tie, he probably would've approved of them, but he didn't approve of The Beatles.
?
[worn vinyl sensual music]
But I was always late back from work,
I was always pushing and puffing and panting and sitting down and starting to type.
I couldn't say I was somewhere else or I got held up in a restaurant or trying to get some food because I had the Cavern smell on me, so they knew exactly where I'd been.
The girls in the typing pool had photographs up on the wall of Pat Boone and Elvis and Tommy Steele and Cliff Richard, and I didn't like any of them, so I found a little picture of The Beatles,
but it was only dead small, and I remember putting it up on the wall, and the personnel manager caught me when I was putting it up on the wall, Mr. Mold, and he said,
"Oh, what are you doing, who are they?"
and I said "Oh, they're The Beatles,"
and he went "Who's The Beatles?"
and I said "They're a Liverpool group,"
and he went "Never heard of them,"
and I said "Oh, you will one day."
Bobbie Brown was the girl who went to The Cavern and started a fan club for The Beatles.
Now, I couldn't understand why The Beatles had a fan club, because they were just a local group, but I eventually ended up helping Bobbie, and then Bobbie got a boyfriend and lost interest in running the Beatles fan club,
so I took over from there.
I was buying stamps and salve in the beginning, and I remember being in the band room one day lunch time and saying to Paul, "You owe me seven six for stamps,"
and he went "I haven't any money."
And then Bob Waller paid them, and I sat in the band room until Bob Waller paid them, and I said "You've now got money."
So he give him his due and paid me.
I just had this faith -- and there wasn't just me -- you just knew they were going to be famous one day, but I couldn't visualize the fame that they got.
To me, being famous was playing on The Empire, having a record in the charts.
Cliff Richard was big in those days, and being as big as Cliff Richard, that was as far as my vision went.
[Billy] Everything was new, nobody knew what was going to happen.
People who ever say to you, "We knew they were going to be a success,"
they're lying through their teeth.
Nobody knew it was going to be the world phenomenon that it became.
?
[music]
I got to know Brian Epstein through The Beatles.
I was going to see The Beatles all the time, and then Brian Epstein started to come to see them and that's how we became friendly.
Everybody in Liverpool knew who he was, because he was manager of NEMS Ltd., the biggest record shop in the north of England.
I do remember it was by St. Barnabas's Hall in Penny Lane, it was a Saturday night, I walked in,
I just know Eppy coming up to me, and he then told me that he was signing The Beatles and he was starting his own firm and he needed a secretary.
Then he said, did I want to come and work for them, and I said "Oh, go on then." I just remember saying, "Oh go on then."
And I was so excited because I was starting my dream job, working for The Beatles.
[Tony Barrow] I think what Brian Epstein saw was somebody who was a fan without being an over-the-top fanatic.
I would call her more of an admirer;
she appreciated The Beatles, and that fitted perfectly, I mean,
Freda was there on the scene and ready to take over.
We had a lot of respect for Brian, obviously, we thought he was really posh, you know, we were all Liverpool screw-offs really, but Brian was very posh, and for him to choose Freda to be the secretary,
we thought "Hey, wow, she must have something,"
you know, he could have picked anybody.
That's when I had to tell home, 'cos I didn't want to tell home, 'cos I just knew the reaction.
My mother died when I was eighteen months, and she died of cancer.
I had a good relationship with my father, but also he was very protective towards me because I was his only child.
I was 17, so I managed to pluck up the courage this particular night at tea time, and I just said casually "I'm starting a new job on Monday."
And I do remember him saying "Has it got anything to do with The Beatles?"
and I just blanked it, I must have turned it back 'cos I know I didn't lie, but I didn't answer the question, and all I remember was the teapot going down with a big slam.
[Freda] We used to call him Daddy Eppy;
he was Brian Epstein's father, and it was his business.
We were on the top floor of his shop.
The first floor was what we used to call the "white goods":
it was televisions and washing machines and things like that, and then on the second floor, that was Brian Epstein's office, and then there was a store room behind his office, so I worked in the store room.
They changed that into an office for me.
In the beginning, the lads were in the office nearly every single day, you know, they just popped in and out.
They would sit by my desk for a chat or while they were waiting to go into Eppy's office, so I got to know them more.
I was 17, so naturally I did have crushes on them.
The way I describe it, and this is the truth, if Paul looked nice or sang a song for me or something,
I was in love with Paul that day, I fancied him that day, but then the following day, if Ritchie asked me how me dogs were
(because he knew I had Yorkshire Terriers, he'd say "Oh, how are the dogs?")
I'd think "Oh, yeah, I fancy Ritchie,"
and then I think, if George offered me a lift home from work,
I'd be in love with George that day, and I'd think "Yeah, yeah, I definitely fancy George."
But then if John came in and started talking about various things,
I'd think "I like his nose, I like the Roman nose,"
but it would only be for a day or two.
Did you go out with any of them?
No.
Pass.
No stories there?
Oh, there is stories, but I don't want anybody's hair falling out or turning curly.
That's personal.
It was the end of a working day, and Eppy just came in and said,
"Come on Freda, put your coat on,
I'm going to take you somewhere."
I had no idea where.
And next minute we were at The Empire, and then next minute we were in the box,
I'd never been in the box of The Empire.
It was this one on the left.
He'd managed to get The Beatles a spot on the Little Richard show, and I think somebody was sick or something and he'd managed to get them on.
And I remember sitting in the box, it was just Eppy and I, and I was to the left, and then I looked down on the stage and the whole theatre and the stage were in darkness,
except for this light shining on Paul's face, and he was singing A Taste of Honey.
I don't cry, but my eyes sort of filled up and I just couldn't believe that The Beatles were on The Empire, the biggest theatre in Liverpool, and I thought "This is it.
They've made it.
They're going to be famous one day."
?
[harmonica music]
The Beatles' first hit, as far as I'm concerned, was Love Me Do, I mean,
I was one of the ones that bought it, and I didn't have a record player, and there was loads of girls like me that didn't have record players, but we bought it just to boost the sales.
You didn't have pop stations then, but we had one station called Radio Luxembourg, and they used to do the charts, and I remember staying up late, sitting by the radio, holding the knob,
trying to keep it on the same wavelength, and waiting to hear The Beatles' record.
And when it got to 17, that was amazing.
I know it only stayed the week, I think, but it didn't matter.
They were in the charts.
I was working for Brian Epstein, doing a normal day-job, but I also had to do the fan club overnight.
Silly me, I gave out my home address as the fan club address.
The postman knocked on the door and he said to me, "Who gave this address out?
You've got 200 letters here."
And I said, "Sorry, won't do it again time."
Little did he know, within the next few months The Beatles became more famous, and instead of just 200 letters, they were coming in bundles, and those bundles came in sacks, so the van rolled up.
My father wasn't keen on The Beatles anyway, and his own personal mail, you know, your telephone bill, electricity bill, your gas bill, all in the fan mail.
So he just looked at me and said,
"You've got to put a stop to this.
What possessed you to give our home address out?"
I didn't think at the time.
My mother has never played the fame game.
If she had, things would be completely different now, and she might not be working six days a week
9 'til 5 o'clock at night, very stressed, when other people have retired, and she hasn't got that joy.
These are all Christmas decorations.
Oh, success.
I kept a couple of scrapbooks with theatre tickets in, and newspaper cuttings in.
A few fan club letters.
Yeah, they're old.
I think it's records, and, oh, me scrapbook.
Yeah.
Cuttings book.
I mean I have a lot of these.
I don't know.
Forty years since Rachel was born.
I could have been a very very wealthy woman, could be a millionairess if I'd have kept everything.
I had loads of autographs, photographs, all the fan club stuff, Apple stuff, fan club records, but over a period of time, I gave it all away.
But I don't regret that, because I know when I gave the majority of the stuff away,
I gave it in 1974, and I actually handed the stuff to Beatle fans myself, so I knew the Beatle fans got all the fan club stuff that was left.
I've got these four boxes anyway.
I didn't even think I had four boxes.
As I'm flicking through, there are so many memories coming back to me.
I'll just pick something up, and I'll remember that day.
Oh, this is George Harrison's real hair.
?
[rock and roll music]
A few months after Love Me Do, the lads had their first number one hit, which was Please Please Me.
We were gradually getting letters, from 50 a day, 200 a day, to my home, and then it worked up to about 800 a day, and then eventually we didn't even count them, we just threw the mail in the corner.
I would put loads of photographs in front of them, and they would go in to Eppy, and they would take the photographs in with them, and while they were talking to Eppy, they were all signing.
But they never complained about signing things, never ever.
I think it was because it was early days and they were all excited by it all, so nothing was a problem.
Out of all The Beatles, I'd say George was the best one for signing things.
He would come in and he'd go,
"Do you want me to sign anything?
What have you got in your cupboard?"
The Beatles called him Eppy, we all did, but to his face, he asked us to call him Mr. Brian in the office.
He was the boss so it was Mister.
He had an aura about him.
I know he was probably only 27 then, but he was old.
Ten years was a big difference in those days, where I'm 17, he's 27.
He came from a well-off family and he had nice clothes and spoke with a posh accent, so you had respect for him.
He threw a few tantrums in the office, and you just kept out of his way.
Well, I did.
Probably that's why I lasted ten years.
Some people didn't, or retaliated, and they were sacked on the spot.
He was the boss, and he was the boss.
Brian Epstein was notorious for his dreadful tantrums.
He would hire and re-fire his top executives at the drop of a hat.
Freda was sort of immune, if you like, to the temper tantrums.
She was never hurt by them.
?
[music]
We had a new dictaphone, and he gave me this tape to do while he was out, and I'd done about two letters and the tape got stuck.
So Neil Aspinall came in and I said,
"Oh God, I've got this tape and I've got it stuck, and there's a load of work on it."
We pressed two things, and we erased all the work.
He came in the office, and I just saw John at the back of him, and he went to hang up the coat, and he said, "Have you finished the tape?"
and I just said "No.
I'm sorry, no.
I've wiped it by mistake."
He just looked at me, and then shouted "You stupid girl!"
and John Lennon saved the day, because he was behind me, and he must have seen how shaken I was, and Eppy about to erupt.
He started laughing, and going "Oh, what have you done, Kelly?"
and when a Beatle laughed, Eppy laughed.
But it wasn't a proper laugh.
He wasn't amused at all.
And I just remember looking at him and saying "I'll stay late to do it."
and he said, "I know you will, you'll definitely stay late, until all this work is done."
I was very naive for my age;
I just came into the music business when I was 17, up until I was 16, I'm camping with the Guides and things like that.
Once I joined the Beatles organization,
I grew up overnight in more ways than one, and I remember saying to John,
"You know what?
I don't know what it is about him--"
I said "I can't put me finger on it,"
and I know I was rabbiting on for England, and John started laughing, and then he went "Have you no idea?"
and I said, "No idea about what?"
He put it to me very innocently, and I always respect him for that, he said, "Well let's say this, Fre, if you're on a desert island with him, you'd be safe."
And the penny dropped.
Where nowadays it's legal, and quite rightly so, but in those days they had a lot to put up with.
Probably that had a lot to do with his mood-swings as well, and trying to keep it from his parents and other people.
The music industry was a man's industry in the '60s.
In The Beatles' circle, there wasn't any high-ranking women.
Women, or girls, worked on the admin side, but the highest you can go in admin is just be secretary to the main guy.
I was secretary to Brian Epstein, but there wasn't a hard road to climb, you just had to stay there.
There was a lot to get done, so anybody that came into the office,
I would put them to work.
I would get them slicing' the envelopes, tearin' the foreign stamps off, stickin' photographs in envelopes, and groups around town
-- because they never had any money, musicians around town -- they used to come into my office for a free cup of tea, or if it was raining, or to hear the records, so while they were sitting there,
nobody sat there doing nothing.
They all used to help out.
I bumped into the lead singer of
The Cryin' Shames, Ritchie Routledge, and he had a big post bag on his back, and I said "Where are you going?"
he said, "I'm going to the post office,"
I said "What for?", he said, "I've got all The Beatles' vinyl stuff in the bag, Freda told me -- not asked me, told me -- to go and post it."
She just had this way about her, a bit like a schoolteacher really.
You know, you had to do what the schoolteacher said, and you had to do what Freda said, really.
Well, you didn't have to do it, you wanted to do it for her, 'cause she'd just give you a little smile, and you did it.
When Ringo first joined the band
-
- I think he was only in the band about two weeks or something --
I came into the office, he said
"I'm getting letters to my house, and if I bring them in, will you do them?"
And I went "No, I won't," I said, "I've got too much to do."
I said "Get your mother to do it, you know all the other parents do,"
and he went "Oh, me mum doesn't know what to do."
He put the sad eyes on, and just like
"Oh, go on, please?
You know, I don't get many."
To shut him up I went "Oh go on then, bring them in."
He brought about nine letters in this little poly bag, and he actually put the answers to the questions that they'd asked in the letters on the top of the letter to help me, 'cos he said to me, "If you don't know the answers
I've put the answers down for you and everything."
He must have thought I was terrible, 'cos I looked at him and I said to him "Is this all you get?"
I couldn't believe-- he must have wanted to shoot me, and I went, "You've only got nine letters."
He said, "Will you help me?
Will you come and show me mum what to do?"
I ended up going 'round, knocking on 10 Admiral Grove, and Elsie opened the door, and I said, "I'm Freda from the office,"
and she went, "Oh, thank God for that, come in, love, come in."
And I said, "Well, I've just brought stuff for you, to show you what to do."
She said, "Have you had any tea?"
And I said "No," and she went, "Would you like egg and chips?"
and I said, "Oh, I'd love egg and chips, yeah."
And then we started talking, and we got on like a house on fire.
Every week, for years, I went to that house.
Will the neighbors not become envious of all the wealth that's been accumulated by the Beatles?
No, not the neighbors 'round here, they're all very good and all quite proud.
Comin' back now, just everything is flashing in me head about just how much joy and happiness and laughter went on in this house.
I had a great time here.
I loved it,
I loved coming here every week.
It's probably...
I haven't been in this house for about 46 years.
I spent a lot of my life here.
I used to stay 'til about 1 or 2 in the morning, going through the mail, and talking, and laughing, things about my life as well, and who I was going out with at the time.
And it's not one of The Beatles, before you start.
Elsie'd give me advice, motherly advice.
She was very jolly, very outgoing, and a really strong laugh.
I told her all my secrets when I was a teenager.
Maybe she looked on the daughter that she didn't have, maybe she looked on me as that.
She decided I wasn't getting enough money, wages, and she was at a party, and Eppy was there, and then she, few drinks down, and then she starts in on him and said "You don't know what you've got there,
you've got a good worker there."
And she was going on and on, and I was going "Well, shut up."
And she was going, "You should pay her some more money, you know.
You don't pay her enough money.
You should give her a rise."
I really got a rise, two weeks later.
His words were, "We've reviewed your wages, Freda, and we've decided to give you a rise."
Well, you asked me about a mother figure before -- she was the nearest to a mother figure for me.
I just adored her.
Once The Beatles were in London and criss-crossing the globe,
Freda became probably the link between the Beatles' families in Liverpool and each individual Beatle.
I was surprised when I met her, because I thought, to have taken on this mammoth, ridiculous job, she must have been some 50-year-old, settled-in-her-ways old secretary with bad feet and a large bosom, but she was anything but:
she was vivacious and fun and just a snip of a teenager, this young, thin girl.
I suppose you could say that The Beatles saw her as a sister, and the families saw her as a daughter.
NEMS used to close on a Wednesday afternoon, but I never told home that I was off on a Wednesday afternoon.
We used to go out with Paul's dad, we used to call him Uncle Jim, we used to go to a place called the Bassnett Bar.
He was trying to educate me on the cures and cheeses and coffee and things like that.
Well, I would stay there and get sozzled, you know, 'cos I'd be trying all these different things with them, and then they would just put me in a taxi and I'd go home and go straight to bed.
Now, John's family...
he only had Mimi.
Mimi was John's aunt.
She took John in when he was about five, when his parents split up.
Mimi didn't let anybody in that house;
very few people got in.
You had to go 'round the back, you know, like the tradesmen's entrance, but I actually went up and knocked on the front door, and I got in the front door.
It wasn't that you were frightened of Mimi, you just watched your Ps and Qs.
To me, Mimi was like my father, she was old-school.
Any time I saw her with John, which wasn't very often, she was quite stern but he did obey her.
I think the Harrisons enjoyed the fame more than any of the other parents.
Mr. and Mrs. Harrison loved it.
They took to it more.
She was excellent with the fans, would let them into her house, would give them a cup of tea, you know, every day, she just sat down and wrote letters to all these kids.
But they were very protective of George, maybe it was because he was the youngest Beatle.
Mr. Harrison -
- Harry Harrison -- was always saying to me,
"You should learn to dance properly,"
and I said "I don't wanna learn ballroom dancing, I don't really like it,"
and he said "No, I'm going to teach you."
He would get me up to dance and show me how to do the quick-step and the waltz and everything.
So we were like there-
- I was really self-conscious about it,
I just did not want to learn to ballroom dance.
You know, all the families and all the boys believed in her.
She was 'good old Freda' to them, in other words.
?
[music]
Seeing them on a regular basis, coming in and out the office, going to their homes, it didn't hit me how big they were or worshipped they were until the civic reception, which was at the Town Hall in Liverpool.
The only people that were invited really were The Beatles themselves and The Beatles' families, and that was it, but Ritchie's family put me down as one of their family.
We were picked up in a car from the counsel, we must have come in the back way, and the lads were already here, and we had a meal, so we were all relaxed and everything,
and then next minute, they then had to go out onto the balcony and, just as they opened these doors, the noise hit us, with the shouts and the screaming, [crowd screaming] and then I came to behind the door here
and I just couldn't believe Castle Street.
?
[music] [crowd screaming]
It was just full of people;
as far as the eye could see was people, everywhere.
I mean, the noise was deafening, there was chaos in the street, girls were wriggling and pushing to get through the crowd, and they were fainting, and the ambulance men and police were just passing them over the crowds
to get them into the ambulance.
It was unbelievable.
[crowd screaming and chanting]
I think the penny actually dropped with me then, how big they were, 'cos it hadn't really hit home until I saw that amount of people, it was about 200,000 people -- I couldn't even visualize 200,000 people
until I saw it that day.
I think now, and I think the parents must have been so proud of 'em, that their sons were out on the balcony, and Liverpool was reacting to them.
I'm very proud that I worked for them.
[interviewer] So what was Beatlemania to you at the height of it, when it was its busiest, what, 1964, '65?
[Freda] No sleep with all the mail.
[interviewer] How many letters a week were you getting, roughly?
[Freda] Oh, God, thousands, two to three thousand a day.
Must have sat up 'til 4, 5 o'clock in the morning just answering -- I used to do all what we call detail letters --
I used to just bring all them home and then go back to work with me little parcel the next day.
I don't know how I lived.
?
[music]
In the wake of the outbreak of Beatlemania, there was a very very sudden increase in interest amongst fans, people writing in, asking for autographs, asking to join the Beatles fan club, etc.
Brian Epstein decided that we would have a stamp.
It looked like a proper signature.
And I remember, sometimes, I would roll it across the autograph book, and only half of it would turn out, or it would smudge.
I ruined so many kids' autograph books.
And of course, I'm a Beatle fan, so I'm thinking the way they're thinking, and I thought "I'd go mad if that was me."
I know I was against them and John Lennon was against them as well,
I think he thought because of the falseness.
I remember John coming in, and I asked him to sign something, and he said, "I did that,"
"You don't normally sign it that way,"
and he said "I've decided to sign that way from now on,"
and I said, "Is that because our stamps look like you wrote the signature?"
He went "Yeah."
In the end, I thought, "Oh, I'm dumping them."
I never told Eppy, I just thought, "Right,
I'll just keep all these autograph books and photographs in the cupboard, and when the lads come in, I'll still carry on."
I would know when they were staying at home in their own houses,
I would know in advance that, oh, George is coming home tonight, so I'll nab him, I'll go from the office straight to Mackets Lane, so I would go 'round and get them to sign stuff in their own house,
say, "Oh, while you're sitting there, watching the telly, do us a favor.
Can you just sign that bagful?"
So, if some of the fans, especially in the foreign countries, they didn't have the address of the fan club, so they just knew that they lived in England somewhere, so they would just put 'To Paul McCartney'
or 'To George Harrison, England,' but it would come through the system.
The post office, give them their due, were very good, they just knew where the fan club existed.
?
[music]
The type of questions kids would ask in the fan club letters was, you know,
'Can I have a piece of Paul's shirt?
' or 'If I send you a map, can you ask
Paul to come 'round at 6 o'clock?
Because I'm having a party and I'd like him to come.'
But then it got a bit out of hand, because then people wanted hair, and it was the same barber that cut their hair, it was always this one guy.
I mean, it was their hair, they'd probably do DNA on it now.
He would have a mat down on the floor or something, and cut their hair... 'cos he thought I was mental.
And he'd just say "There you go, do you want that bit?"
I'd go "Yeah, yeah, thanks."
Somebody sent a pillowcase in and said "Can you get Ritchie to sleep on this pillowcase and then send it back to me and get him to sign it?"
I must have known that he was going to be home for three days, so I just threw that in the bag and took it to his house and said, "Will you sleep on that tonight and sign it then?"
And I remember saying to Elsie -- that was his mum --
"Can you make sure he sleeps on it?"
Anyway, he brought it in, just said "Here,"
and then I just sent it out again-- whether she believed me or not that he'd slept on it, but he did, he put his head on that pillow.
Honestly, if I could do it, I would do it, 'cos I was one of them, I was a fan me self, so I knew where they were coming from.
There was one particular fan that stowed away on a ship from America to Liverpool docks, finished up on our doorstep.
Freda had many episodes like that to deal with, of fans that were just crazy.
?
[music]
They would just open the mail and flip through the mail, and go "Oh, this kid wants such and such,"
or "This girl wants a piece of my shirt,"
they'd just laugh, and I said, "Oh, just leave it there, 'cos I've got a bit of your shirt," and they'd go "Good."
When I typed the wages, the balance went in the bank Fordham, and they all got 50 pound in an envelope, cash, for them to play around with whatever way they wanted.
Now, I used to take that money sometimes:
if they didn't come in that week, Eppy'd just say to me,
"Now you go to one of the bookings."
I knew they were playing at The Empire and I was trying to get through the crowd, and in those days, policemen were always big, and this guy was a big guy and he was on a horse
and I was trying to wriggle through the crowd, and I just said to him, "I need to get into The Empire."
He just blanked me.
And I said "No, no, I work for them, honestly, I've got their wages,
I need to get into The Empire."
And he went, "You and thousands of others.
Hop it."
Which one is this?
Oh, it's a Beatle one.
My mum is the most private person I've ever met in my life.
She would never sit down and put dinner on the table and discuss just idle chitter-chatter about what's gone on with The Beatles in the past, or anything like that.
That's just not her nature.
You know, Freda, unless you knew her, you would never know what she's done, 'cos she never tells anybody at all.
We did a gig the other month in New Brighton and Freda was in the audience.
I saw her come in, and I was on the microphone,
I said "I'd like to welcome Freda Kelly, The Beatles' secretary,"
and she just turned around and walked straight out, so nobody knew who she was, they're all looking 'round but she wasn't there;
she'd walked out.
A lot of people in my mother's life don't even know her previous life, so to speak, i.e. her job, and she's always kept it like that.
It was a time of her life, and things changed, and then she became a mother so things moved on, so if they do happen to find out, they are rather surprised, to say the least.
You know, some things are very personal, and I do respect the word privacy.
I like my own privacy, and I think even The Beatles, they're entitled to part of their lives that really people shouldn't invade.
?
[acoustic guitar and birds chirping] ?
Ritchie started going out with a girl called Mo Cox who was from Liverpool, she was a hairdresser, and we just got on very well together, Mo and I.
I think it was because she was just an ordinary girl from Liverpool.
Mo and Ritchie got married in '65, and then she had Zak in the September, I think.
I happened to be in London the day he was born, and I was in the office, and Ritchie called into the office, and he said, "I'm going to see Mo now, and Zak.
Do you wanna come with me?"
and I went "Oh yeah, yeah,"
So I think I was the second person to see Zak, soon after he was born.
John's girlfriend -- well, she was his wife when I got to know Cynthia -- she was out of the picture, she was very low key.
We were told -- but that we weren't to say anything -- that John was married.
Brian Epstein was sitting on it for as long as he could.
I even had a friend that was going out with John, and she would go to bookings and he would take her home, but I couldn't tell her that, "Oh please, end this now.
It's not gonna go anywhere."
You really want to say something.
You're dying to say something, because it is your friend, but you work for a company that have asked you not to say things, so you have given your word.
Freda had this Liverpool trait of loyalty in her love life and other people's love lives.
Relationships were amongst the top priorities of being personal things that you did not publicize.
You certainly did not kiss and tell.
I was out with Paul, walking somewhere, maybe he gave me a lift home or he walked me to the bus stop, somebody saw us, and then it was, you know, I was marrying Paul,
and then they got a quote
"Well, Paul McCartney is not marrying Freda Kelly."
When it was released that Paul had got married, because people didn't know that he was getting married, phone call after phone call was all Paul fans, crying down the phone,
"Why didn't you tell us he was getting married?"
"We didn't know he was getting married!"
and, oh, some of them that wanted to kill themselves, and "Oh, I'll never be a Paul McCartney fan again!
He's gone and married somebody else!"
so you just had to calm them down and say, "Well, you know, he's still Paul McCartney, he'll still be making his records,"
and they'd be "No no no, but he's got married now and it's not the same."
I do remember the guy from one of the papers.
He lived near me, you know, he knew what my job was -- that I was working for The Beatles -- and I remember him saying to me, could I tell him anything?
"Freda, you just have to put an envelope through my door with things written on it, and then there will be an envelope through your door."
This was just before George got married, 'cos I thought "Well I ain't telling ya that George is going to get married,"
but I just looked at him, and then I just said, "Oh no, I wouldn't do that."
Everybody needs money, and we all like money, or we'd like to have more money than we have, but not to that extent.
I'm not prepared to sell me soul to the devil for a few pounds.
That's just me though, isn't it?
You know everybody doesn't think like me.
Maybe some people think I'm silly or stupid or...
She was a girl and then a woman with absolute integrity and faithfulness.
So many other people have, over the years, told, I would say, dirt digging type stories, and Freda never did do that and never would.
In the beginning, you know, I was just a fan and everything like that, but once I started working for them, the loyalty set in.
It wasn't there from day one, 'cos I'm just a seventeen-year-old, but then, as I'm maturing with them, the loyalty is setting in, and you don't break loyalty.
I think if you're loyal to something, you should stay loyal.
If she had to be tough, she would certainly be tough;
if she had to be sweet, she was sweet anyway, and she was intent on getting the facts right all the time, and lo and behold, if you didn't get the facts right, you were in her bad books,
and I wouldn't like to be in Freda's bad books.
I think that Freda's motto in life was "I'll be nice to you, but don't cross me.
I'll not deal with you, in fact, if you're trying to tell lies about my boys."
?
[music]
I was quite nervous around Freda, 'cos to me she was like an idol.
I was about 14, there was three of us worked together, oh it was just absolutely an amazing thing to do at the time, you know, to think that one of The Beatles could possibly walk in,
it was just-- oh, I just can't explain it now.
It was amazing at the time.
[Freda] They would put photographs in envelopes and they would open certain letters, and then bring the letters in for me to answer, and I would really frank in the mail, and this particular day, one of the envelopes
that I put through the franking machine was a bit bulky, so I opened it, and when I opened it, there was hair fell out, and the girls were still in the office, and I just said, "What's going on here?"
She was absolutely livid.
I mean, being the innocent party,
I didn't know nothing about it, and then my friend Lorraine, she owned up and said it was her.
It materialized that she'd cut her sister's hair and put her sister's hair in the envelope and pretended it was going to be Paul's, and I just said, "Well, I just can't trust you after this."
I still remember thinking, "I've done nothing wrong, it wasn't my fault!"
I just done a clean sweep, didn't just sack the girl that done it,
I said, "That's it, sorry.
Can't trust you anymore."
That was the only time I've been sacked.
Wouldn't wanna live that day again, that's for sure.
It was horrible... awful day.
The thing about Freda is that if she found out that somebody was telling lies about somebody, it'd just be "Come here you," in front of everybody and she would castigate them right down the banks,
and so she's a bit judgmental, if you like, but so?
That's Freda.
The bottom line was, I had to run a tight ship --
I had to answer to Apple and to The Beatles, and if anything went wrong, it was my head that went on the chopping block, nobody else's.
?
[rock and roll]
It was August 1965, and The Beatles were playing on The Empire, and The Moody Blues were also on the bill, with them.
I had popped in to see the lads,
I just opened the door slightly and their band room was just full of relations, so I thought, "Oh, I'm never going to get in here,"
so, I was involved with one of The Moodys at the time, so I went into their dressing room, which was next door, that was just them and they had alcohol and drinks, so I decided to stay there for a drink,
but probably I stayed a bit longer than I shoulda done, and then I realized that I had to get autographs signed and photographs signed, so anyway,
I came back, knocked on the door, and I just walked in.
And as I walked in, John said to me, "Where have you been?"
And I said, "Oh, I've been next door,
I've been in the Moodys' dressing room,"
and he went, "Whose fan club secretary are you?"
and I went "What are you talking about?"
I said, "I'm your fan club secretary,"
and he went "Not anymore."
He said, "You might as well go back to The Moodys and be their fan club secretary,"
and I said "What are you talking about?" and he went "You're sacked."
And then I looked at the other three, so I said, "Are you sacking me as well?"
and they went, "No, we're not sacking you."
So I got on my high horse then, probably because of the drink, and I looked at him and I said,
"Well, I'll just work for the other three;
I won't do your mail anymore."
He said "Oh, I was only joking," I went, "No you weren't,"
and he went "Oh, I'm begging you, come back!"
and I said, "Well, I'll tell you what, get down on your two knees and beg me to come back, you dumped me."
He said, "If I get down on one knee?"
and I said, "Go on then, get down on one knee,"
and he did, and I said, "Oh, all right, I'll come back to you."
There has been quite a degree of loss in her lifetime which not many people have gone through, so, obviously, her mother dying when she was very young, my brother dying, then my mum and dad getting divorced...
A lot of people have gone under for less, and she hasn't.
She's a strong character, and she's come out fighting every time.
Over a period of time, people have said "Oh, why don't you do a book?"
or "You know, you should do a book,"
and my son did ask me -
- Timothy did ask me -- to do a few things, and I just-- it was because I never talked about The Beatles, or my past, and then something would come on the television and it would jog my memory, and I would say, "Oh, I went to that,"
or, "Oh, I remember the civic reception,"
or "I remember this," and Timothy used to say,
"But mum, you never talk about it,"
and I said, "Timothy, I haven't got time to talk about it.
I'm more interested in going to shops and thinking what to put on the table tonight for dinner, not to sit down and talk to you about The Beatles."
And he just shook it off, and then, when my grandson came along, I thought
"Well, I didn't do it for Timothy,"
and then Timothy passed away a few years ago, and then when Nial came along,
I thought, "Well, I'm definitely going to do it now."
Shh, I can hear the birdies singing, yeah, can you hear them singing?
You know, because one of these days, he might just look at me in the corner with the shawl and the grey hair and a cat sitting on me knee, and probably think, "Oh, you know,
she never done anything, or..."
I would like him to be proud of me and see how exciting my life was in the '60s, and the fun I had.
If I hadn't 'a done it now -- and this is the truth --
If I hadn't 'a done it now, I know I wouldn't ever have done it.
She could always say tomorrow, tomorrow, and she'll never sit down and sort it out.
When Nial was born, things definitely changed, and I think that when anybody has a child in that respect, it does open a lot of doors for people and changes their position in life in general, and you can suddenly reinvent yourself to a degree,
because Timothy isn't around now, and you don't know what tomorrow brings.
When they came back from America,
Brian Epstein decided then that we had to move to London, and you did, because in those days everything happened in London, wasn't happening up north.
We were planning on where we were going to live and what we were gonna do, and what clubs we would visit, and we were just -- all the excitement and the adrenaline was, ooh, we're going to the big city, the capital city.
So I went home and said, "Oh, well, I'm going to London, the fam's going to London, and I'm going to London with the fam and everything,"
and I'm all bubbly, and me father, he just sat in the chair and he was just listening, and he said, "London is a city of vice.
You're not going."
I knew I could go, you know, he couldn't stop me going, but when I started looking in me own mind, he wasn't very well at the time, so that's when I thought "No, I can't do this to me father.
A job's a job, even if it is The Beatles, a job's a job."
And that's why I handed in my notice.
He had a beautiful desk in the office, really big desk, he didn't even look up when I walked in,
I just stood in front of him, and I said, very quietly,
"I want to hand in my notice please."
He'd never heard that before, and he went,
"Don't you want to come to London?"
I said, "Oh, I desperately want to come to London,
I'd love to come to London,"
and I said, "But I can't come to London, 'cos me father won't allow me."
I know for a fact that Brian Epstein was seriously concerned, and I also know that the individual Beatles were most upset that she wasn't coming to London.
And then Eppy sent for me.
He said, "I've had a talk with the lads, and we don't want to you leave."
And I was just stunned.
He said, "I've had a word with your father, and you can come to London on a regular basis.
You stay up here."
And he said, "You can go back to NEMS, let me see it done, you can have my old offices in White Chapel."
?
[music]
And that was how I didn't leave.
[She's the girl the Beatles had to leave behind]
Before they moved to London, I wanted to get their autographs, so, George was in this day, and I had autograph book upon autograph book for him to sign, and I slipped mine in the middle.
So he's signing them, and I'm saying, you know, "That's to Rita, that's to Barbara, that's to Steve, and he gets to mine, and he said
"Who's this to?" and I said, "Well, just sign that,"
'cos I just wanted it out of the way, and he went, "Well, no, who's it to?"
and I think it was because I was going,
"Oh, it doesn't matter, just sign it,"
and I remember saying to him, "Oh, just sign the book, just sign the book,"
and he flicked it to the front, and he went, "Is this yours?"
and I went, "Yeah, I haven't got your autograph,
I just want your autograph before you go to London."
So he signed it, and he pocketed it, he took it, and I went, "What are you doing with me book?"
and he went, "I'll get the others for ya."
And then next time he came in, he just threw it on the table, he went, "There you go." And they'd all put little comments in it.
Oh, Beatles Monthly.
Before the days of the internet and
Twitter and Facebook and everything, the way we got news to the fans was through the Beatles Monthlys.
I would get information from their parents, little gossipy snippets, I would also ask them what was going on, and little bits of juicy information from them, and I would put it in my newsletter, that was, in The Beatles Monthly.
Dear Beatle People,
I'd really like to thank each and every one of you who have sent presents for John's birthday.
John was really pleased that so many of you remembered him.
During his 10-day trip to America,
Paul looked in on a Beach Boys recording session.
Tarrah for now, Freda Kelly.

[rock and roll]
Dear Beatle People, July 1964 will go down in Beatle history as a hard day's month.
At last the first feature film starring our fabulous foursome is ready for showing, and will be coming to your local cinema quite soon.
At the beginning of March, you will see, Beatles at Shea Stadium Show, filmed in New York last August, when the boys starred in the largest-ever concert of their career before 57,000 fans.
Thank goodness the rumors about Paul are over.
Paul is still with us, and is likely to be with us for a long time.
Congratulations to Ringo and Maureen, who are expecting their second baby shortly after Maureen's next birthday.
George has been to the dentist again.
Dear Beatle People, after nearly four months of solid session work, the new LP, called
Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, is ready.
Beatles are hoping to acquire their own private recording studios at a secret location in central London.
New Beatles recording every week.
In one short period of just over four months, The Beatles have released no less than sixteen new recordings.
John hated his passport photograph so much that he tore it up and had a new picture taken.
Dear Beatle People, quite a lot of letters sent in discussed John, Cynthia, and Yoko Ono.
At least as many members have written about Paul and Jane.
Everyone has dozens of questions to ask, and many of you have only been too ready to put forward your opinions.
Here at the fan club, we believe that The Beatles deserve their separate and individual private lives, which should remain their business, and no other people's.
I am sure both John and Paul will work out their problems in their own ways, and I think they should be allowed to do so without the help or hindrance from millions of Beatle People.
Tarrah for now, Freda Kelly.

[acoustic guitar music]
Over the years, we could see the effect that his job was having on Eppy.
It was taking its toll.
The odd time that I went to London and saw him, he was just changing, you know, you could just see things weren't right.
He became obsessed with trying out, initially, experimenting with drugs, and then becoming very reliant upon them, and becoming more and more of a mess.
The 27th of August, 1967, I was at home.
There was something up with our phone, and I know I had to use a neighbor's phone, and the neighbor came over to me and said, "There's a call for you, there's a girl, Pat, wants to talk to you,"
and Pat said, "Oh, have you heard about
Brian, have you heard about Brian?
He's just been found dead."
The media were on this one that he committed suicide, and I just didn't believe that he committed suicide.
Somebody said that he choked on his vomit, and I tend to believe that tale.
The Beatles were actually in Wales, they'd gone there to see the Maharishi, and they were informed there, and I just remember John, out of all of them, he was the one that was sorta stunned.
Although I was still young me self, I could still visualize the devastation that it was going to cause.
He was the anchor for everything, and it was just...
where do we all go from here?
What happens now?
So Paul had this meeting set for September the 1st, within a couple of days of Brian Epstein's very tragic, premature death, and when I got there, nobody else had arrived yet, and he said, "Before the others get here, I just want to tell you,
I think that if The Beatles do not get together and work together very very quickly now, the group is going to disintegrate."
?
[music]
Magical Mystery tour, it wasn't the best-organized thing, well, it wasn't organized, because Paul had a rough idea, but just a very rough idea.
This coach rolled up, and there was all different types of people milling around, like a guy dressed up as a bit of a clown, and he had a spotty, funny-type suit, and I thought "What's going on?"
and then this man -
- I didn't know him, I found out his name then, it was called Ivor Cutler -- and he come over to me and he just said to me, "You've got a nice-shaped head."
We all eventually got on the bus, and I dived for the back,
I thought, "Well, I'll go on the back seat, and, you know, you're not really seen on the back seat,"
and then Paul eventually got on the bus, and he sat by the driver, and then he called my name, and he went, "Freda, where are you?"
and I went, "I'm here, I'm on the back,"
and he went, "Can you come up the front?"
and I went, "Do I have to?" and he went, "Come up the front."
I thought, "Well, he's getting severe here now, do as you're told."
You couldn't book the hotels in The Beatles' names because they wouldn't have you, so you always had to book them under false names, and Neil was doing some of the hotels, and I said to him, "Why don't you book it in the Women's Institute
or the Catholic Women's League or something like that?"
and he went, "Oh, that's a good idea,"
so I had to go up to the counter in the hotel and say, "Hello, you've got a reservation in the name of the Women's Institute,"
and then they went, "Oh fine," I said, "Well, we're just come in now."
The shock on people's faces when we all trooped in -- because it was The Beatles, it was people dressed weird -- it was a very mixed bunch, very odd bunch, and I was one of them.
But where, I think, Paul was decided to do it there and then was 'cos it was so quickly after Brian Epstein's death.
He thought it might hold us all together, or hold them all together, but I don't think it worked.
That's just my opinion.
You know, you don't wanna think about that, you can be big-headed, and say,
"Yeah, we're gonna last ten years,"
but as soon as you've said that, you think
"We're lucky if we last three months."
Well obviously, we can't keep playing the same sort of music until we're about 40.
When I as at 40, we may not know how to write songs anymore.
I hope to have enough money to go into a business of my own by the time we do flop.
I've always fancied having a ladies' hairdresser.
I string them, in fact, and strut 'round in me stripes and me tails, you know, "Like a cup of tea, madam?"
The Beatles stopped touring in roughly 1966, I think, then Brian Epstein died in '67, and
Magical Mystery Tour was in '67, and Apple had started by then.
In the beginning, when Apple first opened, it was great:
the fun and the madness and all different nationalities in the press office.
People didn't act as if they were working in an office or a business, and then it became more settled down, more normal, and there wasn't as much fun.
I loved the beginning part of it, 'cos it was fun in the beginning, and it was fun for them, they enjoyed it so much.
Every group wants to be in the charts, or wants a hit record, or...
Everything was exciting in the beginning:
they got a number one, and then they were asked to appear on the Royal Command Performance, and they saw the queen, and they were a hit in America, and the civic reception, and it was all these landmarks,
and... where does it stop?
You can't keep carrying on like that, can you?
Towards the end of the '60s, it wasn't what The Beatles were doing as a group anymore, it was what they were doing individually.
I know Paul's was-- he was bringing out his own LP,
John and Yoko were doing the peace movement, and George was doing things, I think with Clapton, I can't remember,
Ritchie had two sons by then, and he was more interested in, sort of, a family life.
And then the penny was dropping with me, that we aren't gonna be Beatles as a group anymore.
Are you still the Beatles' fan club secretary?
How's business?
Fine, except for the post day.
They don't have a group anymore.
Well they've still got four members, haven't they?
I don't like to lie, but it was trying to bend the truth, when people were asking you questions about what was going on, you had to more or less say, "Well yes,
The Beatles are still together, and everything's great," but it wasn't great.
And now, what's the arrangement today?
Well last August, Paul rang me up and said he didn't want people to be writing about him as a Beatle, which I was doing, and he wanted to split this word, Beatles, up.
They are four individual people now, recording and everything, and we'll write all about Apple artists, so we're still writing about the four Beatles 'cos Paul is still an Apple artist.
Is the atmosphere today anything like it was ten years ago?
No, no.
What's missing?
The closeness.
It was all fun when we were teenagers, but your life changes, and my life had changed, I was then 27, I mean,
I was married now, had a baby son, and I wanted more children, and I was, we'll say, concentrating on that.
I then found out I was pregnant.
I'd been trying to get pregnant for a while;
I desperately wanted this baby, and I just wanted to make sure that everything was gonna be all right, so that was more important to me than my job, was my married life, my son, and the baby on the way,
and then that's when I thought, "Well, I'm out here."
?
[music]
I went to London, had a discussion with Neil Aspinall, the head of Apple, who was their road manager in the beginning, and George and Ritchie were there;
it was just-- that was all, I remember we were 'round a table.
I told them that I was pregnant, and they said,
"Well, do you think you would be going back to work?"
and I said, "I won't be going back to work, you know, I'll have two children then."
And then George finally spoke up and said, "Freda, you were there in the beginning, you're there at the end, let's call it a day.
Let's end the fan club."
You're still involved in the fan club?
Well, I'm sorta trying to wind it up.
This is what I wrote:
"Well, this is it.
John, Paul, George, and Ringo have each gone their separate ways, and they are no longer collectively an item.
There it is.
Eleven years.
Eleven years in which we have become a very strong, happy, and close circle of friends.
There will not be another official fan club for The Beatles as individual artists.
Please do not write again.
Yours faithfully, Freda Kelly."
I haven't read that since it went out.
I actually felt quite sad, reading it.
With me being a Beatle fan myself,
I just knew that this is going to break a lot of girls' hearts, so I musta put a lot of lights out for people.
Well, the lights went out, didn't they?
At the back of all this, I am still
-- or was -- am still a Beatle fan, so I do think the way they think.
We were still getting a lot of letters every day.
I took them all home with me, 'cos I couldn't leave them in the office, and although I said I wouldn't write again and I wouldn't answer any letters, between running my home and doing
the normal things a mother does,
I did answer the letters.
Slowly.
You know, I'd maybe do three one night,
I might do none the next night,
I might do five on the Saturday.
But it took me, on average, about three years to answer all those letters.
?
[acoustic guitar solo]
Once I ended the fan club, that was it.
I was then not Freda Kelly anymore, and I just lived a normal life like everybody else, nothing to do with The Beatles anymore.
When I look back, it is shocking how many people that have gone that I knew from those days.
Well, we lost Eppy first of all.
You've got the main two-- you've got John and George, you've got two wives-- Mo Cox, Linda McCartney, you've got all the parents, you've got Neil Aspinall,
Derek Taylor, my friend Laurie McCaffrey... it brings it home to me.
I think fame and money doesn't mean anything.
All the wealth doesn't cure cancer, does it?
I worked with a lot of good people, I did, I loved them.
?
[music and singing]
Giving a job like that, to what became the biggest band in the world, to a girl of 17, that was an unbelievable thing to do, and she never let 'em down.
The tide washes the sea in every day.
Freda was the tide -- you saw the effects of the tide like you see the effects of Freda -- but you never actually see a tide as such, it just happens to be there, and Freda was, so tell the story.
I don't know why Eppy picked me.
Maybe it was just fate.
And I was taken along for this ten-year, exciting ride, and then dropped off on the corner where I started it.
You know, I'm not famous, I'm not wealthy,
I'm still working for a living, I'm still a Beatle fan, so although there's a 50-year gap since I started it,
I still like to think that I'm back where I was in the beginning.
I don't ever have to tell this tale again.
It's down now, on record, isn't it?
End of.
Peace and love.
My name is Ringo, and this is a message to all of Freda Kelly's grandchildren.
Freda was a great friend to The Beatles, she was the fan club leader, and we've known her for a long time.
Anyway, we all loved Freda.
She was great, and Freda was like part of the family, and she knew all our families, she was just one of the best.
Peace and love.
Peace and love.

Hello, this is John speaking with his voice.
We're all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic.
This record reaches you at the end of a really dear year for us, and it's all due to you.
I'd like to say thank you to all of the Beatle people who have written to me during the year.
I'd love to reply personally to everyone, but I just haven't enough pens.
This is Paul here.
We're all dead pleased by the way you've treated us in 1963, and we're trying to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we write and record next year.
Well, I'm running out of my time and people are telling me to stop--
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop shouting those animals!
So I'll finish now with wishing everyone
Happy Crimble, and a merry new year.
Ya Ringo!
Hello, Ringo here.
As you know,
I was the last member to join The Beatles.
I started to play gongs in the group 1962.
Thank you Ringo, thank you Ringo.
We'll phone you.
I'm George Harrison!
Nobody else has said anything yet about our secretary, Freda Kelly in Liverpool.
Good old Freda!
So on behalf of us all, I'd just like to say a great big "thank you"--
I was just a secretary then, and, funny enough, I'm still a secretary now, and who would want to hear the secretary's story?
Millions of girls around the world wanted this dream job:
they wanted to be the secretary.
She epitomized all their dreams and all their hopes, and all these girls wanted to be Freda Kelly and to be that close to The Beatles.
Well, I didn't expect to talk, maybe grab one of them, but I wouldn't hurt 'em, I wouldn't hurt 'em,
I'd just talk to them maybe, but I wouldn't, you know, grab-- like, everybody says they're gonna cut their hair and everything-- we wouldn't do that.
If you look at what is history now,
The Beatles were together ten years.
Freda worked for The Beatles for eleven.
She was there right before they made it, and right after they finished, so that says it all, basically.
Tell me, when you hear a Beatles record, what thoughts run through your mind?
Beauty, sheer beauty.
The Beatles bring joy into the world:
they're happiness; we forget our cares when we hear Beatle records.
Freda was far more than a secretary to the Beatles;
she was a family member.
She's never had the same recognition that a number of people within the inner circle have had, simply because she never pushed herself, she never wrote a book, she never agreed to do interviews, she's always kept a very very confidential existence.
We came here at 6 o'clock in the morning, 5:30, to see them, and all they do is push you farther and farther away and then they don't even let you see them!
A lot of people didn't take these girls seriously, but I did, because, you know,
I was one of them -- I was a fan me self.
So I knew where they were coming from.
We grew up with them.
You know, they started when they were younger and we were younger.
And all through these years, we've just developed with them and grown up with them, and they belong to us, you know?
But there could never be another Beatles.
Never.
She's one of the last survivors of the whole Beatles era, and you know, this story of Freda Kelly's will be, surely, one of the last true stories of the Beatles that you'll ever really hear.
I've been a secretary for half a century, fifty years, and that's quite frightening.
This job is interesting, but it's not as exciting as my last job.
I don't get the phone calls that I did in the 60's, like, you know, an invite to a premiere, you know, "Roy Orbison's having a party and we've managed to get a few tickets,
do you want to come to that Fre?"
And I'm like "Yeah, okay, I'm on the next train!"
I left school when I was sixteen, and my first job was at a firm called Prince's.
I was in the middle of a typing pool, which is rows of secretaries just typing away.
The lads from different levels of law would come down and give me work to do, but most of my day was just spent typing contracts, typing letters -- it wasn't the most glamorous of jobs,
but I was a working woman now.
One day, two guys from upstairs came down and came over to my desk and just said "Come on Freda, we're going to take you out for lunch."
I didn't know where I was going, and I ended up in The Cavern.
Now, I'd never been to The Cavern before,
I didn't even know what I was going into, because it was a cellar.
It had a unique smell:
there was no ventilation, and sometimes the toilets overflowed, and it was opposite a fruit market, so it was probably a mixture of disinfectant, rotten fruit, and sweat all rolled into one.
There was three archways, and in the middle archway was wooden seats, all different types of wooden seats, they weren't all in rows and all the same.
There was a little wooden stage at the back, and The Beatles were playing on the stage when I first walked in.
And I'd never experienced anything like that -- it was everything about them, it was just the way they dressed, with all this leather gear, they were larking about, and dancing on stage, and mucking about with the audience,
and on top of everything else, there was the music.
It was just unlike anything I'd ever heard.
I was hooked.
I just was amazed by everything I saw, and I thought "That's it, I'm going to go tomorrow."
Well I think it's put down that they played something silly like 294 times.
Out of that, I would say, I probably saw them about 190 times.
Freda was definitely a staple of The Cavern, she was always there, and she always sat in the same seat.
I used to like the second arch on the left hand side, because it was just that handy.
You could pop in and out the band room all the time.
There was about two rows in the front, they would leave their rollers in until before the lads would come onstage, and then they'd take their rollers out and doll theirselves up and everything.
It was conversation all the time with the audience.
Somebody came in, a different hairstyle, they'd pick on them.
They'd go "Have you been the hairdresser's?"
or "Who got you up this morning?"
But he answered them back.
They liked the razzmatazz between you and them.
People used to write down a number, give it to them, and ask them would they right play that number.
Now, if you gave it to John, Paul always went over to John and leaned over his shoulder and read the request out.
I thought "Can John read, or--?"
He looked pretty arrogant, to be honest-- he'd look at the crowd like that as if he was going to kill everyone in the crowd.
And then I mentioned it to somebody and they said "Oh, no, no, John's as blind as a bat.
He wears glasses and he never wears his glasses, so he can't see further than his nose."
I liked George singing Three Cool Cats, I loved that one.
Or The Sheik of Araby, because he used to do a little dance and I liked him doing the little dance.
He used to sort of kick his feet along the stage.
A few times I rang Paul up, because one of my friends fancied him and I wanted him to sing for her.
We used to just dial Garston and then the number 6922.
He'd say "Hello," and you'd go, "Oh hi Paul, it's Freda.
It's Linda Shepherd's birthday on such-and-such a day, can you play Love of the Loved for her?"
"Yeah, okay."
I got to know them personally through just talking to them, going in the band room, because when they came off-stage, they used to either sit in the band room, talking to different people who ever came in,
and then you would just sit by them, and you would just ask them where they were playing, or how come you weren't here yesterday.
Paul was always nice and always friendly, and any time you'd ask Paul to sing something, he would do it.
John... a man of many moods.
It depended on what side of the bed he got out in in the morning.
He could be really grumpy, but he was always himself, he never put an act on.
People say George was the quiet Beatle, and I suppose he was in one way, but he was never quiet with me.
He was more quietly-spoken, I think, than the others.
He was very thoughtful.
Ringo hadn't joined the group yet;
Pete Bass was on the drums.
Pete was very shy, and he was also very handsome, so he had a big following around town, from the girls.
They loved Pete.
They all lived my way home, on the south side of Liverpool, and Paul and George had cars, and then they'd say "Do you want a lift home?"
My father wasn't keen on them, he saw them and what he saw he didn't like.
If they'd had suits on, or somebody had a suit with a collar and tie, he probably would've approved of them, but he didn't approve of The Beatles.
But I was always late back from work,
I was always pushing and puffing and panting and sitting down and starting to type.
I couldn't say I was somewhere else or I got held up in a restaurant or trying to get some food because I had the Cavern smell on me, so they knew exactly where I'd been.
The girls in the typing pool had photographs up on the wall of Pat Boone and Elvis and Tommy Steele and Cliff Richard, and I didn't like any of them, so I found a little picture of The Beatles,
but it was only dead small, and I remember putting it up on the wall, and the personnel manager caught me when I was putting it up on the wall, Mr. Mold, and he said,
"Oh, what are you doing, who are they?"
and I said "Oh, they're The Beatles,"
and he went "Who's The Beatles?"
and I said "They're a Liverpool group,"
and he went "Never heard of them,"
and I said "Oh, you will one day."
Bobbie Brown was the girl who went to The Cavern and started a fan club for The Beatles.
Now, I couldn't understand why The Beatles had a fan club, because they were just a local group, but I eventually ended up helping Bobbie, and then Bobbie got a boyfriend and lost interest in running the Beatles fan club,
so I took over from there.
I was buying stamps and salve in the beginning, and I remember being in the band room one day lunch time and saying to Paul, "You owe me seven six for stamps,"
and he went "I haven't any money."
And then Bob Waller paid them, and I sat in the band room until Bob Waller paid them, and I said "You've now got money."
So he give him his due and paid me.
I just had this faith -- and there wasn't just me -- you just knew they were going to be famous one day, but I couldn't visualize the fame that they got.
To me, being famous was playing on The Empire, having a record in the charts.
Cliff Richard was big in those days, and being as big as Cliff Richard, that was as far as my vision went.
Everything was new, nobody knew what was going to happen.
People who ever say to you, "We knew they were going to be a success,"
they're lying through their teeth.
Nobody knew it was going to be the world phenomenon that it became.
I got to know Brian Epstein through The Beatles.
I was going to see The Beatles all the time, and then Brian Epstein started to come to see them and that's how we became friendly.
Everybody in Liverpool knew who he was, because he was manager of NEMS Ltd., the biggest record shop in the north of England.
I do remember it was by St. Barnabas's Hall in Penny Lane, it was a Saturday night, I walked in,
I just know Eppy coming up to me, and he then told me that he was signing The Beatles and he was starting his own firm and he needed a secretary.
Then he said, did I want to come and work for them, and I said "Oh, go on then." I just remember saying, "Oh go on then."
And I was so excited because I was starting my dream job, working for The Beatles.
I think what Brian Epstein saw was somebody who was a fan without being an over-the-top fanatic.
I would call her more of an admirer;
she appreciated The Beatles, and that fitted perfectly, I mean,
Freda was there on the scene and ready to take over.
We had a lot of respect for Brian, obviously, we thought he was really posh, you know, we were all Liverpool screw-offs really, but Brian was very posh, and for him to choose Freda to be the secretary,
we thought "Hey, wow, she must have something,"
you know, he could have picked anybody.
That's when I had to tell home, 'cos I didn't want to tell home, 'cos I just knew the reaction.
My mother died when I was eighteen months, and she died of cancer.
I had a good relationship with my father, but also he was very protective towards me because I was his only child.
I was 17, so I managed to pluck up the courage this particular night at tea time, and I just said casually "I'm starting a new job on Monday."
And I do remember him saying "Has it got anything to do with The Beatles?"
and I just blanked it, I must have turned it back 'cos I know I didn't lie, but I didn't answer the question, and all I remember was the teapot going down with a big slam.
We used to call him Daddy Eppy;
he was Brian Epstein's father, and it was his business.
We were on the top floor of his shop.
The first floor was what we used to call the "white goods":
it was televisions and washing machines and things like that, and then on the second floor, that was Brian Epstein's office, and then there was a store room behind his office, so I worked in the store room.
They changed that into an office for me.
In the beginning, the lads were in the office nearly every single day, you know, they just popped in and out.
They would sit by my desk for a chat or while they were waiting to go into Eppy's office, so I got to know them more.
I was 17, so naturally I did have crushes on them.
The way I describe it, and this is the truth, if Paul looked nice or sang a song for me or something,
I was in love with Paul that day, I fancied him that day, but then the following day, if Ritchie asked me how me dogs were
(because he knew I had Yorkshire Terriers, he'd say "Oh, how are the dogs?")
I'd think "Oh, yeah, I fancy Ritchie,"
and then I think, if George offered me a lift home from work,
I'd be in love with George that day, and I'd think "Yeah, yeah, I definitely fancy George."
But then if John came in and started talking about various things,
I'd think "I like his nose, I like the Roman nose,"
but it would only be for a day or two.
Did you go out with any of them?
No.
Pass.
No stories there?
Oh, there is stories, but I don't want anybody's hair falling out or turning curly.
That's personal.
It was the end of a working day, and Eppy just came in and said,
"Come on Freda, put your coat on,
I'm going to take you somewhere."
I had no idea where.
And next minute we were at The Empire, and then next minute we were in the box,
I'd never been in the box of The Empire.
It was this one on the left.
He'd managed to get The Beatles a spot on the Little Richard show, and I think somebody was sick or something and he'd managed to get them on.
And I remember sitting in the box, it was just Eppy and I, and I was to the left, and then I looked down on the stage and the whole theatre and the stage were in darkness,
except for this light shining on Paul's face, and he was singing A Taste of Honey.
I don't cry, but my eyes sort of filled up and I just couldn't believe that The Beatles were on The Empire, the biggest theatre in Liverpool, and I thought "This is it.
They've made it.
They're going to be famous one day."
The Beatles' first hit, as far as I'm concerned, was Love Me Do, I mean,
I was one of the ones that bought it, and I didn't have a record player, and there was loads of girls like me that didn't have record players, but we bought it just to boost the sales.
You didn't have pop stations then, but we had one station called Radio Luxembourg, and they used to do the charts, and I remember staying up late, sitting by the radio, holding the knob,
trying to keep it on the same wavelength, and waiting to hear The Beatles' record.
And when it got to 17, that was amazing.
I know it only stayed the week, I think, but it didn't matter.
They were in the charts.
I was working for Brian Epstein, doing a normal day-job, but I also had to do the fan club overnight.
Silly me, I gave out my home address as the fan club address.
The postman knocked on the door and he said to me, "Who gave this address out?
You've got 200 letters here."
And I said, "Sorry, won't do it again time."
Little did he know, within the next few months The Beatles became more famous, and instead of just 200 letters, they were coming in bundles, and those bundles came in sacks, so the van rolled up.
My father wasn't keen on The Beatles anyway, and his own personal mail, you know, your telephone bill, electricity bill, your gas bill, all in the fan mail.
So he just looked at me and said,
"You've got to put a stop to this.
What possessed you to give our home address out?"
I didn't think at the time.
My mother has never played the fame game.
If she had, things would be completely different now, and she might not be working six days a week
9 'til 5 o'clock at night, very stressed, when other people have retired, and she hasn't got that joy.
These are all Christmas decorations.
Oh, success.
I kept a couple of scrapbooks with theatre tickets in, and newspaper cuttings in.
A few fan club letters.
Yeah, they're old.
I think it's records, and, oh, me scrapbook.
Yeah.
Cuttings book.
I mean I have a lot of these.
I don't know.
Forty years since Rachel was born.
I could have been a very very wealthy woman, could be a millionairess if I'd have kept everything.
I had loads of autographs, photographs, all the fan club stuff, Apple stuff, fan club records, but over a period of time, I gave it all away.
But I don't regret that, because I know when I gave the majority of the stuff away,
I gave it in 1974, and I actually handed the stuff to Beatle fans myself, so I knew the Beatle fans got all the fan club stuff that was left.
I've got these four boxes anyway.
I didn't even think I had four boxes.
As I'm flicking through, there are so many memories coming back to me.
I'll just pick something up, and I'll remember that day.
Oh, this is George Harrison's real hair.
A few months after Love Me Do, the lads had their first number one hit, which was Please Please Me.
We were gradually getting letters, from 50 a day, 200 a day, to my home, and then it worked up to about 800 a day, and then eventually we didn't even count them, we just threw the mail in the corner.
I would put loads of photographs in front of them, and they would go in to Eppy, and they would take the photographs in with them, and while they were talking to Eppy, they were all signing.
But they never complained about signing things, never ever.
I think it was because it was early days and they were all excited by it all, so nothing was a problem.
Out of all The Beatles, I'd say George was the best one for signing things.
He would come in and he'd go,
"Do you want me to sign anything?
What have you got in your cupboard?"
The Beatles called him Eppy, we all did, but to his face, he asked us to call him Mr. Brian in the office.
He was the boss so it was Mister.
He had an aura about him.
I know he was probably only 27 then, but he was old.
Ten years was a big difference in those days, where I'm 17, he's 27.
He came from a well-off family and he had nice clothes and spoke with a posh accent, so you had respect for him.
He threw a few tantrums in the office, and you just kept out of his way.
Well, I did.
Probably that's why I lasted ten years.
Some people didn't, or retaliated, and they were sacked on the spot.
He was the boss, and he was the boss.
Brian Epstein was notorious for his dreadful tantrums.
He would hire and re-fire his top executives at the drop of a hat.
Freda was sort of immune, if you like, to the temper tantrums.
She was never hurt by them.
We had a new dictaphone, and he gave me this tape to do while he was out, and I'd done about two letters and the tape got stuck.
So Neil Aspinall came in and I said,
"Oh God, I've got this tape and I've got it stuck, and there's a load of work on it."
We pressed two things, and we erased all the work.
He came in the office, and I just saw John at the back of him, and he went to hang up the coat, and he said, "Have you finished the tape?"
and I just said "No.
I'm sorry, no.
I've wiped it by mistake."
He just looked at me, and then shouted "You stupid girl!"
and John Lennon saved the day, because he was behind me, and he must have seen how shaken I was, and Eppy about to erupt.
He started laughing, and going "Oh, what have you done, Kelly?"
and when a Beatle laughed, Eppy laughed.
But it wasn't a proper laugh.
He wasn't amused at all.
And I just remember looking at him and saying "I'll stay late to do it."
and he said, "I know you will, you'll definitely stay late, until all this work is done."
I was very naive for my age;
I just came into the music business when I was 17, up until I was 16, I'm camping with the Guides and things like that.
Once I joined the Beatles organization,
I grew up overnight in more ways than one, and I remember saying to John,
"You know what?
I don't know what it is about him--"
I said "I can't put me finger on it,"
and I know I was rabbiting on for England, and John started laughing, and then he went "Have you no idea?"
and I said, "No idea about what?"
He put it to me very innocently, and I always respect him for that, he said, "Well let's say this, Fre, if you're on a desert island with him, you'd be safe."
And the penny dropped.
Where nowadays it's legal, and quite rightly so, but in those days they had a lot to put up with.
Probably that had a lot to do with his mood-swings as well, and trying to keep it from his parents and other people.
The music industry was a man's industry in the '60s.
In The Beatles' circle, there wasn't any high-ranking women.
Women, or girls, worked on the admin side, but the highest you can go in admin is just be secretary to the main guy.
I was secretary to Brian Epstein, but there wasn't a hard road to climb, you just had to stay there.
There was a lot to get done, so anybody that came into the office,
I would put them to work.
I would get them slicing' the envelopes, tearin' the foreign stamps off, stickin' photographs in envelopes, and groups around town
-- because they never had any money, musicians around town -- they used to come into my office for a free cup of tea, or if it was raining, or to hear the records, so while they were sitting there,
nobody sat there doing nothing.
They all used to help out.
I bumped into the lead singer of
The Cryin' Shames, Ritchie Routledge, and he had a big post bag on his back, and I said "Where are you going?"
he said, "I'm going to the post office,"
I said "What for?", he said, "I've got all The Beatles' vinyl stuff in the bag, Freda told me -- not asked me, told me -- to go and post it."
She just had this way about her, a bit like a schoolteacher really.
You know, you had to do what the schoolteacher said, and you had to do what Freda said, really.
Well, you didn't have to do it, you wanted to do it for her, 'cause she'd just give you a little smile, and you did it.
When Ringo first joined the band
-
- I think he was only in the band about two weeks or something --
I came into the office, he said
"I'm getting letters to my house, and if I bring them in, will you do them?"
And I went "No, I won't," I said, "I've got too much to do."
I said "Get your mother to do it, you know all the other parents do,"
and he went "Oh, me mum doesn't know what to do."
He put the sad eyes on, and just like
"Oh, go on, please?
You know, I don't get many."
To shut him up I went "Oh go on then, bring them in."
He brought about nine letters in this little poly bag, and he actually put the answers to the questions that they'd asked in the letters on the top of the letter to help me, 'cos he said to me, "If you don't know the answers
I've put the answers down for you and everything."
He must have thought I was terrible, 'cos I looked at him and I said to him "Is this all you get?"
I couldn't believe-- he must have wanted to shoot me, and I went, "You've only got nine letters."
He said, "Will you help me?
Will you come and show me mum what to do?"
I ended up going 'round, knocking on 10 Admiral Grove, and Elsie opened the door, and I said, "I'm Freda from the office,"
and she went, "Oh, thank God for that, come in, love, come in."
And I said, "Well, I've just brought stuff for you, to show you what to do."
She said, "Have you had any tea?"
And I said "No," and she went, "Would you like egg and chips?"
and I said, "Oh, I'd love egg and chips, yeah."
And then we started talking, and we got on like a house on fire.
Every week, for years, I went to that house.
Will the neighbors not become envious of all the wealth that's been accumulated by the Beatles?
No, not the neighbors 'round here, they're all very good and all quite proud.
Comin' back now, just everything is flashing in me head about just how much joy and happiness and laughter went on in this house.
I had a great time here.
I loved it,
I loved coming here every week.
It's probably...
I haven't been in this house for about 46 years.
I spent a lot of my life here.
I used to stay 'til about 1 or 2 in the morning, going through the mail, and talking, and laughing, things about my life as well, and who I was going out with at the time.
And it's not one of The Beatles, before you start.
Elsie'd give me advice, motherly advice.
She was very jolly, very outgoing, and a really strong laugh.
I told her all my secrets when I was a teenager.
Maybe she looked on the daughter that she didn't have, maybe she looked on me as that.
She decided I wasn't getting enough money, wages, and she was at a party, and Eppy was there, and then she, few drinks down, and then she starts in on him and said "You don't know what you've got there,
you've got a good worker there."
And she was going on and on, and I was going "Well, shut up."
And she was going, "You should pay her some more money, you know.
You don't pay her enough money.
You should give her a rise."
I really got a rise, two weeks later.
His words were, "We've reviewed your wages, Freda, and we've decided to give you a rise."
Well, you asked me about a mother figure before -- she was the nearest to a mother figure for me.
I just adored her.
Once The Beatles were in London and criss-crossing the globe,
Freda became probably the link between the Beatles' families in Liverpool and each individual Beatle.
I was surprised when I met her, because I thought, to have taken on this mammoth, ridiculous job, she must have been some 50-year-old, settled-in-her-ways old secretary with bad feet and a large bosom, but she was anything but:
she was vivacious and fun and just a snip of a teenager, this young, thin girl.
I suppose you could say that The Beatles saw her as a sister, and the families saw her as a daughter.
NEMS used to close on a Wednesday afternoon, but I never told home that I was off on a Wednesday afternoon.
We used to go out with Paul's dad, we used to call him Uncle Jim, we used to go to a place called the Bassnett Bar.
He was trying to educate me on the cures and cheeses and coffee and things like that.
Well, I would stay there and get sozzled, you know, 'cos I'd be trying all these different things with them, and then they would just put me in a taxi and I'd go home and go straight to bed.
Now, John's family...
he only had Mimi.
Mimi was John's aunt.
She took John in when he was about five, when his parents split up.
Mimi didn't let anybody in that house;
very few people got in.
You had to go 'round the back, you know, like the tradesmen's entrance, but I actually went up and knocked on the front door, and I got in the front door.
It wasn't that you were frightened of Mimi, you just watched your Ps and Qs.
To me, Mimi was like my father, she was old-school.
Any time I saw her with John, which wasn't very often, she was quite stern but he did obey her.
I think the Harrisons enjoyed the fame more than any of the other parents.
Mr. and Mrs. Harrison loved it.
They took to it more.
She was excellent with the fans, would let them into her house, would give them a cup of tea, you know, every day, she just sat down and wrote letters to all these kids.
But they were very protective of George, maybe it was because he was the youngest Beatle.
Mr. Harrison -
- Harry Harrison -- was always saying to me,
"You should learn to dance properly,"
and I said "I don't wanna learn ballroom dancing, I don't really like it,"
and he said "No, I'm going to teach you."
He would get me up to dance and show me how to do the quick-step and the waltz and everything.
So we were like there-- I was really self-conscious about it,
I just did not want to learn to ballroom dance.
You know, all the families and all the boys believed in her.
She was 'good old Freda' to them, in other words.
Seeing them on a regular basis, coming in and out the office, going to their homes, it didn't hit me how big they were or worshipped they were until the civic reception, which was at the Town Hall in Liverpool.
The only people that were invited really were The Beatles themselves and The Beatles' families, and that was it, but Ritchie's family put me down as one of their family.
We were picked up in a car from the counsel, we must have come in the back way, and the lads were already here, and we had a meal, so we were all relaxed and everything,
and then next minute, they then had to go out onto the balcony and, just as they opened these doors, the noise hit us, with the shouts and the screaming,
and then I came to behind the door here and I just couldn't believe Castle Street.
It was just full of people;
as far as the eye could see was people, everywhere.
I mean, the noise was deafening, there was chaos in the street, girls were wriggling and pushing to get through the crowd, and they were fainting, and the ambulance men and police were just passing them over the crowds
to get them into the ambulance.
It was unbelievable.
I think the penny actually dropped with me then, how big they were, 'cos it hadn't really hit home until I saw that amount of people, it was about 200,000 people -- I couldn't even visualize 200,000 people
until I saw it that day.
I think now, and I think the parents must have been so proud of 'em, that their sons were out on the balcony, and Liverpool was reacting to them.
I'm very proud that I worked for them.
So what was Beatlemania to you at the height of it, when it was its busiest, what, 1964, '65?
No sleep with all the mail.
How many letters a week were you getting, roughly?
Oh, God, thousands, two to three thousand a day.
Must have sat up 'til 4, 5 o'clock in the morning just answering -- I used to do all what we call detail letters --
I used to just bring all them home and then go back to work with me little parcel the next day.
I don't know how I lived.
In the wake of the outbreak of Beatlemania, there was a very very sudden increase in interest amongst fans, people writing in, asking for autographs, asking to join the Beatles fan club, etc.
Brian Epstein decided that we would have a stamp.
It looked like a proper signature.
And I remember, sometimes, I would roll it across the autograph book, and only half of it would turn out, or it would smudge.
I ruined so many kids' autograph books.
And of course, I'm a Beatle fan, so I'm thinking the way they're thinking, and I thought "I'd go mad if that was me."
I know I was against them and John Lennon was against them as well,
I think he thought because of the falseness.
I remember John coming in, and I asked him to sign something, and he said, "I did that,"
"You don't normally sign it that way,"
and he said "I've decided to sign that way from now on,"
and I said, "Is that because our stamps look like you wrote the signature?"
He went "Yeah."
In the end, I thought, "Oh, I'm dumping them."
I never told Eppy, I just thought, "Right,
I'll just keep all these autograph books and photographs in the cupboard, and when the lads come in, I'll still carry on."
I would know when they were staying at home in their own houses,
I would know in advance that, oh, George is coming home tonight, so I'll nab him, I'll go from the office straight to Mackets Lane, so I would go 'round and get them to sign stuff in their own house,
say, "Oh, while you're sitting there, watching the telly, do us a favor.
Can you just sign that bagful?"
So, if some of the fans, especially in the foreign countries, they didn't have the address of the fan club, so they just knew that they lived in England somewhere, so they would just put 'To Paul McCartney'
or 'To George Harrison, England,' but it would come through the system.
The post office, give them their due, were very good, they just knew where the fan club existed.
The type of questions kids would ask in the fan club letters was, you know,
'Can I have a piece of Paul's shirt?
' or 'If I send you a map, can you ask
Paul to come 'round at 6 o'clock?
Because I'm having a party and I'd like him to come.'
But then it got a bit out of hand, because then people wanted hair, and it was the same barber that cut their hair, it was always this one guy.
I mean, it was their hair, they'd probably do DNA on it now.
He would have a mat down on the floor or something, and cut their hair... 'cos he thought I was mental.
And he'd just say "There you go, do you want that bit?"
I'd go "Yeah, yeah, thanks."
Somebody sent a pillowcase in and said "Can you get Ritchie to sleep on this pillowcase and then send it back to me and get him to sign it?"
I must have known that he was going to be home for three days, so I just threw that in the bag and took it to his house and said, "Will you sleep on that tonight and sign it then?"
And I remember saying to Elsie -- that was his mum --
"Can you make sure he sleeps on it?"
Anyway, he brought it in, just said "Here,"
and then I just sent it out again-- whether she believed me or not that he'd slept on it, but he did, he put his head on that pillow.
Honestly, if I could do it, I would do it, 'cos I was one of them, I was a fan me self, so I knew where they were coming from.
There was one particular fan that stowed away on a ship from America to Liverpool docks, finished up on our doorstep.
Freda had many episodes like that to deal with, of fans that were just crazy.
They would just open the mail and flip through the mail, and go "Oh, this kid wants such and such,"
or "This girl wants a piece of my shirt,"
they'd just laugh, and I said, "Oh, just leave it there, 'cos I've got a bit of your shirt," and they'd go "Good."
When I typed the wages, the balance went in the bank Fordham, and they all got 50 pound in an envelope, cash, for them to play around with whatever way they wanted.
Now, I used to take that money sometimes:
if they didn't come in that week, Eppy'd just say to me,
"Now you go to one of the bookings."
I knew they were playing at The Empire and I was trying to get through the crowd, and in those days, policemen were always big, and this guy was a big guy and he was on a horse
and I was trying to wriggle through the crowd, and I just said to him, "I need to get into The Empire."
He just blanked me.
And I said "No, no, I work for them, honestly, I've got their wages,
I need to get into The Empire."
And he went, "You and thousands of others.
Hop it."
Which one is this?
Oh, it's a Beatle one.
My mum is the most private person I've ever met in my life.
She would never sit down and put dinner on the table and discuss just idle chitter-chatter about what's gone on with The Beatles in the past, or anything like that.
That's just not her nature.
You know, Freda, unless you knew her, you would never know what she's done, 'cos she never tells anybody at all.
We did a gig the other month in New Brighton and Freda was in the audience.
I saw her come in, and I was on the microphone,
I said "I'd like to welcome Freda Kelly, The Beatles' secretary,"
and she just turned around and walked straight out, so nobody knew who she was, they're all looking 'round but she wasn't there;
she'd walked out.
A lot of people in my mother's life don't even know her previous life, so to speak, i.e. her job, and she's always kept it like that.
It was a time of her life, and things changed, and then she became a mother so things moved on, so if they do happen to find out, they are rather surprised, to say the least.
You know, some things are very personal, and I do respect the word privacy.
I like my own privacy, and I think even The Beatles, they're entitled to part of their lives that really people shouldn't invade.
Ritchie started going out with a girl called Mo Cox who was from Liverpool, she was a hairdresser, and we just got on very well together, Mo and I.
I think it was because she was just an ordinary girl from Liverpool.
Mo and Ritchie got married in '65, and then she had Zak in the September, I think.
I happened to be in London the day he was born, and I was in the office, and Ritchie called into the office, and he said, "I'm going to see Mo now, and Zak.
Do you wanna come with me?"
and I went "Oh yeah, yeah,"
So I think I was the second person to see Zak, soon after he was born.
John's girlfriend -- well, she was his wife when I got to know Cynthia -- she was out of the picture, she was very low key.
We were told -- but that we weren't to say anything -- that John was married.
Brian Epstein was sitting on it for as long as he could.
I even had a friend that was going out with John, and she would go to bookings and he would take her home, but I couldn't tell her that, "Oh please, end this now.
It's not gonna go anywhere."
You really want to say something.
You're dying to say something, because it is your friend, but you work for a company that have asked you not to say things, so you have given your word.
Freda had this Liverpool trait of loyalty in her love life and other people's love lives.
Relationships were amongst the top priorities of being personal things that you did not publicize.
You certainly did not kiss and tell.
I was out with Paul, walking somewhere, maybe he gave me a lift home or he walked me to the bus stop, somebody saw us, and then it was, you know, I was marrying Paul,
and then they got a quote
"Well, Paul McCartney is not marrying Freda Kelly."
When it was released that Paul had got married, because people didn't know that he was getting married, phone call after phone call was all Paul fans, crying down the phone,
"Why didn't you tell us he was getting married?"
"We didn't know he was getting married!"
and, oh, some of them that wanted to kill themselves, and "Oh, I'll never be a Paul McCartney fan again!
He's gone and married somebody else!"
so you just had to calm them down and say, "Well, you know, he's still Paul McCartney, he'll still be making his records,"
and they'd be "No no no, but he's got married now and it's not the same."
I do remember the guy from one of the papers.
He lived near me, you know, he knew what my job was -- that I was working for The Beatles -- and I remember him saying to me, could I tell him anything?
"Freda, you just have to put an envelope through my door with things written on it, and then there will be an envelope through your door."
This was just before George got married, 'cos I thought "Well I ain't telling ya that George is going to get married,"
but I just looked at him, and then I just said, "Oh no, I wouldn't do that."
Everybody needs money, and we all like money, or we'd like to have more money than we have, but not to that extent.
I'm not prepared to sell me soul to the devil for a few pounds.
That's just me though, isn't it?
You know everybody doesn't think like me.
Maybe some people think I'm silly or stupid or...
She was a girl and then a woman with absolute integrity and faithfulness.
So many otherpeople have, over the years, told, I would say, dirt digging type stories, and Freda never did do that and never would.
In the beginning, you know, I was just a fan and everything like that, but once I started working for them, the loyalty set in.
It wasn't there from day one, 'cos I'm just a seventeen-year-old, but then, as I'm maturing with them, the loyalty is setting in, and you don't break loyalty.
I think if you're loyal to something, you should stay loyal.
If she had to be tough, she would certainly be tough;
if she had to be sweet, she was sweet anyway, and she was intent on getting the facts right all the time, and lo and behold, if you didn't get the facts right, you were in her bad books,
and I wouldn't like to be in Freda's bad books.
I think that Freda's motto in life was "I'll be nice to you, but don't cross me.
I'll not deal with you, in fact, if you're trying to tell lies about my boys."
I was quite nervous around Freda, 'cos to me she was like an idol.
I was about 14, there was three of us worked together, oh it was just absolutely an amazing thing to do at the time, you know, to think that one of The Beatles could possibly walk in,
it was just-- oh, I just can't explain it now.
It was amazing at the time.
They would put photographs in envelopes and they would open certain letters, and then bring the letters in for me to answer, and I would really frank in the mail, and this particular day, one of the envelopes
that I put through the franking machine was a bit bulky, so I opened it, and when I opened it, there was hair fell out, and the girls were still in the office, and I just said, "What's going on here?"
She was absolutely livid.
I mean, being the innocent party,
I didn't know nothing about it, and then my friend Lorraine, she owned up and said it was her.
It materialized that she'd cut her sister's hair and put her sister's hair in the envelope and pretended it was going to be Paul's, and I just said, "Well, I just can't trust you after this."
I still remember thinking, "I've done nothing wrong, it wasn't my fault!"
I just done a clean sweep, didn't just sack the girl that done it,
I said, "That's it, sorry.
Can't trust you anymore."
That was the only time I've been sacked.
Wouldn't wanna live that day again, that's for sure.
It was horrible... awful day.
The thing about Freda is that if she found out that somebody was telling lies about somebody, it'd just be "Come here you," in front of everybody and she would castigate them right down the banks,
and so she's a bit judgmental, if you like, but so?
That's Freda.
The bottom line was, I had to run a tight ship --
I had to answer to Apple and to The Beatles, and if anything went wrong, it was my head that went on the chopping block, nobody else's.
It was August 1965, and The Beatles were playing on The Empire, and The Moody Blues were also on the bill, with them.
I had popped in to see the lads,
I just opened the door slightly and their band room was just full of relations, so I thought, "Oh, I'm never going to get in here,"
so, I was involved with one of The Moodys at the time, so I went into their dressing room, which was next door, that was just them and they had alcohol and drinks, so I decided to stay there for a drink,
but probably I stayed a bit longer than I shoulda done, and then I realized that I had to get autographs signed and photographs signed, so anyway,
I came back, knocked on the door, and I just walked in.
And as I walked in, John said to me, "Where have you been?"
And I said, "Oh, I've been next door,
I've been in the Moodys' dressing room,"
and he went, "Whose fan club secretary are you?"
and I went "What are you talking about?"
I said, "I'm your fan club secretary,"
and he went "Not anymore."
He said, "You might as well go back to The Moodys and be their fan club secretary,"
and I said "What are you talking about?" and he went "You're sacked."
And then I looked at the other three, so I said, "Are you sacking me as well?"
and they went, "No, we're not sacking you."
So I got on my high horse then, probably because of the drink, and I looked at him and I said,
"Well, I'll just work for the other three;
I won't do your mail anymore."
He said "Oh, I was only joking," I went, "No you weren't,"
and he went "Oh, I'm begging you, come back!"
and I said, "Well, I'll tell you what, get down on your two knees and beg me to come back, you dumped me."
He said, "If I get down on one knee?"
and I said, "Go on then, get down on one knee,"
and he did, and I said, "Oh, all right, I'll come back to you."
There has been quite a degree of loss in her lifetime which not many people have gone through, so, obviously, her mother dying when she was very young, my brother dying, then my mum and dad getting divorced...
A lot of people have gone under for less, and she hasn't.
She's a strong character, and she's come out fighting every time.
Over a period of time, people have said "Oh, why don't you do a book?"
or "You know, you should do a book,"
and my son did ask me -
- Timothy did ask me -- to do a few things, and I just-- it was because I never talked about The Beatles, or my past, and then something would come on the television and it would jog my memory, and I would say, "Oh, I went to that,"
or, "Oh, I remember the civic reception,"
or "I remember this," and Timothy used to say,
"But mum, you never talk about it,"
and I said, "Timothy, I haven't got time to talk about it.
I'm more interested in going to shops and thinking what to put on the table tonight for dinner, not to sit down and talk to you about The Beatles."
And he just shook it off, and then, when my grandson came along, I thought
"Well, I didn't do it for Timothy,"
and then Timothy passed away a few years ago, and then when Nial came along,
I thought, "Well, I'm definitely going to do it now."
Shh, I can hear the birdies singing, yeah, can you hear them singing?
You know, because one of these days, he might just look at me in the corner with the shawl and the grey hair and a cat sitting on me knee, and probably think, "Oh, you know,
she never done anything, or..."
I would like him to be proud of me and see how exciting my life was in the '60s, and the fun I had.
If I hadn't 'a done it now -- and this is the truth --
If I hadn't 'a done it now, I know I wouldn't ever have done it.
She could always say tomorrow, tomorrow, and she'll never sit down and sort it out.
When Nial was born, things definitely changed, and I think that when anybody has a child in that respect, it does open a lot of doors for people and changes their position in life in general, and you can suddenly reinvent yourself to a degree,
because Timothy isn't around now, and you don't know what tomorrow brings.
When they came back from America,
Brian Epstein decided then that we had to move to London, and you did, because in those days everything happened in London, wasn't happening up north.
We were planning on where we were going to live and what we were gonna do, and what clubs we would visit, and we were just -- all the excitement and the adrenaline was, ooh, we're going to the big city, the capital city.
So I went home and said, "Oh, well, I'm going to London, the fam's going to London, and I'm going to London with the fam and everything,"
and I'm all bubbly, and me father, he just sat in the chair and he was just listening, and he said, "London is a city of vice.
You're not going."
I knew I could go, you know, he couldn't stop me going, but when I started looking in me own mind, he wasn't very well at the time, so that's when I thought "No, I can't do this to me father.
A job's a job, even if it is The Beatles, a job's a job."
And that's why I handed in my notice.
He had a beautiful desk in the office, really big desk, he didn't even look up when I walked in,
I just stood in front of him, and I said, very quietly,
"I want to hand in my notice please."
He'd never heard that before, and he went,
"Don't you want to come to London?"
I said, "Oh, I desperately want to come to London,
I'd love to come to London,"
and I said, "But I can't come to London, 'cos me father won't allow me."
I know for a fact that Brian Epstein was seriously concerned, and I also know that the individual Beatles were most upset that she wasn't coming to London.
And then Eppy sent for me.
He said, "I've had a talk with the lads, and we don't want to you leave."
And I was just stunned.
He said, "I've had a word with your father, and you can come to London on a regular basis.
You stay up here."
And he said, "You can go back to NEMS, let me see it done, you can have my old offices in White Chapel."
And that was how I didn't leave.
Before they moved to London, I wanted to get their autographs, so, George was in this day, and I had autograph book upon autograph book for him to sign, and I slipped mine in the middle.
So he's signing them, and I'm saying, you know, "That's to Rita, that's to Barbara, that's to Steve, and he gets to mine, and he said
"Who's this to?" and I said, "Well, just sign that,"
'cos I just wanted it out of the way, and he went, "Well, no, who's it to?"
and I think it was because I was going,
"Oh, it doesn't matter, just sign it,"
and I remember saying to him, "Oh, just sign the book, just sign the book,"
and he flicked it to the front, and he went, "Is this yours?"
and I went, "Yeah, I haven't got your autograph,
I just want your autograph before you go to London."
So he signed it, and he pocketed it, he took it, and I went, "What are you doing with me book?"
and he went, "I'll get the others for ya."
And then next time he came in, he just threw it on the table, he went, "There you go." And they'd all put little comments in it.
Oh, Beatles Monthly.
Before the days of the internet and
Twitter and Facebook and everything, the way we got news to the fans was through the Beatles Monthlys.
I would get information from their parents, little gossipy snippets, I would also ask them what was going on, and little bits of juicy information from them, and I would put it in my newsletter, that was, in The Beatles Monthly.
Dear Beatle People,
I'd really like to thank each and every one of you who have sent presents for John's birthday.
John was really pleased that so many of you remembered him.
During his 10-day trip to America,
Paul looked in on a Beach Boys recording session.
Tarrah for now, Freda Kelly.
Dear Beatle People, July 1964 will go down in Beatle history as a hard day's month.
At last the first feature film starring our fabulous foursome is ready for showing, and will be coming to your local cinema quite soon.
At the beginning of March, you will see, Beatles at Shea Stadium Show, filmed in New York last August, when the boys starred in the largest-ever concert of their career before 57,000 fans.
Thank goodness the rumors about Paul are over.
Paul is still with us, and is likely to be with us for a long time.
Congratulations to Ringo and Maureen, who are expecting their second baby shortly after Maureen's next birthday.
George has been to the dentist again.
Dear Beatle People, after nearly four months of solid session work, the new LP, called
Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, is ready.
Beatles are hoping to acquire their own private recording studios at a secret location in central London.
New Beatles recording every week.
In one short period of just over four months, The Beatles have released no less than sixteen new recordings.
John hated his passport photograph so much that he tore it up and had a new picture taken.
Dear Beatle People, quite a lot of letters sent in discussed John, Cynthia, and Yoko Ono.
At least as many members have written about Paul and Jane.
Everyone has dozens of questions to ask, and many of you have only been too ready to put forward your opinions.
Here at the fan club, we believe that The Beatles deserve their separate and individual private lives, which should remain their business, and no other people's.
I am sure both John and Paul will work out their problems in their own ways, and I think they should be allowed to do so without the help or hindrance from millions of Beatle People.
Tarrah for now, Freda Kelly.
Over the years, we could see the effect that his job was having on Eppy.
It was taking its toll.
The odd time that I went to London and saw him, he was just changing, you know, you could just see things weren't right.
He became obsessed with trying out, initially, experimenting with drugs, and then becoming very reliant upon them, and becoming more and more of a mess.
The 27th of August, 1967, I was at home.
There was something up with our phone, and I know I had to use a neighbor's phone, and the neighbor came over to me and said, "There's a call for you, there's a girl, Pat, wants to talk to you,"
and Pat said, "Oh, have you heard about
Brian, have you heard about Brian?
He's just been found dead."
The media were on this one that he committed suicide, and I just didn't believe that he committed suicide.
Somebody said that he choked on his vomit, and I tend to believe that tale.
The Beatles were actually in Wales, they'd gone there to see the Maharishi, and they were informed there, and I just remember John, out of all of them, he was the one that was sorta stunned.
Although I was still young me self, I could still visualize the devastation that it was going to cause.
He was the anchor for everything, and it was just...
where do we all go from here?
What happens now?
So Paul had this meeting set for September the 1st, within a couple of days of Brian Epstein's very tragic, premature death, and when I got there, nobody else had arrived yet, and he said, "Before the others get here, I just want to tell you,
I think that if The Beatles do not get together and work together very very quickly now, the group is going to disintegrate."
Magical Mystery tour, it wasn't the best-organized thing, well, it wasn't organized, because Paul had a rough idea, but just a very rough idea.
This coach rolled up, and there was all different types of people milling around, like a guy dressed up as a bit of a clown, and he had a spotty, funny-type suit, and I thought "What's going on?"
and then this man -
- I didn't know him, I found out his name then, it was called Ivor Cutler -- and he come over to me and he just said to me, "You've got a nice-shaped head."
We all eventually got on the bus, and I dived for the back,
I thought, "Well, I'll go on the back seat, and, you know, you're not really seen on the back seat,"
and then Paul eventually got on the bus, and he sat by the driver, and then he called my name, and he went, "Freda, where are you?"
and I went, "I'm here, I'm on the back,"
and he went, "Can you come up the front?"
and I went, "Do I have to?" and he went, "Come up the front."
I thought, "Well, he's getting severe here now, do as you're told."
You couldn't book the hotels in The Beatles' names because they wouldn't have you, so you always had to book them under false names, and Neil was doing some of the hotels, and I said to him, "Why don't you book it in the Women's Institute
or the Catholic Women's League or something like that?"
and he went, "Oh, that's a good idea,"
so I had to go up to the counter in the hotel and say, "Hello, you've got a reservation in the name of the Women's Institute,"
and then they went, "Oh fine," I said, "Well, we're just come in now."
The shock on people's faces when we all trooped in -- because it was The Beatles, it was people dressed weird -- it was a very mixed bunch, very odd bunch, and I was one of them.
But where, I think, Paul was decided to do it there and then was 'cos it was so quickly after Brian Epstein's death.
He thought it might hold us all together, or hold them all together, but I don't think it worked.
That's just my opinion.
You know, you don't wanna think about that, you can be big-headed, and say,
"Yeah, we're gonna last ten years,"
but as soon as you've said that, you think
"We're lucky if we last three months."
Well obviously, we can't keep playing the same sort of music until we're about 40.
When I as at 40, we may not know how to write songs anymore.
I hope to have enough money to go into a business of my own by the time we do flop.
I've always fancied having a ladies' hairdresser.
I string them, in fact, and strut 'round in me stripes and me tails, you know, "Like a cup of tea, madam?"
The Beatles stopped touring in roughly 1966, I think, then Brian Epstein died in '67, and
Magical Mystery Tour was in '67, and Apple had started by then.
In the beginning, when Apple first opened, it was great:
the fun and the madness and all different nationalities in the press office.
People didn't act as if they were working in an office or a business, and then it became more settled down, more normal, and there wasn't as much fun.
I loved the beginning part of it, 'cos it was fun in the beginning, and it was fun for them, they enjoyed it so much.
Every group wants to be in the charts, or wants a hit record, or...
Everything was exciting in the beginning:
they got a number one, and then they were asked to appear on the Royal Command Performance, and they saw the queen, and they were a hit in America, and the civic reception, and it was all these landmarks,
and... where does it stop?
You can't keep carrying on like that, can you?
Towards the end of the '60s, it wasn't what The Beatles were doing as a group anymore, it was what they were doing individually.
I know Paul's was-- he was bringing out his own LP,
John and Yoko were doing the peace movement, and George was doing things, I think with Clapton, I can't remember,
Ritchie had two sons by then, and he was more interested in, sort of, a family life.
And then the penny was dropping with me, that we aren't gonna be Beatles as a group anymore.
Are you still the Beatles' fan club secretary?
How's business?
Fine, except for the post day.
They don't have a group anymore.
Well they've still got four members, haven't they?
I don't like to lie, but it was trying to bend the truth, when people were asking you questions about what was going on, you had to more or less say, "Well yes,
The Beatles are still together, and everything's great," but it wasn't great.
And now, what's the arrangement today?
Well last August, Paul rang me up and said he didn't want people to be writing about him as a Beatle, which I was doing, and he wanted to split this word, Beatles, up.
They are four individual people now, recording and everything, and we'll write all about Apple artists, so we're still writing about the four Beatles 'cos Paul is still an Apple artist.
Is the atmosphere today anything like it was ten years ago?
No, no.
What's missing?
The closeness.
It was all fun when we were teenagers, but your life changes, and my life had changed, I was then 27, I mean,
I was married now, had a baby son, and I wanted more children, and I was, we'll say, concentrating on that.
I then found out I was pregnant.
I'd been trying to get pregnant for a while;
I desperately wanted this baby, and I just wanted to make sure that everything was gonna be all right, so that was more important to me than my job, was my married life, my son, and the baby on the way,
and then that's when I thought, "Well, I'm out here."
I went to London, had a discussion with Neil Aspinall, the head of Apple, who was their road manager in the beginning, and George and Ritchie were there;
it was just-- that was all, I remember we were 'round a table.
I told them that I was pregnant, and they said,
"Well, do you think you would be going back to work?"
and I said, "I won't be going back to work, you know, I'll have two children then."
And then George finally spoke up and said, "Freda, you were there in the beginning, you're there at the end, let's call it a day.
Let's end the fan club."
You're still involved in the fan club?
Well, I'm sorta trying to wind it up.
This is what I wrote:
"Well, this is it.
John, Paul, George, and Ringo have each gone their separate ways, and they are no longer collectively an item.
There it is.
Eleven years.
Eleven years in which we have become a very strong, happy, and close circle of friends.
There will not be another official fan club for The Beatles as individual artists.
Please do not write again.
Yours faithfully, Freda Kelly."
I haven't read that since it went out.
I actually felt quite sad, reading it.
With me being a Beatle fan myself,
I just knew that this is going to break a lot of girls' hearts, so I musta put a lot of lights out for people.
Well, the lights went out, didn't they?
At the back of all this, I am still
-- or was -- am still a Beatle fan, so I do think the way they think.
We were still getting a lot of letters every day.
I took them all home with me, 'cos I couldn't leave them in the office, and although I said I wouldn't write again and I wouldn't answer any letters, between running my home and doing
the normal things a mother does,
I did answer the letters.
Slowly.
You know, I'd maybe do three one night,
I might do none the next night,
I might do five on the Saturday.
But it took me, on average, about three years to answer all those letters.
Once I ended the fan club, that was it.
I was then not Freda Kelly anymore, and I just lived a normal life like everybody else, nothing to do with The Beatles anymore.
When I look back, it is shocking how many people that have gone that I knew from those days.
Well, we lost Eppy first of all.
You've got the main two-- you've got John and George, you've got two wives-- Mo Cox, Linda McCartney, you've got all the parents, you've got Neil Aspinall,
Derek Taylor, my friend Laurie McCaffrey... it brings it home to me.
I think fame and money doesn't mean anything.
All the wealth doesn't cure cancer, does it?
I worked with a lot of good people, I did, I loved them.
Giving a job like that, to what became the biggest band in the world, to a girl of 17, that was an unbelievable thing to do, and she never let 'em down.
The tide washes the sea in every day.
Freda was the tide -- you saw the effects of the tide like you see the effects of Freda -- but you never actually see a tide as such, it just happens to be there, and Freda was, so tell the story.
I don't know why Eppy picked me.
Maybe it was just fate.
And I was taken along for this ten-year, exciting ride, and then dropped off on the corner where I started it.
You know, I'm not famous, I'm not wealthy,
I'm still working for a living, I'm still a Beatle fan, so although there's a 50-year gap since I started it,
I still like to think that I'm back where I was in the beginning.
I don't ever have to tell this tale again.
It's down now, on record, isn't it?
End of.
Peace and love.
My name is Ringo, and this is a message to all of Freda Kelly's grandchildren.
Freda was a great friend to The Beatles, she was the fan club leader, and we've known her for a long time.
Anyway, we all loved Freda.
She was great, and Freda was like part of the family, and she knew all our families, she was just one of the best.
Peace and love.
Peace and love.

Hello, this is John speaking with his voice.
We're all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic.
This record reaches you at the end of a really 'gear' year for us, and it's all due to you.
I'd like to say thank you to all of the Beatle people who have written to me during the year.
I'd love to reply personally to everyone, but I just haven't enough pens.
This is Paul here.
We're all dead pleased by the way you've treated us in 1963, and we're trying to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we write and record next year.
Well, I'm running out of my time and people are telling me to stop-- [all] Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop shouting those animals!
So I'll finish now with wishing everyone
Happy Crimble, and a merry new year.
Ya Ringo!
Hello, Ringo here.
As you know,
I was the last member to join The Beatles.
I started to play gongs in the group 1962.

Good old Freda!
So on behalf of us all, I'd just like to say a great big "thank you"--
♪ Beatles a cappella:
Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer
[Freda] I was just a secretary then, and, funny enough, I'm still a secretary now, and who would want to hear the secretary's story?
♪
[Freda] Millions of girls around the world wanted this dream job:
they wanted to be the secretary.
She epitomized all their dreams and all their hopes, and all these girls wanted to be Freda Kelly and to be that close to The Beatles.
Well, I didn't expect to talk, maybe grab one of them, but I wouldn't hurt 'em, I wouldn't hurt 'em,
I'd just talk to them maybe, but I wouldn't, you know, grab like everybody says they're gonna cut their hair and everything.
We wouldn't do that!
[Bill Kinsley] If you look at what is history now,
The Beatles were together ten years.
Freda worked for The Beatles for eleven.
She was there right before they made it, and right after they finished, so that says it all, basically.
Tell me, when you hear a Beatles record, what thoughts run through your mind?
Beauty, sheer beauty.
The Beatles bring joy into the world.
They're happiness.
We forget our cares when we hear Beatle records.
[man] Freda was far more than a secretary to the Beatles;
she was a family member.
She's never had the same recognition that a number of people within the inner circle have had, simply because she never pushed herself, she never wrote a book, never agreed to do interviews
She's always kept a very very confidential existence.
[fan] We came here at 6 o'clock in the morning, 5:30, to see them and all they do is push you farther and farther away and then they don't even let you see them!
A lot of people didn't take these girls seriously, but I did, because, you know,
I was one of them -- I was a fan me-self.
So I knew where they were coming from.
We grew up with them.
You know, they started when they were younger and we were younger.
And all through these years, we've just developed with them and grown up with them, and they belong to us, you know?
But there could never be another Beatles.
Never.
[woman] She's one of the last survivors of the whole Beatles era, and you know, this story of Freda Kelly's will be, surely, one of the last true stories of the Beatles that you'll ever really hear.
[Freda] I've been a secretary for half a century, fifty years, and that's quite frightening.
This job is interesting, but it's not as exciting as my last job.
I don't get the phone calls that I did in the 60's, like, you know, an invite to a premiere, you know, "Roy Orbison's having a party and we've managed to get a few tickets,
do you want to come to that Fre?"
And I'm:
"Yeah OK, I'm on the next train!" ♪ [xylophone music]
I left school when I was sixteen, and my first job was at a firm called Prince's.
I was in the middle of a typing pool, which is rows of secretaries just typing away.
The lads from different levels of law would come down and give me work to do, but most of my day was just spent typing contracts, typing letters -- it wasn't the most glamorous of jobs,
but I was a working woman now.
♪ [indie rock music]
[Freda] One day, two guys from upstairs came down and came over to my desk and just said "Come on Freda, we're going to take you out for lunch."
I didn't know where I was going, and I ended up in The Cavern.
Now, I'd never been to The Cavern before,
I didn't even know what I was going into, because it was a cellar.
It had a unique smell:
there was no ventilation, and sometimes the toilets overflowed, and it was opposite a fruit market, so it was probably a mixture of disinfectant, rotten fruit, and sweat all rolled into one.
There was three archways, and in the middle archway was wooden seats, all different types of wooden seats, they weren't all in rows and all the same.
There was a little wooden stage at the back, and The Beatles were playing on the stage when I first walked in.
And I'd never experienced anything like that -- it was everything about them, it was just the way they dressed, with all this leather gear, they were larking about, and dancing on stage, and mucking about with the audience,
and on top of everything else, there was the music.
It was just unlike anything I'd ever heard.
I was hooked.
I just was amazed by everything I saw, and I thought "That's it, I'm going to go tomorrow."
Well I think it's put down that they played something silly like 294 times.
Out of that, I would say, I probably saw them about 190 times.
♪ [rock music]
[Bill Kinsley] Freda was definitely a staple of The Cavern, she was always there, and she always sat in the same seat.
[Freda] I used to like the second arch on the left hand side, because it was just that handy.
You could pop in and out the band room all the time.
There was about two rows in the front, they would leave their rollers in until before the lads would come onstage, and then they'd take their rollers out and doll theirselves up and everything.
It was conversation all the time with the audience.
Somebody came in, a different hairstyle, they'd pick on them.
They'd go "Have you been the hairdresser's?"
or "Who got you up this morning?" [laughter]
But he answered them back.
They liked the razzmatazz between you and them.
People used to write down a number, give it to them, and ask them would they right play that number.
Now, if you gave it to John, Paul always went over to John and leaned over his shoulder and read the request out.
I thought "Can John read, or--?"
He looked pretty arrogant, to be honest-- he'd look at the crowd like that as if he was going to kill everyone in the crowd.
And then I mentioned it to somebody and they said "Oh, no, no, John's as blind as a bat.
He wears glasses and he never wears his glasses, so he can't see further than his nose."
I liked George singing Three Cool Cats, I loved that one.
Or The Sheik of Araby, because he used to do a little dance and I liked him doing the little dance.
He used to sort of kick his feet along the stage.
[laughter]
A few times I rang Paul up, because one of my friends fancied him and I wanted him to sing for her.
We used to just dial Garston and then the number 6922.
He'd say "Hello," and you'd go, "Oh hi Paul, it's Freda.
It's Linda Shepherd's birthday on such-and-such a day, can you play Love of the Loved for her?"
"Yeah, okay."
I got to know them personally through just talking to them, going in the band room, because when they came off-stage, they used to either sit in the band room, talking to different people who ever came in,
and then you would just sit by them, and you would just ask them where they were playing, or how come you weren't here yesterday.
Paul was always nice and always friendly, and any time you'd ask Paul to sing something, he would do it.
John... a man of many moods.
It depended on what side of the bed he got out in in the morning.
He could be really grumpy, but he was always himself, he never put an act on.
People say George was the quiet Beatle, and I suppose he was in one way, but he was never quiet with me.
He was more quietly-spoken, I think, than the others.
He was very thoughtful.
Ringo hadn't joined the group yet;
Pete Bass was on the drums.
Pete was very shy, and he was also very handsome, so he had a big following around town, from the girls.
They loved Pete.
They all lived my way home, on the south side of Liverpool, and Paul and George had cars, and then they'd say "Do you want a lift home?"
My father wasn't keen on them, he saw them and what he saw he didn't like.
If they'd had suits on, or somebody had a suit with a collar and tie, he probably would've approved of them, but he didn't approve of The Beatles.
♪ [worn vinyl sensual music]
But I was always late back from work,
I was always pushing and puffing and panting and sitting down and starting to type.
I couldn't say I was somewhere else or I got held up in a restaurant or trying to get some food because I had the Cavern smell on me, so they knew exactly where I'd been.
The girls in the typing pool had photographs up on the wall of Pat Boone and Elvis and Tommy Steele and Cliff Richard, and I didn't like any of them, so I found a little picture of The Beatles,
but it was only dead small, and I remember putting it up on the wall, and the personnel manager caught me when I was putting it up on the wall, Mr. Mold, and he said,
"Oh, what are you doing, who are they?"
and I said "Oh, they're The Beatles,"
and he went "Who's The Beatles?"
and I said "They're a Liverpool group,"
and he went "Never heard of them,"
and I said "Oh, you will one day."
Bobbie Brown was the girl who went to The Cavern and started a fan club for The Beatles.
Now, I couldn't understand why The Beatles had a fan club, because they were just a local group, but I eventually ended up helping Bobbie, and then Bobbie got a boyfriend and lost interest in running the Beatles fan club,
so I took over from there.
I was buying stamps and salve in the beginning, and I remember being in the band room one day lunch time and saying to Paul, "You owe me seven six for stamps,"
and he went "I haven't any money."
And then Bob Waller paid them, and I sat in the band room until Bob Waller paid them, and I said "You've now got money."
So he give him his due and paid me.
I just had this faith -- and there wasn't just me -- you just knew they were going to be famous one day, but I couldn't visualize the fame that they got.
To me, being famous was playing on The Empire, having a record in the charts.
Cliff Richard was big in those days, and being as big as Cliff Richard, that was as far as my vision went.
[Billy] Everything was new, nobody knew what was going to happen.
People who ever say to you, "We knew they were going to be a success,"
they're lying through their teeth.
Nobody knew it was going to be the world phenomenon that it became.
♪ [music]
I got to know Brian Epstein through The Beatles.
I was going to see The Beatles all the time, and then Brian Epstein started to come to see them and that's how we became friendly.
Everybody in Liverpool knew who he was, because he was manager of NEMS Ltd., the biggest record shop in the north of England.
I do remember it was by St. Barnabas's Hall in Penny Lane, it was a Saturday night, I walked in,
I just know Eppy coming up to me, and he then told me that he was signing The Beatles and he was starting his own firm and he needed a secretary.
Then he said, did I want to come and work for them, and I said "Oh, go on then." I just remember saying, "Oh go on then."
And I was so excited because I was starting my dream job, working for The Beatles.
[Tony Barrow] I think what Brian Epstein saw was somebody who was a fan without being an over-the-top fanatic.
I would call her more of an admirer;
she appreciated The Beatles, and that fitted perfectly, I mean,
Freda was there on the scene and ready to take over.
We had a lot of respect for Brian, obviously, we thought he was really posh, you know, we were all Liverpool screw-offs really, but Brian was very posh, and for him to choose Freda to be the secretary,
we thought "Hey, wow, she must have something,"
you know, he could have picked anybody.
That's when I had to tell home, 'cos I didn't want to tell home, 'cos I just knew the reaction.
My mother died when I was eighteen months, and she died of cancer.
I had a good relationship with my father, but also he was very protective towards me because I was his only child.
I was 17, so I managed to pluck up the courage this particular night at tea time, and I just said casually "I'm starting a new job on Monday."
And I do remember him saying "Has it got anything to do with The Beatles?"
and I just blanked it, I must have turned it back 'cos I know I didn't lie, but I didn't answer the question, and all I remember was the teapot going down with a big slam.
[Freda] We used to call him Daddy Eppy;
he was Brian Epstein's father, and it was his business.
We were on the top floor of his shop.
The first floor was what we used to call the "white goods":
it was televisions and washing machines and things like that, and then on the second floor, that was Brian Epstein's office, and then there was a store room behind his office, so I worked in the store room.
They changed that into an office for me.
In the beginning, the lads were in the office nearly every single day, you know, they just popped in and out.
They would sit by my desk for a chat or while they were waiting to go into Eppy's office, so I got to know them more.
I was 17, so naturally I did have crushes on them.
The way I describe it, and this is the truth, if Paul looked nice or sang a song for me or something,
I was in love with Paul that day, I fancied him that day, but then the following day, if Ritchie asked me how me dogs were
(because he knew I had Yorkshire Terriers, he'd say "Oh, how are the dogs?")
I'd think "Oh, yeah, I fancy Ritchie,"
and then I think, if George offered me a lift home from work,
I'd be in love with George that day, and I'd think "Yeah, yeah, I definitely fancy George."
But then if John came in and started talking about various things,
I'd think "I like his nose, I like the Roman nose,"
but it would only be for a day or two.
Did you go out with any of them?
No.
Pass.
No stories there?
Oh, there is stories, but I don't want anybody's hair falling out or turning curly.
That's personal.
It was the end of a working day, and Eppy just came in and said,
"Come on Freda, put your coat on,
I'm going to take you somewhere."
I had no idea where.
And next minute we were at The Empire, and then next minute we were in the box,
I'd never been in the box of The Empire.
It was this one on the left.
He'd managed to get The Beatles a spot on the Little Richard show, and I think somebody was sick or something and he'd managed to get them on.
And I remember sitting in the box, it was just Eppy and I, and I was to the left, and then I looked down on the stage and the whole theatre and the stage were in darkness,
except for this light shining on Paul's face, and he was singing A Taste of Honey.
I don't cry, but my eyes sort of filled up and I just couldn't believe that The Beatles were on The Empire, the biggest theatre in Liverpool, and I thought "This is it.
They've made it.
They're going to be famous one day."
♪ [harmonica music]
The Beatles' first hit, as far as I'm concerned, was Love Me Do, I mean,
I was one of the ones that bought it, and I didn't have a record player, and there was loads of girls like me that didn't have record players, but we bought it just to boost the sales.
You didn't have pop stations then, but we had one station called Radio Luxembourg, and they used to do the charts, and I remember staying up late, sitting by the radio, holding the knob,
trying to keep it on the same wavelength, and waiting to hear The Beatles' record.
And when it got to 17, that was amazing.
I know it only stayed the week, I think, but it didn't matter.
They were in the charts.
I was working for Brian Epstein, doing a normal day-job, but I also had to do the fan club overnight.
Silly me, I gave out my home address as the fan club address.
The postman knocked on the door and he said to me, "Who gave this address out?
You've got 200 letters here."
And I said, "Sorry, won't do it again time."
Little did he know, within the next few months The Beatles became more famous, and instead of just 200 letters, they were coming in bundles, and those bundles came in sacks, so the van rolled up.
My father wasn't keen on The Beatles anyway, and his own personal mail, you know, your telephone bill, electricity bill, your gas bill, all in the fan mail.
So he just looked at me and said,
"You've got to put a stop to this.
What possessed you to give our home address out?"
I didn't think at the time.
My mother has never played the fame game.
If she had, things would be completely different now, and she might not be working six days a week
9 'til 5 o'clock at night, very stressed, when other people have retired, and she hasn't got that joy.
These are all Christmas decorations.
Oh, success.
I kept a couple of scrapbooks with theatre tickets in, and newspaper cuttings in.
A few fan club letters.
Yeah, they're old.
I think it's records, and, oh, me scrapbook.
Yeah.
Cuttings book.
I mean I have a lot of these.
I don't know.
Forty years since Rachel was born.
I could have been a very very wealthy woman, could be a millionairess if I'd have kept everything.
I had loads of autographs, photographs, all the fan club stuff, Apple stuff, fan club records, but over a period of time, I gave it all away.
But I don't regret that, because I know when I gave the majority of the stuff away,
I gave it in 1974, and I actually handed the stuff to Beatle fans myself, so I knew the Beatle fans got all the fan club stuff that was left.
I've got these four boxes anyway.
I didn't even think I had four boxes.
As I'm flicking through, there are so many memories coming back to me.
I'll just pick something up, and I'll remember that day.
Oh, this is George Harrison's real hair.
♪ [rock and roll music]
A few months after Love Me Do, the lads had their first number one hit, which was Please Please Me.
We were gradually getting letters, from 50 a day, 200 a day, to my home, and then it worked up to about 800 a day, and then eventually we didn't even count them, we just threw the mail in the corner.
I would put loads of photographs in front of them, and they would go in to Eppy, and they would take the photographs in with them, and while they were talking to Eppy, they were all signing.
But they never complained about signing things, never ever.
I think it was because it was early days and they were all excited by it all, so nothing was a problem.
Out of all The Beatles, I'd say George was the best one for signing things.
He would come in and he'd go,
"Do you want me to sign anything?
What have you got in your cupboard?"
The Beatles called him Eppy, we all did, but to his face, he asked us to call him Mr. Brian in the office.
He was the boss so it was Mister.
He had an aura about him.
I know he was probably only 27 then, but he was old.
Ten years was a big difference in those days, where I'm 17, he's 27.
He came from a well-off family and he had nice clothes and spoke with a posh accent, so you had respect for him.
He threw a few tantrums in the office, and you just kept out of his way.
Well, I did.
Probably that's why I lasted ten years.
Some people didn't, or retaliated, and they were sacked on the spot.
He was the boss, and he was the boss.
Brian Epstein was notorious for his dreadful tantrums.
He would hire and re-fire his top executives at the drop of a hat.
Freda was sort of immune, if you like, to the temper tantrums.
She was never hurt by them.
♪ [music]
We had a new dictaphone, and he gave me this tape to do while he was out, and I'd done about two letters and the tape got stuck.
So Neil Aspinall came in and I said,
"Oh God, I've got this tape and I've got it stuck, and there's a load of work on it."
We pressed two things, and we erased all the work.
He came in the office, and I just saw John at the back of him, and he went to hang up the coat, and he said, "Have you finished the tape?"
and I just said "No.
I'm sorry, no.
I've wiped it by mistake."
He just looked at me, and then shouted "You stupid girl!"
and John Lennon saved the day, because he was behind me, and he must have seen how shaken I was, and Eppy about to erupt.
He started laughing, and going "Oh, what have you done, Kelly?"
and when a Beatle laughed, Eppy laughed.
But it wasn't a proper laugh.
He wasn't amused at all.
And I just remember looking at him and saying "I'll stay late to do it."
and he said, "I know you will, you'll definitely stay late, until all this work is done."
I was very naive for my age;
I just came into the music business when I was 17, up until I was 16, I'm camping with the Guides and things like that.
Once I joined the Beatles organization,
I grew up overnight in more ways than one, and I remember saying to John,
"You know what?
I don't know what it is about him--"
I said "I can't put me finger on it,"
and I know I was rabbiting on for England, and John started laughing, and then he went "Have you no idea?"
and I said, "No idea about what?"
He put it to me very innocently, and I always respect him for that, he said, "Well let's say this, Fre, if you're on a desert island with him, you'd be safe."
And the penny dropped.
Where nowadays it's legal, and quite rightly so, but in those days they had a lot to put up with.
Probably that had a lot to do with his mood-swings as well, and trying to keep it from his parents and other people.
The music industry was a man's industry in the '60s.
In The Beatles' circle, there wasn't any high-ranking women.
Women, or girls, worked on the admin side, but the highest you can go in admin is just be secretary to the main guy.
I was secretary to Brian Epstein, but there wasn't a hard road to climb, you just had to stay there.
There was a lot to get done, so anybody that came into the office,
I would put them to work.
I would get them slicing' the envelopes, tearin' the foreign stamps off, stickin' photographs in envelopes, and groups around town
-- because they never had any money, musicians around town -- they used to come into my office for a free cup of tea, or if it was raining, or to hear the records, so while they were sitting there,
nobody sat there doing nothing.
They all used to help out.
I bumped into the lead singer of
The Cryin' Shames, Ritchie Routledge, and he had a big post bag on his back, and I said "Where are you going?"
he said, "I'm going to the post office,"
I said "What for?", he said, "I've got all The Beatles' vinyl stuff in the bag, Freda told me -- not asked me, told me -- to go and post it."
She just had this way about her, a bit like a schoolteacher really.
You know, you had to do what the schoolteacher said, and you had to do what Freda said, really.
Well, you didn't have to do it, you wanted to do it for her, 'cause she'd just give you a little smile, and you did it.
When Ringo first joined the band
-
- I think he was only in the band about two weeks or something --
I came into the office, he said
"I'm getting letters to my house, and if I bring them in, will you do them?"
And I went "No, I won't," I said, "I've got too much to do."
I said "Get your mother to do it, you know all the other parents do,"
and he went "Oh, me mum doesn't know what to do."
He put the sad eyes on, and just like
"Oh, go on, please?
You know, I don't get many."
To shut him up I went "Oh go on then, bring them in."
He brought about nine letters in this little poly bag, and he actually put the answers to the questions that they'd asked in the letters on the top of the letter to help me, 'cos he said to me, "If you don't know the answers
I've put the answers down for you and everything."
He must have thought I was terrible, 'cos I looked at him and I said to him "Is this all you get?"
I couldn't believe-- he must have wanted to shoot me, and I went, "You've only got nine letters."
He said, "Will you help me?
Will you come and show me mum what to do?"
I ended up going 'round, knocking on 10 Admiral Grove, and Elsie opened the door, and I said, "I'm Freda from the office,"
and she went, "Oh, thank God for that, come in, love, come in."
And I said, "Well, I've just brought stuff for you, to show you what to do."
She said, "Have you had any tea?"
And I said "No," and she went, "Would you like egg and chips?"
and I said, "Oh, I'd love egg and chips, yeah."
And then we started talking, and we got on like a house on fire.
Every week, for years, I went to that house.
Will the neighbors not become envious of all the wealth that's been accumulated by the Beatles?
No, not the neighbors 'round here, they're all very good and all quite proud.
Comin' back now, just everything is flashing in me head about just how much joy and happiness and laughter went on in this house.
I had a great time here.
I loved it,
I loved coming here every week.
It's probably...
I haven't been in this house for about 46 years.
I spent a lot of my life here.
I used to stay 'til about 1 or 2 in the morning, going through the mail, and talking, and laughing, things about my life as well, and who I was going out with at the time.
And it's not one of The Beatles, before you start.
Elsie'd give me advice, motherly advice.
She was very jolly, very outgoing, and a really strong laugh.
I told her all my secrets when I was a teenager.
Maybe she looked on the daughter that she didn't have, maybe she looked on me as that.
She decided I wasn't getting enough money, wages, and she was at a party, and Eppy was there, and then she, few drinks down, and then she starts in on him and said "You don't know what you've got there,
you've got a good worker there."
And she was going on and on, and I was going "Well, shut up."
And she was going, "You should pay her some more money, you know.
You don't pay her enough money.
You should give her a rise."
I really got a rise, two weeks later.
His words were, "We've reviewed your wages, Freda, and we've decided to give you a rise."
Well, you asked me about a mother figure before -- she was the nearest to a mother figure for me.
I just adored her.
Once The Beatles were in London and criss-crossing the globe,
Freda became probably the link between the Beatles' families in Liverpool and each individual Beatle.
I was surprised when I met her, because I thought, to have taken on this mammoth, ridiculous job, she must have been some 50-year-old, settled-in-her-ways old secretary with bad feet and a large bosom, but she was anything but:
she was vivacious and fun and just a snip of a teenager, this young, thin girl.
I suppose you could say that The Beatles saw her as a sister, and the families saw her as a daughter.
NEMS used to close on a Wednesday afternoon, but I never told home that I was off on a Wednesday afternoon.
We used to go out with Paul's dad, we used to call him Uncle Jim, we used to go to a place called the Bassnett Bar.
He was trying to educate me on liqueurs and cheeses and coffee and things like that.
Well, I would stay there and get sozzled, you know, 'cos I'd be trying all these different things with them, and then they would just put me in a taxi and I'd go home and go straight to bed.
Now, John's family...
he only had Mimi.
Mimi was John's aunt.
She took John in when he was about five, when his parents split up.
Mimi didn't let anybody in that house;
very few people got in.
You had to go 'round the back, you know, like the tradesmen's entrance, but I actually went up and knocked on the front door, and I got in the front door.
It wasn't that you were frightened of Mimi, you just watched your Ps and Qs.
To me, Mimi was like my father, she was old-school.
Any time I saw her with John, which wasn't very often, she was quite stern but he did obey her.
I think the Harrisons enjoyed the fame more than any of the other parents.
Mr. and Mrs. Harrison loved it.
They took to it more.
She was excellent with the fans, would let them into her house, would give them a cup of tea, you know, every day, she just sat down and wrote letters to all these kids.
But they were very protective of George, maybe it was because he was the youngest Beatle.
Mr. Harrison -
- Harry Harrison -- was always saying to me,
"You should learn to dance properly,"
and I said "I don't wanna learn ballroom dancing, I don't really like it,"
and he said "No, I'm going to teach you."
He would get me up to dance and show me how to do the quick-step and the waltz and everything.
So we were like there-
- I was really self-conscious about it,
I just did not want to learn to ballroom dance.
You know, all the families and all the boys believed in her.
She was 'good old Freda' to them, in other words.
♪ [music]
Seeing them on a regular basis, coming in and out the office, going to their homes, it didn't hit me how big they were or worshipped they were until the civic reception, which was at the Town Hall in Liverpool.
The only people that were invited really were The Beatles themselves and The Beatles' families, and that was it, but Ritchie's family put me down as one of their family.
We were picked up in a car from the counsel, we must have come in the back way, and the lads were already here, and we had a meal, so we were all relaxed and everything,
and then next minute, they then had to go out onto the balcony and, just as they opened these doors, the noise hit us, with the shouts and the screaming, [crowd screaming] and then I came to behind the door here
and I just couldn't believe Castle Street.
♪ [music] [crowd screaming]
It was just full of people;
as far as the eye could see was people, everywhere.
I mean, the noise was deafening, there was chaos in the street, girls were wriggling and pushing to get through the crowd, and they were fainting, and the ambulance men and police were just passing them over the crowds
to get them into the ambulance.
It was unbelievable.
[crowd screaming and chanting]
I think the penny actually dropped with me then, how big they were, 'cos it hadn't really hit home until I saw that amount of people, it was about 200,000 people -- I couldn't even visualize 200,000 people
until I saw it that day.
I think now, and I think the parents must have been so proud of 'em, that their sons were out on the balcony, and Liverpool was reacting to them.
I'm very proud that I worked for them.
[interviewer] So what was Beatlemania to you at the height of it, when it was its busiest, what, 1964, '65?
[Freda] No sleep with all the mail.
[interviewer] How many letters a week were you getting, roughly?
[Freda] Oh, God, thousands, two to three thousand a day.
Must have sat up 'til 4, 5 o'clock in the morning just answering -- I used to do all what we call detail letters --
I used to just bring all them home and then go back to work with me little parcel the next day.
I don't know how I lived.
♪ [music]
In the wake of the outbreak of Beatlemania, there was a very very sudden increase in interest amongst fans, people writing in, asking for autographs, asking to join the Beatles fan club, etc.
Brian Epstein decided that we would have a stamp.
It looked like a proper signature.
And I remember, sometimes, I would roll it across the autograph book, and only half of it would turn out, or it would smudge.
I ruined so many kids' autograph books.
And of course, I'm a Beatle fan, so I'm thinking the way they're thinking, and I thought "I'd go mad if that was me."
I know I was against them and John Lennon was against them as well,
I think he thought because of the falseness.
I remember John coming in, and I asked him to sign something, and he said, "I did that,"
"You don't normally sign it that way,"
and he said "I've decided to sign that way from now on,"
and I said, "Is that because our stamps look like you wrote the signature?"
He went "Yeah."
In the end, I thought, "Oh, I'm dumping them."
I never told Eppy, I just thought, "Right,
I'll just keep all these autograph books and photographs in the cupboard, and when the lads come in, I'll still carry on."
I would know when they were staying at home in their own houses,
I would know in advance that, oh, George is coming home tonight, so I'll nab him, I'll go from the office straight to Mackets Lane, so I would go 'round and get them to sign stuff in their own house,
say, "Oh, while you're sitting there, watching the telly, do us a favor.
Can you just sign that bagful?"
So, if some of the fans, especially in the foreign countries, they didn't have the address of the fan club, so they just knew that they lived in England somewhere, so they would just put 'To Paul McCartney'
or 'To George Harrison, England,' but it would come through the system.
The post office, give them their due, were very good, they just knew where the fan club existed.
♪ [music]
The type of questions kids would ask in the fan club letters was, you know,
'Can I have a piece of Paul's shirt?
' or 'If I send you a map, can you ask
Paul to come 'round at 6 o'clock?
Because I'm having a party and I'd like him to come.'
But then it got a bit out of hand, because then people wanted hair, and it was the same barber that cut their hair, it was always this one guy.
I mean, it was their hair, they'd probably do DNA on it now.
He would have a mat down on the floor or something, and cut their hair... 'cos he thought I was mental.
And he'd just say "There you go, do you want that bit?"
I'd go "Yeah, yeah, thanks."
Somebody sent a pillowcase in and said "Can you get Ritchie to sleep on this pillowcase and then send it back to me and get him to sign it?"
I must have known that he was going to be home for three days, so I just threw that in the bag and took it to his house and said, "Will you sleep on that tonight and sign it then?"
And I remember saying to Elsie -- that was his mum --
"Can you make sure he sleeps on it?"
Anyway, he brought it in, just said "Here,"
and then I just sent it out again-- whether she believed me or not that he'd slept on it, but he did, he put his head on that pillow.
Honestly, if I could do it, I would do it, 'cos I was one of them, I was a fan me self, so I knew where they were coming from.
There was one particular fan that stowed away on a ship from America to Liverpool docks, finished up on our doorstep.
Freda had many episodes like that to deal with, of fans that were just crazy.
♪ [music]
They would just open the mail and flip through the mail, and go "Oh, this kid wants such and such,"
or "This girl wants a piece of my shirt,"
they'd just laugh, and I said, "Oh, just leave it there, 'cos I've got a bit of your shirt," and they'd go "Good."
When I typed the wages, the balance went in the bank Fordham, and they all got 50 pound in an envelope, cash, for them to play around with whatever way they wanted.
Now, I used to take that money sometimes:
if they didn't come in that week, Eppy'd just say to me,
"Now you go to one of the bookings."
I knew they were playing at The Empire and I was trying to get through the crowd, and in those days, policemen were always big, and this guy was a big guy and he was on a horse
and I was trying to wriggle through the crowd, and I just said to him, "I need to get into The Empire."
He just blanked me.
And I said "No, no, I work for them, honestly, I've got their wages,
I need to get into The Empire."
And he went, "You and thousands of others.
Hop it."
Which one is this?
Oh, it's a Beatle one.
My mum is the most private person I've ever met in my life.
She would never sit down and put dinner on the table and discuss just idle chitter-chatter about what's gone on with The Beatles in the past, or anything like that.
That's just not her nature.
You know, Freda, unless you knew her, you would never know what she's done, 'cos she never tells anybody at all.
We did a gig the other month in New Brighton and Freda was in the audience.
I saw her come in, and I was on the microphone,
I said "I'd like to welcome Freda Kelly, The Beatles' secretary,"
and she just turned around and walked straight out, so nobody knew who she was, they're all looking 'round but she wasn't there;
she'd walked out.
A lot of people in my mother's life don't even know her previous life, so to speak, ie. her job, and she's always kept it like that.
It was a time of her life, and things changed, and then she became a mother so things moved on, so if they do happen to find out, they are rather surprised, to say the least.
You know, some things are very personal, and I do respect the word privacy.
I like my own privacy, and I think even The Beatles, ...they're entitled to part of their lives that really people shouldn't invade.
♪ [acoustic guitar and birds chirping] ?
Ritchie started going out with a girl called Mo Cox who was from Liverpool, she was a hairdresser, and we just got on very well together, Mo and I.
I think it was because she was just an ordinary girl from Liverpool.
Mo and Ritchie got married in '65, and then she had Zak in the September, I think.
I happened to be in London the day he was born, and I was in the office, and Ritchie called into the office, and he said, "I'm going to see Mo now, and Zak.
Do you wanna come with me?"
and I went "Oh yeah, yeah,"
So I think I was the second person to see Zak, soon after he was born.
John's girlfriend -- well, she was his wife when I got to know Cynthia -- she was out of the picture, she was very low key.
We were told -- but that we weren't to say anything -- that John was married.
Brian Epstein was sitting on it for as long as he could.
I even had a friend that was going out with John, and she would go to bookings and he would take her home, but I couldn't tell her that, "Oh please, end this now.
It's not gonna go anywhere."
You really want to say something.
You're dying to say something, because it is your friend, but you work for a company that have asked you not to say things, so you have given your word.
Freda had this Liverpool trait of loyalty in her love life and other people's love lives.
Relationships were amongst the top priorities of being personal things that you did not publicize.
You certainly did not kiss and tell.
I was out with Paul, walking somewhere, maybe he gave me a lift home or he walked me to the bus stop, somebody saw us and then it was, you know, I was marrying Paul,
and then they got a quote
"Well, Paul McCartney is not marrying Freda Kelly."
When it was released that Paul had got married, because people didn't know that he was getting married, phone call after phone call was all Paul fans,crying down the phone,
"Why didn't you tell us he was getting married?"
"We didn't know he was getting married!"
and, oh, some of them that wanted to kill themselves, and "Oh, I'll never be a Paul McCartney fan again!
He's gone and married somebody else!"
so you just had to calm them down and say, "Well, you know, he's still Paul McCartney, he'll still be making his records,"
and they'd be "No no no, but he's got married now and it's not the same."
I do remember the guy from one of the papers.
He lived near me, you know, he knew what my job was -- that I was working for The Beatles --
I remember him saying to me, could I tell him anything?
"Freda, you just have to put an envelope through my door with things written on it, and then there will be an envelope through your door."
This was just before George got married, 'cos I thought "Well I ain't telling ya that George is going to get married,"
but I just looked at him, and then I just said, "Oh no, I wouldn't do that."
Everybody needs money, and we all like money, or we'd like to have more money than we have, but not to that extent.
I'm not prepared to sell me soul to the devil for a few pounds.
That's just me though, isn't it?
You know everybody doesn't think like me.
Maybe some people think I'm silly or stupid or...
She was a girl and then a woman with absolute integrity and faithfulness.
So many other people have, over the years, told, I'd say, dirt digging type stories, and Freda never did do that and never would.
In the beginning, you know, I was just a fan and everything like that, but once I started working for them, the loyalty set in.
It wasn't there from day one, 'cos I'm just a 17-year-old, but then, as I'm maturing with them, the loyalty is setting in, and you don't break loyalty.
I think if you're loyal to something, you should stay loyal.
If she had to be tough, she would certainly be tough;
if she had to be sweet, she was sweet anyway, and she was intent on getting the facts right all the time, and lo and behold, if you didn't get the facts right, you were in her bad books,
and I wouldn't like to be in Freda's bad books.
I think that Freda's motto in life was "I'll be nice to you, but don't cross me.
I'll not deal with you, in fact, if you're trying to tell lies about my boys."
♪ [music]
I was quite nervous around Freda, 'cos to me she was like an idol.
I was about 14, there was three of us worked together, oh it was just absolutely an amazing thing to do at the time, you know, to think that one of The Beatles could possibly walk in,
it was just-- oh, I just can't explain it now.
It was amazing at the time.
[Freda] They would put photographs in envelopes and they would open certain letters, and then bring the letters in for me to answer, and I would really frank in the mail, and this particular day, one of the envelopes
that I put through the franking machine was a bit bulky, so I opened it, and when I opened it, there was hair fell out, and the girls were still in the office, and I just said, "What's going on here?"
She was absolutely livid.
I mean, being the innocent party,
I didn't know nothing about it, and then my friend Lorraine, owned up and said it was her.
It materialized that she'd cut her sister's hair and put her sister's hair in the envelope and pretended it was going to be Paul's,
I just said, "Well, I just can't trust you after this."
I still remember thinking, "I've done nothing wrong, it wasn't my fault!"
I just done a clean sweep, didn't just sack the girl that done it,
I said, "That's it, sorry.
Can't trust you anymore."
That was the only time I've been sacked.
Wouldn't wanna live that day again, that's for sure.
It was horrible... awful day.
The thing about Freda is that if she found out that somebody was telling lies about somebody, it'd just be "Come here you," in front of everybody and she would castigate them right down the banks,
and so she's a bit judgmental, if you like, but so?
That's Freda.
The bottom line was, I had to run a tight ship --
I had to answer to Apple and to The Beatles, and if anything went wrong, it was my head that went on the chopping block, nobody else's.
♪ [rock and roll]
It was August 1965, and The Beatles were playing on The Empire, and The Moody Blues were also on the bill, with them.
I had popped in to see the lads,
I just opened the door slightly and their band room was just full of relations, so I thought, "Oh,I'm never going to get in here,"
so, I was involved with one of The Moodys at the time, so I went into their dressing room, which was next door, that was just them and they had alcohol and drinks, so I decided to stay there for a drink,
but probably I stayed a bit longer than I shoulda done, and then I realized that I had to get autographs signed and photographs signed, so anyway,
I came back, knocked on the door, and I just walked in.
And as I walked in, John said to me, "Where have you been?"
And I said, "Oh, I've been next door,
I've been in the Moodys' dressing room,"
and he went, "Whose fan club secretary are you?"
and I went "What are you talking about?"
I said, "I'm your fan club secretary,"
and he went "Not anymore."
He said, "You might as well go back to The Moodys and be their fan club secretary,"
and I said "What are you talking about?" and he went "You're sacked."
And then I looked at the other three, so I said, "Are you sacking me as well?"
and they went, "No, we're not sacking you."
So I got on my high horse then, probably because of the drink, and I looked at him and I said,
"Well, I'll just work for the other three;
I won't do your mail anymore."
He said "Oh, I was only joking," I went, "No you weren't,"
and he went "Oh, I'm begging you, come back!"
and I said, "Well, I'll tell you what, get down on your two knees and beg me to come back, you dumped me."
He said, "If I get down on one knee?"
and I said, "Go on then, get down on one knee,"
and he did, and I said, "Oh, all right, I'll come back to you."
There has been quite a degree of loss in her lifetime which not many people have gone through, so, obviously, her mother dying when she was very young, my brother dying, then my mum and dad getting divorced...
A lot of people have gone under for less, and she hasn't.
She's a strong character, and she's come out fighting every time.
Over a period of time, people have said "Oh, why don't you do a book?"
or "You know, you should do a book,"
and my son did ask me -
- Timothy did ask me -- to do a few things, and I just-- it was because I never talked about The Beatles, or my past, and then something would come on the television and it would jog my memory, and I would say, "Oh, I went to that,"
or, "Oh, I remember the civic reception,"
or "I remember this," and Timothy used to say,
"But mum, you never talk about it,"
and I said, "Timothy, I haven't got time to talk about it.
I'm more interested in going to shops and thinking what to put on the table tonight for dinner, not to sit down and talk to you about The Beatles."
And he just shook it off, and then, when my grandson came along, I thought
"Well, I didn't do it for Timothy,"
and then Timothy passed away a few years ago, and then when Nial came along,
I thought, "Well, I'm definitely going to do it now."
Shh, I can hear the birdies singing, yeah, can you hear them singing?
You know, because one of these days, he might just look at me in the corner with the shawl and the grey hair and a cat sitting on me knee, and probably think, "Oh, you know,
she never done anything, or..."
I would like him to be proud of me and see how exciting my life was in the '60s, and the fun I had.
If I hadn't 'a done it now -- and this is the truth --
If I hadn't 'a done it now, I know I wouldn't ever have done it.
She could always say tomorrow, tomorrow, and she'll never sit down and sort it out.
When Nial was born, things definitely changed, and I think that when anybody has a child in that respect, it does open a lot of doors for people and changes their position in life in general, and you can suddenly reinvent yourself to a degree,
because Timothy isn't around now, and you don't know what tomorrow brings.
When they came back from America,
Brian Epstein decided then that we had to move to London, and you did, because in those days everything happened in London, wasn't happening up north.
We were planning on where we were going to live and what we were gonna do, and what clubs we would visit, and we were just -- all the excitement and the adrenaline was, ooh, we're going to the big city, the capital city.
So I went home and said, "Oh, well, I'm going to London, the firm's going to London, and I'm going to London with the firm and everything,"
and I'm all bubbly, and me father, he just sat in the chair and he was just listening, and he said, "London is a city of vice.
You're not going."
I knew I could go, you know, he couldn't stop me going, but when I started looking in me own mind, he wasn't very well at the time, so that's when I thought "No, I can't do this to me father.
A job's a job, even if it is The Beatles, a job's a job."
And that's why I handed in my notice.
He had a beautiful desk in the office, really big desk, he didn't even look up when I walked in,
I just stood in front of him, and I said, very quietly,
"I want to hand in my notice please."
He'd never heard that before, and he went,
"Don't you want to come to London?"
I said, "Oh, I desperately want to come to London,
I'd love to come to London,"
and I said, "But I can't come to London, 'cos me father won't allow me."
I know for a fact that Brian Epstein was seriously concerned, and I also know that the individual Beatles were most upset that she wasn't coming to London.
And then Eppy sent for me.
He said, "I've had a talk with the lads, and we don't want to you leave."
And I was just stunned.
He said, "I've had a word with your father, and you can come to London on a regular basis.
You stay up here."
And he said, "You can go back to NEMS, let me see it done, you can have my old offices in White Chapel."
♪ [music]
And that was how I didn't leave.
[She's the girl the Beatles had to leave behind]
Before they moved to London, I wanted to get their autographs, so, George was in this day, and I had autograph book upon autograph book for him to sign, and I slipped mine in the middle.
So he's signing them, and I'm saying, you know, "That's to Rita, that's to Barbara, that's to Steve, and he gets to mine, and he said
"Who's this to?" and I said, "Well, just sign that,"
'cos I just wanted it out of the way, and he went, "Well, no, who's it to?"
and I think it was because I was going,
"Oh, it doesn't matter, just sign it,"
and I remember saying to him, "Oh, just sign the book, just sign the book,"
and he flicked it to the front, and he went, "Is this yours?"
and I went, "Yeah, I haven't got your autograph,
I just want your autograph before you go to London."
So he signed it, and he pocketed it, he took it, and I went, "What are you doing with me book?"
and he went, "I'll get the others for ya."
And then next time he came in, he just threw it on the table, he went, "There you go." And they'd all put little comments in it.
Oh, Beatles Monthly.
Before the days of the internet and
Twitter and Facebook and everything, the way we got news to the fans was through the Beatles Monthlys.
I would get information from their parents, little gossipy snippets, I would also ask them what was going on, and little bits of juicy information from them, and I would put it in my newsletter, that was, in The Beatles Monthly.
Dear Beatle People,
I'd really like to thank each and every one of you who have sent presents for John's birthday.
John was really pleased that so many of you remembered him.
During his 10-day trip to America,
Paul looked in on a Beach Boys recording session.
Ta-ra for now, Freda Kelly.
♪ [rock and roll]
Dear Beatle People, July 1964 will go down in Beatle history as a hard day's month.
At last the first feature film starring our fabulous foursome is ready for showing, and will be coming to your local cinema quite soon.
At the beginning of March, you will see, Beatles at Shea Stadium Show, filmed in New York last August, when the boys starred in the largest-ever concert of their career before 57,000 fans.
Thank goodness the rumors about Paul are over.
Paul is still with us, and is likely to be with us for a long time.
Congratulations to Ringo and Maureen, who are expecting their second baby shortly after Maureen's next birthday.
George has been to the dentist again.
Dear Beatle People, after nearly four months of solid session work, the new LP, called
Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, is ready.
Beatles are hoping to acquire their own private recording studios at a secret location in central London.
New Beatles recording every week.
In one short period of just over four months, The Beatles have released no less than sixteen new recordings.
John hated his passport photograph so much that he tore it up and had a new picture taken.
Dear Beatle People, quite a lot of letters sent in discussed John, Cynthia, and Yoko Ono.
At least as many members have written about Paul and Jane.
Everyone has dozens of questions to ask, and many of you have only been too ready to put forward your opinions.
Here at the fan club, we believe that The Beatles deserve their separate and individual private lives, which should remain their business, and no other people's.
I am sure both John and Paul will work out their problems in their own ways, and I think they should be allowed to do so without the help or hindrance from millions of Beatle People.
Ta-ra for now, Freda Kelly.

♪ [acoustic guitar music]
Over the years, we could see the effect that his job was having on Eppy.
It was taking its toll.
The odd time that I went to London and saw him, he was just changing, you know, you could just see things weren't right.
He became obsessed with trying out, initially, experimenting with drugs, and then becoming very reliant upon them, and becoming more and more of a mess.
The 27th of August, 1967, I was at home.
There was something up with our phone, and I know I had to use a neighbor's phone, and the neighbor came over to me and said, "There's a call for you, there's a girl, Pat, wants to talk to you,"
and Pat said, "Oh, have you heard about
Brian, have you heard about Brian?
He's just been found dead."
The media were on this one that he committed suicide, and I just didn't believe that he committed suicide.
Somebody said that he choked on his vomit, and I tend to believe that tale.
The Beatles were actually in Wales, they'd gone there to see the Maharishi, and they were informed there, and I just remember John, out of all of them, he was the one that was sorta stunned.
Although I was still young me self, I could still visualize the devastation that it was going to cause.
He was the anchor for everything, and it was just...
where do we all go from here?
What happens now?
So Paul had this meeting set for September the 1st, within a couple of days of Brian Epstein's very tragic, premature death, and when I got there, nobody else had arrived yet, and he said, "Before the others get here, I just want to tell you,
I think that if The Beatles do not get together and work together very very quickly now, the group is going to disintegrate."
♪ [music]
Magical Mystery tour, it wasn't the best-organized thing, well, it wasn't organized, because Paul had a rough idea, but just a very rough idea.
This coach rolled up, and there was all different types of people milling around, like a guy dressed up as a bit of a clown, and he had a spotty, funny-type suit, and I thought "What's going on?"
and then this man -
- I didn't know him, I found out his name then, it was called Ivor Cutler -- and he come over to me and he just said to me, "You've got a nice-shaped head."
We all eventually got on the bus, and I dived for the back,
I thought, "Well, I'll go on the back seat, and, you know, you're not really seen on the back seat,"
and then Paul eventually got on the bus, and he sat by the driver, and then he called my name, and he went, "Freda, where are you?"
and I went, "I'm here, I'm on the back,"
and he went, "Can you come up the front?"
and I went, "Do I have to?" and he went, "Come up the front."
I thought, "Well, he's getting severe here now, do as you're told."
You couldn't book the hotels in The Beatles' names because they wouldn't have you, so you always had to book them under false names, and Neil was doing some of the hotels, and I said to him, "Why don't you book it in the Women's Institute
or the Catholic Women's League or something like that?"
and he went, "Oh, that's a good idea,"
so I had to go up to the counter in the hotel and say, "Hello, you've got a reservation in the name of the Women's Institute,"
and then they went, "Oh fine," I said, "Well, we're just come in now."
The shock on people's faces when we all trooped in -- because it was The Beatles, it was people dressed weird -- it was a very mixed bunch, very odd bunch, and I was one of them.
But where, I think, Paul was decided to do it there and then was 'cos it was so quickly after Brian Epstein's death.
He thought it might hold us all together, or hold them all together, but I don't think it worked.
That's just my opinion.
You know, you don't wanna think about that, you can be big-headed, and say,
"Yeah, we're gonna last ten years,"
but as soon as you've said that, you think
"We're lucky if we last three months."
Well obviously, we can't keep playing the same sort of music until we're about 40.
When I as at 40, we may not know how to write songs anymore.
I hope to have enough money to go into a business of my own by the time we do flop.
I've always fancied having a ladies' hairdresser.
I string them, in fact, and strut 'round in me stripes and me tails, you know, "Like a cup of tea, madam?"
The Beatles stopped touring in roughly 1966, I think, then Brian Epstein died in '67, and
Magical Mystery Tour was in '67, and Apple had started by then.
In the beginning, when Apple first opened, it was great:
the fun and the madness and all different nationalities in the press office.
People didn't act as if they were working in an office or a business, and then it became more settled down, more normal, and there wasn't as much fun.
I loved the beginning part of it, 'cos it was fun in the beginning, and it was fun for them, they enjoyed it so much.
Every group wants to be in the charts, or wants a hit record, or...
Everything was exciting in the beginning:
they got a number one, and then they were asked to appear on the Royal Command Performance, and they saw the queen, and they were a hit in America, and the civic reception, and it was all these landmarks,
and... where does it stop?
You can't keep carrying on like that, can you?
Towards the end of the '60s, it wasn't what The Beatles were doing as a group anymore, it was what they were doing individually.
I know Paul's was-- he was bringing out his own LP,
John and Yoko were doing the peace movement, and George was doing things, I think with Clapton, I can't remember,
Ritchie had two sons by then, and he was more interested in, sort of, a family life.
And then the penny was dropping with me, that we haven't got any Beatles as a group, anymore.
Are you still the Beatles' fan club secretary?
How's business?
Fine, except for the post day.
They don't have a group anymore.
Well they've still got four members, haven't they?
I don't like to lie, but it was trying to bend the truth, when people were asking you questions about what was going on, you had to more or less say, "Well yes,
The Beatles are still together, and everything's great," but it wasn't great.
And now, what's the arrangement today?
Well last August, Paul rang me up and said he didn't want people to be writing about him as a Beatle, which I was doing, and he wanted to split this word, Beatles, up.
They are four individual people now, recording and everything, and we'll write all about Apple artists, so we're still writing about the four Beatles 'cos Paul is still an Apple artist.
Is the atmosphere today anything like it was ten years ago?
No, no.
What's missing?
The closeness.
It was all fun when we were teenagers, but your life changes, and my life had changed, I was then 27, I mean,
I was married now, had a baby son, and I wanted more children, and I was, we'll say, concentrating on that.
I then found out I was pregnant.
I'd been trying to get pregnant for a while;
I desperately wanted this baby, and I just wanted to make sure that everything was gonna be all right, so that was more important to me than my job, was my married life, my son, and the baby on the way,
and then that's when I thought, "Well, I'm out here."
♪ [music]
I went to London, had a discussion with Neil Aspinall, the head of Apple, who was their road manager in the beginning, and George and Ritchie were there;
it was just-- that was all, I remember we were 'round a table.
I told them that I was pregnant, and they said,
"Well, do you think you would be going back to work?"
and I said, "I won't be going back to work, you know, I'll have two children then."
And then George finally spoke up and said, "Freda, you were there in the beginning, you're there at the end, let's call it a day.
Let's end the fan club."
You're still involved in the fan club?
Well, I'm sorta trying to wind it up.
This is what I wrote:
"Well, this is it.
John, Paul, George, and Ringo have each gone their separate ways, and they are no longer collectively an item.
There it is.
Eleven years.
Eleven years in which we have become a very strong, happy, and close circle of friends.
There will not be another official fan club for The Beatles as individual artists.
Please do not write again.
Yours faithfully, Freda Kelly."
I haven't read that since it went out.
I actually felt quite sad, reading it.
With me being a Beatle fan myself,
I just knew that this is going to break a lot of girls' hearts, so I musta put a lot of lights out for people.
Well, the lights went out, didn't they?
At the back of all this, I am still
-- or was -- am still a Beatle fan, so I do think the way they think.
We were still getting a lot of letters every day.
I took them all home with me, 'cos I couldn't leave them in the office, and although I said I wouldn't write again and I wouldn't answer any letters, between running my home and doing
the normal things a mother does,
I did answer the letters.
Slowly.
You know, I'd maybe do three one night,
I might do none the next night,
I might do five on the Saturday.
But it took me, on average, about three years to answer all those letters.
♪ [acoustic guitar solo]
Once I ended the fan club, that was it.
I was then not Freda Kelly anymore, and I just lived a normal life like everybody else, nothing to do with The Beatles anymore.
When I look back, it is shocking how many people that have gone that I knew from those days.
Well, we lost Eppy first of all.
You've got the main two-- you've got John and George, you've got two wives-- Mo Cox, Linda McCartney, you've got all the parents, you've got Neil Aspinall,
Derek Taylor, my friend Laurie McCaffrey... it brings it home to me.
I think fame and money doesn't mean anything.
All the wealth doesn't cure cancer, does it?
I worked with a lot of good people, I did, I loved them.
♪ [music and singing]
Giving a job like that, to what became the biggest band in the world, to a girl of 17, that was an unbelievable thing to do, and she never let 'em down.
The tide washes the sea in every day.
Freda was the tide -- you saw the effects of the tide like you see the effects of Freda -- but you never actually see a tide as such, it just happens to be there, and Freda was, so tell the story.
I don't know why Eppy picked me.
Maybe it was just fate.
And I was taken along for this ten-year, exciting ride, and then dropped off on the corner where I started it.
You know, I'm not famous, I'm not wealthy,
I'm still working for a living, I'm still a Beatle fan, so although there's a 50-year gap since I started it,
I still like to think that I'm back where I was in the beginning.
I don't ever have to tell this tale again.
It's down now, on record, isn't it?
End of.
Peace and love.
My name is Ringo, and this is a message to all of Freda Kelly's grandchildren.
Freda was a great friend to The Beatles, she was the fan club leader, and we've known her for a long time.
Anyway, we all loved Freda.
She was great, and Freda was like part of the family, and she knew all our families, she was just one of the best.
Peace and love.

I'm sorry, Mike.
You're fired.
You will return Mr. Schiller's property.

That's fantastic.
Where is it?
Don't tell him.
He'll sell it to line his own pockets.
Yeah, damn right.
My pockets, Marta's pockets,
- but not yours, dad, no.
- I could give it back to Schiller.
What?
No.
- I could dump it in the bay.
- No, no, no.
Just let me handle it.
Marta, come.
I think we should sit on it and figure the way how to use it against Schiller.
"We"?
Why are you even including him?
I want to get all of your perspectives.
Dad, is taking him down even possible?
Yeah, for a guppy to take down jaws?
No, it's not possible.

They will be when and if you're certain she is in danger, but if you involve me, you're not gonna be able to contact the police in any way, and they are pretty useful in finding runaways.
Now, in the meantime, what time will you do the dry run today?

Is she back yet?
Come on, Marta.
She's my goddaughter.
I just want to help.
(Sighs and pats back)
Thanks.
Someone must have seen her tagging.
We could go check around the area.
This is to find Natalie.
That's it.
- Hey, Uncle Irwin.
- Yeah?
Um...
The stuff you were asking me about last night... could it have something to do with Natalie being missing?
It might.
Why?
Gabriel, if you know something that'll help Natalie...
I found some bins tied to the bottom of the "Corina" last week.
My mom told me that she dumped them in the bottom of the bay.
They're gone.
Oh, it's good you told me.
She said they were filled with pot from dad's business.
Is that true?
Yeah.
That's what was in them.
(Door opens and closes)
Is Natalie okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, she's just... out painting.
No, she isn't.
She would have told me.
Hey... what did she tell you, baby?
That she was sad.
Because of daddy?
She said nobody ever told her the truth.
(Exhales)
It made her feel lonely.
Did she say she wanted to run away?
I don't remember.
Think.
Okay?
This is important.
You're scaring me, mommy.
(Elena) Marta!
Marta!
Come down here!
Stay here, baby.
- Mom?
- It rang.
It's... the text.
Let me see.
- Let me see, let me see.
- (Speaking Russian)
(Gasps) What?
What is it?
What is it?
"$500,000.
Lagoon park. 5:00 P.M.
Or your daughter's dead.
No cops."
This is all Evan left you?
I can probably get the rest from Schiller.
No.
I'll get the rest.
That bastard could be the one behind this.
Schiller doesn't need half a million ransom money.
What about the Coxon brothers?
They were angry when Irwin stole their pot.
They know they'd have to answer to Orson, Schiller, and Andrei.
I mean, they're stupid.
They're not suicidal.
(Cell phone vibrating)
"Northeast side of park.
Cab will come.
Put money in bag.
We get cash, you get girl."
It's from a different phone anan the other texts.
- What... does that mean something?
- They're using burner phones.
Can't be traced.
They are not amateurs.
We'll set up on lagoon park to follow the cab.
The money will be brought to you here.
Marta...
I will find her.
(Kisses)
(Breath quavering)
(Door opens and closes)
(Picks up phone)
(Dialing, line rings
(woman) Mr. Schiller's office.
(Breathing heavily, lowered voice) Please...
I need to talk to Mr. Schiller.
- (Exhales)
- I'm coming with you. (Closes door)
You are a good brother who will go to Café Rossiya with Boris.
You can stand guard with my men.
- Dedushka.
- The men protect women and children.
This is your job.
Do you understand?
(Door closes)
(Chuckles)
What you got in there?
If I had to wager, I'd bet, what, 250 horsepower?
Uh, yeah. (Chuckles) Maybe 300.
(Whistles) Nice.
Well, shall we?
Wait, what are you, uh...
Mr. Schiller asked me to accompany you on the practice run.
Well, the "Corina's" broken.
Well, your sister said she'd have it repaired.
Well, she's been a little preoccupied.
Oh, yeah.
Missing daughter.
Shame.
My own sis disappeared once.
Psychotic break, they said.
Found her in a whorehouse.
(Ignition cranking)
For gigolos. (Cranking stops)
Tells you how batty she was.
- Hey, hey!
- What?
No ignition wire.
We fix that, we'll be off in a jiff.
We'll sew this into the lining of the bag.
We'll know its location at all times.
When is the drop?
In two hours.
Tell Neaulani she has five minutes.
Mrs. Walraven will be waiting in the lobby.
This is all very disruptive.
Do you have a phone number that texted you?
It's from a burner phone.
It can't be traced.
Really?
(Sighs)
- It's hard to hide from you, huh?
- (Typing)
I like to think so.
Thanks.
(Zipper zips)
(Exhales)
(Zipper zips)
I grounded her.
That's the last thing I said to her.
(Sighs)
(Whispers) Somebody out there has my baby.
And I have no idea who.
You'll have her in your arms in 30 minutes.
(Normal voice) It's time to go.
(Muffled sobbing)
If I have to come in there, you're not gonna like what I do!
(Lowered voice) Hey!
Stop scaring her like that!
Ah!
(Sobs and gasps)
Why did you put that gag in her mouth?
She was making noise.
Whatever, dude.
Not "whatever." Where's your mask?
She's blindfolded.
- You don't know what she can see.
- Oh, yeah?
Hello?
!
Hello?
Can you see this?
Hey!
You had one job... to sit here with a mask on and watch her.
Now do your job.
I gotta go set up the taxi.
Look, suck it, dude.
I grabbed her.
I want more than this little snow you got.
- (Normal voice) We had an agreement.
- New deal...
- Half of whatever you're getting.
- Forget it!
All right, fine.
See who's gonna watch her now then, you cheap bastard.
Hmm?
Wait.
Hey... (Door slams)
Damn it!
Uncle Mike?
Is that you?
(Exhales)
(Beeps and dials)
(Schiller) Did the taxi show?
No.
I don't know why.
It doesn't matter.
We found the store where the burner phones were bought.
We're sending you a photo from their security camera now.
(Beeping)
Who is it?
Kurt...
Bowman.
Two possession stints plus one for armed robbery.
Find him.
(Phone beeps)
Kurt Bowman.
He's the one that sent the texts.
How did you learn this?
Whatever you have to do, whoever you have to do it to, get him.
(Siren wailing in distance)
What are you gonna do to me?
I was just gonna hold you till I got some money.
And now?
I promise I won't tell anyone if you let me go.
I'm sorry.
I can't.
Why do you want the money so bad?
Your mom shut me out.
She shut me out of the business.
She's got plenty of dough, but she won't cut me in.
So this is her fault?
(Panting)
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm an idiot.
Your mother got saddled with a mess, and she's doing her best to clean it up, and I prioritize my life around snorting powder like a damn shop-vac.
(Scoffs)
Your dad... held me together.
Without him, I just unraveled.
(Scoffs)
Do you know who killed him?
Nicholae Schiller.
But we'll never be able to prove it.
He's too powerful.
Why did he do it?
Because he thought your dad stole from him.
Did he?
No.
Your dad was careful as hell after you kids were born.
What about before?
Oh... me and Evan thought we were... big shots back then.
We wanted into your grandpa's card game.
I thought I could stack the deck.
Your grandpa caught us, and your dad said it was his doing.
Took my beating.
Your mom comes in.
She tells your grandpa to stop.
Andrei's like, "why should I?"
And Evan says, "because I asked your daughter to marry me."
And I'm like, "what?" (Laughs)
But he just knew in that instant, and sure enough, she backed him up.
She actually kissed him, blood and all.
The woman commits, I'll give her that.
Three months later, they were married.
Dina was the maid of honor, and I told that story as my best man speech.
Crickets.
(Chuckles)
So daddy was a criminal.
Are you sure you want to know this, Nat?
If you don't tell me, it's like I'm remembering a lie.
Ahh... all we did was export weed.
Not perfect, but nothing compared to the Petrov side of your family.
Does Dedushka still do card games?
And extortion, fraud, auto theft.
He's got a crew in the Richmond.
He's part of the mob.
They call it the Bratva.
Mm. "Brotherhood."
That's what "Bratva" means.
Huh.
I didn't know that.
Thank you for telling me.
(Fence rattling) Your drug buddy...
Kurt... where is he?
I swear!
I have no idea!
I haven't seen him!
(Panting)
Go.
(Footsteps retreating)
- Nothing.
- Nah?
- Check hunters point.
- Check it out.
(Cell phone vibrates)
- Anything?
- I showed Natalie's picture to some local stores... nothing yet.
I'm gonna send you a photograph of the kidnapper.
- His name is Kurt Bowman.
- You know who it is?
Th...
I want you and Mike to go back to the shops and show this picture.
If you separate, you'll cover more ground.
- I'm not with Mike.
- What?
- Where is he?
- He went to check hospitals... for Jane Does.
- (Man singing in Russian) - (Felicity and Boris laughing)
I am gonna get you!
(Felicity and Boris laughing)
- I'm gonna get you!
- You got it, okay?
(Boris and Felicity laughing)
*
(Chair scrapes floor) (Laughter continues)
Nice .22.
It's a .45.
*
(Felicity shouting playfully)
(Felicity and Boris laughing)
(Laughter continues) I'm gonna get you!
(Laughs)
Aah!
(Laughing)
Stop tickling him!
He doesn't like it!
I...
I'm sorry.
I mean, you're getting him all riled up before bedtime.
Do you know nothing about children?
*
I'm going to get you!
(Shouting indistinctly)
(Panting)
(Grunting)
So, you been hanging with Kurt?
- No!
He just deals to me sometimes.
- Yeah?
So why'd you run?
I don't want to get killed 'cause he's running his mouth!
Listen, if you lie to me again, you piece of crap,
- I'll rip your face off.
- I don't know where Kurt is!
Where is he?
!
What did he say?
All I know is that he's getting an ass-load of coke for helping snatch some girl.
(Grunts) Where is he?
I don't know.
But he's... working with some other guy.
Mike!
His name's Mike!
(Shudders) Mike.
Mike who?
!
What does he look like?
I've only seen him once.
Blond hair, regular height.
Goofy laugh.
Oh, my God.
Get out of here.
Thanks anyway, Mr. Sanchez.
Yes.
I'm sure she'll walk in any minute.
(Beeps, door opens)
- Where's your dirtbag husband?
- What?
- Where is he?
- Dad!
Stop.
- Just... just give us a minute.
- Okay.
We think Mike took Natalie.
What?
No, he was with me.
He won't pick up my calls.
Dina, I need you to call him.
(Cell phone rings)
(Ringing continues)
(Ringing continues)
(Ringing continues)
(Beeps)
Hey, babe.
Hey.
Where are you?
- Still checking hospitals.
- Which ones have you gone to?
Uh, St. Francis, St. Catherine's, S.F. General.
Mike, S...
St. Catherine's closed down a year ago.
Please tell me you have nothing to do with this.
I love you so much, Deens.
(Crying) (Beeps)
(Cell phone beeps, dials)
(Sobs) No.
Get me Schiller.
Marta, he'll... he'll kill Michael.
Please don't!
Mr. Schiller?
Ohh... (Gasps)
We know who took Natalie.
(Exhales)
You should not have asked him.
- You'll owe him worse...
- I don't care!
(Cell phone vibrates)
Did you track Mike's cell phone?
We can't.
He disabled it.
What?
So... so that's it?
We found his V.I.N. number.
His vehicle has a navigation system.
When it's located, we'll retrieve your daughter, and then we'll dispense with Tomlin.
No.
We can handle it.
He threatened someone under my protection.
- An example will be made.
- Look.
This is personal.
I want to deal with it myself.
Make sure he's dealt with appropriately.
(Phone clatters)
Uncle Mike?
Uh...
I really, really have to go.
Sure, sweetie.
(Knife clicks open)
Uh, just don't listen, okay?
I get nervous and I can't go.
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
What's gonna happen now?
Your grandpa's gonna kill me.
No.
Mom won't let him.
I'll make sure of it.
Thanks, Nat.
(Toilet flushes)
Uh... this is embarrassing, but it's that time of the month.
I need tampons.
Oh, crap. (Sighs)
Brilliant, wasn't it?
Thanks for letting me take the helm.
You bet.
I'll tell Mr. Schiller that you're ready for the gun runs.
Hey, just one small thing.
It's Mr. Schiller's, right?
Nicked a couple months back.
It's worth what?
$2 million?
If it's cut?
More.
See, I've been looking for a little side business.
And I assume it'd be a three-way cut?
You, me...
Marta?
Marta doesn't know about this.
Great.
Then it'll be halfsies.
(Door opens) (Heavy breathing)
- Stay away from me.
- Where's Mike?
Hmm?
Mike!
(Panting)
There's people after me because of you.
(Clicks open)
(Gasps)
All right.
You be a good girl, okay?
(Gasping)
(Knife clatters) Shh, shh.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- (Muffled shouting)
Hey, take it easy!
- (Muffled shouting) (Panting)
- Come here.
(Grunts) (Muffled screaming)
- Okay?
I said be a good girl, okay?
- (Door opens)
- Hey!
- (Grunting) We gotta get rid of her!
(Grunting)
- Look, she's a Russian mob kid!
- Get out of here!
- Get out!
- Aah!
- Get... get out!
- (Shouting indistinctly)
Get out, you piece of garbage!
(Door slams)
(Panting)
(Knife closes) Are you okay?
Did he hurt you?
(Grunts)
I'm so sorry.
(Door opens) Mike!
(Grunting)
(Marta) Natalie!
- Mom!
- Hey...
- Ah, baby!
- Mom!
- It's okay!
- (Andrei shouting in Russian)
Oh, my love.
My beautiful girl.
(Sobbing)
- (Shouting in Russian)
- Don't do anything!
- No, no!
- No!
Natalie!
- He didn't do anything!
- It's okay.
- (Speaks Russian)
- It was the other guy!
It's okay, Natalie.
No, please, please don't kill him!
(Panting)
Marta...
I'm gonna promise my daughter you won't be killed.
But you are dead to us.
You understand?
You are out of our lives.
You are out of Dina's.
- Understand?
- Mom...
No.
Y... your mother's right, honey.
Do not forgive me.
Ever.
Run.
Run!
(Footsteps running)
- It's okay, sweetie.
Come here.
- (Crying)
It's okay.
It's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you.
No one's gonna hurt you ever again.
(Door opens and closes)
Sergei... (Speaks Russian)
She is safe.
Oh... (Crying)
- Hey.
- Hmm?
Come.
We're going home, boys.
(Groans softly) Come.
The people who did this... when will you take care of them?
- Don't worry about it.
- No.
Dedushka...
They hurt my sister.
And now she has to live with this memory for the rest of her life.
I want to make them pay.
(Birds chirping)
(Gasps)
(Lowered voice) Hey...
It's okay.
It's okay, Solnyshko.
I'm sorry for sneaking out.
Shh.
Don't apologize.
I didn't know what you had been dealing with since dad died.
I'm so sorry.
Shh.
It's okay.
Do you still love daddy, even though he left you with all this?
Yeah.
Me, too.
Is Dedushka gonna kill Uncle Mike?
I know who grandpa is, mom.
What we are.
No.
He promised Mike would not be killed.
Dedushka always keeps his promises.
Mom...
I don't want to be in the Bratva.
I don't want to live like that.
You won't have to, because I am gonna get us out of this.
And I honor my promises, too.
I trust you.
(Sniffles and exhales)
(Exhales)
Your charming mother was kind enough to show me in.
She's poisoning my coffee.
Andrei lost a gem when he left her. (Chuckles)
What are you doing here?
All the time and energy I put into this rescue,
I feel invested.
How's Natalie?
She's gonna be fine.
Thank you.
I thought you'd want to know we've dealt with Kurt Bowman.
Dealt with?
He's in the trunk of Vincent's car.
Most of him.
And Michael Tomlin?
He's... been dealt with.
All right.
So the daughter is found, and the mother is back on the job, focused on nothing else.
(Exhales)
Okay.
I'm gonna...
This was not a favor.
I helped find Natalie because you work for me.
Do you understand?
Is that why you came to my house, Mr. Schiller?
To remind me that I owe you?
Oh, what difference does it make where we meet?
We are in the same world now.
(Door opens and closes)
(Ship horn blows)
I need to disappear, Irwin.
Damn right you do.
I never would have hurt her.
We're not gonna talk about that.
Too pissed at you.
Then why'd you call me?
I got no other option.
I got 75 keys I need to cut and distribute and... no crew.
You in or out?
Let's go make some cash.
Gabriel?
Good job, son.
(Grunts)
You dare touch my granddaughter?
(Grunting and groaning)
(Panting) Just... kill me.
No.
I made a promise.
(Kick lands) (Grunting loudly)
(Kicking continues)
(Blow lands) Ohh!
(Blows landing) (Mike grunting)
Just once.

How will I manage 150,000 ?
You're not paying for the house, electricity and maid.

Then don't go out of the house.
I shouldn't go out of the house.
Is that possible ?
Chino, I'm the one left as guardian of your in heretance.

I was born and grew up here Angeles.
The story of my I Fe, is usual story of the GI babies.
My mom's a prostitute, my dad's a pilot.
But when the US base pulled out in 1992, my mom was just pregnant at that time, that's why I didn't get to see my dad.
You know, whenever I see an airplane,
I thought of my dad flying with it.
Maybe he's a good pilot.
It's just sad that I didn't get to try flying with him.
You know, Lani.
You don't need your dad to fulfill your dream.
I don't have a visa, not even a passport.
I don't even have money to buy a ticket.
You can get it for free.
Is there such Thing as free nowadays ?
There is.
(Speaks I kapampangan)
Can you see how small my house is ?
Mal
What's that ?
What do you mean, "What's that" ?
You should be the one who answer your quest on.
What's that ?
There, look at the card.
What happened to you ?
Mal
I have a boyfriend, now.
You know that girls in Manila are one cent for 10
Especially for the rich ones.
Ma, that's the point.
There are a lot of girls in Manila but he chose me.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
Ma, don't worry about me.
Lani, you have visitor.
Good afternoon.
Lunch ?
You thought we're eating in an air-conditioned restaurant, right ?
You're wearing a jacket.
Why, don't you like it ?
I wore this for you.
So you'd find me gorgeous.
So what did you order ?
This is obviously a frog.
But ...
We call it "betute".
Frog stuff with meat.
Okay.
I eat frog legs so I'm okay with this.
That one.
It looks scary.
What's that ?
This one, we call it "kamaru".
It's Delicious.
It looks like a cockroach.
These are insects living in the rice fields' mud.
How does it become delicious ?
Insects living in mud ?
They feed on leaves.
Pigs eat swill.
Which one do you think is better ?
You're right.
This ?
This one s delicious.
It tastes like fried chicken.
Eat it.
We call it "dagis".
A lot of people say that exotic food tastes like fr ed chicken.
I'm scared ...
What's this ?
Rat.
Okay ...
There's no way I'm eating Mickey Mouse.
Sir here are your keys and your room number.
This way please.
Thank you.
Thaks, guys.
Welcome Sir.
Sammy, please get me out of here.
I'll clean up.
When you're well already Ella.
I'm okay already.
Come on.
I'll do everything.
Sammy, please.
Ella, when you get out of here, I'll give you your own condominium unit.
Monthly allowance.
You'll live comfortably.
But with one condition.
What condition ?
You won't fight me with the annulment case that I'll file.
Sammy ...
Psychological in capacity for using illegal drugs.
Sammy, I just did it because I love you.
Ella, if you resist, you'll rot here in rehabilitation center.
What kind of offer is that ?
Whichever I pick makes me a loser.
I know.
Go now, take her.
You're an animal.
Guys, Cheers for the friendship and ladies ...
Boys, boys, boys !
Chino, you gotta introduce us to this fine lady you're with, man
Fine lady, huh.
Lani, these are my friend.
Daniel,
Hi !
- We're all single.
You might have friends ...
- This is Mon, Albert
Not this one.
He's a playboy.
Dude, you were with another ...
Hey morons.
These are on me
I'll take care of it !
For free.
There !
Thank you.
I'm single.
One more round.
Party time.
Boss, can you lessen your loudness.
Why, do we have a problem ?
Yes, we have a problem.
You're too loud.
We're loud.
This one is stupid.
This is a club, right ?
- Are we loud ?
- Of course, co'z this is a club.
I don't care who he is.
Dude, if you can't take the noise then go find some other place.
Did you here that ?
Let's go to another place.
Hey, get your hands off my date.
Chino, that's enough.
Dude, you're in no place.
You're in no place.
Chino, that's enough.
Chino, that's enough.
It's not his fault.
He just protected me from the Mayor's son.
Come on.
Attorney Litaua.
You were informed about this already.
Bautista.
Sir ?
Those who are from Manila.
Chino, are you okay ?
Were you hurt ?
Attorney, thank you.
Sorry, I came a bit late.
We had a hard time dealing with this one.
Attorney, what did my brother say ?
Well, he had to pull some strings.
He's really mad.
You should go back to Manila immediately.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Chino.
Hold it.
Where are you going ?
- I'll come back for you.
Wait for me.
- I'll come with you.
Wait for me.
Chino.
Okay, book it.
Then e-mail me, the itinerary immediately.
Okay, thank you.
Bro, I'm sorry.
Take a bath.
Your flight is at 5:30am.
It's 2am.
You have to be in the airport in 30 minutes.
Where am I going ?
To America.
Stay there.
I don't want to go there.
What will I do in America ?
Chino, you had a fight with the Mayor's son.
Do you think your fight with him ends there ?
They wouldn't stop until they get back at you.
Now, if you still love your life, cool down in America.
Put these in the car.
Tell Edwin to take Chino to the airport.
Let's eat ?
No one dies by being broken hearted.
But with an ulcer, there is.
Ma,
I'm pregnant.
Why didn't you listen to me ?
You're really hard-headed.
Didn't I tell you ?
That men will just use you and hurt you.
Ma, what do you know about love ?
Men's worth is just an amount of money for you, right ?
Oh yes.
I once loved.
To your dad.
Weren't you the fruit of our love ?
He promised to come back for me.
And like you ...
I believed him.
I was once like you.
My heart leaps whenever a car stops in front of our house.
But days passed, weeks,
months, years.
Now tell me.
Am I the one that you should question if I know anything about love ?
Sir chino isn't here.
He's in America.
Ha ?
When will he come back ?
I don't know.
Go now, ma'am.
Sir Ginno is not here.
Wait a second.
Sir !
Please don't close the gate.
Sir.
Chino !
Wait a second.
Chino.
Chino.
Who are you ?
I'm sorry.
I thought you're Chino.
I'm his girlfriend from Angeles.
Someone came here yesterday.
His girlfriend from Cebu, from Bacolod, from Palawan, from Boracay
So you see, you're not his only girlfriend.
But he said that he'll come back.
Chino is in America now.
He's not coming back.
So please, don't come and bother us here.
Wait a second.
But he said ...
Wait a second ...
Hold it.
Please bring out Chino if you don't want me to create trouble here.
I'm pregnant and he's the father.
Sir, what now ?
- Sir, please let Chino show up.
- She doesn't want to move over.
I'll go on.
Sir !
Bring out Chino.
Ma ...
It isn't God's will.
Maybe what happened is better, than you being a single mom.
You'll find a man, who's really for you.
Forget him.
Bro, why do all my credit cards were declined ?
Because you're spending beyond your allowance.
Bro, I'm spending dollars.
Chino, if you weren't shopping at designer outlets, dinng in expensive restaurants, you can manage your budget.
But bro ...
Okay, I get it.
You wanna punish me, alright ?
But be reasonable.
No.
You be reasonable.
All the money that you're spending there, shall be deducted to your inheritance.
It's not like a deep well that doesn't ran out.
With your kind of lifestyle, your money will be gone that soon.
And if it's gone, you're on your own.
You'll be left sorry.
Bro, how am I gonna live decently with 150,000
Tell me.
It's easy.
Just learn to be thrifty or work.
This is BS !
Adobo ?
Pancit ?
You are Filipino, right ?
Yes.
I thought you're Japanese.
Ah no.
I'm pure-blooded Filipino.
And you ?
Chinese, Filipino ...
A combination.
Do you like ?
Really ?
Yeah.
Here.
Wow.
Before that, I'm Chino.
You are ?
I'm Gwen.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Here.
It's Po son-free.
Wow, I haven't eaten something like this.
Delicious ?
There.
Delicious.
Did you cook this ?
Oh, no, My grandmother.
My grandmother cooks.
When she cooks, it's as if like there's feast.
Then there are left overs that she wants me to bring in school.
She expects me to eat all of it.
Obviously, I can't.
So I look for Filipino here in Minnesota.
Which ending ...
none.
So I just throw it ...
- Dont
- If she's that I haven't eaten all of it, she'd feel bad.
Throw it to me.
So how long have you been staying here ?
Sorry.
Sorry.
Do I talk too much ?
Okay, just eat.
Thank you.
Still have more ?
I still have spring rolls.
Thank you.

Hi, I'm Chino.
I'll be ...
Still working ?
Yes.
Would you take long ?
About 30 minutes, why ?
Do you miss me already ?
Midnight snack ?
All for food, yes.
You're cheap.
Well, you had me in adobo.
Wait 't I you try my grandma's kare-kare.
You know your grandma, is she single ?
Can I marry her ?
My dad will kill you.
Well in that case, I'll settle for you.
You'll marry me ?
This restaurant might have hit you big time.
You're fluent in Tagalog.
But you speak like those on the out skirts.
Ah Okay, Oh really ?
Hey, don't get irritated.
It's okay.
Really okay.
If you want,
You can have midnight snack on your own ...
Hold it ...
Come on, stay.
10 minutes.
I'm just kidding.
I'll get you a drink.
Okay.
So my mom, died when I was 10.
My dad he died 3 months ago.
When he was alive, he was never around anyway.
So my brother Sammy, he's been father figure ko.
He attended all the meetings,
PTA,
Graduation.
And Dad, wasn't there.
So he was my father figure.
But then,
He got into our family business.
And he was no longer around.
They didn't care about me anymore.
And that's when I became this spoiled little rich kid.
I started all these vices, became kind of a playboy.
And now I'm here.
So why are you here ?
You really wanna know ?
I had a fight with a Mayor's son.
But it's not my fault.
If you have a lot of money then why did you take the waiter job ?
I guess,
My brother is guilty, he wants to show me that he loves me.
Pathetic, right ?
Aren't you a bit old enough to be rehabilitated ?
Okay so what do you suggest Miss Psyche major ?
I don't know ...
Psycho-therapy ...
Substitution therapy,
Regression ...
Lobotomy maybe.
I'm scared of your suggestions.
Can't you just be my medicine ?
I don't know.
You might go more insane because of me.
Maybe I'm going insane.
Hey, sweetie.
Yes ?
How are you ?
I'll join you later.
Have a seat, please.
Have a seat,
- Please ?
- Okay.
What's your name ?
Whatever you like.
Whatever I like ?

Please.
Ya, over there.
Is this your home address already ?
Am I going to send Christmas cards here, and my birthday cards for you ?
The house is too quiet.
I feel so alone.
The company isn't going to be broke for you to become too workaholic.
You need a life, man.
You need to enjoy life.
You need a woman in your life.
Women can cause you headache.
After what I experienced with Ella,
I don't want them anymore.
You need a good decent woman.
Don't shut the possibility of marrying again.
You'll never know.
Sit down.
Join me, come on.
Don't mind if I do.

Where are you thinking opening this kind of restaurant ?
I'm thinking back in my hometown, Angeles.
But I'm planning to put up a restaurant here n Manila.
Wow.
When do you think you are starting ?
I'm actually short on funds right now ...
And I need a bit more time to raise it.
You know what ?
I've been thinking about some business that I can get into here in the Philippines.
And I like your idea.
I can't own the business myself.
But why don't I help raise funds for you.
Then you and I could be business partners.
That sounds like a good plan.
In the mean time, may I invite you to our charity ball this weekend ?
You alright ?
Ya,
Can I get you a drink ?
Sure.
Alright.
Sorry, Excuse me for a while.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

Never did.

He's a friend.
Would he mind, if we have coffee at the lobby and talk.
I don't think so.
You don't think we can talk and have coffee ?
I don't think the Consul would mind.
Ma'am this s from Mr. Sammy Lee.
His driver is here.
Please return that to your boss.
What ?
I don't need what he has sent me.
Ma'am, my boss might get mad at me.
Please tell him, I can't accept this.
I'd like you to meet Pat and Brenda.

Actually, you bring trouble in my mind.
I want to know you.
Like what I said,
I don't need your gifts.
I don't have a bad intention.
I just want to make friends with you.
I don't need friends.
Hold t, I don't understand.
I thought we were having a good conversat on last n ght.
I thought were okay.
We're okay.
You don't need gifts.
You don't need a friend.
What do you want ?
I want a serious relationship.
Now if you can't givel that to me, don't bother anymore.
Excuse me.
Ma'am Lani, somebody called, they're interested to get our catering services.
What's the problem ?
It's a bit big time.
They want some foods that are not included in our menu.
What k nd of food do they want ?
I can't understand.
I don't know half of the menu
I can't pronounce the other half.

I used to hate my brother for send ng me here.
Co'z here you're not the boss.
True.
But now,
I thank him.
Because ?
Because, if he hasn't sent me here,
I wouldn't have met you.
You got me already, you don't have to flatter me.
It goes to show that it isn't what I'm after for.
Are you saying you're in love with me ?
Maybe.
Co'z in-love is different from being home s ck.
Gwen, if I feel like home sicked,
I would probably wish to be home.
But now,
I can see a life with you here.
Morning bad breath.
No.
You know, you're so beautiful but ... damn !
Take care of it.
Yes, ma'am.
Here's the billing for the remaining balance.
Just wait for our boss.
He'll be the one to givel the payment.
Beaut ful.
You ?
I'm beaut ful ?
You are beautiful.
You're playing tricks on me.
Playing tricks ?
.
Why ?
I paid my down payment.
I'll be paying the balance.
Why didn't you tell me that you're my client ?
If I have told you that I'm you're cl ent, would you reject me ?
Yes.
Why ?
Because ...
You told that you want someone ser ous.
I am ser ous.
Where are the guests ?
If I have told you that that 100,000 is for just one person you'd probably wonder.
You are buying me.
I'm not buy ng you, it's your food.
What do you need from me ?
One dance.
Are you going to give me a chance ?
Bro, it's 3 am here.
Come home, bro.
I Just got married.
What ?
What did your brother say ?
He's excited.
Really ?
He wasn't surprised ?
Not really.
He was shocked, though.
He never thought I'd marry again.
What would be his mpression on me ?
Chino s happy for me.
And because you make me happy, you're okay with him.
When will I meet him ?
On Saturday.
He's going home.
That's my brother.
That's my brother.
Hey,
Chino.

Beaut ful.
So where's my sister in-law.
She's at home, cook ng dinner.
She cooks well.
Perfect.
We didn't eat at the a rplane.
We're really hungry.
It's nice to be home, Bro.
You have such a beautiful home.
Well, thank you, Gwen.
Come in, come in.
Bro, where's the beaut ful w fe ?
Maybe she's just getting dressed up.
There she goes.
Hon.
Finally.
This is my lovely wife, Lani.
My brother, Chino and his g rlfriend, Gwen.
A toast for chino and Gwen.
Welcome home.
Thanks, guys.
Welcome back, bro.
Thank you.
It's nice to be back, uncle.
You know what saved me ?
Her grandma's cooking.
Excuse me, guys, I'll just get some food.
Okay.
You want a drink ?
Ya.
I'll grab you one.
You guys, okay.
Ya.
Alright, Sure.
Get red wine please.
Thanks.
Okay, Sir.
What do you need from my brother ?
Chicken galantina is delicious.
I made this.
Does he know what happened between us ?
He wouldn't know if you won't tell him ?
How about you ?
Does Gwen know about us ?
How did you meet my brother ?
- Excuse me, Sir.
- Thanks
How did you two have a relationsh p ?
Howithe hell did you get to marry him ?
Why don't you ask him ?
And why are you mad ?
What am I do ng to you ?
You have an intent on.
I'll find it out.
You know what ?
You are conceited.
The world isn't just about you.
What if I tell you that I love your brother ?
Wouldn't you believe ?
Let's pray for that.
Are you guilty ?
Or maybe you're just skeptic because I married your brother and not you.
Maybe I have such low standards with women, but my brother is a decent person.
He deserves a good woman.
So whatever you plan is, don't do it.
If you need money, I've got lots of it.
Just stay away from my brother.
Eat it.
Here you go.
Excuse me.
Ya.
So I'm also excited to go.
I really wanna go there for a break.
What are you doing ?
You told me that he accepted me already.
Yes, what happened ?
He insulted me.
He questioned my intention.
Sammy, I never ran after your money.
I, myself, even told you.
That we should sign a pre-nuptial agreement, right ?
And you refused.
Honey, I'm sorry.
I don't know why Chino said those things to you.
But don't worry about it.
I'll talk to him.
You are brothers.
I don't want to be in the middle.
Honey, you are my w fe.
He has to respect that.
If he can't do it, then he should forget that we're brothers.
Chino.
Why are you being rude to my wife ?
Because she's not right for you.
Why ?
Do you know her to speak of her like that ?
Bro, you shouldn't marry the likes of Lani.
Why ?
What kind of person's Lani for you to judge her like that ?
Bro, there are a lot of women out there.
Why her ?
Why not her ?
Because you deserve better.
Chino, for years, I put up with your cheap women
Women who bring trouble, who chases you, who mad for be ng fooled by you.
I am happy now.
I didn't feel this with Ella.
Can't you be happy for me ?
I love her.
You love her.
Bro, I hope you'd be happy and that you won't get hurt.
I'm outt'a here.
I'd be hands off.
Hey.
What's wrong ?
Noth ng.
Just ... thinking of my new sister in-law.
I was wonder ng about that.
Why ?
Co'z when you saw her earlier, it's like as if you've seen a ghost.
No, I'm just really concerned for my brother.
I feel like, marrying that g rl is a b g mistake
Why did you say that ?
That woman has a bad intention.
I can feel t.
You're making assumpt ons ?
Unless ...
Unless ?
Unless what you're saying has basis.
Of course.
My basis is she's a slut.
You know that, right ?
Since when did you become d scriminating with sluts ?
I mean, you still love them right ?
Where did that come from ?
You know, I don't understand.
What's happening with people here ?
I don't know what's happen ng to you.
Let's just sleep.
The weather is hot.
It feels good to swim.
Come on.
Have you forgotten ?
Lift the arm ad lift the leg
That's it.
Go.
Up and down.
And up and down.
And up that's it.
Go dow, and up.

Arms up.
Hi.
So you enrolled here, too.
Ya.
Are you going somewhere after this ?
No.
You're not going out with Chino ?
He's going somewhere.
Let's have lunch ?
I have errands to do.
I thought you're not going anywhere after this.
Well, I just realized there is.
Do we have a problem here, sis ?
So ?
How's your sex with Chino ?
You know, first love never dies.
But for me, first sex is the best.
Sammy loves you so much.
Your life now s great.
Why do you still have to do this ?
Don't tell me, that you're chang ng your mind.
No.
As for me, I believe they're not ord nary people.
I'm afra d that what we're doing m ght bounce back at us.
Don't be such a coward.
We planned his for a year, right ?
Why would you feel nervous now ?
Don't tell me you're falling in-love with Chino.
Lani, everyone falls n love.
Everyone gets hurt.
Don't you think t's time to move on ?
You don't know what you're saying.
You don't knowithe hardships I've been through.
Except for ...
I've been thinking that everything's okay now.
We're okay.
We might fail on this.
Do you love him ?
No.
How much pesticide do you need to get poisoned with that salad ?
What do you mean ?
Just make sure that you're not ly ng.
Co'z if not, your mouth might just get fizzy with what you're eating.
We're sisters.
Allies.
I'll do whatever you want me to do.
I'll support you.
Good.
Eat more.
Okay, this will really be the last.
Taste this.
That's good babe.
Ya.
Wait, I'll do it.
Check f it tastes good.
Passed ?
You know honey, the reason why I end all my meetings early is because I go home with this goodness.
Please ?
Let's not ru n other people's appetite.
You know, Gwen ...
Please attend to my brother's needs.
He's too envious with me.
I am not envious, bro.
We were just raised up to respect our food.
Am I disrespecting your food ?
What do you know ?
You don't have breeding, right ?
Chino.
Stop t.
You look upon me so degradingly.
Why ?
Are you clean ?
Hon, it's okay.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Let's eat.
It's alright.
Chino.
I'm sorry, babe.
I just can't stand be ng in the same room with that woman.
Chino, I need to tell you something.
I mean who the hell does she think she is ?
Chino please.
Must unknowingly mess with the Lee brothers
What do you mean by that ?
Women in our lives either end up on cloud 9, the basement or 6 feet under.
Aren't you over-reacting ?
I mean she seems okay.
Okay ?
What do you mean by okay ?
I had lunch with her.
We were talking this afternoon.
And what did she tell you ?
Well, she loves your brother so give her a break.
Gwen, I'm going to say this once, okay ?
I don't want you see ng that woman.
Stay away from her.
Chino.
Chino.
What are you plann ng ?
What am I do ng to you ?
I rema n s lent, and you're like a faggot who comes up here and talk a lot.
You even dare to talk with Gwen.
Why ?
Is it forbidden
Don't you want her to know that you enjoyed more with me than with her.
You've got boring sex I fe with her, right ?
I love Gwen.
Stay away from her, understand ?
Understand ?
Okay, you said it.
Chino.
What will Gwen do, if she sees us like this ?
Ma'am, you're looking for Sir chino ?
Yes.
He went to the sauna room.
Okay.
Chino.
Chino.
I'm done.
Now you can use t.
I don't know what to do now.
That's new.
The br ll ant chairman of the board, doesn't know what to do ?
Ian and Chino don't seem to get along well.
I feel like,
I need to choose between them.
Why do you have to choose ?
If you can make both of them happy.
How do I do that ?
Just give them what they want.
Like n video game,
You should handle the joystick.
How do I make the two of them happy ?
What are their guilty pleasures ?
What are we doing here, bro ?
Choose.
Are yous serious ?
Whichever ?
Whichever.
Whatever the price s ?
Your choice.
I know what's happening here.
You're gonna take this out of my trust fund, aren't you ?
Just consider this as bonus.
Okay.
Miss, what's this ?
It's the Volvo XC60
XC60 ?
Yes sir.
- Wow !
- Hurry up, before I change my mind.
I choose this one.
And here's the key, Sir so you could try it.
Alright.
All yours.
What's this ?
Just a show of love.
Beaut ful.
You're still lovelier.
Did you like it ?
Nice car.
Sorry, Lani.
My taste changes.
Oh come on, Chino.
The first time you saw me, you got harder down there.
Lani ... once I put spittle on it,
I don't like t anymore.
No, once you got your saliva on it you don't givel it away ?
You are the first one
So you have the right.
Promise, I'll make you happy just like before.
You know, Lani, women like you, will just bring disease to me.
Hon,
You know I love you, right ?
I wanna spend the rest of my I fe with you.
Are you proposing to me ?
Gwen ... will you marry me ?
Hey, what's wrong ?
Are you hav ng second thoughts ?
I just need to do something, Chino.
What s t ?
Chino ...
It's okay.
Of course, I'll marry you.
I just playing hard to get.
Yes.
Yes, you'll marry me ?
Yes.
You're gonna givel me a heart attack, you know that ?
.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Hold it,
I'll just lower down the heater maybe it's too hot.
It's not the water that you feel.
But my heated up blood.
Lani ...
Do you love Chino already ?
You're getting married ?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
You mean t's an accident ?
A person doesn't fall n love by acc dent.
Lani, Chino is a good person.
Whatever happened between the two of you before
Forget about it.
Forgive him.
It happened already.
You had everything.
You were the one who got a good like in America.
What about me ?
What ?
I got rotten in Angeles.
You left me there.
You owe me this one.
I didn't mean to leave you there.
I didn't wish to go to America and leave you and Ma.
You're my sister.
I'm just doing this because I want to help you.
But this is wrong already.
This is too much.
It isn't right.
We're sisters.
We're both stupid when it comes to love.
But do you know our difference ?
I am just stupid.
You're a traitor.
If you'll continue your plan on Chino.
That plan,
I'm telling you,
I'll tell everything to him.
Are you threatening me ?
If you're telling me that you accidentally fell in-love with Chino,
What if I tell you that you acc dentally slipped and drown in jacuzzi.
Be careful, sis.
This is my last.
You okay ?
.
How's the wine ?
Bro.
I know who's you are with.
She's familiar.
Hold it.
Aren't you Chino's friend ?
Yes, sir.
Mon.
Mon.
I've seen her before.
I just can't remember when ...
When was that ?
Seems like ...
Let him be co'z he's drunk
Hold it, bro.
She's my friend.
Sam, let's go ...
Sammy.
Ya, it's okay.
He's drunk.
- You're brother, dude.
- He's drunk.
He's Drunk, Let him be.
I felt hum I ated.
Let me go.
That's Chino's girl.
Your brother has tasted her.
Mon !
Chino.
Let's just talk outs de, bro.
Hold t, what happened ?
Mon was killed.
And they were told that your brother was the one who killed him ...
What ?
What does my brother has to do with this ?
Mon was last seen drunk in an event.
They were gossiping that your brother had him killed.
What ?
Daniel, you know that my brother won't do it.
I'll talk to Mon's loved ones.
Dude, maybe next time.
They're still sensitive right now.
Come on, I'll go with you.
Let's go out guys.
Bro ...
What do you know about Mon's death ?
What ?
Mon's family believes that you asked someone to kill him.
Why would I do that ?
Because of Ian ?
Yes, I got mad ...
He showed rudeness to my wife.
But that's not a reason to kill a person.
Can't you see it, bro ?
That woman brings bad luck to you.
People are dying.
And now you're a suspect ?
Chino, people can talk all they want.
But my conscience is clean.
And Lani isn't a jinx to me.
She's the best thing that happened to me.
And no one can tear us apart.
Not even you.
Lani, let's talk.
We don't have anything to talk about.
Lani, be careful with sammy.
If he finds out everything, it's going to be dangerous.
You're interested even with sammy ?
Yes, that's right, isn't it ?
You're greedy.
You want everything to be yours.
If Sammy finds out about your plan of revenge against Chino, you'll be damned.
He should be scared of me.
Even you.
Co'z I wouldn't let you take away Chino.
I'll find a way to get him from you.
Hi, Gwen.
We're going somewhere.
I'll follow you.
He's crazy over me.
Like how Chino got crazy over me before.
Just wait.
I'll take him away from you.
What are we doing here ?
I think it's time.
Time ?
That we start a new family.
You mean, baby ?
We weren't thinking of a puppy.
Don't you want to enjoy our company first ?
Just the two of us.
Lani, honey ... you're still young.
I'm not.
I want to somehow be capable of chasing our kids.
Not like I'm be ng assisted up walking.
I don't want to have one for now.
Why ?
I'm not yet ready.
What do you need to be ready ?
Time.
We're okay.
All we need is a child.
You're not the one who's going to give birth ?
You're not the one who'll get pregnant.
Hi, Sir.
Hi, Ma'am.
What are you looking for ?
We're talking, don't butt in.
I'm sorry, sir.
What's up, man ?
Chino, how's it going ?
Hey, bro.
Hi.
Hi, Gwen.
Dude, haven't you heard ?
There's already a suspect in Mon's murder.
You're brother is off the hook.
Who killed Mon ?
It's a senseless killing.
An addict who picked on Mon.
He was a target for robbery.
Then he got into it.
Oh, babe.
I feel bad, for assum ng that it was my brother.
You were so doubtful about him.
He's thinking too much.
That people has bad intentions.
That's why I don't know what s t that you like about my friend.
I don't know, too.
Really ?
Ya,
You're the one who's crazy about me.
What ?
It's you who's saying a lot of things.
Have you been here that long ?
Yes.
We've been dancing
- Now we're just relaxig "Chino, help me.
Your brother will kill me."
Oh my god.
We should've been here early.
We'll actually, we got caught in heavy traffic going here ...
And then had to put some ...
Excuse me, babe.
You don't mind if I step out a bit ?
Why ?
My friend has an emergency.
I'll just go there.
Where ?
Bro, I'll take care of her.
I'll bring Gwen home.
- Are you sure ?
- I'll come back for you.
I'll take care of her.
I'll just go back.
Okay.
Okay.
It's okay.
Gwen, don't worry.
I'll take care of you.
Let's have one drink and then ...
Guys, cheers !
What are you doing there ?
What happened to you ?
Your brother hurt me.
Why ?
He wants to have a baby.
I told him that I'm not ready yet.
He got pissed off on me.
We argued.
He hurt me.
Hurt ?
You don't seem like you got hurt.
What's your drama ?
Oh my god.
Come on.
Get up, Lani.
Come on.
Slowly.
"Do you know what Chino's doing with me right ow ?"
O, Gwen.
Can you drive me home ?
Come on.
Let's have some fun and dance.
Sorry, I have an emergency.
One drink, please.
Never mind, I'll just take a cab.
Gwen, Chino told me to take care of you.
He told me to bring you home.
Gwen.
"Chino, if you truly love lani, I will not get in the way."
Hey, listen up.
I would like to propose a toast.
Okay ?
Baby, stand up.
To the best woman n the world ...
To the love of my life ...
Best cook ...
Best lover ...
Enough.
Hey.
My little brother !
You know my brother, ya ?
Chino.
I love him so much, too.
I stood up as your parent since you were a kid.
I'll do anything for you brother.
You're late.
Come on, p ck up, pick up.
Join us.
Bobby.
Bobby ...
Good friend Bobby.
Chino, Lani.
Take him upstairs.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, bro.
No, wait.
- Sammy let's go.
- That's enough
- Come on.
- Let's go Bro ...
Come on.
Where's Gwen ?
She's gone.
Why ?
She found out about us.
Mom ...
Since your new family brought you to America,
Lani didn't stop finding some ways to follow you there.
She sought the help of foundations that might help locate your father.
But everything failed.
I was forb dden by the social worker to communicate with you.
They told me that ... it'll be better to focus on my new family so I could easily adjust.
I'm sorry.
I understand you, dear.
I should be the one who should ask for forgiveness.
I was forced to have you adopted.
I can't raise two kids at that time.
But Lani, she didn't stop to reach her dream.
Spent her whole time on the Internet.
Hoping to find a man who will take her abroad.
I don't know with your sister.
Her weakness is a man.
Mom, I'm nervous for Lani.
She might get into deep trouble wh le doing her revenge on Chino.
She lost her baby because of Chino's brother.
Those rich people are animals.
They hit your sister like a cat.
Mom, hold it.
You mean Lani got pregnant.
Didn't she tell you ?
Chino.
Babe.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Gwen,
Gwen, I messed up.
I messed up big.
Look.
I ...
I don't know where to start.
I don't know how to tell you in a way that you wouldn't get hurt.
I'll admit that Ian and I has history.
And the reason why I know she's one of them girls because
I used to mess around with her
a long, long time ago.
But I promise you,
It didn't mean anything, Gwen.
Babe, I'm really, really sorry for my ndiscretion with her
I know and you witness it.
If you have done something wrong,
I've got a b gger m stake than you.
No, babe, you didn't do anything wrong.
This is all me.
I know what you're talking about.
I know it because she's my sister.
Sister ?
Hold on.
Gwen, what are you saying ?
Chino, we're not just sisters.
We're the best of friends.
We lost touch until a year ago.
A year ago.
I got a call from her, she told me,
she wants to get back to the man who cheated on her.
I felt bad for her.
I thought that maybe it's the only way to make it up to her.
So I looked for you.
The plan is ... to make you fall n love with me.
And then after that, I'll hurt you.
But ...
But I fell in love with you.
Gwen,
Your sister s mad at me.
Why did she marry my brother ?
Because she got pregnant before, didn't you know that ?
You are the father,
And your brother is the reason why ...
I got Lani pregnant ?
You didn't know ?
Your brother was the reason why she lost the baby.
Rise and shine.
What time is it ?
Pack up your things.
Why ?
We're hav ng our second honeymoon
You, me, just the trees and cr ckets.
No cellphone, no internet, no one will disturb us.
Why do we have to go far ?
For us not to be stressed.
So we could have a good vacation.
Sammy started with foul words.
He would call me all sorts of names.
Until he slaps me sometimes.
It depends on his moods.
If he has good mood, it would be rough sex.
If he's in bad mood, he becomes a sadist.
He taught me how to use coca ne.
He sells me to his friends.
I got hooked up with drugs.
Because.
That's my only way to escape with what I'm going through.
I want to d e a couple of times.
He would chain me.
Piss on my face.
That's why when Papa died,
I know he was the one who called PDEA to arrest me.
Because he doesn't want anyone to partake the inher tance.
Lani is with sammy right now.
I'm worried.
He takes me to an isolated place.
Along with other girls who taste his sadism.
A hidden place where ...
No one can hear us.
And no one will witness.
This is nice, right ?
It's just that it's too hidden.
Even if we scream here, no one will hear us.
What if we're too late ?
Honey ?
Let's go downstairs.
Okay, I'll follow.
Okay.
You really think I didn't know that you and your sister are making fool of me and my brother.
Do you think I'm stupid ?
I refused to accept what I saw.
But I started ...
To open my eyes and ears.
He should be scared of me.
You should, too.
Co'z I wouldn't let you take Chino away from me.
I'll do everything to get him from you.
Until I saw with my very own eyes.
Damn you.
You are the only woman I loved.
Do you know that ?
How does my brother make out with you ?
Like this ?
Like this ?
Who's better ?
Him or me ?
Who ?
Sammy, that's enough.
How does he kiss you ?
How does he kiss you ?
Sammy, that's enough.
Lani !
Lani, what happened to you ?
Your brother !
He's hurting me !
Where is he ?
He's inside the house.
Bro !
Bro, I know now everything.
Bro, let's talk.
Bro !
Bro don't do this.
This is all my fault.
Don't ruin your life because of me.
Bro !
Chino !
What are you doing ?
I'm glad you came, bro.
Did you know that these sisters have been making a fool out of us ?
Don't tell me you came here for her.
To save this whore.
I came for you.
Why are you doing this ?
This is enough.
This is wrong.
Don't do this.
You know, since you were a kid
I promised mom, that I'd take care of you.
That's why I'm tell ng you.
No one can get between the two of us.
I know that, bro.
But what you're doing sn't right ...
It isn't really right !
Co'z I wouldn't let that these two will get between us.
That's why they should get out of our way.
Gwen !
Bro !
Enough !
I told you, it's enough.
Chino, let me go.
Don't do this, bro.
Gwen !
Bro !
Gwen !
That's enough !
Don't interfere !
Enough !
Gwenl

Have a nice day.
I wrote this music and I wrote these songs... to accompany a play.
A play about my hometown, which is a shipyard town in the North of England.
When I think of the environment I was raised in, these streets and this ship, such a huge part of our identity, part of who we were... and...
I am fiercely proud of it.
It's all there in my gospels
The Magdalene girl, comes to pay her respects
But her mind is awhirl, when she finds the tomb empty
The stone had been rolled
Not a sign of a corpse, in the dark and the cold
When she reaches the door, sees an unholy sight
There's this solitary figure, in a halo of light
He just carries on floating past Calvary Hill
In an almighty hurry, aye, but she might catch him still
Tell me where are ye going Lord, and why in such haste?
Now don't hinder me woman, I've no time to waste
For they're launching a boat on the morrow at noon
And I have to be there before daybreak
Oh, I cannae be missing, the lads'll expect me
Why else would the good Lord himself... resurrect me, for nothing will stop me, I have to prevail
Through the teeth of this tempest, in the mouth of a gale
May the angels protect me, if all else should fail
When the last ship sails
Oh, the roar of the chains, and the cracking of timbers
The noise at the end of the world in your ears
As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea
And the last ship sails
It's that strange kind of beauty, it's cold and austere
And whatever it was, that ye've done to be here
It's the sum of your hopes, your despairs and your fears
When the last ship sails
Whoa, the first to arrive, saw these signs in the east
Like that strange moving finger at Balthazar's Feast
Where they asked the advice of some wandering priest
And the sad ghosts of men whom they'd thought long deceased
And whatever got said they'd be counted at least
When the last ship sails
Oh, the roar of the chains, and the cracking of timbers
The noise at the end of the world in your ears
As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea
And the last ship sails
And whatever you'd promised, whatever you've done
And whatever the station in life you've become
In the name of the Father, in the name of the Son
And whatever the weave of this life that you've spun
On the Earth or in Heaven, or under the sun
When the last ship sails
Oh, the roar of the chains, and the cracking of timbers
The noise at the end of the world in your ears
As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea
And the last ship
Saaaaaails.
Welcome, everybody.
I'm delighted to be here because I'm, I'm presenting some brand-new songs for the first time in almost a decade.
All of these songs you'll hear tonight, or most of them, anyway, have been inspired by the writing of a play.
Now, you're not going to see the play tonight.
Although one of our leading men is right here by me, Mr. Jimmy Nail.
What you're going to hear, what you're going to hear is the the raw material from which this play is being carved, or constructed, or pieced together.
That's not a collage, it's the picture of my street, the street I was born and raised in, and when I was old enough to walk out the front door,
I turned south towards the river, and that's what I'd see.
This mighty ship at the end the street, blotting out the sky and the sun for most, most of the year.
It was quite a sight.
But it was a surreal, industrial landscape, and every morning I'd watch thousands of men walk to work, down that hill, to work on the ships.
I'd watch them come back at night.
I wondered if that was my destiny.
I didn't want it.
I was frightened of the shipyard.
It was noisy and dangerous.
Those men, though, were tough, and proud.
They worked in terrible conditions, but were fiercely proud of the ships they built.
They built the largest ships ever constructed on Planet Earth, right at the end of my street.
So this play is about my community, the community I come from.
And this next song, which is probably the first that I wrote in the series, some of that community present themselves.
They talk about who they are, what they do.
Their hopes, their passions, their fears for the future.
Mr. Nail, would you take the floor?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
Oh, my name is Jackie White, and I'm the foreman of the yard
And ye don't mess with Jackie on this quayside
Why, I'm as hard as iron plate, woe betide ye if you're late
When we have to push the boat out on a spring tide
Now ye could die and hope for Heaven, but ye'd need to work your shift
And I'd expect yous all to back me to the hilt
And if St. Peter at his gate were to ask ye why you're late
Why you'd tell him that ye had to get a ship built
We've built battleships and cruisers for Her Majesty the Queen
Super tankers for Onassis and all the classes in between
We built the greatest shipping tonnage that the world has ever seen
But the only life we've known is in the shipyard...
Come on, boys!
Steel in the stockyard, iron in the soul
We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole
And I don't know what we'll do if the yard gets sold
For the only life we've known is in the shipyard
All the platers and the welders and the boiler-making crews
When they see that beggar finished on the slipway, oh!
All the hardship's soon forgot and we'll cheer as like as not
And the bairns'll wave their Union Jacks all day
Ah, it's a patriotic scene, all that's missing is the Queen
But she said she couldn't make it of a Tuesday
Then something wells up here inside, and you could take it in your stride
But you wonder if you'll see another payday
For there's a mixture of emotions, hatred, gratitude and pride
And you hate yourself for crying, but it's difficult to hide
For there's a sadness in the launching, you worry what's ahead
And that worry never leaves ye, it keeps on nagging in your head
And so ye pray to God for orders, but ye'll worry till you're dead
Until they bury your remains in the blacksmith's shed
And the only life you've known is in the shipyard.
Come on!
Steel in the stockyard, iron in the soul
We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole
And I don't know what we'll do if the yard gets sold
For the only life we've known is in the shipyard
Aye, in the shipyard.
Come on, Tom!
Me name is Tommy Thompson, I'm shop steward for the Union
- Me dream is proletarian revolution
- Go on, Tom!
Comrades, brothers, fellow travellers and others
Class struggle is the means of dialectic evolution
Das Kapital's me Bible, and the ruling class are liable
And quoting Marx and Engels it's entirely justifiable
If the workers' revolution here is ever to be viable
And we become the rightful owners of the shipyard
So, it's a one-day stoppage or an overtime ban
Or a work to rule for the Five Year Plan
Till the means of production are safely in our hands
And we become the rightful owners of the shipyard
I'm not saying it won't be hard if the boss hands us me cards
And they try to close us down like other shipyards
And if industrial action only helps the competition
As I've heard the bosses bleating from their usual position
And I stand accused of anarchy, disruption and sedition
Well, ye'll never knock us down, you reactionary clowns
When it's time for occupation of the shipyard
My name is Peggy White
And I've nursed ye through your injuries
- And your cuts and wounds I've bound.
- Come on, Peg!
Busted arms and busted heads, broken backs and broken legs
I'd sooner put ye in a splint than have them put ye in the ground
And the fumes from all the welding where the poison air is hung
And the toxic radiation that's been blackening your tongue
I could give yous all an aspirin while you're coughing up your lungs
But it's all you'll ever get here in this shipyard.
- Adrian Sanderson!
- Just putting me hat on.
Be patient, will you?
You're on, kid!
Ah, me name is Adrian Sanderson, and the river is me trade
But it's intellectual discourse I'm known better for
I may forego English grammar when I'm injured by the hammer
But I've a preference for the deference of a metaphor
I've read The Odyssey by Homer, and the Iliad as well
- I've read Tacitus and Pliny
- Aye, aye, and the Scarlet Pimpernel
I've spent a night shift down with Dante on his journey into Hell
And that's what we'll all be facing, if this yard's put up to sell
For the only life we've known is in the shipyard...
- Shall I go on?
- Go on.
Now about those Trojan wars and the troubles that they caused,
- when they sailed off on that summer's afternoon?
- Yes.
Because the ship they had was crap, and they lost their bloody map
When they tried to get themselves back to the tomb
There's a lesson in these tales although they happened ages past
Just like Spartacus, that film by Stanley Kubricks
First it's tragedy then farce, then they'll kick you up the arse
When you tempt the gods with arrogance and hubris
Well, it's obvious I'm gifted with the rhyming and the meter
- And hereabouts I'm thought of highly as a bard!
- As a bard.
And if I wasn't shooting rivets, I'd be famous in me time
All those literary circles, I could dazzle with me rhyme
I've never lacked ambition, you can say it was a crime
For rivets may be riveting, but sonnets are sublime
And the only life we've known is in the shipyard...
Come on, lads!
Steel in the stockyard, iron in the soul
We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole
But we don't know what we'll do if this yard gets sold
For the only life we've known is in the shipyard...
Oh, here he comes, Davy Harrison, the town drunk!
- Are you all right, Davy?
- Davy!
Oh, me name is Davy Harrison, I like a drink or two
You could ask me when it started, and I haven't got a clue
I'm ever never miserable, I'm never ever blue
And I'll still be up tomorrow for the shipyard
I drink meself into a stupor, and I wake up with two heeds
And then the missus starts complaining', about all me drunken deeds
Like when I got the train to Sunderland...
- ... but found meself in Leeds
- Leeds!
And I had to get up early for the shipyards
You know I once gave up the drinking
It was 1963
But it seems as if sobriety was not the thing for me
It was the worst... three hours, I ever hope to see
Steel in the stockyard, iron in the soul
We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole
And the ship sets sail, and the tale gets told
And the only life we've known is in the shipyard
Steel in the stockyard, iron in the soul
We'll get the bastard finished and we'll end up on the dole
And we don't know what we'll do if the yard gets sold
The only life we've ever known is in the
Shipyaaaaard.
Thank you!
So... so without giving too much of the play away, because I want you to come out and see it eventually, um...
It does have a love story, and our leading man is a man called Gideon.
He's been away from this town for 14 years.
He went away to sea.
He left under a bit of a cloud.
He doesn't like the place, but he's back because his Dad's died, and he needs to sort some things out, but there's also, some other ghosts he needs to lay, some unfinished business.
This is Gideon's song.
Oh, I know I've come home for a reason
But that reason escapes me now
The engine's ceased and the wind from the east
Cleared the fog off the starboard bow
Well, here's the mouth of the river that spawned me
I feel like a stranger here
How long has it been, well, I haven't been seen... in these parts for 14 years
Yes, these are the streets where I once played
Where some debt of the soul was left unpaid
And the place the old man's bones are laid
And coming home, coming home's not easy
I wonder if she still lives round here
That girl I've been missing these 14 years
She's probably married, with kids of her own by now
By now.
This town, this stain on the sunrise
Disguised in the mist this morning
It's 8am
A seagull shouts a sailor's warning
This sky, this bend in the river
Slows down and delivers me
The tide rolls back
And all my memories fade to black
And yet, and yet, I'm back
This town has a strange magnetic pull
Like a homing signal in your skull
And you sail by the stars of the hemisphere
Wondering how in the hell did you end up here?
It's like an underground river, or a hidden stream
That flows through your head and haunts your dreams
And you stuffed those dreams in this canvas sack
And there's nothing round here that the wide world lacks
And yet, and yet, you're back
Some nights I'd lie on the deck and I'd stare
At the turning of the stars
Those constellations hanging up there
From the cables and the rigging
I'd wonder if she saw the same
Or managed to recall my name
Why would she ever think of me?
Some boy she loved who fled to sea?
And why waste time debating, whether she'd be waiting, for the likes of me?
So you drift into port with the scum of the seas
To the dance halls and the brothels where you took your ease
And the ship's left the dock but you're half past caring
You haven't got a clue whose bed you're sharing
And your head's like a hammer on a bulkhead door
And it feels like somebody might have broken your jaw
And there's bloodstains and glass all over the floor
And you swear to God you'll drink no more
And yet, and yet
In truth, it's too late to find her
Too late to remind her at some garden gate
Where a servant tells me I should wait
And perhaps a door's slammed in my face
My head must be in outer space
And yet, and yet
Before the sun has set
Before the sea
There may be something else that's waiting for... the likes of me
This town, this stain on the sunrise.
When August winds are turning
The fishing boats set out upon the sea
I watch till they sail out of sight
The winter follows soon
I watch them drawn into the night
Beneath the August moon
And no-one knows I come here
Some things I don't share
I can't explain the reasons why
It moves me close to tears
Or something in the season's change
Will find me wandering here
And in my public moments
I hear the things I say, but they're not me
Perhaps I'll know before I die
Admit that there's a reason why
I count the boats returning to the sea
I count the boats returning to the sea
And in my private moments
I drop the mask that I've been forced to wear
But no-one knows this secret me
Where albeit unconsciously
I count the boats returning from the sea
I count the boats returning from the sea
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oooooooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oooooooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Thank you.
So the shipyard will close, with terrible results for this community.
The men who had such pride, and such dignity, a sense of self, will be robbed of that.
Robbed of their work, their jobs.
A parish priest decides he needs to do something about his community, his parish.
He has this wacky, quixotic, even Homeric idea.
He wants the men to occupy their shipyard, and build a ship for themselves.
Eventually, he convinces them because they realise they have nothing else.
And in my dialect they would say,
"What have we got?
We've got nowt else", and this is their song.
- Good people, give ear to me story
- Steady!
Pay attention, and none of your lip
- For I've brought you five lads and their daddy
- And their daddy!
Intending to build yous a ship
Wallsend is wor habitation
It's the place we was all born and bred
And there's nae finer lads in the nation
And none are more gallantly led...
One, two, three!
- What have we got
- But the buzzer in the morning?
- And what have we got
- But the laying of a keel?
- And what have we got
- But the cranes above us soaring?
The commotion and the clamour in the welding of the steel?
- What have we got
- But the mist upon the river?
- And what have we got
- But that noise inside the hold?
- What have we got
- But the arse end of the weather?
Where we work in horizontal rain and shiver in the cold
What do we got?
We've got nowt We've got nowt else
What do we got?
We've got nowt We've got nowt else
- What have we got
- But the singing in the cables?
- What have we got
- But the ringing in your ears?
- What have ye got
- But the telling of the fables?
And the ghosts of all them ships, that we've been building donkey's years
What do we got?
We've got nowt We've got nowt else
What do we got?
We've got nowt We've got nowt else...
You're standing for your tea break.
You're up to here in shite.
You're dying for a cigarette, you're desperate for a light.
And then the gaffer pulls along with his drop sheet and he reads,
"Tea break's over, gentlemen, now get back on your heids. "
- What's it say in the papers?
- What does it say on the news?
- They say we've all gone bloody daft.
- Oh, what have we got to lose?
- What would I get for murder?
- What would I get for life?
- What do I get for a capital crime?
- What'll I tell me wife?
- What do you get for your politics?
- What do you get for your vote?
- What have you got at the end of the day?
- A great big bloody boat!
Aye, you've got to die of something, it's written in your fate!
Ye might as well die next Tuesday, and woe betide you're late.
Come on!
Ah-ah-ah...
- What have ye got
- All you men what's fit and able?
- What have ye got
- For the straining in your neck?
- What have ye got
- When you're laid out on the table?
And the snapping of a cable when the rigging hits the deck?
- What have ye got
- But the loyalty of brothers?
- What have ye got
- But the punching of the clock?
- What have ye got
- You reactionary clowns!
Well, ye'll never knock us down, cos we're the union of the dock!
- What do we got?
- What do we got?
- We've got nowt
- We've got nowt else
- Hey!
What do we got?
- What do we got?
- We've got nowt
- We've got nowt else
- What do we got?
- What do we got?
- We've got nowt
- We've got nowt else
- What do we got?
- What do we got?
We've got nowt
We've gooot nooowt eeeeeeeeeeeelse.
So, you know, I didn't enter the musical theatre blithely thinking it would be easy.
It's not.
The landscape is strewn with bleached corpses on either side.
What I hadn't realised is just how precise and exacting a medium it is.
You know.
I had a fantastic team of collaborators.
My first collaborator was Brian Yorkey, prize-winning, Pulitzer-winning...
Um, a fantastic director, Joe Mantello... and, um and another prize winning writer, John Logan... and, um and occasionally they would tell me that, um, a song I'd written wasn't quite right.
Now, this is novel for me.
But you know it's hard for me as my finest couplets are being thrown in a bin and I'm spluttering my flimsy protests.
But every song in a musical fights for its life, every character fights for its life, every verse in every song fights for its life.
Every line, every word is scrutinised with an intensity that's unusual.
Um, the next two songs are a case in point.
I envisaged an older character called Arthur, who's about my age, who falls in love with a much younger woman.
It's a common thing.
Um, this song is called Practical Arrangement, and it goes like this.
Am I asking for the moon?
Is it really so implausible?
That you and I could soon, come to some kind of arrangement?
I'm not asking for the moon
I've always been a realist
When it's really nothing more, than a simple rearrangement
With one roof above our heads, a warm house to return to
We could start with separate beds
I could sleep alone, or learn to
I'm not suggesting that we'd find, some earthly paradise for ever
I mean how often does that happen now?
The answer's probably never
But if we came to an arrangement
A practical arrangement
And you could learn to love me, given time
Well, I like my independence,
I get by, I'm not greedy
Do you see yourself as Galahad?
Do I really look that needy?
I brought a child up on my own
It takes me all my strength to face him
The father upped and left me
And I'm not desperate to replace him
Tell me what kind of catch is a struggling single mother?
I respect you, and I like you
But I won't accept another... empty promise
When some grey and stormy rain cloud hangs above me
When I've heard it all 100 times, from a man who said he loved me
But if we came to an arrangement
A practical arrangement
Then perhaps I'd learn to love you... given time
I'm not promising the moon
I'm not promising a rainbow
Just a practical solution, to a solitary life
I'd be a father to your boy
A shoulder you could lean on
How bad could it be... to be my wife?
With one roof above our heads, a warm house to return to
You wouldn't have to cook for me
You wouldn't have to learn to
I'm not suggesting that we find... some earthly paradise for ever
I've no intention of deceiving you... you're far too clever
But if we come to an arrangement
A practical arrangement
Then perhaps you'd learn to love me... given time
It may not be the romance that you had in mind
But you could learn to love me... given time.
So... so that song was in the play for a while.
And then one Monday morning I turned up for work and my dramatic collaborators were sitting there at a table.
It looked like an intervention was about to take place.
I said "What's up?" They said,
- "Uh, Arthur. " - "What about him?"
- "Practical Arrangement. " - "Yes?"
"Can't be in the play. " I said, "Come on.
"It's a great, I mean, you know... "
And I was really thinking, you know, Arthur is me.
He's my age.
You know this is, this is me!
I said, "Well why?
What's the reason?" They said, "Well, as soon as he opens his mouth,
"he's clearly lost the girl.
He's not going to get this girl.
"We need the rival to Gideon to be viable.
"To be young, to be virile. "
So...
I know, I know.
And it took me a good month of struggling with this issue... and then one day I woke up and said, "You know. "You put yourself in the way.
"Get out of the way.
"Write a song for this character.
"This young, virile character, even though you don't like him.
Write a song for him.
So, I came up with this...
There's a house on the hill that's come up for sale
It's a place I've known since I was a lad
And it needs a lick of paint and a hammer and a nail
But it's part of a boyhood dream I've always had
I'd climb up the hill with the Evening News
I'd been sent from the town to deliver
And I'd stand in the porch, and gaze at the views
Till my eyes were bruised by the sunset's glow on the river
I'd imagine a girl who would share my life
As dreamers'll tend to do
And the face I always conjured up
Was always no-one... else but you
What say you, Meg?
What's this story's ending?
I want you, Meg, by my side
What's the use, Meg, to gaze at a view on your own
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and health
I will see, this through, Meg
No chance, of this ending
Such a view, Meg, as we gaze from the house on the hill
To love and to cherish, to have and to hold
I'm a hard man to beat, if I may be so bold
And I promise it all by the sweat of my brow
Tell me what, say you, Meg now?
What say you, Meg?
How's this story shaping?
I want you, Meg, as we gaze from the house on the hill
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and health
I'd be hard to replace, if I say so myself
And I promise it all by the sweat of my brow
Tell me what... say you, Meg now?
...now?
Thank you.
So... another theme in our play is the perennial struggle between fathers and sons.
Something I know a little bit about.
You know, sometimes a father will not appreciate the scope of a son's ambition.
And a son will not realise that a father cares for him when he thinks is being, just being controlled.
In my community there's a phrase called dead man's boots.
Dead man's boots really indicates how difficult it is to get a job.
Uh, you'd only get a job if someone died, so they called it dead man's boots.
And when your father gets you a job in the shipyard and you say; "No" that's trouble.
You said, you see these work boots in my hands, they probably fit you now, my son
Take them, they're a gift from me, why don't you try them on?
It would do your old man good, to see you walking in these boots one day
And take your place among the men, who work upon the slipway
These dead man's boots though they're old and curled
When a feller needs a job, and a place in the world
When it's time for a man to put down roots
And walk to the river in his old man's boots
He was dying, son, and asking that you do one final thing, you see?
You were barely but a sapling, and you thought you were a tree
If you need a seed to prosper, you must first put down some roots
He wanted you to settle in your old man's boots
These dead man's boots know their way down the hill
They could walk there themselves and they probably will
There's a place for you there to sink your roots
And take a walk down the river in your old man's boots
I said, "Why the hell would I do that?"
Why would I agree?
When his hand was all that I'd received
As far as I remember
It's not as if he'd spoiled me
With his kindness up to then, you see
I'd a plan of me own and I'd quit this place
When I came of age September
These dead man's boots know their way down the hill
They can walk there themselves and they probably will
I'd plenty of choices, plenty other routes
And he'd never see me walking in these dead man's boots
What was it made him think
I'd be happy ending up like him?
When he'd hardly got two ha'pennies left, or a broken pot to piss in
He wanted this same thing for me, was that his final wish?
- So, what the hell are you going to do, lad?
- I said, "Anything but this!"
These dead man's boots know their way down the hill
They can walk there themselves and they probably will
But they won't walk with me cos I'm off the other way
I've had it up to here, I'm going to have my say
When all ye've got left is that cross on the wall
I want nothing from you, I want nothing at all
Not a pension, nor a pittance, when your whole life is through
Get this through your head, I'm nothing like you
I'm done with all the arguments, there'll be no more disputes
And you'll die before you see me in your dead man's boots.
Most of the people on the stage come from the North East of England.
Um, and we have five brothers here from my neck of the woods.
They're called the Wilson Family.
Um...
I actually, actually thought I was hiring the Beach Boys, but I was...
Pretty soon I figured they weren't.
They're going to sing a song which was a poem by Rudyard Kipling written in 1911, called Big Steamers.
And the music was by Peter Bellamy, and this is the Wilson Family.
Oh, where are you going to all, you big steamers?
With England's own coal, up and down the salt seas?
We are going to fetch you, your bread and your butter
Your beef, pork, and mutton, eggs, apples and cheese
And where will you fetch it from, all you big steamers?
And where shall I write you, when you are away?
We'll fetch it from Melbourne, Quebec and Vancouver
Address us at Hobart, Hong Kong and Bombay
But if anything happened to all, you big steamers
Suppose you were wrecked, up and down the salt sea?
And you'd have no coffee or bacon for breakfast
And you'd have no muffins or toast for your tea
Then I'll pray for fine weather
For all you big steamers
With little blue billows, and breezes so soft
Oh, billows and breezes don't bother big steamers
We're iron below and steel rigging aloft
Then I'll build a new lighthouse, for all you big steamers
With plenty wise pilots, for to pilot you through
Oh, the Channel's as bright as a ballroom already
And pilots are thicker than pilchards at Looe
Then what can I do for you, all you big steamers?
Oh, what can I do, for your comfort and good?
Send out your big warships to watch your big waters
That no-one may stop us from bringing you food
For the bread that you eat, and the biscuits you nibble
The sweets that you suck, and the joints that you carve
They are brought to you daily by all us big steamers
And if any one hinders our coming you will staaaaaaarve!
That's the Wilson Family.
This next song concerns the mild hazing that would go on when an apprentice had his first day at the shipyard.
You'd be sent for some spurious nonexistent, um, item like a left-handed screwdriver, a glass hammer or you might be sent for a long wait.
In this case our hapless apprentice is going to be played by Jimmy.
He does hapless very well.
He's going to be sent for a brace, that's two, a brace of sky hooks.
Presumably something that you hook onto the sky.
He's going to be sent for a packet of nail holes, and finally two cans of tartan paint.
Thank you.
Oh, and I'm going to make my debut on the spoons in New York City.
I almost forgot.
Me first day in the shipyard, the gaffer says to me
I want ye to go to the store lad, and get a few things, do you see?
Now here's a list, can you read, lad?
Can you read it back to me?
And me and the boys'll listen while we're having our morning tea
Now reading was me pride, when I left school at 14
There wouldn't be no problem here, I'd show them I was keen
But when I starts to reading, they just couldn't hold their mirth
Splitting their sides and spluttering, like they was giving birth
First off a brace of sky hooks, and a packet of nail holes neat
And then three cans of tartan paint, and that's me task complete
The gaffer swipes me on the heid, and sends me on me way, he says;
"Don't come back empty-handed lad, or I'll have to dock your all pay"
So he gets to the store all nervous, and the quartermaster's there
He pulls the list out of his pocket, and he starts to read all square
Well, he hadn't barely finished, when the storeman's face turns red
He gives him such an evil look, he thought he'd soon be dead!
First off a brace of sky hooks, and a packet of nail holes neat
And then three cans of tartan paint, and that's me task complete
The storeman swipes me on the heid, and sends me on me way
With a kick in the arse for good measure, and such was my first day...
On the violin, Kathryn Tickell, thank you.
It's Julian Sutton on the melodeon, please.
So, I get back home that evening, and me mother says to me
"How was it, son?
How was your day?
Sit down and have some tea!"
I told her of the list I'd read, and the trouble I was in
I couldn't go back tomorrow else, the gaffer'd have me skinned
First off a brace of sky hooks, and a packet of nail holes neat
And then three cans of tartan paint, and that's me task complete
Me mother swipes me on the heid, and sends me on me way
With a kick in the arse for me efforts, and such was my first day
First off a brace of sky hooks, and a packet of nail holes neat
And then three cans of tartan paint, and that's me task complete
Me mother swipes me on the heid, and sends me on me way
With a kick in the arse for me efforts, and such was my first
Daaaaaaaay.
It was a doozy!
So, I have a very good friend that I've known for many years.
Mr. Billy Connolly, the actor and comedian.
Before he was a famous actor and comedian he worked in the shipyards as a welder in Glasgow, in Scotland, and he told me some stuff about welders that I found very amusing.
He said all welders are crazy.
They're crazy because of the welding fumes that they have to ingest for eight-hour shifts.
Also, they're all practical jokers.
You should never let a welder get behind you or he'll weld your heels, the steel toecaps to the deck and you'll fall over.
The other thing about welders is all of them sing.
All of them.
Because in the... welder's helmet there's a natural echo chamber.
So they all think they're Elvis Presley.
They sing all day.
So this idea really tickled me, and I wrote this next song.
It's called Jock The Singing Welder.
Any shipyard man can sing, when he works upon the hull
Amongst the noise and the clamour that he all but disregards
So he'll sing to himself, and no-one pays him any mind
He's just another crazy welder in the shipyards
But inside this welder's helmet, if you'll let me demonstrate
When the mask is in position, and the fumes accumulate
There's the finest echo chamber, with a sound that can't be beat
Where I'm the king of rock'n'roll, and the world is at me feet
And it may not sound like much to all them jokers on the squad
But inside of here I'm singing with the voice of fuckin' God
I'm Jock the singing welder, heavy metal, rock'n'roll, jazz, blues, roots reggae, country, rockabilly, soul
When I'm singing, well, you'd best lock up your daughters and your mothers
I'm Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochrane, I'm the missing Everly Brother
I'm Jock the singing welder, I'm heading for the heights
I'm Jock the singing welder and the Acetylene Lights
Well, I'm more than just a welder, and I'm telling you my name
And one day you'll see it blazoned in the rockin' hall of fame
I've got these songs in my head, I've got this dancing in my bones
I'm Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, I'm Tom fuckin' Jones
I'm Jock the singing welder, I'm heading for the heights
I'm Jock the singing welder and the Acetylene lights...
Yeah, yeah, yeah,...
Uh-huh-huh
Uh-huh-huh
Uh-huh-huh
Uh-huh-huh
Uh-huh-huh
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Uh-huh-huh
Uh-huh-huh
Uh-huh-huh
Uh-huh-huh
Uh-huh-huh
Prometheus, he stole the fire, and he brought it down to Earth
It was a prehistoric welder, who figured out what it was worth
They call it holy metallurgy, and I want it to be clear
That no man puts asunder what I've joined together here
I'm Jock the singing welder in the belly of the ship
I've got my shaky leg, I got my quivering lip
I'm Jock the singing welder I just haven't got a choice
Cos I'm singing all day, at the top of my voice
I'm Jock the singing welder, and the Acetylene lights
There's an empty throne waiting every Saturday night
There'll be no more mistaking where I've set my sights
Cos I ain't no pretender, cos it's mine by rights
I'm Jock the Singing Welder and the Acetylene Light
Jock the Singing Welder and the Acetylene Light
Jock the Singing Welder and the Acetylene Light
Jock the Singing Welder and the Oxy-Acetylene Light.
Yeeeeeeeeah!
So, here's a plot spoiler alert.
Close your ears if you want.
Our beloved Father O'Brian, whose idea this ship-building was, is not going to make it through the second act.
He's been diagnosed with, uh, a terrible disease.
And first, this scene was just a dramatic scene, there was no singing in it, and then our esteemed producer came to me one day and said,
"Sting, you've got to musicalise that scene. "
Now I'd never heard of that verb before.
But I knew what he meant.
And luckily, already in the text there was a metaphor which I thought I could use.
This song is called So To Speak, thank you.
They're seriously saying it's prolonging me life
If I'll only submit to the surgical knife?
But what are the odds, on a month or a week?
When the betting shop's closing its doors, so to speak
When you're tied to a pump, and a breathing machine
With their X-rays and probes, and their monitor screens
And they'll wake ye up hungry, saying, how do ye feel?
And then you're stuffed full of pills, or a barium meal
Prolonging me life?
Now that's some kind of joke!
I'd be laughing me head off, and I'd probably choke
The spirit's still willing, but the rest of me's weak
Now the bets are all off, and the prospects look bleak
When you're laid like a piece of old meat on the slab
And they'll cut and they'll slice, and they'll poke and they'll jab
And they'll grill ye and burn ye, and they'll wish ye good health
With their radium, chemo, and God knows what else?
Well, ye can't fault the science, though the logic is weak
Is it really an eternal life we should seek?
That ship has sailed
That ship has already sailed, so to speak
Our mission is more than a struggle for breath
For a few extra rounds in a fight to the death
When our mission is love, and compassion and grace
It's not a test of endurance, or a marathon race
For love is the sabre and love is the shield
Love is the only true power we wield
When eternal love, is all ye should seek
And that ship will be ready to sail so to speak
Well, I'm tossed and I'm torn like a leaf on a street
And I'm blown every which way by the tides of a dream
And the ship of my heart doesn't know what it seeks
And the water's way over my head, so to speak
So make a decision, Meg, hold to it fast
Keep your hand on the tiller, tie yourself to the mast
For this sea of emotions, no place for the meek
When it's only eternity's love you should seek
For when that ship sails and the course has been set
And the wind's in the offing and the sails have been let
And the hatches are full, and the hull doesn't leak
That ship will be ready to sail, so to speak
I'm tired and fading, and losing the light
And I've no way to tell, if it's day or it's night
Follow your heart
It's the harbour you seek
And this ship isready to sail
This ship is ready to sail
This ship is ready to sail
So to
Speeeeeeeak.
Show some respect on this deck for the dear departed
Gather yous round, let's be bound by the work we started
Save all your strength for the length of the task before us
Think on that ship on the slipway, they can't ignore us
It's what he would have wanted, he'll not be disappointed
Each of us well appointed, we've all but been anointed
Such was our occupation, this means of our salvation
We'll make a rope out of our dreams and hopes and tribulations
We'll weave these strands together, we'll splice a rope and tether
And though we won't know whether, it's fair or stormy weather
We'll quit this quay, and we'll cast this net of souls upon the sea
Are you with me?
Pick up your tools, we're not fools to be treated lightly
- We'll weld our souls to the bulkheads
- Secure them tightly!
We'll use the skills and the crafts, that our fathers taught us
We'll work with pride, not as slaves, no-one ever bought us
We'll weave a net of our dreams and our hopes between us
We'll be the envy of that sorry bunch, who'll wish they'd been us
We'll form a web of steel, a structure that will not be broken
We'll be the heroes of the day whenever tales are spoken
And as the dance gets faster, we'll build a double master
No vessel will outlast her, no other ship gets past her
We'll quit this quay and we'll cast this net of souls upon the sea...
Come on!
Come strike the floor with your feet, all you lads and lasses
And if you're too old to dance, you can raise your glasses
Just come on in, take a spin, in your dreams ye've held her
What are ye?
Man or a mouse?
Or a shipyard welder?
Shy bairns get nowt for waiting, so why ye hesitating?
Ships don't get built debating, or launched just contemplating
Wear out your old shoe leather, we're in this dance together
We'll pull the blades and feather, in fair or clement weather
Each one of us connected, all trades and skills respected
Always to be expected, we will not be deflected
We'll quit this quay and we'll cast this net of souls upon the sea
- Are you with me?
- Come on!
Na-na-na-na na-na - na na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na na-na - na na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na na-na - na na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na na-na - na na-na-na-na-na
- Na-na-na-na na-na
- Na-na-na-na na-na
- Na-na-na-na na-na
- Na-na-na-na na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na- na-na-na-na-a-a-a-a-ahh
Show some respect, fill the deck, get the lassies twirling
Cos they expect, to be swept, off their feet and whirling
Life is a dance, a romance, where ye take your chances
Just don't be left on the shores of regretful glances
We may not drive Rolls-Royces, we're hardly spoilt for choices
If we're to pay invoices, we'll need to raise our voices
Our strength is in communion, this Boilermakers' Union
This Shipwright Welder's Guild, with every working station filled
These bonds we've spliced together, will face all kinds of weather
Considered all together, and sailing hell for leather
We'll quit this quay and we'll cast this net of souls upon the sea
Where will you be when we cast this net of souls upon the sea?
Show some respect on this deck for the dear departed
Gather yous round, let's be bound by the work UPON THE SEA!
They say there's an underground river that none of us can see
And it flows through winding tunnels on its way to a tideless sea
And across that sea is an island a paradise, we are told
Where the toils of life are forgotten and they call it the island of souls
For only a soul can go there a soul that's been set free
From the confines of our working life to find eternity
Your dad had a cage for his pigeons
And they say that's where he kept his soul
And when he watched them fly, he would see himself
At least that's how it was told
But his soul was still trapped in the cage, son
While the birds they soared to the sky
But he couldn't find his own way out
At least not till the day he died
A man builds a cage with the tools he is given
His casket is sealed with a riveter's gun
Ah, the days in between he's just making a living
And he takes to his bed, and he lays down his head
And he's passed down his tools to his son
I know that he loved you but he hadn't the words
He'd be easier speaking the language of birds
For to speak of emotion, oh, it just wasn't done
It was him that was trapped in the soul cage, son
It was him that was trapped in the soul cage
Oh, a man builds a cage with the tools he is given
His casket is sealed with a riveter's gun
Ah, the days in-between he's just making a living
Till he takes to his bed, and he lays down his head
And he's passed on his tools to his son
And the ship's left the quay, only now is he free
And the days of his labour are done
Oh, a man builds a cage with the tools he is given
His casket is sealed with a riveter's gun
While the days in-between he is just making a living
Till he takes to his bed, and he lays down his head
And he's passed on his tools to his son
They say there's an underground river that none of us can see
And it flows through winding tunnels on its way to a tideless sea
And across that sea is an island a paradise, we are told
Where the toils of life are forgotten
And they call it the island of souls.
You are too kind!
Before we leave you tonight, we have one more song, but first of all I want to tell you a little story.
In my home town, we never saw any celebrities.
Very short on celebrities in my town.
Except, when they would launch a big ship, they would invite a member of the royal family to come to our town to throw some champagne at the bow, and the ship would go into the river.
So one Saturday, my mother dresses me up in my Sunday best, which I hate, and she gives me a little British flag, the Union Jack, and the whole street's out there, and everybody's really excited.
Even the Communists are excited, because, um, because the Queen Mother is coming.
So, we're all stood there, then suddenly at the top of the hill, there's some motorcycle outriders, police.
And then this gigantic Rolls-Royce moving very slowly, in a stately fashion down the street.
Now to explain to you Americans what the royal family means to the British.
It wasn't that long ago that children with diseases like scrofula were held up to touch the hem of the monarch's garment to cure them.
All right?
It's true.
So, there I am, stood there, and the car's moving past me, and I wave my little flag...
and the Queen Mother waves back.
She smiles at me and I smile and I wave my...
She sees me.
She picks me out of all of the crowd.
Well, I wasn't cured of anything.
It was the opposite.
I was infected with something.
I was infected with this idea that...
I don't want to be on the street.
I don't want to end up in that shipyard.
I want to be in that car.
And so, I'm here.
Anyway, um...
Appropriately... appropriately, this next song begins in Buckingham Palace.
- You ready?
- Ready.
And you Jackie White, shall I pass you this chalice?
Is there something afoot down at Buckingham Palace?
Well, the footmen are frantic in their indignation
For it seems the Queen's took a taxi herself to the station!
Where the porters, surprised by her lack of royal baggage
Bustle her and three corgis to the rear of the carriage
For the train it is crammed with all Europe's nobility
None of them famed for their compatibility
There's a fight over seats I beg pardon, Your Grace
But you'll find that one's mine, so get back in your place!
Aye, but where are they going?
The porters debate
Why they're going to Newcastle, and they dare not be late
For they're launching a boat on the Tyne at high tide
And they've come from all over, from far and from wide
Oh, there's the old Dalai Llama, and the Pontiff of Rome
Every palace in Europe, and there's no bugger home
Here's the Duchess of Cornwall, and the loyal Prince of Wales
Looking crushed and uncomfortable in his top hat and tails
And they haven't got tickets, oh, but it's just a detail
There was no time to purchase, and one has to prevail
For we'll get to the shipyard or we'll end up in jail
And the last ship sails
Oh, the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers
The noise like the end of the world in your ears
As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea
And the last ship sails
It's a strange kind of beauty, it's cold and austere
And whatever it was, that you've done to be here
It's the sum of your hopes, your despairs and your fears
When the last ship sails
Oh, the first to arrive saw these signs in the east
Like that strange moving finger at Balthazar's Feast
Where they asked the advice of some wandering priest
And the sad ghosts of men whom they'd thought long deceased
And whatever got said they'd be counted at least
When the last ship sails
Oh, the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers
The noise at the end of the world in your ears
As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea
And the last ship sails
And whatever you'd promised, whatever you've done
And whatever the station in life you've become
In the name of the Father, In the name of the Son
And whatever the weave of this life that you've spun
On the Earth or in Heaven, or under the sun
When the last ship sails
Oh, the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers
The noise at the end of the world in your ears
As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea
And the last ship
Saaaaaaaaails!
I don't think anything you do can get away from who you are.
Why would it?
Why would we want it to?
I'm proud of my story, I think it's a good story.
It's not finished yet, but I'm proud of who I am, I'm proud of where I come from.
It's a simple abiding emotion in me, is gratitude.
I'm grateful.

This programme contains some strong language.
I wrote this music and I wrote these songs to accompany a play.
A play about my hometown, which is a shipyard town in the North of England.
When I think of the environment I was raised in, these streets and this ship, such a huge part of our identity, part of who we were and...
I am fiercely proud of it.
# It's all there in my gospels
# The Magdalene girl comes to pay her respects
# But her mind is awhirl when she finds the tomb empty
# The stone had been rolled
# Not a sign of a corpse in the dark and the cold
# When she reaches the door, sees an unholy sight
# There's this solitary figure in a halo of light
# He just carries on floating past Calvary Hill
# In an almighty hurry Aye, but she might catch him still
# Tell me where are ye going Lord, and why in such haste?
# Now don't hinder me woman I've no time to waste
# For they're launching a boat on the morrow at noon
# And I have to be there before daybreak
# Oh, I cannae be missing The lads'll expect me
# Why else would the good Lord himself resurrect me
# For nothing will stop me
# I have to prevail
# Through the teeth of this tempest in the mouth of a gale
# May the angels protect me if all else should fail
# When the last ship sails
# Oh, the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers
# The noise at the end of the world in your ears
# As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea
# And the last ship sails
# It's that strange kind of beauty It's cold and austere
# And whatever it was that ye've done to be here
# It's the sum of your hopes, your despairs and your fears
# When the last ship sails
# Whoa the first to arrive saw these signs in the east
# Like that strange moving finger at Balthazar's Feast
# Where they asked the advice of some wandering priest
# And the sad ghosts of men whom they'd thought long deceased
# And whatever got said they'd be counted at least
# When the last ship sails
# Oh, the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers
# The noise at the end of the world in your ears
# As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea
# And the last ship sails
# And whatever you'd promised Whatever you've done
# And whatever the station in life you've become
# In the name of the Father In the name of the Son
# And whatever the weave of this life that you've spun
# On the Earth or in Heaven or under the sun
# When the last ship sails
# Oh, the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers
# The noise at the end of the world in your ears
# As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea
# And the last ship
# Sails. #
Welcome, everybody.
I'm delighted to be here because I'm...
I'm presenting some brand-new songs for the first time in almost a decade.
All of these songs you'll hear tonight, or most of them, anyway, have been inspired by the writing of a play.
Now, you're not going to see the play tonight.
Although one of our leading men is right here by me, Mr Jimmy Nail.
What you're going to hear...
what you're going to hear is the raw material from which this play is being carved, or constructed, or pieced together.
That's not a collage, it's the picture of my street, the street I was born and raised in, and when I was old enough to walk out the front door,
I turned south towards the river, and that's what I'd see.
This mighty ship at the end the street, blotting out the sky and the sun for most...
most of the year.
It was quite a sight.
But it was a surreal, industrial landscape, and every morning I'd watch thousands of men walk to work, down that hill, to work on the ships.
I'd watch them come back at night.
I wondered if that was my destiny.
I didn't want it.
I was frightened of the shipyard.
It was noisy and dangerous.
Those men, though, were tough and proud.
They worked in terrible conditions, but were fiercely proud of the ships they built.
They built the largest ships ever constructed on Planet Earth, right at the end of my street.
So this play is about my community, the community I come from.
And this next song, which is probably the first that I wrote in the series, some of that community present themselves.
They talk about who they are, what they do.
Their hopes, their passions, their fears for the future.
- Mr Nail, would you take the floor?
- Yes.
# Oh my name is Jackie White and I'm the foreman of the yard
# And ye don't mess with Jackie on this quayside
# Why, I'm as hard as iron plate Woe betide ye if you're late
# When we have to push the boat out on a spring tide
# Now ye could die and hope for Heaven
# But ye'd need to work your shift
# And I'd expect yous all to back me to the hilt
# And if St Peter at his gate were to ask ye why you're late
# Why you'd tell him that ye had to get a ship built
# We've built battleships and cruisers for Her Majesty the Queen
# Super tankers for Onassis and all the classes in between
# We built the greatest shipping tonnage that the world has ever seen
# But the only life we've known is in the shipyard...
Come on, boys!
# Steel in the stockyard Iron in the soul
# We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole
# And I don't know what we'll do if the yard gets sold
# For the only life we've known is in the shipyard
# All the platers and the welders and the boiler-making crews
# When they see that beggar finished on the slipway, oh!
# All the hardship's soon forgot and we'll cheer as like as not
# And the bairns'll wave their Union Jacks all day
# Ah, it's a patriotic scene All that's missing is the Queen
# But she said she couldn't make it of a Tuesday
# Then something wells up here inside
# And you could take it in your stride
# But you wonder if you'll see another payday
# For there's a mixture of emotions Hatred, gratitude and pride
# And you hate yourself for crying but it's difficult to hide
# For there's a sadness in the launching
# You worry what's ahead
# And that worry never leaves ye It keeps on nagging in your head
# And so ye pray to God for orders But ye'll worry till you're dead
# Until they bury your remains in the blacksmith's shed
# And the only life you've known is in the shipyard. #
Come on!
# Steel in the stockyard Iron in the soul
# We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole
# And I don't know what we'll do if the yard gets sold
# For the only life we've known is in the shipyard
# Aye, in the shipyard. #
Come on, Tom!
# Me name is Tommy Thompson I'm shop steward for the Union
# Me dream is proletarian revolution... #
Go on, Tom!
# Comrades, brothers, fellow travellers and others
# Class struggle is the means of dialectic evolution
# Das Kapital's me Bible and the ruling class are liable
# And quoting Marx and Engels It's entirely justifiable
# If the workers' revolution here is ever to be viable
# And we become the rightful owners of the shipyard.
# So it's a one-day stoppage or an overtime ban
# Or a work to rule for the Five Year Plan
# Till the means of production are safely in our hands
# And we become the rightful owners of the shipyard
# I'm not saying it won't be hard if the boss hands us me cards
# And they try to close us down like other shipyards
# And if industrial action only helps the competition
# As I've heard the bosses bleating from their usual position
# And I stand accused of anarchy disruption and sedition
# Well, ye'll never knock us down you reactionary clowns
# When it's time for occupation of the shipyard
# My name is Peggy White
# And I've nursed ye through your injuries
# And your cuts and wounds I've bound.
# Come on, Peg!
# Busted arms and busted heads broken backs and broken legs
# I'd sooner put ye in a splint than have them put ye in the ground
# And the fumes from all the welding where the poison air is hung
# And the toxic radiation that's been blackening your tongue
# I could give yous all an aspirin while you're coughing up your lungs
# But it's all you'll ever get here in this shipyard. #
Adrian Sanderson!
Just putting me hat on.
Be patient, will you?
You're on, kid!
# Ah, my name is Adrian Sanderson and the river is me trade
# But it's intellectual discourse I'm known better for
# I may forego English grammar when I'm injured by the hammer
# But I've a preference for the deference of a metaphor
# I've read The Odyssey by Homer and the Iliad as well
# I've read Tacitus and Pliny
# Aye, aye and the Scarlet Pimpernel
# I've spent a night shift down with Dante on his journey into Hell
# And that's what we'll all be facing
# If this yard's put up to sell
# For the only life we've known is in the shipyard... #
- Shall I go on?
- Go on.
Now about those Trojan wars and the troubles that they caused
- When they sailed off on that summer's afternoon?
- Yes.
# Because the ship they had was crap and they lost their bloody map
# When they tried to get themselves back to the tomb
# There's a lesson in these tales although they happened ages past
# Just like Spartacus that film by Stanley Kubricks
# First it's tragedy then farce Then they'll kick you up the arse
# When you tempt the gods with arrogance and hubris
# Well, it's obvious I'm gifted with the rhyming and the meter
# And hereabouts I'm thought of highly as a bard!
As a bard.
# And if I wasn't shooting rivets I'd be famous in me time
# All those literary circles I could dazzle with me rhyme
# I've never lacked ambition
# You can say it was a crime
# For rivets may be riveting But sonnets are sublime
# And the only life we've known is in the shipyard... #
Come on, lads!
# Steel in the stockyard Iron in the soul
# We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole
# But we don't know what we'll do if this yard gets sold
# For the only life we've known is in the shipyard... #
Oh, here he comes, Davy Harrison, the town drunk!
- Are you all right, Davy?
- Davy!
# Oh, me name is Davy Harrison I like a drink or two
# You could ask me when it started and I haven't got a clue
# I'm ever never miserable I'm never ever blue
# And I'll still be up tomorrow for the shipyard
# I drink meself into a stupor and I wake up with two heeds
# And then the missus starts complainin'
# About all me drunken deeds
# Like when I got the train to Sunderland
#
- But found meself in Leeds...
- Leeds!
# And I had to get up early for the shipyards
# You know I once gave up the drinking
# It was 1963
# But it seems as if sobriety was not the thing for me
# It was the worst...
three hours I ever hope to see
# Steel in the stockyard Iron in the soul
# We'll conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole
# And the ship sets sail and the tale gets told
# And the only life we've known is in the shipyard
# Steel in the stockyard Iron in the soul
# We'll get the bastard finished and we'll end up on the dole
# And we don't know what we'll do if the yard gets sold
# The only life we've ever known is in the
# Shipyard. #
So... so without giving too much of the play away, because I want you to come out and see it eventually, um...
It does have a love story, and our leading man is a man called Gideon.
He's been away from this town for 14 years.
He went away to sea.
He left under a bit of a cloud.
He doesn't like the place, but he's back because his dad's died, and he needs to sort some things out, but also some other ghosts he needs to lay, some unfinished business.
This is Gideon's song.
# Oh, I know I've come home for a reason
# But that reason escapes me now
# The engine's ceased and the wind from the east
# Cleared the fog off the starboard bow
# Well, here's the mouth of the river that spawned me
# I feel like a stranger here
# How long has it been
# Well, I haven't been seen in these parts for 14 years
# Yes, these are the streets where I once played
# Where some debt of the soul was left unpaid
# And the place the old man's bones are laid
# And coming home
# Coming home's not easy
# I wonder if she still lives round here
# That girl I've been missing these 14 years
# She's probably married with kids of her own...
# By now
# By now. #
# This town, this stain on the sunrise
# Disguised in the mist this morning
# It's 8am
# A seagull shouts a sailor's warning
# This sky, this bend in the river
# Slows down and delivers me
# The tide rolls back
# And all my memories fade to black
# And yet, and yet
# I'm back
# This town has a strange magnetic pull
# Like a homing signal in your skull
# And you sail by the stars of the hemisphere
# Wondering how in the hell did you end up here?
# It's like an underground river, or a hidden stream
# That flows through your head and haunts your dreams
# And you stuffed those dreams in this canvas sack
# And there's nothing round here that the wide world lacks
# And yet, and yet
# You're back
# Some nights I'd lie on the deck and I'd stare
# At the turning of the stars
# Those constellations hanging up there
# From the cables and the rigging
# I'd wonder if she saw the same
# Or managed to recall my name
# Why would she ever think of me?
# Some boy she loved who fled to sea?
# And why waste time debating
# Whether she'd be waiting
# For the likes of me?
# So you drift into port with the scum of the seas
# To the dance halls and the brothels where you took your ease
# And the ship's left the dock but you're half past caring
# You haven't got a clue whose bed you're sharing
# And your head's like a hammer on a bulkhead door
# And it feels like somebody might have broken your jaw
# And there's bloodstains and glass all over the floor
# And you swear to God you'll drink no more
# And yet, and yet
# In truth, it's too late to find her
# Too late to remind her at some garden gate
# Where a servant tells me I should wait
# And perhaps a door's slammed in my face
# My head must be in outer space
# And yet, and yet
# Before the sun has set
# Before the sea
# There may be something else that's waiting for
# The likes of me
# This town, this stain on the sunrise. #
# When August winds are turning
# The fishing boats set out upon the sea
# I watch till they sail out of sight
# The winter follows soon
# I watch them drawn into the night
# Beneath the August moon
# And no-one knows I come here
# Some things I don't share
# I can't explain the reasons why
# It moves me close to tears
# Or something in the season's change
# Will find me wandering here
# And in my public moments
# I hear the things I say but they're not me
# Perhaps I'll know before I die
# Admit that there's a reason why
# I count the boats returning to the sea
# I count the boats returning to the sea
# And in my private moments
# I drop the mask that I've been forced to wear
# But no-one knows this secret me
# Where albeit unconsciously
# I count the boats returning from the sea
# I count the boats returning from the sea
# Ooh, ooh, ooh
# Oooooooh
# Ooh, ooh, ooh
# Oooooooh
# Ooh, ooh, ooh. #
Thank you.
So, the shipyard will close, with terrible results for this community.
The men who had such pride, and such dignity, a sense of self, will be robbed of that.
Robbed of their work, their jobs.
A parish priest decides he needs to do something about his community, his parish.
He has this wacky, quixotic, even Homeric idea.
He wants the men to occupy their shipyard and build a ship for themselves.
Eventually, he convinces them because they realise they have nothing else and in my dialect they would say,
"What have we got?
We've got nowt else", and this is their song.
#
- Good people, give ear to me story
- Steady!
# Pay attention, and none of your lip
# For I've brought you five lads and their daddy
# And their daddy!
# Intending to build yous a ship
# Wallsend is wor habitation
# It's the place we was all born and bred
# And there's nae finer lads in the nation
# And none are more gallantly led... #
One, two, three!
# What have we got But the buzzer in the morning?
# And what have we got But the laying of a keel?
# And what have we got But the cranes above us soaring?
# The commotion and the clamour in the welding of the steel?
# What have we got But the mist upon the river?
# And what have we got But that noise inside the hold?
# What have we got But the arse end of the weather?
# Where we work in horizontal rain and shiver in the cold
# What do we got?
# We've got nowt We've got nowt else
# What do we got?
What do we got?
# We've got nowt We've got nowt else
# What have we got But the singing in the cables?
# What have we got But the ringing in your ears?
# What have ye got But the telling of the fables?
# And the ghosts of all them ships
# That we've been building donkey's years
# What do we got?
What do we got?
# We've got nowt We've got nowt else
# What do we got?
What do we got?
# We've got nowt We've got nowt else... #
You're standing for your tea break.
You're up to here in shite.
You're dying for a cigarette, you're desperate for a light.
And then the gaffer pulls along with his drop sheet and he reads,
"Tea break's over, gentlemen, now get back on your heids. "
What's it say in the papers?
What does it say on the news?
They say we've all gone bloody daft.
Oh, what have we got to lose?
What would I get for murder?
What would I get for life?
What do I get for a capital crime?
What'll I tell me wife?
What do you get for your politics?
What do you get for your vote?
What have you got at the end of the day?
A great big bloody boat!
Aye, you've got to die of something, It's written in your fate!
Ye might as well die next Tuesday, and woe betide you're late.
Come on!
Ah-ah-ah...
# What have ye got All you men what's fit and able?
# What have ye got For the straining in your neck?
# What have ye got When you're laid out on the table?
# And the snapping of a cable when the rigging hits the deck?
# What have ye got But the loyalty of brothers?
# What have ye got But the punching of the clock?
# What have ye got You reactionary clowns!
# Well, ye'll never knock us down, cos we're the union of the dock!
# What do we got?
What do we got?
# What do we got?
What do we got?
# We've got nowt We've got nowt else
#
- Hey!
What do we got?
- What do we got?
# What do we got?
What do we got?
# We've got nowt We've got nowt else
# What do we got?
What do we got?
# We've got nowt We've got nowt else
# What do we got?
What do we got?
# We've got nowt
# We've go-o-ot no-o - o- owt e-e-e-else. #
So, you know, I didn't enter the musical theatre blithely, thinking it would be easy.
It's not.
The landscape is strewn with bleached corpses on either side.
What I hadn't realised is just how precise and exacting a medium it is.
You know.
I had a fantastic team of collaborators.
My first collaborator was Brian Yorkey, prize-winning,
Pulitzer-winning...
Um, a fantastic director Joe Mantello and um and another prize winning writer, John Logan and um and occasionally they would tell me that... um... a song I'd written wasn't quite right.
Now, this is novel for me.
But you know it's hard for me as my finest couplets are being thrown in a bin and I'm spluttering my flimsy protests.
But every song in a musical fights for its life, every character fights for its life, every verse in every song fights for its life.
Every line, every word is scrutinised with an intensity that's unusual.
Um, the next two songs are a case in point.
I envisaged an older character called Arthur, who's about my age, who falls in love with a much younger woman.
It's a common thing.
This song is called Practical Arrangement, and it goes like this.
# Am I asking for the moon?
Is it really so implausible?
# That you and I could soon come to some kind of arrangement?
# I'm not asking for the moon
# I've always been a realist
# When it's really nothing more
# Than a simple rearrangement
# With one roof above our heads
# A warm house to return to
# We could start with separate beds
# I could sleep alone Or learn to
# I'm not suggesting that we'd find
# Some earthly paradise for ever
# I mean how often does that happen now?
# The answer's probably never
# But if we came to an arrangement
# A practical arrangement
# And you could learn to love me given time
# Well, I like my independence I get by, I'm not greedy
# Do you see yourself as Galahad?
Do I really look that needy?
# I brought a child up on my own
# It takes me all my strength to face him
# The father upped and left me
# And I'm not desperate to replace him
# Tell me what kind of catch is a struggling single mother?
# I respect you and I like you
# But I won't accept another empty promise
# When some grey and stormy rain cloud hangs above me
# When I've heard it all 100 times From a man who said he loved me
# But if we came to an arrangement
# A practical arrangement
# Then perhaps I'd learn to love you
# Given time
# I'm not promising the moon I'm not promising a rainbow
# Just a practical solution to a solitary life
# I'd be a father to your boy
# A shoulder you could lean on
# How bad could it be to be my wife?
# With one roof above our heads A warm house to return to
# You wouldn't have to cook for me
# You wouldn't have to learn to
# I'm not suggesting that we find
# Some earthly paradise for ever
# I've no intention of deceiving you
# You're far too clever
# But if we come to an arrangement
# A practical arrangement
# Then perhaps you'd learn to love me
# Given time
# It may not be the romance that you had in
# Mind
# But you could learn to love me
# Given... ti-i-i-ime. #
So... so that song was in the play for a while.
And then one Monday morning I turned up for work and my dramatic collaborators were sitting there at a table.
It looked like an intervention was about to take place.
I said "What's up?"
They said, "Uh, Arthur. " "What about him?"
"Practical Arrangement. "
"Yes?" "Can't be in the play.
" I said, "Come on.
"It's a great...
I mean, you know. "
And I was really thinking, you know, Arthur is me.
He's my age.
You know this is, this is me!
I said, "Well why?
Wh-what's...
what's the reason?"
They said, "Well, as soon as he opens his mouth,
"he's clearly lost the girl.
He's not going to get this girl.
"We need the rival to Gideon to be viable.
"To be young, to be virile. "
So...
I know, I know.
And it took me a good month of struggling with this issue and then one day I woke up and said, "You know.
"You put yourself in the way.
Get out of the way.
"Write a song for this character.
"This young, virile character - even though you don't like him.
"Write a song for him.
" So I came up with this...
# There's a house on the hill that's come up for sale
# It's a place I've known since I was a lad
# And it needs a lick of paint and a hammer and a nail
# But it's part of a boyhood dream I've always had
# I'd climb up the hill with the Evening News
# I'd been sent from the town to deliver
# And I'd stand in the porch and gaze at the views
# Till my eyes were bruised by the sunset's glow on the river
# I'd imagine a girl who would share my life
# As dreamers'll tend to do
# And the face I always conjured up
# Was always no-one else but you
# What say you, Meg?
# What's this story's ending?
# I want you, Meg,
# By my side
# What's the use, Meg
# To gaze at a view on your own
# For richer, for poorer In sickness and health
# I will see this... #... through, Meg
# No chance of this ending
# Such a view, Meg
# As we gaze from the house on the hill
# To love and to cherish To have and to hold
# I'm a hard man to beat If I may be so bold
# And I promise it all by the sweat of my brow
# Tell me what
# Say you, Meg... #... now?
# What say you, Meg?
# How's this story shaping?
# I want you, Meg
# As we gaze from the house on the hill
# For richer, for poorer In sickness and health
# I'd be hard to replace If I say so myself
# And I promise it all By the sweat of my brow
# Tell me what
# Say you, Meg now?
#
So, another theme in our play is the perennial struggle between fathers and sons.
Something I know a little bit about.
You know, sometimes a father will not appreciate the scope of a son's ambition, and a son will not realise that a father cares for him when he thinks is being, just being controlled in...
In my community there's a phrase called dead man's boots.
Dead man's boots really indicates how difficult it is to get a job.
Uh, you'd only get a job if someone died, so they called it dead man's boots.
And when your father gets you a job in the shipyard and you say no...
That's trouble.
# You said, you see these work boots in my hands
# They probably fit you now, my son
# Take them, they're a gift from me Why don't you try them on?
# It would do your old man good
# To see you walking in these boots one day
# And take your place among the men who work upon the slipway
# These dead man's boots Though they're old and curled
# When a feller needs a job And a place in the world
# When it's time for a man to put down roots
# And walk to the river in his old man's boots
# He was dying, son, and asking that you do one final thing, you see?
# You were barely but a sapling And you thought you were a tree
# If you need a seed to prosper you must first put down some roots
# He wanted you to settle in your old man's boots
# These dead man's boots know their way down the hill
# They could walk there themselves and they probably will
# There's a place for you there to sink your roots
# And take a walk down the river in your old man's boots
# I said, "Why the hell would I do that?"
# Why would I agree?
# When his hand was all that I'd received
# As far as I remember
# It's not as if he'd spoiled me
# With his kindness up to then, you see
# I'd a plan of me own and I'd quit this place
# When I came of age September
# These dead man's boots know their way down the hill
# They can walk there themselves and they probably will
# I'd plenty of choices Plenty other routes
# And he'd never see me walking in these dead man's boots
# What was it made him think
# I'd be happy ending up like him?
# When he'd hardly got two ha'pennies left
# Or a broken pot to piss in
# He wanted this same thing for me, was that his final wish?
#
So what the hell are you going to do, lad?
I said, "Anything but this!"
# These dead man's boots Know their way down the hill
# They can walk there themselves And they probably will
# But they won't walk with me Cos I'm off the other way
# I've had it up to here I'm going to have my say
# When all ye've got left is that cross on the wall
# I want nothing from you I want nothing at all
# Not a pension, nor a pittance When your whole life is through
# Get this through your head I'm nothing like you
# I'm done with all the arguments There'll be no more dispute
# And you'll die before you see me in your dead man's boots. #
Most of the people on the stage come from the North East of England.
Um, and we have five brothers here from my neck of the woods.
They're called the Wilson Family.
Um, I actually, actually thought I was hiring the Beach Boys, but I was...
Pretty soon I figured they weren't.
They're going to sing a song which was a poem by Rudyard Kipling written in 1911, called Big Steamers.
And the music was by Peter Bellamy, and this is the Wilson Family.
# Oh, where are you going to All you big steamers?
# With England's own coal Up and down the salt seas?
# We are going to fetch you Your bread and your butter
# Your beef, pork, and mutton, eggs, apples and cheese
# And where will you fetch it from All you big steamers?
# And where shall I write you When you are away?
# We'll fetch it from Melbourne, Quebec and Vancouver
# Address us at Hobart, Hong Kong and Bombay
# But if anything happened to all you big steamers
# Suppose you were wrecked up and down the salt sea?
# And you'd have no coffee or bacon for breakfast
# And you'd have no muffins or toast for your tea
# Then I'll pray for fine weather
# For all you big steamers
# With little blue billows and breezes so soft
# Oh, billows and breezes don't bother big steamers
# We're iron below and steel rigging aloft
# Then I'll build a new lighthouse for all you big steamers
# With plenty wise pilots for to pilot you through
# Oh, the Channel's as bright as a ballroom already
# And pilots are thicker than pilchards at Looe
# Then what can I do for you all you big steamers?
# Oh, what can I do for your comfort and good?
# Send out your big warships to watch your big waters
# That no-one may stop us from bringing you food
# For the bread that you eat and the biscuits you nibble
# The sweets that you suck and the joints that you carve
# They are brought to you daily by all us big steamers
# And if any one hinders our coming
# You will sta-a-a-arve!
#
That's the Wilson Family.
This next song concerns the mild hazing that would go on when an apprentice had his first day at the shipyard.
You'd be sent for some spurious nonexistent item like a left-handed screwdriver, a glass hammer or you might be sent for a long wait.
In this case our hapless apprentice is going to be played by Jimmy.
He does hapless very well.
He's going to be sent for a brace, that's two, a brace of sky hooks.
Presumably something that you hook onto the sky.
He's going to be sent for a packet of nail holes and finally two cans of tartan paint.
Thank you.
Oh, and I'm going to make my debut on the spoons in New York City.
I almost forgot.
# Me first day in the shipyard The gaffer says to me
# I want ye to go to the store, lad And get a few things, do you see?
# Now here's a list Can you read, lad?
# Can you read it back to me?
# And me and the boys'll listen while we're having our morning tea
# Now reading was me pride When I left school at 14
# There wouldn't be no problem here I'd show them I was keen
# But when I starts to reading, They just couldn't hold their mirth
# Splitting their sides and spluttering
# Like they was giving birth
# First off a brace of sky hooks And a packet of nail holes neat
# And then three cans of tartan paint, and that's me task complete
# The gaffer swipes me on the heid And sends me on me way
# He says, don't come back empty-handed or I'll have to dock your pay
# So he gets to the store all nervous
# And the quartermaster's there
# He pulls the list out of his pocket
# And he starts to read all square
# Well, he hadn't barely finished When the storeman's face turns red
# He gives him such an evil look He thought he'd soon be dead!
# First off a brace of sky hooks And a packet of nail holes neat
# And then three cans of tartan paint, and that's me task complete
# The storeman swipes me on the heid And sends me on me way
# With a kick in the arse for good measure, and such was my first day... #
On the violin, Kathryn Tickell, thank you.
It's Julian Sutton on the melodeon, please.
# So, I get back home that evening and me mother says to me
# How was it, son?
How was your day?
# Sit down and have some tea!
# I told her of the list I'd read and the trouble I was in
# I couldn't go back tomorrow Else the gaffer'd have me skinned
# First off a brace of sky hooks and a packet of nail holes neat
# And then three cans of tartan paint, and that's me task complete
# Me mother swipes me on the heid and sends me on me way
# With a kick in the arse for me efforts, and such was my first day
# First off a brace of sky hooks and a packet of nail holes neat
# And then three cans of tartan paint, and that's me task complete
# Me mother swipes me on the heid and sends me on me way
# With a kick in the arse for me efforts,
# And such was my first
# Da-a-a-a-a-a-a-ay. #
It was a doozy!
So, I have a very good friend that I've known for many years.
Mr Billy Connolly, the actor and comedian.
Before he was a famous actor and comedian he worked in the shipyards as a welder in Glasgow, in Scotland and he told me some stuff about welders that I found very amusing.
He said all welders are crazy.
They're crazy because of the welding fumes that they have to ingest for eight-hour shifts.
Also, they're all practical jokers.
You should never let a welder get behind you or he'll weld your heels, the steel toecaps to the deck and you'll fall over.
The other thing about welders is all of them sing.
All of them.
Because in the... welder's helmet there's a natural echo chamber.
So they all think they're Elvis Presley.
They sing all day.
So this idea really tickled me and I wrote this next song.
It's called Jock The Singing Welder.
# Any shipyard man can sing when he works upon the hull
# Amongst the noise and the clamour that he all but disregards
# So he'll sing to himself and no-one pays him any mind
# He's just another crazy welder in the shipyards
# But inside this welder's helmet If you'll let me demonstrate
# When the mask is in position and the fumes accumulate
# There's the finest echo chamber With a sound that can't be beat
# Where I'm the king of rock'n'roll And the world is at me feet
# And it may not sound like much to all them jokers on the squad
# But inside of here I'm singing
# With the voice of fuckin' God
# I'm Jock the singing welder, Heavy metal, rock'n'roll
# Jazz blues, roots reggae, country, rockabilly, soul
# When I'm singing Well, you'd best lock up
# Your daughters and your mothers
# I'm Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochrane, I'm the missing Everly Brother
# I'm Jock the singing welder I'm heading for the heights
# I'm Jock the singing welder and the Acetylene Lights
# Well, I'm more than just a welder And I'm telling you my name
# And one day you'll see it blazoned In the rockin' hall of fame
# I've got these songs in my head I've got this dancing in my bones
# I'm Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, I'm Tom fuckin' Jones
# I'm Jock the singing welder I'm heading for the heights
# I'm Jock the singing welder And the Acetylene lights... #
# Uh-huh-huh
# Uh-huh-huh
# Uh-huh-huh
# Uh-huh-huh
# Uh-huh-huh
# Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo
# Uh-huh-huh
# Uh-huh-huh
# Uh-huh-huh
# Uh-huh-huh
# Uh-huh-huh
# Prometheus, he stole the fire And he brought it down to Earth
# It was a prehistoric welder Who figured out what it was worth
# They call it holy metallurgy and I want it to be clear
# That no man puts asunder what I've joined together here
# I'm Jock the singing welder In the belly of the ship
# I've got my shaky leg I got my quivering lip
# I'm Jock the singing welder I just haven't got a choice
# Cos I'm singing all day At the top of my voice
# I'm Jock the singing welder And the Acetylene lights
# There's an empty throne waiting every Saturday night
# There'll be no more mistaking Where I've set my sights
# Cos I ain't no pretender Cos it's mine by rights
# I'm Jock the Singing Welder and the Acetylene Light
# Jock the Singing Welder and the Acetylene Light
# Jock the Singing Welder and the Oxy-Acetylene Light. #
Ye-e-e-e-eah!
So, here's a plot spoiler alert.
Close your ears if you want.
Our beloved Father O'Brian, whose idea this ship-building was, is not going to make it through the second act.
He's been diagnosed with, uh, a terrible disease.
And first, this scene was just a dramatic scene, there was no singing in it, and then our esteemed producer came to me one day and said,
"Sting, you've got to musicalise that scene. "
Now I'd never heard of that verb before.
But I knew what he meant.
And luckily, already in the text there was a metaphor, which I thought I could use.
This song is called So To Speak, thank you.
# They're seriously saying it's prolonging me life
# If I'll only submit to the surgical knife?
# But what are the odds on a month or a week?
# When the betting shop's closing its doors, so to speak
# When you're tied to a pump and a breathing machine
# With their X-rays and probes and their monitor screens
# And they'll wake ye up hungry, saying, how do ye feel?
# And then you're stuffed full of pills or a barium meal
# Prolonging me life?
Now that's some kind of joke!
# I'd be laughing me head off And I'd probably choke
# The spirit's still willing But the rest of me's weak
# Now the bets are all off and the prospects look bleak
# When you're laid like a piece of old meat on the slab
# And they'll cut and they'll slice And they'll poke and they'll jab
# And they'll grill ye and burn ye And they'll wish ye good health
# With their radium, chemo And God knows what else?
# Well, ye can't fault the science Though the logic is weak
# Is it really an eternal life we should seek?
# That ship has sailed That ship has sailed
# That ship has already sailed So to speak
# Our mission is more than a struggle for breath
# For a few extra rounds in a fight to the death
# When our mission is love And compassion and grace
# It's not a test of endurance or a marathon race
# For love is the sabre and love is the shield
# Love is the only true power we wield
# When eternal love is all ye should seek
# And that ship will be ready to sail, so to speak
# Well, I'm tossed and I'm torn Like a leaf on a street
# And I'm blown every which way By the tides of a dream
# And the ship of my heart doesn't know what it seeks
# And the water's way over my head, so to speak
# So make a decision, Meg Hold to it fast
# Keep your hand on the tiller Tie yourself to the mast
# For this sea of emotions No place for the meek
# When it's only eternity's love We should seek
# For when that ship sails And the course has been set
# And the wind's in the offing And the sails have been let
# And the hatches are full And the hull doesn't leak
# That ship will be ready to sail
# So to speak
# I'm tired and fading And losing the light
# And I've no way to tell If it's day or it's night
# Follow your heart
# It's the harbour you seek
# And this ship is ready to sail
# This ship is ready to sail
# This ship is ready to sail
# So to
# Spe-e-e-e-eak. #
# Show some respect on this deck for the dear departed
# Gather yous round, let's be bound by the work we started
# Save all your strength for the length of the task before us
# Think on that ship on the slipway They can't ignore us
# It's what he would have wanted He'll not be disappointed
# Each of us well appointed We've all but been anointed
# Such was our occupation This means of our salvation
# We'll make a rope out of our dreams and hopes and tribulations
# We'll weave these strands together We'll splice a rope and tether
# And though we won't know whether It's fair or stormy weather
# We'll quit this quay and we'll cast this net of souls upon the sea
# Are you with me?
# Pick up your tools, we're not fools to be treated lightly
# We'll weld our souls to the bulkheads Secure them tightly
# We'll use the skills and the crafts that our fathers taught us
# We'll work with pride, not as slaves, no-one ever bought us
# We'll weave a net of our dreams and our hopes between us
# We'll be the envy of that sorr bunch who'll wish they'd been us
# We'll form a web of steel A structure that will not be broken
# We'll be the heroes of the day whenever tales are spoken
# And as the dance gets faster We'll build a double master
# No vessel will outlast her No other ship gets past her
# We'll quit this quay and we'll cast this net of souls upon the sea... #
Come on!
# Come strike the floor with your feet, all you lads and lasses
# And if you're too old to dance You can raise your glasses
# Just come on in, take a spin In your dreams ye've held her
# What are ye?
Man or a mouse?
# Or a shipyard welder?
# Shy bairns get nowt for waiting So why ye hesitating?
# Ships don't get built debating Or launched just contemplating
# Wear out your old shoe leather We're in this dance together
# We'll pull the blades and feather In fair or clement weather
# Each one of us connected All trades and skills respected
# Always to be expected We will not be deflected
# We'll quit this quay and we'll cast this net of souls upon the sea
- Are you with me?
- Come on!
# Na-na-na-na na-na - na na-na-na-na-na
# Na-na-na-na na-na - na na-na-na-na-na
# Na-na-na-na na-na - na na-na-na-na-na
# Na-na-na-na na-na - na na-na-na-na-na

# Na-na-na-na na-na
# Na-na-na-na na-na
# Na-na-na-na na-na-na na-na-na-na-na-a-a-a-a-ah
# Show some respect, fill the deck Get the lassies twirling
# Cos they expect to be swept off their feet and whirling
# Life is a dance, a romance where ye take your chances
# Just don't be left on the shores of regretful glances
# We may not drive Rolls-Royces We're hardly spoilt for choices
# If we're to pay invoices We'll need to raise our voices
# Our strength is in communion This Boilermakers' Union
# This Shipwright Welder's Guild With every working station filled
# These bonds we've spliced together Will face all kinds of weather
# Considered all together And sailing hell for leather
# We'll quit this quay and we'll cast this net of souls upon the sea.
# Where will you be
# When we cast this net of souls upon the sea?
# Show some respect on this deck for the dear departed
# Gather yous round, let's be bound by the work upon the sea!
#
# They say there's an underground river that none of us can see
# And it flows through winding tunnels On its way to a tideless sea
# And across that sea is an island A paradise we are told
# Where the toils of life are forgotten
# And they call it the island of souls
# For only a soul can go there
# A soul that's been set free
# From the confines of our working life
# To find eternity
# Your dad had a cage for his pigeons
# And they say that's where he kept his soul
# And when he watched them fly he would see himself
# At least that's how it was told
# But his soul was still trapped in the cage, son
# While the birds they soared to the sky
# But he couldn't find his own way out
# At least not till the day he died
# A man builds a cage with the tools he is given
# His casket is sealed with a riveter's gun
# Ah, the days in between He's just making a living
# And he takes to his bed And he lays down his head
# And he's passed down his tools to his son
# I know that he loved you But he hadn't the words
# He'd be easier speaking the language of birds
# For to speak of emotion Oh, it just wasn't done
# It was him that was trappe in the soul cage, son
# It was him that was trapped in the soul cage
# Oh, a man builds a cage with the tools he is given
# His casket is sealed with a riveter's gun
# Ah, the days in-between He's just making a living
# Till he takes to his bed And he lays down his head
# And he's passed on his tools to his son
# And the ship's left the quay Only now is he free
# And the days of his labour are done
# Oh, a man builds a cage with the tools he is given
# His casket is sealed with a riveter's gun
# While the days in-between He is just making a living
# Till he takes to his bed And he lays down his head
# And he's passed on his tools to his son
# They say there's an underground river
# That none of us can see
# And it flows through winding tunnels
# On its way to a tideless sea
# And across that sea is an island
# A paradise, we are told
# Where the toils of life are forgotten
# And they call it the island of souls. #
You are too kind!
Before we leave you tonight, we have one more song, but first of all I want to tell you a little story.
In my home town, we never saw any celebrities.
Very short on celebrities in my town.
Except when they would launch a big ship, they would invite a member of the royal family to come to our town to throw some champagne at the bow, and the ship would go into the river.
So one Saturday my mother dresses me up in my Sunday best, which I hate, and she gives me a little British flag, the Union Jack, and the whole street's out there, and everybody's really excited.
Even the Communists are excited, because the Queen Mother is coming.
So, we're all stood there, then suddenly at the top of the hill, there's some motorcycle outriders, police.
And then this gigantic Rolls-Royce moving very slowly, in a stately fashion down the street.
Now to explain to you Americans what the royal family means to the British.
It wasn't that long ago that children with diseases like scrofula were held up to touch the hem of the monarch's garment to cure them.
All right?
It's true.
So, there I am, stood there, and the car's moving past me, and I wave my little flag and the Queen Mother waves back.
She smiles at me and I smile and I wave my...
She sees me.
She picks me out of all of the crowd.
Well, I wasn't cured of anything.
It was the opposite.
I was infected with something.
I was infected with this idea that I don't want to be on the street.
I don't want to end up in that shipyard.
I want to be in that car.
And so I'm here.
Anyway... um...
Appropriately, appropriately, this next song begins in Buckingham Palace.
- You ready?
- Ready.
# And you Jackie White Shall I pass you this chalice?
# Is there something afoot down at Buckingham Palace?
# Well, the footmen are frantic in their indignation
# For it seems the Queen's took a taxi herself to the station!
# Where the porters, surprised by her lack of royal baggage
# Bustle her and three corgis to the rear of the carriage
# For the train it is crammed with all Europe's nobility
# None of them famed for their compatibility
# There's a fight over seats I beg pardon, Your Grace
# But you'll find that one's mine So get back in your place!
# Aye, but where are they going?
The porters debate
# Why they're going to Newcastle and they dare not be late
# For they're launching a boat on the Tyne at high tide
# And they've come from all over, from far and from wide
# Oh, there's the old Dalai Llama And the Pontiff of Rome
# Every palace in Europe And there's no bugger home
# Here's the Duchess of Cornwall and the loyal Prince of Wales
# Looking crushed and uncomfortable in his top hat and tails
# And they haven't got tickets Oh, but it's just a detail
# There was no time to purchase and one has to prevail
# For we'll get to the shipyard or we'll end up in jail
# And the last ship sails
# Oh, the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers
# The noise like the end of the world in your ears
# As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea
# And the last ship sails
# It's a strange kind of beauty It's cold and austere
# And whatever it was that you've done to be here
# It's the sum of your hopes your despairs and your fears
# When the last ship sails
# Oh, the first to arrive saw these signs in the east
# Like that strange moving finger at Balthazar's Feast
# Where they asked the advice of some wandering priest
# And the sad ghosts of men Whom they'd thought long deceased
# And whatever got said They'd be counted at least
# When the last ship sails
# Oh, the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers
# The noise at the end of the world in your ears
# As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea
# And the last ship sails
# And whatever you'd promised Whatever you've done
# And whatever the station in life you've become
# In the name of the Father In the name of the Son
# And whatever the weave of this life that you've spun
# On the Earth or in Heaven or under the sun
# When the last ship sails
# Oh, the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers
# The noise at the end of the world in your ears
# As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea
# And the last ship
# Sa-a-a-a-ails!
#
I don't think anything you do can get away from who you are.
Why would it?
Why would we want it to?
I'm proud of my story, I think it's a good story.
It's not finished yet, but I'm proud of who I am,
I'm proud of where I come from.
It's a simple abiding emotion in me, is gratitude.
I'm grateful.

At the end of the centuries They found peace
With spells and magic.
Forever and ever.
In special place, A lieu without evil.
In full harmony and happiness
And forever they will have A place beyond ...
Where all his magic Unite save.
A place beyond.
Where nothing is the same.
Where you can dream.
Instead of illusion.
Is another dimension
Dragon's Hill.
It all started in another place, In another dimension,
In time, now so far away
What peens of folks do remember, Millions of years ago ...
Oh, no grandfather, you would not go Still tells us the same story!
The same story?
Well, I did not know What a jealous say of times!
I have never understood!
I would like to know.
Sweets!
As I said,
There was a time, now as far, That piece of people is remembered,
There are hundreds and And it's hundreds of years,
An extraordinary event in The existence of dragons
Fierce warriors, Dragon Hunters,
And iron-covered riders And the armor,
With their great spears and their swords Began a bloody struggle against our people.
I fainted from the Persecution to the one Subjected them to men.
Slow harassment Pushed them towards extermination,
The dragons, at another time, The most powerful beings on earth,
And as many as the stars, Were on the verge of disappearing.
On the verge of disappearing the grandfather?
This is not an exaggeration.
Elfi, shut up and listen!
Unite power and magic Accumulated for centuries,
The dragoons flew to their destinies, And crossed the frontier of our universe,
Trouble refuge Far from the time,
South the dragon hill.
Surrounded by high mountains and Dense forests,
Protected by the four elements.
Water, fire, earth and air.
The people of the dragons, safe and sound, Prospered to the new.
The heart of the oak
At the center of Dragon Hill, It is a gigantic oak.
In the mountains, And old as time.
Millions of years of existence have They left their traces on his chest and his branches.
Its roots have slowly traveled a path, With the days and years,
And after centuries, succeeded At the bottom of Dragon Hill
Adopt your own heart.
What happened?
You will not let me down.
To protect the forest!
If I do not stop this catastrophe, The world will perish by the cold!
I can find help!
I will see The Sacred Tree, it can help me!
Imbecile!
You were mistaken!
Why am I wrong?
You put the pyramid In the hole of the sphere.
And what does that mean?
That meaning you destroyed My dragon of terace ice,
And this insolent dwarf was able to Escape month claws!
But I get confused with this stuff.
These are polygons, you idiot!
Magical polygons!
That is to say...
Geometric bodies with different faces.
What faces?
I do not see a face!
You are an imbecile!
- I know!
By your fault, this insect has escaped us.
Are you talking about the elf?
Well, I ...
Finds it sympathetic, With its small pointed ears and ...
You can afford these stupidities, but not me!
I want to be the Emperor of the world!
The Master of the Universe, and I can not Allow someone to object!
And why do you want to be The Master of the Universe?
Well ... for ...
Uh, for ..., I want to be ...
I'm bad, very bad!
Creepy!
And I want to be the Master of everything!
Let all tremble in my presence!
But I am also a coward.
So the best thing is to not take any risk.
If we freeze the world It will be much easier to get hold of everything.
With everything and all transformed into ice, Who can oppose our domination?
And why do you want to dominate a world, Where will all be frozen?
Why are you asking this question?
Return to your work and This time do good!
We must freeze the world!
But nobody can close This window?
Here it is closed.
It's cold Duck, the climate has gone mad!

Hey, it's not so bad!
Not so bad?
It's awesome!
You know what would be great, darling?
That you put an end to all this disaster!
Gala my darling, I'm an artist and This disorder develops my creative mind.
You should be happy, Galadrielle.
Art is one of the most sublime Manifestations of the mind!
And you have an artist at home!
Since the dragons There were more princesses,
They do not know what to invent.
What a cold outside!
And it looks funny!
Amusing?
Elfi, my boy, it's not fun.
It is a work of art!
A what?
When I was little, in college We were doing things like that.
I even remember having you Offered one for your birthday!
You see, what you do It's kids stuff!
It's time for you to grow And do something worthwhile!
For example, clean up all that!
And throw in the trash all these You are doing!
Your mother has had enough!
You said "bees"?
Now you think I'm stupid!
Tell me why you got married With an imbecile?
Thin, then it looks like he's angry!
But ...
Honey ...
Well then this fool goes away With his nonsense elsewhere!
Hi everybody!
- Very well, go away!
I hope that where you go You will do things more useful than here!

He's a tyrant!
And in addition it Never understood me!
It is unbearable!

But no one will stop me?

Dad, you're crushing me!
Oh, my son, you want me back at home!
Not true?
- Of course, papa!
What are you going to do, alone, without Mama?
In addition, with this time
You can catch a cold.
- Forget it, Elfi!
You better come with me!
Together father and son!
You are like me, Elfi!
We are twin souls!
Luckily you do not look like your mother!
Daddy, daddy, wait!
Where are you going?
You have to come home!
You can not live without Mom.
There she is angry because of This stuff of painting.
I do not know if it's good Idea of ​​painting this!
I would say that your painting is ...
How strange it is!
These tasks, these colors ...
- Elfi, I can teach you to paint!
Dad, I do not want to paint.
I do not want to have a monotonous life And boring like you!
Me ...
I want to live adventures, Travel and get to know the world!
I prefer a life, Full of risk and emotions.
Having a different existence.
Defending the weak from tyranny Of the strongest.
Fight for truth and justice!
You will see!
You will be proud of me!
Hold your picture, or you call it picture!
Go home, the anger will pass to Mom!
I'm sure she'll forgive you.
And try not to get cold.No one can To bear you when you catch a cold!
Oh Sacred Tree, I've been missing you!
I was defeated, and now ...
Now the forest is dying.
Ice and cold seize the earth.
And I could not do anything To avoid it!
What have we done to undergo This punishment?
Father Sacred tree, what can I do?
Help me!
I struggled with all my strength!
But without you, my powers Do not manifest themselves!
And I'm so small.
All have fled!
The beings of the forest are gone.
What will happen to them?
What will happen to life in the forest?
Sacred Tree, Send me a sign!
A sign!
The spirits of the forest send me a sign!
Hello!
I greet you, sent from the Gods!
Welcome!
That!
You look like eggplants!
I'm Robin.
Welcome!
Thank you for your help!
The forest is being destroyed!
Bad guys with a huge ice machine Are in the process of freezing.
Everyone has fled.
And I fight alone against them!
But now that you have listened My prayers, we will fight together and
Let us give a good lesson to these scoundrels!
Let's go!
What are you waiting for?
But...
What are you doing?
It's not the time to play But rather to fight!
Okay, let's play!
Yes!
This is just beginning!
Let's see if you get here!
Magnifying glass!
Why did not you come together?
You are not prepared to fight!
I'll have to train you fast!
Oh my God!
All this makes no sense!
Time is getting worse!
Etelbert, what's going on?
Well, I would say that time ...
Has cooled a little.
A little!
We are in summer!
You have not noticed how The temperatures have dropped?
On the Dragon Hill, he Good weather and even in winter.
It's good, it's good!
I was right In the process of consulting a weather report.
I will contact Gidion the White, He can tell us what's going on.
In the 21st century, men were On the verge of destroying their world
By provoking climate change.
Do not exagerate!
A small anomaly in the Climate is not a disaster.
You will not tell me the same thing when you Will catch a cold like mine.
Gidion!
The heart of oak!
Kevin!
Kevin!
Kevin, it's me, Elfi!
Nobody in the kitchen.
I can not imagine What other place it could be.
Maybe in the library.
Unless the books are edible, I doubt Kevin has anything to do here.
What?
Ah, you are there!
I was looking for you.
Let's go play for a while.
What a dream, I can not, Elfi!
- How?
What else do you have to do?
I have to think about my future.
- Your future?
But you did not want to be a knight.
It would be more logical you be In the gymnasium, in the weapons room.
I changed my mind.
I no longer want to be a knight.
How?
Well, come on, tell me, according to you, What do knights do?
Well, let me think about it!
Well, to fight and defend the weak And girls and ...
Exact!
And to save sequestered princesses By evil dragons
And therefore lamentable results for dragons Almost every time.
And now the dragons I like very much More than the princesses.
Yes, it sounds logical.
And you've already thought about what you want to do?
Yes, useful.
I want to be useful to others.
Are you kidding me?
There are many ways to be useful.
That's why I'm here.
In what other Place, I could find so much knowledge.
Look around you!
Here, in these thousands of books is found All I need to know!
If I read them all, I would be the wisest man and ...
You're stupid or what!
There is no need to know everything.
And then, we can not know everything!
Yes we can!
- No, we can not!
If we can!
- No, we can not!
Reading is fun.
- Play also, see!
Read more about learning Allows you to dream!
Through a book, you can travel To wonderful places.
Experience the most extraordinary adventures.
What are you doing?
Kevin Warning!
It reassures me!
In spite of everything you remain yourself.
My god, Kevin, look at this!
The Dana Hin!
The Dragon Knights!
I do not need them.
Let them support the family on their own.
I gave them the best Years of my life.
And what do I have in exchange?
They believe that I can not Live without them.
I am self-sufficient.
Better to be alone than badly accompanied.
They will not be able to live without me.
Selene!
The White City!
Oh Selene!
What attracted me to you!
Dana Hin!
The Dana Hin!
The Dragon Knights!
Dragon Knights!
Extraordinary!
You never told me about them.
Until now I believed that It was only a legend.
Look, Kevin, the Dana Hin badge!
Two dragons and a sword.
This book is an extraordinary document!
Here, there are dates, names.
Looks like a register of order Of the Dana Hin!
It's incredible!
All the dragons we know history,
But I thought it was just a myth.
"Where did you find this book?"
Grandfather, you frightened us!
It's snowing.
Time degrades quickly.
Grandfather, what is the climate Has to do with the Dana Hin?
It's August and it's snowing!
The chaos that surrounds us answers a reason:
If the balance between things Breaks, everyone is in danger!
This change is happening.
Yeah ... but you were going to tell us about the Dana Hin.
Why did you make us believe That they were a legend?
Because legend allows us to dream.
And dreaming gives us hope.
And hope will one day, To be what our legends
Say what we are.
Cool!
- I do not understand!
Are you gonna talk about the Dana Hin or not?
Ok, ok, I'm coming!
Dana Hin means Son of the Gods.
I know what it means!
Elfi, can you stop interrupting me?
"Pardon me, grandfather!"
The Dana Hin, also known as Knights dragons.
Born to protect life Of all that exists,
Watch over the balance of our universe, And fight for truth and justice.
Thousands of years ago, Gathered in the depths of the earth,
Intrepid and proud, they raised their swords and,
Swore to protect Dragon Hill And everything that lives there.
In the light of the heart of the oak, This oath shone,
In the same way as to become a sanctuary And refuge of the Dana Hin.
From this place, their power spread On the surface, all around the gigantic oak.
The Dragon Knights founded Built Selene.
The White City.
The home of the Dana Hin.
And for centuries, their reputation Fair and courageous
Spread over all the earth.
I always thought it was a myth.
Elfi, it's the myth that makes them immortal.
For centuries, they have lived In our briefs, honored
And not forgotten in the stories and legends, Which we tell our children.
What does all this have to do with The change in climate?
Everything is bound on Dragon Hill, Kevin.
The heart of the oak is dying, Etelbert.
Someone is killing him!
The Oak Gate!
So long ago!
The Heart of Oak goes out.
The Heart of Oak is dying.
What is it that kills the Oak Heart?
Igor Kan!
"It's a madness!"
It can not be the cause of all this!
"Who else then?"
He is locked in the ice fortress.
Gidion is watching him.
Chains can break.
I can not To communicate with him.
Something happened.
The ice fortress contains power To provoke this catastrophe.
In a few days everything will be frozen.
The Heart of Oak will die!
And the earth shall be extinguished.
If that's what you say, you have to stop it!
But how?
And that?
Who?
You know the answer!
You alone can stop it.
You, the last Dana Hin!
My God!
Did you hear that?
Me!
Tell me Etelbert how?
With what?
Tell me how I could stop him?
Only with my bare hands!
The last Dana Hin!
The last dragon knight!
After years to be loving father, And husband,
I would save the world by confronting
The most destructive power, That we have never known!
And only with her bare hands!
You've already defeated him once.
- You just said it!
We defeated him!
The Dana Hin we defeated!
The little we were.
Among all, we have defeated him, Perseval,
Brawne, Finn,
Lohengrin,
Conrad and me!
This time, in addition, we had The help of the Forest Guardian.
He snatched his magic sword, Isilme Forged in a star.
The sword that must have been mine.
You had to choose between power and love!
And you chose love.
- Yes.
I chose Gala and Igor Kan Remained with the sword.
I prefer my mother!
Isilme!
That is the solution.
If you possess it, you can Face Igor Kan.
With this sword you can To defeat it!
The Guardian of the Forest planted it On the summit of the Finger of Idun!
In the Forest of Swords.
And only he, with his power, Can remove it.
Yes.
But only a Dana Hin Can seize it.
Look, Ken, you gotta go To the Forest of Swords!
Meet the Guardian of the Forest.
He will remove Isilme.
And you, the last Dana Hin Will take to save
The Heart of Oak, And Dragon Hill.
I will look for this Guardian of The forest, papa!
Elfi, my son!
- Dad, I ...
I did not know!
Look, now I have to go.
Do whatever your grandfather tells you.
And tell your mother that I loved her,
And I love it more than all things In this world!
I'll tell him Daddy!
We will meet again in three days, In the Forest of Swords.
Take the Guardian, And let the gods be with us!
Mom, Dad has not come back yet?
Do not worry, Vivianne!
He will come back.
Time is getting worse.
If it takes time To come back, it will take cold.
Forget it now and help Moon To pick up all these things.
Recognize that this time you have gone a little far!
"And Elfi where is Elfi?"
Why does not he help?
- Stop ranting, Vivianne!
Yes, of course, my brother is smart, It always scrolls when you have to work.
Like all boys!
What nerve!
- The cosmic ray!
Moon, we need the cosmic ray!
Where's Ken?
Where is my husband?
It is not enough!
At this rate, I would never The Master of the universe!
I do everything I can!
Changing the climate takes time.
You are useless!
In this book, it is said that this tip
Of frozen mountains contains The inside a terrible
Evil power, Able to control the universe!
Until now we have only succeeded To make fall a little snow.
I've been working all this According to the manual.
It is best to follow the instructions.
Look, there is even a drawing of The place where it is hidden!
It's easy and possible!
"And if it is so easy,
Why do not you look for it yourself?
Because it's a job for Imbecile, and here the only imbecile is you!
That is true!
I'll be right back!
And do not waste too much time!
I want to be The Master of the Universe before the weekend!
The floor is slippery.
Be careful.
A barrier.
The obstacles in life forge the character.
The most important is the Recognize and surpass them!
Water, I'll fall into the water!
I have succeeded ...
My armor!
My old beloved armor!
And despite your power, now You do not serve me!
Truth and justice will prevail!
Now it does not snow anymore, Elfi And the wind stopped blowing.
This is our chance!
We must act quickly!
I managed to stop the storm, But it will not last long.
I trust you, Elfi!
Find the Guardian, And take him to the Forest of Swords!
Where is this forest?
Do not worry, the Guardian will guide you.
There your father is waiting for you.
For the rest, let's make destiny ...
Grandfather, you think my father Can defeat Igor Kan?
Your father was one of the Extraordinary dragon knights!
Few of the Dana Hin were able to fight
Against the strength of her arm and The courage of his heart.
So ...
My father was never It seems.
And what does your father look like, Elfi?
- Well...
My father seemed to be, well ... a father!
Listen, Elfi, the courage you need To assume the responsibility of father,
Only one thing can surpass it,
Being a mother.
How will I find the Forest Guardian?
- This star will guide you.
Follow her and she will guide you to him!
Mom...
I I love you!
Me too my son!
Mom asked me to tell you ...
- I know, Elfi, I know!
It's time to go!
- But if I did not tell you yet ... how do you know?
A long time ago, your father, Has left everything to live
Every moment of his life by my side.
Elfi, wait!
Let me come with you!
No, Kevin, this time I have to go alone.
But, Elfi, I can help you!
Take care!
In front the children!
Listen, what I have in my hand Is a slingshot.
And that's a stone.
This is not the definitive weapon, But it's better than nothing!
Now watch carefully!
We put the stone on the piece of leather.
Afterwards,
We aim and shoot!
Now your turn!
It's easy, come on!
Choose a target and practice!
It's not that I'm afraid, but ...
I did not think about that,
When I told you to look for a target.
Quickly, the snowball is To melt and becomes smaller and smaller!
But ...
It's not like that!
No!
But what have you done?
How Will you help me if you get hurt.
Hey, take care!
No no!
In this way, one can never Defeat these rascals and save the forest!
How beautiful!
I did not know this place.
Where does it lead?
What an illusion!
I might do Find the Sleeping Beauty!
If she wakes up I could Turn me into a prince!
I almost fell.
Heck!
It seems I broke something!
What?
What is that?
Released!
Me, Igor Kan, finally I am free!
Where does this star take me?
The wings are overloaded with snow.
I do not know if the cosmic ray will hold.
Be careful, the stick is a Weapon primitive, but very effective.
With a little bit of goodwill, You can learn to handle it quickly.
Now attack!
Do not be afraid, come on!
If you can not manage A simple stick?
Now, in your turn, go!
Hey, I'm not gonna hurt you!
Fortunately I had put on my belt!
You!
Are you the Guardian of the Forest?
Yes, yes it is me!
And you?
Who are you?
You are not another messenger of the Gods not true?
Because with those there is enough.
I must not only prevent the world from freezing,
But also pay attention to them.
Isilm, the magic sword!
It has been such a long time!
My grandfather only you can Extract it from the Finger of Idun.
Yes and only a Dana Hin can to take hold of!
Your father will be able to do it, but a sword Is not enough to stop this catastrophe!
I asked for help from the Gods, And they sent me that!
I will help you!
We must go to the Forest of Swords.
Igor Kan must be arrested!
It was not Igor Kan who provoked that!
four hundred ninety seven 00:48:37,656 -- 00:48:40,117 What?
But my grandfather ...
Igor Kan is still locked in The fortress of ice.
Igor Kan was one of the most powerful Dana Hin
Your father and he fought for Isilme And for Galadrielle, your mother.
Stay with the sword!
Gala is mine!
Blinded by power and ambition, Igor Kan betrays
The principles he had Sworn to defend.
The Dana Hin divided.
Crtains on the side of Igor Kan,
And the others on the side of justice.
A struggle between brothers began.
For a time the power of Isilm Rendered invinable Igor Kan.
Then your father came back.
And began a battle that Seemed never to end.
So I intervened in the fight, And with all, we defeated Igor Kan.
What happened next?
Igor Kan was locked up in the Fortress of ice.
Under the supervision of Gidion the White, Lord of Heaven.
He was to remain there forever.
The few Dana Hin who survived, Scattered
And Selene remained abandoned.
It's been such a long time, Elfi, you were not yet born.
It's snowing again!
If it is not Igor Kan, Who is behind all this?
Gidion the white?
- No, Gidion is dead.
Death!
Gidion is dead!
Thanks to you, dwarf!
I needed to see him to believe it.
Death of a flu!
In a house so cold, it does not surprise me!
Lancelot, it's been a while That I seek you!
Hello!
Who are you?
I ...
I am the king of the world!
And who are you, the king of the moon?
In reality, I was taking care of the household.
And him...
It was the cook.
When Gidion, our lord, died,
We decided to use the power Of the Ice Fortress
To freeze the world and To take hold of everything!
And who had this brilliant idea?
Me.
I would have bet on him.
Listening to waste,
I would crush you here and now, like rats Repugnant that you are, but you have freed me from my prison!
And in addition you have done a part of my work.
As I am a good person, I will not destroy you.
Now out of my sight!
Disappear before I change my mind!
If I see you again, I would A scarf with your skin and a necklace with your teeth!
Now is the time to Settle accounts!
First, I'll get Isilme, My magical sword!
And then I would visit To my old friends.
We have a debt to settle!
And for that I will To need something that you possess!
Your ring, your magic ring.
You do not care, right?
You do not need it now!
There is no other way.
We must enter Here and prove that Igor Kan is always in a safe place.
Remember that my father Wait in the Forest of the Swords!
So there's no time to lose!
We will approach as much as we'll be able to.
Riding on my back, And I would fly to the fortress.
He will not expect that.
Maybe we can surprise him.
Warning!
There, in front!
These are the rascals.
The servants of Gidion.
Let's see if you are the Masters of the world!
We are cold!
You are aware of what You have done, sorts of morons!
These two frelins provoked This disaster?
The ice fortress is actually A meteorological station,
Able to control the climate.
At the death of Gidion, these two idiots Have played with fire.
With ice, you mean ice cream!
Shut up, you idiot!
Me, I mean we, we wanted Only be masters of the world.
The real bad guy is Igor Kan.
My god, then he escaped!
We must go to the Forest of Swords!
What do we do with them?
Leave them, they are harmless now!
Let them have a little cold.
They will understand a little!
The Forest of Swords!
Isilme!
It becomes more and more disastrous!
We Will never come to the Forest of Swords!
We will hammer along the way.
- There's another way to get there.
Through the Father Sacred Tree.
Come, follow me!
Under its roots, a path Will lead to the Finger of Idun,
At its summit is Isilme!
We must make a torch, Perhaps with these branches.
My God, we have nothing to light it!
- Leave it to me!
I forgot that you are a dragon!
What is the Forest of Swords?
I had never heard of Of that place before.
In reality it is not a forest, it is a sacred place Where the only trees are the swords
Planted in the rock, in memory Of each of the dragon knights.
591.
00:56:13,630 -- 00:56:15,700 For thousands of years, When a Dana Hin
Would die, his sword was taken to ...
We can not go on!
Let's turn around!
We'll go through the forest!
- It's impossible!
We're going to die frozen!
Here it all ended!
And here everything begins again.
Chaos rules our fates
By giving a strange logic to our existence
Isilme, my treasure!
You can not take her off, Igor.
Only the Elf can.
The Guardian of the Forest.
Do you remember?
It was he who Planted in this rock.
Here, my good friend Kenetgrin!
That everyone called "Iron Arm"!
You have grown old!
Family life does not You did not succeed.
Me, on the contrary, so many years in the ice Have preserved me.
Again, face to face, you and me!
Old friend!
Let's start again where we stopped!
Before the Elf comes in!
You always thought better than me,
And now you go To verify that you are wrong!
6.11 00:58:19,211 -- 00:58:21,219 What can we do?
If the forest were alive, I would retain my power,
And it would suffice for me of a simple movement Of the hand to break this heap of stones!
We can not abandon my father!
Let's take the risk outside.
It's not true, eggplant!
What are you doing here?
I will not get rid of you!
Where are you going?
Damn, what a brute!
Are you crazy or what?
You are sure that they are envoys gods?
What do I know?
They came down Of the sky preceded by a light.
Hey, wake up, I too got off The sky and that's not why ...
What are you doing now?
Damn it!
They teleported us!
Isilme!
We are on the Finger of Idun, In the Forest of Swords!
There, below!
- This is my father!
This is Igor Kan!
You have always been more courageous and nobler.
But I have always been ... stronger!
It has always been your problem.
You put everything on your strength!
Not always!
This time I took the precaution To have a lucky charm.
The magic ring of Gidion!
Now he no longer needs it!
We must help him!
"Isilm!"
I planted you in the living rock, Now I conjure you, go!
Quick, Robin!
Suffer me and I will forgive you!
Go to hell!
I can not!
I can not take it off!
Move out of the way!
Let me do!
It's useless Elfi, without my powers it's impossible.
Come on!
Cursed sword, go!
Let's get this over with!
My God, she does not come!
"Farewell, Ken" Iron Arm! "
Very well, better half a sword That no sword at all.
You broke it.
Dad!
Elfi!
Ken!
Igor!
Farewell, Igor Kan!
Failure and matte!
My God, you beat me Vivianne!
Neither Elfi nor your grandfather ever succeeded!
Yes, girls are smarter!
Yes I see that!
Another part, Vivianne?
Now it's your turn to be Igor Kan!
Me!
No way!
I am Sire Elfi the Brave!
The penultimate Dana Hin!
Well, then I'll read.
- Alright Alright!
It's hot!
- Yes, everything is back in order.
We saved the forest And Dragon Hill!
Ken gave me the ring of Gidion.
You know what he did with Isilme?
- Yes.
More or less!
Do not you miss children?
They are no longer children, darling.
You know this is where I got you Embraced for the first time.
Hence the last Dana Hin becomes reantic.
That from time to time I make a stupidity,
Does not mean that I continue to be So in love with you as on the first day, little angel!
Little angel?
You called me "little angel"!
Do not you want me to call you that?
- Very well, if you let me call you, little love!
Is that obligatory?
Alright Alright!
[ Thunder crashes ]
[ Laughs evilly ]
[ Sawing ]
[ Electricity crackles ]
It's alive!
[ Thunder crashes ]
[ Laughs evilly ]
[ Smooch!
]
[ Laughs evilly ]
So, what's my surprise, fellas?

You okay, man?
Uh, doc, are you sure this is absolutely necessary?
No.
I'm sticking my finger up a grown man's ass on a [Bleep]
Hunch.
You forgot the sword of omens?
I'm a cat, Panthro.
I get distracted easily.
I'm a cat, too, but you don't see me losing focus every time -- [ bird squawks ]
Bird!
Bird!
Bird!
Bird!
All right, let's do this.
Sword of omens, come to my hand.
[ Gasps ]
Run!
Hurry up, you stupid sword.
[ Panting ]
Wilykit!
Geez, it's heavy.
No!
Floor it, Panthro!
Finally.
Wait, there's blood on it.
Obviously, someone doesn't know how to respect my nice things.
Where is my mother?
I don't know how to tell you this.
I'm afraid your mother is a zombie!
Oh, no!
Oh, yes!
She just sits in front of those soap operas all day!
So, she's not a real zombie?
No.
I used the word in the figurative sense.
Well, that is a relief.
This week's "scary movie for people with heart conditions"
will be right back.
Approved by the American heart association.
Maybe it's time to stop, William.
No, I can get this.
I can get this.
Come on, Travis.
Let's have sex on my roommate's bed.
Oh, man, you're so dirty.
I'm gonna get... oh!
Right there.
Oh, it's almost as good as... oh, yeah.
Oh, man.
We're totally having sex!
Yeah, this is the best!
Oh, sex feels so good!
No, no, no, don't stop!
Oh, right there!

You act like you don't have feeling, but I bet deep down you want to care, don't you?
Tell me you want to care.
Tell me.
Tell me you want to care.
Oh, yeah!
That's it!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
You need a credit-card number?
Okay.
It's 438 -- have you ever seen a kitten sneeze?
[ Laughs ] It's very cute.
Don't blink, or you might miss it.
Any second now, that kitten is going -- [ Roars ]
The "scary movie for people with heart conditions" was a lie from the very start!
Good luck calling 911 with your heart completely stopped, you dumb assholes!
Cull the wheat from the chaff!
You never know when the mood for bear sex will strike.
But when it does, be ready with bear-alis, the roofie formulated specially for bears.
Bear-alis is the only animal tranquilizer pill proven to work fast and last a long time so you can [Bleep] that bear right away.
And then, after you've had time to re-boner, go for the deuce.
Ask your doctor about bear-alis.
You never know when the mood for bear sex will strike.
When it does, be ready with bear-alis brand roofies for bears.
If you tell anyone, I will [Bleep] [Bleep] you.
So, goofy, did your parents take it okay when you told them you and Clarabelle are together?
Well, of course, Minnie.
Why wouldn't they?
Because she's a cow and you're a dog!
It's u-- it's unnatural!
Someone finally said it!
But, gawrsh, guys.
T-there isn't anybody like me out there.
Well, there's Pluto.
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.
I move we vote to ban mixed-species couples from the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.
Do I have a second?
I second!
No!
You can't legislate love!
Oh, really?
Two confirmed bachelors who've cohabitated their entire lives have liberal social ethics?
[ Laughing ] Shocker.
We're brothers.
We're cousins.
[ Chuckles ]
Get your story straight, fellas.
Just a reminder -
- I'm actually human under all this, so belle and I are cool, right, guys?
Guys?
[ Gavel bangs ]
All right, enough, enough.
All in favor?
[ All shout "aye" ]
The motion passes.
Everyone, please stop fighting!
I, Walt Disney, created you to spread happiness, not bigotry.
He so did.
Just look at me -
- Uncle Remus.
You tells them, Massa Disney.
Well, I guess it's back to the grave.
Disney out.
[ All gasp ] 10 years have passed since the third world war.
The most valuable resources in this terrible new world -- food, water, gasoline.
But for those forgotten holidays struggling to survive, the most valuable resource is children!
[ Gasps ]
Daddy, it's a turkey on a motorcycle!
Be quiet!
Keep your heads down!
[ Tires screeching ]
That man's suit looks like the flag we burned for warmth!
It looks so fun!
Daddy!
Daddy, can we stop?
Be quiet!
Don't look at them!
How much for the little girl?
!
[ Tires screech ]
[ Gobbling ]
How about a little fireworks, scarecrows?
!
[ Sighs ] That was awful.
Oh, boy!
Again!
Again!
Again!
Idiots!
We raised three idiots!
My sack is so full.
Would you care to slurp up its contents?
Yay!
Candy!
[ Laughs evilly ]
[ Screams ]
Now, you know I couldn't let that cactus put a prick in you, kid!
That's his job.
Geez.
That guy is creepy.
Hang on!
[ Tires screech ]
Hey, where is arbor day?
Gaah!
I've had enough of this [Bleep]
I think we made it.
Dear?
What the hell is that?

Ho!
Ho!

[ Engine turns over ]
Honey?
Dad, what are you doing?

I'm gonna spread a little Christmas cheer.
All over the [Bleep] desert.
Yaah!
He is real!
[ Gasps ]
I love you, Santa Claus!
It was a feeling that Santa Claus had long forgotten -- the love of a child.
They didn't need to kidnap the children.
They just needed a place in their hearts.
Ho!
Ho!
Ho!
The lesson from this tale of woe-- always keep the holidays alive in your heart.
Or just remember that turkey riding a motorcycle, because that was pretty [bleep] cool.
[ Thunder crashes ]

[ Electricity crackles ]
It's alive!

- Almost done.
- It's cold.
- Don't move!
- Ouch!
That hurts!
You know, it's not funny anymore and I'm cold.
- Bam!
- Done?
- Yes.
- Can I look?
Yes!
Let's see if your suggestions were correct.
Totally shaved: no.
Landing strip: no.
- What did...
What...
- It's a "N".
- What did you do?
- A "N" for my first name, Nikolaus.
I know your name, but that's not a "N".
It is!
In capital letters.
I didn't have enough place but...
- It's a lower case "R".
- Not at all.
You totally fucked it up.
You know what?
Marion told me that her boyfriend shaved her in an airplane shape.
- Yeah?
- Anton shaved Roxane as a diamond ring.
- And you, you shaved me in...
- Something that nobody has!
Or want!
- Alright.
You have your suggestions?
- Yes!
Oh you know, the part where the body meets the penis?
If you shave it, it will look longer.
- Right.
I will make your cock look longer.
- Cool!

- Is it still far?
- No, it's here somewhere.
I can't believe your bought an apartment before visiting it.
- It was an emergency, I'm used to it.
- I still have things to learn about you.
- Sorry for the trouble.
- No, it's funny.
- Can't wait to meet this...
- We'll stay far from him, it's safer.
New neighbors with a secret, isn't it too much cliché?
But we killed no one...
Well, you killed no one.
Okay, but it was an accident!
And it's your job.
- I'm a female escort!
- Your other job!
- And what will be your job?
- I'll sell insurances.
It fits you very well.
Is "he" really so dangerous?
You know why we are here and what we did because of him.
Don't be afraid, my angel.
He doesn't know our names or faces.
You're safe with me.
We are arrived!
If I knew that your mother would come today...
Yeah, what?
- I don't know.
I would have gone to Nebraska.
- She comes for a tea.
Just an hour.
- Can we open the wine?
- No!
The last time we did that, we threw our neighbors away.
That's why.
- Don't you have a heart?
- No, I needed place for my sarcasm.
I'm sure you like her, actually.
Yeah but really a bit.
Like something tiny seen from afar.
I even know where to hide her body if I kill her.
Where is it?
On Google, page 2.
No one ever go there.
You're in a good mood.
I have a sixth sense with your mother.
Like Spider-Man, I feel the danger.
By the way...
I know she's behind the door right now.
Strange, I usually can feel the danger.
- This time I felt nothing.
- Sorry?
- Hello, Mrs Zimmermann.
- I don't like you, where is my son?
It will feel longer than an hour at the dentist.
Any news from Johannes?
No, not since the wedding where he forgot to invite me.
And you?
Nothing either.
His new life looks more interesting.
Or it's his stupid husband.
I don't like him.
You don't like anyone that goes out with your sons, Lucia.
Since when do you call me Lucia?
Do I call you Carole?
No, but maybe cause my name isn't Carole.
- Really?
What's your name?
- Isobel.
- Isabel?
- Isobel, with a "O".
Isobel?
It's a first name?
It sounds like an illness!
And you know this Maykel.
I'm sure he's deleting my emails.
Johannes maybe just wants to start a new life.
It's not like if I wanted to control the life of my son.
No...
Do you want some tea, Mrs Zimmermann?
You're ugly.
And you're old.
But it doesn't answer my question.
Why do you stay with her?
There are a lot of girls in this city!
- Cause I love her.
- She has no hips!
She can't give you a child!
Will we really talk about my ovaries each week?
It's a running gag?
Cause I think we said everything about it already.
And seriously she's neither kind nor friendly.
Yet I prevent myself to crush you, like if you were an ant, I had a giant boot and...
Nick, I can't take it anymore.
You have to choose.
It's her, or me!
Nick?
That's your nickname?
I thought you would never hear it.
Mommy, I won't make a choice.
I want to spend my life with Isobel.
I know why you're scared.
I'm not your favorite son who succeed in everything, but I won't go away.
And no one can stop me to see you, even not Isobel.
Oh, my kitty.
Finally your father was wrong.
Your education is not a full mistake.
- Daddy said that?
- Yes!
Oh, group hug!
Don't overdo it!
I tolerate you, but I don't like you!
- Mommy, please.
- Oh well, ok.
Come here.
But it's only for him, and cause you borrowed your uterus to Johannes, that I smile.
It's only cause you don't wear your jasmine perfume that I prevent myself from vomiting.
See?
All is good now.
- Isn't it a bit big?
- We need to be comfortable.
As long as we have a big bathroom...
- Now we need to focus on the neighborhood.
- Where do we start?
The neighbors below.
We'll meet them.
I'll make a pie!
I saw that in a movie, it seems easy.
- I would love to be as positive as you.
- We need it.
Even more now.
The next weeks will be hard.
- He is getting closer?
- But we'll stop him.
And we'll make a pie!

Let's go.
Mummy will be back soon.
It's going to be ok.
- Call me later, Boris.
Ok?
- Don't worry, I will.
Ok, doctor?
Are you a surgeon?
Do you operate?
- On what?
- The head.
The head?
Ok...
Want to sing a song?
Yes.
What could we sing?
What do you like?
- Fly Away, Birdie?
- All right.
My little birdie has flown away
My little birdie has flown away
Flown away, away, flown away
Flown away on his wings
Little birdie, please take care
Little birdie...
Thank you for staying.
Any news?
It's not just a migraine.
The hospital's doing an MRI.
Don't worry.
We'll keep you posted.
Bye, sonny.
You were a good boy.
Goodbye.
Doctor!
Good evening.
This is for you and your brother.
You shouldn't have.
It's for everything you do for my son, Kay.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Yes, Rémi's with his dad now.
You saw Lapresle?
He's down from Neuro for her?
Good.
See you later.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Hello, Dr Pizarnik.
Hello.
How are you, children?
- How are you, Mr Pérez?
- Fine, thank you.
Shall we go?
Goodbye, doctor sir.
Have a good evening.
MISS AND THE DOCTORS
Concentrate, ok.
That's it.
Gently.
Send it back.
Like that.
Flick it a bit!
- In 6 months, I'll beat you.
- Go on.
- Shall we play next week?
- Ok.
Mr Pizarnik!
Your brother forgot his mail.
Thank you.
Have a good evening.
Quiet, Aspro.
Who is it?
It's us, the doctors.
- Prove it.
- Get your mum, please.
Prove it.
Are you the Snake Master?
I can't see now.
I'm blocking the spyhole.
That's when a little owl appeared.
Hold out your arm.
That's it.
Here we go.
Alice, did you eat or drink anything special today?
No, I'm diabetic.
You checked your blood sugar?
It's at 1.10 grams.
Let's check.
We trust you but we need to be sure.
Got your records?
Thanks.
So?
What does it say?
Still 1.10 grams.
Did you eat anything today?
You know you mustn't skip meals.
Are your legs numb?
Yes.
I think it's hypoglycaemia.
So we'll prescribe you a banana and four sugar lumps.
- Do you often have spells?
- No.
I felt funny so I asked the janitor and he said to call you.
You brought a dog?
That's Aspro, our dog.
Aspro?
The Aspirin King.
Where are your parents?
Mum works nights.
She should be back soon.
Can you dial her number for me, please?
Hello, ma'am.
This is Dr Boris Pizarnik.
Your daughter had a spell.
She's fine but could you call me back on 06 62 98 83 40.
Thank you.
Stay lying down.
If there's any problem, call us back, ok?
Yes, on 06 62 98 83 40.
Wow.
Mum makes me learn important numbers.
Hers: 06 07 82 97 95.
The ambulance: 15.
The hospital AE: 01 78 98...
We get the message, Miss Numbers.
Eat that banana now, please.
Stick out your tongue.
It's too long!
We'll need to cut it.
Good night.
She seems lonely.
It's not great but we'll manage.
What would we do without you, Annabelle?
Boris...
Do you have someone in your life?
Don't start again, Annabelle.
Why refuse to let a woman love you?
It's not that.
Don't mix things up.
Work, feelings...
I've seen you every day for 3 years.
You're generous and that's rare.
Hello.
Dr Pizarnik.
It's you.
Hello, Judith Durance.
Delighted.
Actually, I wanted to call you.
Come in, please.
Sorry, I just woke up.
Coffee?
Thanks but I don't have time.
I've brought your cheque back.
Why?
It wasn't enough?
You didn't sign it.
I'm sorry.
I do things in too much of a rush.
Which one are you?
Pizarnik 1 or Pizarnik 2?
The gruff one or the shy one?
Boris Pizarnik.
Ok, you're the gruff one.
Sorry about last night.
I wanted to call but...
That's ok but your daughter wasn't able to reach you.
Do you often leave her alone?
It's dangerous.
She could go into a diabetic coma.
You realize that?
I know diabetes inside out.
My daughter and I control things.
Don't exaggerate.
Call Welfare while you're at it.
Don't let me keep you.
Goodbye.
Anna, in the last two months, you've had a cold, stomach ache, stomach cramps and insomnia.
That's four probs.
And, Pierre, you had diarrhoea, a rash on your hand, a sore throat, ear ache and a high temperature.
Five probs in all.
It's not an act.
We're not liars.
We're not saying it's an act.
But you shouldn't be ill so often.
You're both healthy.
You hear what the doctors say?
Pierre, look at me.
Why do you want to see us so often?
Anna, why do you need us so much?
I bought tea.
Have you found it?
Yes, Annabelle, thank you.
Judith Durance...
She called in earlier.
She seemed uneasy.
Were you a bit harsh with her?
Maybe.
Did she say something?
Alice has simple diabetes, it's under control.
She's a beautiful woman.
We agreed to take on her daughter.
You and me?
Or just you?
I didn't specify.
Aren't those doctors a bit odd?
I like their dog anyhow.
Mum, I haven't been ill today.
I'm off.
Don't mess the place up.
- Don't worry.
- Thank you, Annabelle.
Bye, Annabelle.
Annabelle's sweet.
I like her.
She works hard.
- Why do you say that?
- Because.
With that look...
I spoke to the pharmacist...
- You invited her out?
- No, I think...
She's your type.
Shit.
No way!
I've pissed myself.
Sorry.
Does it happen often?
Yes, for 10 days now.
I hope it isn't a relapse after 6 months in remission.
We'll do tests tomorrow.
Ok.
I saw a programme on multiple sclerosis last night.
They interviewed a woman in a worse state than me.
She seemed scared to death.
I'm going home.
I feel filthy.
See you, brothers.
See you.
Bye, Charles.
When'll you be back?
Depends on how much we talk.
Do you talk a lot?
I'm not telling you that.
Seeing Rémi's mum tonight?
Her husband asked me to call in.
See you later.
You'll see to Aspro?
Sure, who else?
Good evening.
Good evening, everyone.
Who'd like to speak first?
Dimitri, will you begin?
All right.
Good evening, I'm Dimitri, I'm an alcoholic.
I don't have a problem with my wife.
I don't have one.
I don't have problems with my children.
I don't have any either.
I have a problem but I don't really know what.
Can anyone help me?
Boris...
What did the MRI say?
A tumour?
Shit.
They're operating tonight?
A cigarette adept on top of the rest?
I relax any way I can.
You have worries?
That's a secret.
Want to walk with me?
Why not?
Been coming here long?
That's a secret.
Want to stay and sleep with me?
Whatever, Dr Lonely.
Alice?
I don't have time for jokes.
Don't say that, sweetheart.
You're breaking my heart.
But, sweetheart, even at work, you're always on my mind.
Looking for this?
Good evening.
Thank you, Dr Pizarnik.
You're out very late.
So are you, Mrs Durance.
I'm on my way home.
I just finished work.
A bit risky.
Shall I see you home?
Or let me buy you soup to apologize.
Why?
I was in a bad mood.
It happens.
It's 6 am.
Alice is asleep.
15 minutes then.
Thank you.
If a baby's red at birth, what does it mean?
He's already ashamed of his mother.
His red corpuscle count is very high.
It's usual in new-borns.
Correct, doctor, you get extra noodles.
Thank you.
She's studying medicine.
She works like crazy and helps her parents here.
These youngsters are tough.
Been working here long?
Since forever.
I've always worked here.
What do you do?
I'm a barmaid.
The queen of cocktails.
I've even won competitions.
You work nights?
- Yes.
- It's not too tough?
No, I'm used to it.
I like living backwards.
The only problem is having to leave Alice alone.
Does she take it well?
Yes.
It's ok for her.
You have tears in your eyes and hot sauce on your lips.
Careful, it can sting.
What's the place where you work?
The Fidji.
Is it around here?
Not far away.
Business is good.
I have some loyal customers.
It's ok.
I'm not a hooker.
It's ok, I like prostitutes.
They have guts.
I had one as a patient.
A Chinese girl who worked locally.
She's disappeared now.
Will you do this job much longer?
You're talking about retirement?
Stop it, it's too depressing.
I'm managing fine for now, thanks.
You seem tired.
I was thinking you should get some rest.
You're right.
I'm scared Alice might wake up.
Have I offended you?
Not at all.
Excuse me, can we have the bill?
It's on me.
No, it's on my tips.
I get tips too.
A local big shot paid me with a gold Buddha.
I didn't sell it in case I got iced, despite my accountant's advice.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Another new day begins.
Have a good day, Dr Pizarnik.
I've fixed an appointment with you because I've had the test results.
My daughter's sick of seeing doctors.
Try to understand if she's...
fractious.
Goodbye.
Kay, how are you doing?
Ok, I guess.
And you?
Fine.
Can you lower the hood?
The results are good.
No epileptic fits in 6 months.
I want to stop the Phenobarbital.
I can't get hard on it.
Got a girl?
None of your business.
There was Marie when you were 8.
Look.
She's hideous.
She's not great.
You were already thinking about it.
You keep everything?
Only natural.
We follow you.
It's for your sake.
You need to keep taking the Phenobarbital.
You can't know.
You don't have girlfriends.
Who says we don't?
You're clearly frustrated, without a life.
What's having a life for you?
And for you?
It's simple.
Finding love, right?
Finding love...
Ridiculous.
We'll talk to your mum and be right back.
Just wait here for us, ok.
Hello, ma'am.
Hello, doctor.
You're worried about Kay?
He's just sick of us.
Don't take everything at face value.
Doctor?
Judith...
What are you doing here alone?
I feel bad.
I just lost a patient.
I'm sorry.
He died?
No, he's not dead, he hates me.
Want to sit down?
All right.
Thanks.
I'm not even up to inviting you to have soup.
I'm exhausted.
I have a coconut pyramid if you want.
A coconut pyramid?
I love them.
So sweet they take hours to digest.
I haven't had one since I was a kid.
You haven't had any.
No, it's for you.
Go ahead.
It's filling, a bit like concrete.
A bit like you.
You're like a concrete wall.
It's reassuring.
But it's scary too.
And Dimitri?
I don't know.
I don't know him well.
He's gentler than you, right?
Thanks for the concrete.
It's kind of you.
Thank you for taking Alice on.
She's been better since seeing you.
You're good with kids.
But Dimitri and I don't want kids.
I mean...
Dimitri doesn't want kids and I don't either.
That's funny, I've always wanted them.
Even if...
Max Fusetti...
He's Alice's father.
Sorry.
I threw him out years ago.
I'd stopped loving him.
That's how it goes.
Can I ask a favour?
It's about Alice?
Your face changes when you mention her.
Really?
I didn't know that.
Hello, Alice.
Your mum said you weren't well.
I'm fine.
No need to come round.
I'm the doctor.
What are you eating?
A chocolate biscuit.
Not a good idea.
Note every little spell.
Don't tell us any stories, ok?
Can we count on you?
You're not acting nice to make your mum happy?
You're sure?
All right.
Don't get up.
I'll write a note for your mum.
Doctor, are you married?
No.
I'm not married.
And your brother?
He's not married either.
Go to sleep, chatterbox.
Judith,
I think your daughter's driving me crazy.
Your place isn't bad but watch the use-by date on the sodas and don't tempt Alice with so many sweet things.
All the best, Boris.
What are you doing here?
Did you see Alice?
Yes, she's fine.
Don't worry.
Alice is a prickly, fragile thistle but she's fine.
Thank you.
Sorry, I have an order.
- Yes?
- The same again.
Of course.
And you want some almonds?
I just realized what's happening.
I love you.
You're mad.
You feel sorry for me?
You feel sorry for me and my daughter.
Don't mix things up, doctor.
Help!
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
You want to go home?
Where do you live?
The 18th district.
Can you afford a taxi?
Yeah.
I'm Dimitri, I'm an alcoholic.
Today wasn't a great day.
I have a brother, we're close...
Are you twins?
No, we're just brothers.
My brother wasn't in great shape.
When he's like that, it worries me a lot.
So I came here.
Stéphane?
Something to say?
Good evening, I'm Stéphane, I'm an alcoholic.
Dimitri, you say your brother wasn't in shape, right?
I feel like saying...
Sorry, this may seem a bit harsh.
But it's no big deal.
My wife left me two days ago and it's tough.
I'm suffering.
It's really tough.
So I feel like drinking too.
I can also say...
I'm sorting things out and I'll have to move out.
So it's all kinds of paperwork to find a new apartment.
That's complicated too.
On top of that, there's... problems with...
My sister has problems with her daughter.
And then...
Charles, it's Dimitri.
I know it's late...
I've just come out of an AA meeting.
Just my luck.
I have two doctors.
An alcoholic and a failed athlete.
One of my patients was at the meeting.
He recognized me.
What do I do?
Boris is sleeping.
Forget Boris, your family and your friends.
You have to work it out.
Are you sure?
You'll come up with something.
It's odd seeing you without Boris and the kids.
The godfather's going to kill me...
I'm not hiding a gun.
Have you ever felt you drink too much?
Have people remarked upon it?
Do you want to drink first thing?
Have you ever felt you need to cut down on alcohol?
I'll spare you the rest.
Thanks.
What's your favourite drink?
Ballantines.
Pure malt.
On the rocks?
Neat is good too.
What do you drink exactly?
Not just whisky.
Anything good I can get.
How often?
Several times a day.
I'm not here to lecture to you.
You're going through a rough patch but I know alcoholism and it's bad.
So here's what we'll do.
At first, we'll run a liver test to check your GGT levels.
If they're too high,
I'll send you to see an addiction specialist.
All right.
I can't cheat with you.
I won't cheat with you either.
Why do you drink?
I don't feel up to it.
Up to what?
Why do you have to be up to it?
You're already doing what you can.
I know I'll always be an alcoholic.
But you can get free of it.
I can tell.
Why me?
Why not you?
Sweetheart, pick up your medication.
You need it.
It's at the pharmacy, ok.
Love you.
Doctor?
Good evening.
What are you doing here?
I was sheltering from the rain but it's stopped.
Not with your brother?
We're not Siamese twins joined at the hip.
You're very fond of each other?
Yes.
That's nice.
You're lucky.
You remind me of my brother.
I do?
You like to drink.
None of your business, Mrs Durance.
I know it isn't.
But I can see it in your eyes.
They're bloodshot?
They're misty.
Misty?
You're not going to lecture me?
My brother was an alcoholic.
I was fond of him.
And?
He died 10 years ago.
He downed all he could find in the end.
He'd come to the bar... and I'd get the doorman to throw him out.
I don't know if I hate alcoholics or understand them perfectly.
Mind a dumb question?
Go ahead, it's dumb question time.
Are there many cases of a man getting stuck in a woman?
Too bad Boris isn't here.
People often ask us that.
I don't know why it excites people.
I don't mean you...
It happens.
It's called "penis captivum".
But it's rare.
I've never seen it.
I've always wondered what they say to the doctor...
"The key's jammed in the lock."
Yes, or...
"I know how he got in but I didn't see him leave."
I'd never have dared to ask Boris that.
I have to go.
Goodbye, Dr Pizarnik 2.
A call...
Maybe my first case of "penis captivum".
My question wasn't so dumb.
Good night, doctor.
- Hello.
- I'd like an appointment, please.
With Boris or with Dimitri Pizarnik?
I don't know.
Either one of them.
Boris...
I'm in love.
Is it the pharmacist?
I saw you in that café with her.
It's not a medical thing.
It's Judith.
Judith Durance.
You think it's mutual?
No idea.
I haven't talked to her yet.
Think I stand a chance?
Boris...
Come with me to her place.
Wait for me, ok.
Funny you can hear it all the way up here.
I think Alice is in shape.
She has fewer spells, she's less tired.
You and your brother suit her.
Thank you.
Congratulate her, not us.
She deals with it well.
Do you mind if I smoke?
In front of a doctor...
I smoke now and then too.
No more than 5 a day, otherwise...
Is your mind always on your work?
It must be tiring all the time.
No, not at all.
You know, our mother was very sick.
What was wrong?
A neurological condition.
A serious one.
Our father was often away from home so we looked after her.
Just before she died, she took both our hands and she told us, "Thank you."
That's sad.
No, that's how it is.
It's funny, I've never talked about that at AA.
Doctor Dimitri, that's a very moving story.
Really.
I've been waiting for you.
Why talk such rubbish?
I shouldn't have smoked in front of you.
Do you have someone in your life?
Sorry, that's none of your business.
Forgive me.
No, forgive me.
Judith...
I'll wait for you.
Mum...
Don't worry.
About your dad...
He's suffering from alcoholism.
Now, alcoholism is as if your toys were filled with a substance...
Pizarnik medical practice...
Boris?
It's Dr Vallini.
Just a second.
Dr Vallini?
Hello.
Don't mention it.
Seeing a real neurologist will help.
He thinks we're two clowns.
I have to warn you.
Kay is a complex case.
He might drive you crazy.
Good.
I understand.
Sorry, Dr Vallini, I have to go.
Have a good day.
I'll be right there.
I'm on my way.
Can you tell Dimitri I'll be back in an hour?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
Judith...
A coffee?
No thanks.
She's sleeping.
She's ok.
She's doing better.
She's very tired.
Judith, I think her illness is going to get worse.
You may need to change her insulin feed and consider a permanent subcutaneous pump.
She'll need to check herself several times a day and adapt her treatment to the results.
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.
She'd been doing better lately.
Why did she keep it from me?
She wasn't doing better.
She kept it from you as long as she could but...
She couldn't anymore.
It's my fault.
Because I'm all alone.
What?
Max will never come back.
That's why.
But you threw him out.
It's because...
I didn't throw him out, he wanted to leave.
He didn't love me that much.
Less than I loved him.
When I got pregnant, he panicked.
He didn't feel ready.
So he left.
When I was 4 months pregnant...
My life with Alice seems such a mess.
Would she be better if she saw her father?
I can't answer a question like that.
Yes, she'd feel better if she could see her father.
So let's do it.
It may not be the right number.
It's so long since I spoke to him.
His voicemail.
His voice hasn't changed.
Max, it's Judith.
Alice is seriously ill.
I'm putting her doctor on.
Your daughter's diabetes is getting worse.
You must come and take care of her.
Thank you.
That's kind of you.
Boris...
Do you know your brother told me he loves me?
Yes, I know.
I'll see you again?
You know...
I'm not sorry for you.
It's something very different.
I hadn't planned on having someone in my life.
I hadn't planned on having a wife.
You're in for a rough ride.
I have a lot of stamina.
So take the Clamoxyl for a week.
Don't stop because you don't like it or it won't work.
You'll be better soon.
In a week, you'll be fine.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
You've changed, doctor.
I have?
You, Boris.
You look happy today.
Forgive him, doctor.
Colchicine treatment.
Reduction in the severity of mouth ulcers, digestive problems, with intermittent abdominal pain and diarrhoea.
A colonoscopy in 2001 to detect rectal bleeding was normal.
There are fits of arthralgia, without arthritis, notably in the knees and ankles.
There were also skin lesions that were consistent with pseudo-folliculitis.
This led to us diagnosing Behçet's syndrome, for which she is consulting Professor Dot.
Judith, I love you.
I want to watch you like this for the rest of my life.
Boris...
I just checked. 1.23 grams.
Great.
Well done.
Tell me...
You love my mother?
Boris just left me a message.
He won't be in today.
Something important came up.
We'll have to manage.
Doctor...
I'm in a hurry.
Come to the office.
Red blood cells: 4 million 620.
Haemoglobin: 13.4.
Haematocrit: 39.5 %.
Haematocrit MCH: 29.
MCHC: 33.9 %.
MCV: 85.5 %.
Polymetrophile: 66.6 %.
Lymphocytes: 22.5 %.
Monocytes: 6.7 %.
Don't worry.
It's just bronchitis.
Thank you, Doctors Pizarnik.
By the way, I passed the medicine exam.
I came 32nd.
Congratulations.
What will you specialize in?
Geriatrics.
A tough one.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Good luck.
Do you love Judith?
Yes.
Since when?
The first minute, no doubt.
So you're together?
Yes.
I hope there's a second Judith on the planet.
Does she have a secret sister?
I don't know.
When I left the metro, I pushed the door.
There was someone behind me.
I held the door but they didn't thank me.
I asked, "You're used to people holding doors for you?"
That's it.
I'm going to stop coming because it's not much use.
There.
Hey, you!
I know you!
Come over here!
We've met.
I've seen you at the doctors' office.
I think so.
You're an epileptic?
And you're a diabetic?
What are you doing here?
Just helping my uncle out.
I'll tell you about our speciality.
It's bubble tea.
I guess you know it.
The flavours we do are durian, soursop, carrot too...
Mango, raspberry, coconut and loads of others.
- A mango-banana smoothie.
- First stick out your tongue.
I dropped the Pizarnerds.
Why?
They were pissing me off.
Pissing you off?
They piss me off too.
Which one's the more handsome?
Boris or Dimitri?
What a question...
Usually...
I don't think about that.
Sorry.
What I like about Dimitri is his hair colour.
It suits him.
And Boris's gruff voice.
It's scary.
Yeah.
Which one's kinder?
Dimitri's pretty classy.
Boris is a drag.
He's strict and he likes giving orders.
You think so?
Yeah.
Dimitri talks much less.
As if he had a secret.
What kind of secret?
A secret of the heart.
That's a load of rubbish.
I saw your mum not so long ago.
She's beautiful with her red hair...
And your dad?
He's a long way away.
He doesn't want to see you?
That's right.
How much for the smoothie?
Are you ok?
He's there.
Are you spying on me?
Get lost!
You know what, Charles?
Talk to him alone.
What can I tell him?
I don't know.
Say...
It's not my fault we love the same woman.
What the hell's going on?
You're crazy coming here!
It's not his fault you love the same woman.
Can't he speak for himself?
Go and tell him I need Judith more than he does.
I'll be right back.
He needs Judith more than you do.
How does he know that?
Don't tell him that.
Say I didn't mean to.
He didn't mean to.
He says you did.
You don't want him to have a life.
Bullshit.
No good.
Give me a full sentence.
Tell him I want him to be happy.
He wants you to be happy.
My foot.
I'm expected for dinner.
Why do you love the same woman?
Charles...
Ask him if I have a chance with Judith.
- Good evening.
- Hello.
Have you got a second?
Stay nearby, sweetheart.
Do I have a chance with you?
Dimitri, I don't love you.
I'm sorry.
We can't help it.
Do you love Boris?
Good night, Dimitri.
Hello?
Hello.
What's wrong?
A guest has been throwing up for three hours.
Room 319.
Anybody here?
Hello.
A nightmare.
Two doctors?
Two for the price of one or twice as much?
We've heard that one before.
Shit...
Sorry, here we go again.
I've been like this all day.
The manager tells me you're the best.
You have heartburn?
Yes.
Nausea?
A fever?
Just a fever. 38.5
Can someone fetch medicine for you?
I don't know anyone here.
I'll leave you some with the name of a pharmacy.
If you can't move, call them and they'll deliver.
I know them.
What's your name?
Max Fusetti.
Is there a problem?
No, there are a lot of stomach bugs about.
May I?
I'll do the prescription.
So, Fusetti...
F-U-S-E-T-T-I.
Max.
Tiorfan and Primperan...
Your address?
I live in Parma, in Italy.
Parmigiano!
Will you be here long?
I don't know.
I came to see my wife and my daughter.
They'll be happy to see you.
Is there a nice shop for presents around here?
There's a jeweller's just round the corner.
They have trinkets for children and jewels for women.
They have some very nice grey pearls too.
Your prescription...
Have a good day.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
You have something awkward to tell me.
The awkward thing is, we can't keep you.
Not the way things are.
We can't afford it anymore.
I understand.
I was expecting this after the accountant called.
Boris, can I see you alone?
Again?
Here we go again?
Of course.
It's ok, it's not another declaration.
Sorry if I hurt you.
Yes, you hurt me.
And it's not over.
I just wanted to ask you...
Are you and Dimitri splitting up?
That's a personal matter.
Because of Alice's mother?
I saw you both looking at her like madmen.
She's too beautiful for you.
Thanks a lot.
I mean she'd be good with any other man.
With the Italian, say.
Alice told me.
I often talk to your patients in the waiting room, you know.
You're a gossip.
And you talk rubbish.
Women are odd creatures.
Hello, Judith.
Why do you only like sick people?
You have to talk to Boris?
I'm afraid he's busy right now.
This evening?
I'm warning you, he needs shaking up right now.
All right, I'll tell him.
Yes, at around 8.
Have a good evening.
An appointment for you.
Hello, Alice.
Hello.
Had a good day?
Ok, I guess.
We drank Love me tenders, remember?
Good evening.
Thank you.
Boris, this is Max who is... back in Paris now and who... turned up out of the blue.
Max, meet Boris, a friend of the family.
How do you do?
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Likewise.
Dad, can we carry on?
Yes.
Alice...
A present for you.
Can you put it in my room?
I'm Alice's father.
Remember that, Judith.
Mum!
Why didn't you tell me?
I don't know.
I still can't believe it.
What?
Are you with him or me?
I can't tell you.
It's all so incredible.
He's Alice's father.
So?
What?
I don't know what to think.
I just don't know.
Can't I be unreasonable for once?
Can't I be unreasonable?
Can I perhaps screw up?
No, you can't.
What are your intentions?
Ask Judith.
It's her decision.
Judith is no longer your wife and Alice is hardly your daughter.
Yes, doctor.
That's all you can say?
Look, you're a doctor, you're brusque...
You see people as cases to solve.
I couldn't love Alice and her mother.
I couldn't take care of them.
But now I can.
But you're harming them.
Is that the doctor speaking?
What's wrong?
Shit, your eye.
Hello, Judith, this is Knowledge calling.
Sorry, terrible joke.
It's Dimitri.
I'm not calling to cause a scandal.
That's not my style.
I just wanted to know what you plan to do with my brother.
All right.
I'll tell him.
It'll be less cruel coming from me.
No one can say the two of us didn't try with you.
Right.
Good night, Judith.
Get ready.
Ever had a shot before?
You like them?
Does it scare you?
Stick your tongue out.
Close your eyes.
You hardly felt a thing.
Nothing like a little shot against bad laryngitis.
- Goodbye.
- Thank you for coming.
You're welcome.
Dimitri?
How's it going?
Fine, and you?
I'm fine.
I'm looking at the sea.
It's beautiful.
A bit boring but beautiful anyway.
It's the Mediterranean.
How about you?
I'm giving up the practice.
It costs too much.
I'm doing consultations here now.
I did that long ago.
You don't miss Paris?
No.
I have a lot of female patients.
It's not all grannies after the sun.
Good.
Right, I'll let you go.
Hold on.
You know what?
Kay is cured.
Fantastic.
So he was right to change doctors.
I didn't expect it to work.
I wish I'd been in Paris to see it.
Tell him he could have called me.
You know how kids are.
They'd rather die first.
I was happy for him anyhow.
I'll let you go.
Talk to you soon.
Bye, Dimitri.
Sorry, I'm late.
How are you?
Better than yesterday?
No.
Not really.
Don't worry.
The corticotherapy is going to work.
Thank you, Daddy Boris.
Boris, there's something I didn't say earlier.
I don't know why we loved the same woman,
I don't know why, despite our 40 years together, we have to part now.
But one thing is sure:
you must be happy, Boris,
You must be happy.
Dimitri.
Hello.
What are you doing here?
I came to see a friend.
And you?
I'm here with Alice.
She had a spell.
You're back in Paris then?
For a month now.
Boris!
Excuse me.
Boris, I'm scared.
Can you promise me I won't die?
Charles, you're a French male, born in '72.
You have a well-known condition, your health is satisfactory.
Like every male your age, you have 40 and a half years to live.
And a half?
Cheapskate.
Stop complaining.
I only have 35 left.
Go to sleep now.
Don't tire yourself.
I'd been waiting 10 years for Max.
You hurt me too much, Judith.
Alice, I'll be back in an hour.
I have to fetch a few things.
Ok, Mum.
Hurry, please.
Help!
Help me, please.
Are you ok?
Sit down.
Are you ok?
Yeah, I'm plastered.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm back here because it's over with Max.
We weren't made for each other and he realized before I did.
But that's not the only reason I'm back.
I'm a bit slow but I've realized something.
You don't look well.
You should see a doctor.
Sorry.
Your daughter's asking for you.
I love you.
I love your eyes, hands, mouth...
Your daughter's waiting.
Coming to see Alice?
Hello, Alice.
Hello, doctor.
How are you?
Fine.
Who looked after you?
Dottore Olivario.
I wasn't keen on him.
Where's Aspro?
Aspro's dead.
He was very old, you know.
He didn't suffer much.
35 years.
I have 35 years left to live.
We can try them together if you want.
- 35 years is a long time.
- You think so?
Yes.
You too?
Hello, Annabelle.
Are you daydreaming?
Hello, Mr Pérez.
I haven't seen you in ages.
Found a new job?
Yes, in another medical practice.
- With two doctors?
- No.
My boss is a woman, a dentist.
She works alone.
It's a bit less tiring.
How are you?
The children?
We're all fine.
It's funny.
I just spoke to Dimitri.
How is he?
He's far away now.
And his brother?
Boris still practices in the neighbourhood.
Quite a pair, weren't they?
Yes.
It was never boring with them.
I wonder sometimes if they're happy now.
I'll let you go, Mr Pérez.
See you again, maybe.
Look after yourself.
Goodbye, Annabelle.

Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm late.
Doing some paperwork.
Nolan, you start.
What is bothering you today?
Well, for starters, you're wearing a woman's shirt.
All right, I wasn't doing paperwork.
I needed a shirt, it was dark, and luckily the nude girl in my bed wasn't wearing hers.
And there she goes now.
Bye, sweetie.
Now, on a more serious note,
Patrick, why are you Ed?
I took Nolan's chair because I've got to look at you straight on.
I hurt my neck in a car accident.
I rear-ended a guy and he got out of his car and punched me in the neck.
But you kept your cool, which I think is a testament to my mad skills as an anger management therapist.
Actually, my seat belt locked up on me and I couldn't reach the crowbar in my back seat.
Minor detail.
I am still putting this in the win column.
I'm very uncomfortable.
Everything's different today.
I'm sitting in the wrong chair and you look like my mom... but hotter.
Hey, Charlie.
I'm going on a talent scout tonight.
You got 40 singles on you?
Oh, hey, you guys are all here.
- Hey, Lacey.
- I'm not talking to you.
Too late.
You just did.
That was me just telling you I'm not talking to you, loser.
Cool, so now we're having a conversation.
Uh, Sean, I don't have any singles, but if you wanna make yourself some "coffee,"
there's a "coffee" can in the pantry.
Ahem.
There's a bunch of singles in there.
How could you be friends with that dirtbag?
That son of a bitch was sleeping with me while he was living with Charlie's ex-wife.
You slept with Sean?
This is turning into my favorite therapy session ever.
Except for that.
Ed, look at that.
Ow!
It had to be done.
Lacey, I don't like Sean, I'm just hanging out with him.
I mean, haven't you ever had a friend that you hated?
- I hate all my friends.
- Well, there you go.
Excuse me.
You got Charlie.
Yeah?
What?
All right, I'll be right there.
Sorry, guys.
I gotta get down to the college.
It's an emergency.
A bunch of frat guys are throwing a party in my research lab.
Hey, you only had a dollar in the can.
What can I say?
I've been drinking a lot of coffee.
Hey, can you give me a ride to my office?
That girl drove me home last night.
I left my car where I met her.
- Where did you meet her?
- I have no idea.
Maybe afterwards you could drive me around Los Angeles while I click my car alarm?
Anger Management 2x37
- Charlie's New Sex Study Partner - Original air date October 3, 2013
Hey, backwards baseball hat.
What the hell's going on here?
We're conducting a serious study on the effects of whiskey and electricity on some pledge's balls.
- Bring it!
- Oh, this is really bad.
- Right?
This is the cheapest beer I've ever had.
- I know, right?
Ooh.
Well, that does kinda make up for it.
All right, guys, listen up.
Listen up.
I hope you're all done 'cause the party is over.
The guy who pays for this office is gonna be here any minute.
Oh, no, dude, he never comes in.
Word is that his partner ditched him and he had some kind of breakdown or something.
No, no.
I heard that she was a royal pain in the ass and he's been celebrating ever since she split.
Now, go on.
Go... go... go someplace else to play with each other's nuts on your parents' dime.
Oh, no.
What?
What's wrong?
Damn.
The grant foundation wants the first run of data by Friday.
And on top of that, I've got to hire a new partner.
Without a PhD's name on this thing, they're gonna pull the plug.
Wait, this is a sex study, right?
Are you telling me that you need a doctor to run a video camera and shoot people doing it?
I can do that.
This isn't the bang bus, you idiot.
This study's gonna take my career to a whole new level.
I've just got to keep my head clear and stay focused.
So, Dr. Miller...
I see you've authored several well-received papers, and, oh, look at that.
You were runner-up for Miss Hawaiian Tropic.
Technically, I wasn't in the contest.
I just stopped by for a piña colada and they gave me an award.
Well, this may be a knee-jerk reaction, but I like you the best.
So you've seen the other applicants?
Nah, I got a bunch more.
That's all fine and well, but what makes you believe you'd be an asset to this study?
I'm meticulous when it comes to research protocol.
As for my preferred methodology...
Pink Taco!
Excuse me?
I just remembered where I left my car.
Excuse me.
- Charlie Goodson?
- You must be my 5:00.
Dr. Denby.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Oh, and I will not be having sex with you.
Well, then there won't be any pleasure.
Please.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to say that.
But I do mean it.
I just didn't mean to say it.
I do want the job.
But I specialize in research and I did mine on you.
You like to party, you can't keep your zipper zipped.
Ergo, no sex.
So I shaved my legs for nothing?
I do my research, okay?
Well, so do I, and I came up with a few juicy tidbits about you, Renee.
It's Jordan.
Wrong file.
Oh.
This is you, Jordan.
What is me?
Well, six months ago, a Dr. Jordan Denby was arrested for "decorating a waitress at Denny's"?
Okay.
Very good.
I was having a bad Christmas.
I'd just gotten divorced.
My antidepressants hadn't been adjusted yet, so I took the ornaments off the tree next to the register and decorated the waitress.
Her name was Noelle.
It seemed logical at the time.
How about "resisting arrest at Macy's"?
Bad New Year's.
"Relieving yourself in an elevator"?
Really, really bad Valentine's Day.
Look, I don't want to waste any more of your time here.
You're obviously qualified and capable, but I've already interviewed somebody who's... how do I put this?
Sane.
I've been on lots of meds and there's been a lot of adjustments.
He married my twin sister.
What was he looking for?
I'm really not sure.
You know what?
Thanks for stopping by.
All I wanted to do was come by and be super confident and have you give me the job on my merits.
Well, you failed.
I can't leave.
Why not?
I already have the job.
Okay, I see we're still trying to find a balance with the meds.
No, the grant foundation was worried that the project was becoming unstable, so they interviewed potential partners for you and they decided on me.
They hired you to add stability?
Yes.
I am supposed to give you a copy of this contract.
What the hell happened to it?
When I'm nervous, I eat paper.
I'm not proud of it.
I know, I know, I said I wanted to hire you.
But the grant foundation is forcing me to hire this emotional train wreck.
I can't.
She's looking right at me.
All right, bye-bye.
Look, I know you're not happy that I'm here, but I'm a professional and I am damn good.
And I would appreciate it if you would behave like a professional as well.
Okay.
Okay, then, why don't you watch the DVDs of the last run of couples and summarize the computer readouts?
What are the couples doing?
Well, let's see.
It's a sex study, so they are building furniture from Sweden.
They're having sex.
- Live sex?
- Yes, live.
Unless you're looking for the necrophilia study.
Well, that's down the hall.
Uh, wouldn't it be faster if I just looked at the computer readouts?
Oh, my God.
You're a sex researcher and you don't like watching people have sex.
Look, most of the research that I've done is dry, and this is... wet.
Oh, God.
Look what you made me say.
You think sex is dirty.
I think sex is beautiful.
I think people make it dirty.
That's what makes it beautiful.
So everything I've heard about you is true.
Wow, that is really judgmental coming from a gal who pees in elevators.
Hey, I was stood up on Valentine's Day and I had to drink an entire bottle of champagne by myself.
You know why you got stood up?
Because you only like sex when it's beautiful under an enchanted rainbow.
Well, guess what?
At the end of that rainbow, all the leprechauns and unicorns are watching you.
And they're all playing with themselves.
- You're disgusting.
- You're a prude.
- I'm leaving.
- No, I'm leaving.
Then we're both leaving.
Fine... but I'm taking the stairs.
I know what you do in elevators.
So, did you totally freak out when you looked down at your phone and saw it was me?
Well, when you called, I thought, "This is odd."
And then I thought, "I'm kinda cool."
You might wanna hang out with me."
Oh, God, no.
Did you know Sean is back in town?
- Ugh.
- God, I hate him.
You know he had the balls to call me and try and get back together?
He called you?
He didn't call me.
I thought you hated him.
Oh, yeah.
That's right.
That's why I wanted to see you.
We never got back at him for sleeping with both of us at the same time, so I say we should do it now.
What do you have in mind?
I have an idea, but we're gonna need some roofies and a tattoo gun.
Your evil little heart is in the right place, but I have a better idea.
Wow, not a good day to be ice.
It's my new PhD.
She's driving me nuts.
- Is she cute?
- Well, sure, if you think sexually repressed, emotionally screwed-up women are cute.
How are the boobs?
Those are adorable.
It's Sean, go.
Hi, Sean, it's Jennifer.
Hey, Jen.
What's happening?
We need to talk.
Yeah, what's up?
I'm pregnant.
Oh, my God.
Are you sure it's mine?
Yes, I'm absolutely sure.
Uh, boy, wow.
I gotta think about this.
I'll call you back.
He couldn't even talk.
He was like, "I guess, uh, hmm",
I'm gonna have to call you back.
"'Cause, hmm, I'm about to go crap my pants."
Of course she's not pregnant.
I had a vasectomy years ago.
Wow, a vasectomy.
Didn't you ever want kids?
No, kids are just little people you're not allowed to drink with.
- Hey there.
- Afternoon.
Sorry I'm late.
I had a thing this morning.
It's called sleeping in.
Anyway, in the spirit of compromise, today I will watch the DVDs, you analyze the data.
You know, I felt guilty all night that I didn't watch those DVDs.
- I can do that.
- Well, it obviously makes you uncomfortable, so today we'll switch.
It was eating me alive all night.
I have to do this.
I chewed through my mouth guard.
Okay, you can do it.
Thank you.
I take it back.
I can't.
You do it.
You're a guy, you like this stuff.
All right, we are gonna go about this in a different way.
How do you like your scotch?
I don't.
Look, we both need to relax so we can get over this hump and you can start watching people hump.
Alcohol and I don't mix.
Tequila?
I do like tequila.
But I shouldn't.
Look, booze can be our thing.
It's obviously not gonna be sex.
You said so yourself.
Can't it be psychology?
I'm sorry, I wish it could be, but booze and sex are the only two choices.
Fine.
Just one.
Great.
There, you happy now?
Uh, yes.
Are you?
Nope, not yet.
Well, that's the end of that.
- End of what?
- My sobriety.
Your sobriety?
Yep.
It's a battle, and I guess I lost today.
Wait a minute.
Are you a...
Alcoholic?
Oh, yeah.
Big-time.
So the Denny's incident,
Macy's, the elevator...
That was tequila.
Should never drink tequila.
But you just drank, like, half the bottle.
I know, we should switch to rum.
Great idea.
There's a bottle under the bed in the observation room.
You grab that, I'll get us some real glasses, and we'll get some work done around here.
Oh, finally.
This was a great idea.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Let me out of here!
Not until you dry out.
I'm not gonna have your boozy meltdown on my head.
You open this door or I'm gonna knock it down.
I have been drinking tequila and I have the strength of four Mexicans.
Sorry, one of us has to be sober to do all of this work, and it's certainly not gonna be me.
Hey, Sean.
I'm just out shopping for the baby.
What's up?
Listen, I've been thinking a lot about this.
- Ah, you're pretty freaked out, huh?
- What, are you kidding?
This is the best thing that has ever happened to me.
- What?
- Yeah, I've never been so excited in my life.
I hope it's cool, but I told my family.
My mom couldn't stop crying.
She's been in pretty poor health and she was afraid that I wouldn't have a baby before she died.
I'll call you later, okay?
I thought of a whole bunch of names.
I did.
Lacey, go.
He's fine with it.
- What?
- He thinks I'm gonna be a wonderful mother.
He told his family.
What a dick.
Let's see how cool he can be when he thinks he's gonna have two babies with two wonderful moms.
I'll call you back.
- Sean, go.
- Hey, Sean.
Lacey, hey, I wasn't expecting to hear from you.
What's up?
I just got back from the doctor and I have some pretty shocking news.
I am completely pregnant with your baby.
Oh, really?
Yeah, this is a super big deal.
It's, like, growing inside me.
That sucks.
So, what do you need, like 300 bucks or something?
I mean, we kinda... we gotta get this taken care of pronto, right?
Before that thing starts sucking its thumb in there.
Have you seen those pictures?
It's really creepy.
So, uh, wait.
You don't want me to have your baby?
No offense, but you as a mom?
Come on, you can barely feed yourself.
I am trying to stay thin!
Is he freaking out?
He said I would be a horrible mom!
Oh, I'm so sorry, Lacey.
I hate him so much!
Please, can we kill him?
Oh, wait.
I just remembered.
He had a vasectomy.
It's been four hours.
Let me out of here.
Not until you sober up.
Why don't you try sleeping it off in that bed?
It's like a little motel room in there.
Hundreds of people have had sex on that bed.
Okay, like a seedy little motel room.
Look, I am not even mad at you anymore, okay?
I'm mad at me.
I was really getting my sobriety back together again and I just threw it all away.
How long were you sober?
I was sober during the entire 10 years of my marriage.
And when my husband left me for my evil twin sister...
I went straight to the bar and I spent the last six months systematically destroying my career and winning wet T-shirt contests for beer money.
I'm not sure if this the right moment, but I recently mentioned to a friend of mine how adorable your boobs are.
Will you let me out now?
I'd really like to get back to work.
Sure.
This has been pretty hard for me.
I know it's stupid, but I could really use a hug.
Come here.
- Oof.
- Ow.
Damn it.
Good luck getting all this work done without me.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
If you stay until Friday,
I'll let you knee me in the balls again.
Anyway, I thought I could do all of this by myself, but obviously I can't.
So, the best way that you can help me is to watch the tapes of the recent test couples and document their sexual activity.
I'm quite familiar with this process.
Please feel confident that you can do your work and I will accomplish...
Shh, Jimbo, I'm trying to work.
Hey, Charlie.
What the hell are you doing here?
- You quit.
- No, I didn't.
I was just proving a point.
So, to prove a point,
I had to sleep with a bag of frozen peas on my balls?
You had it coming.
- Who's that?
- Your replacement.
Oh, well, he can go now.
Look, I hired Dr. Feedler because he's a preeminent psychologist and a consummate professional.
Oh, yeah.
Give it to her.
Who comes highly recommended.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, Mommy, oh, yeah.
Come on.
- By many doctors.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, oh.
Gonna make Daddy cry.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, Jimbo?
Why don't you take this in the next room and actually write some notes?
Don't worry, it's soundproof, so knock yourself out.
Look, the board forced me to hire you, so I did.
But you quit and I replaced you.
My uncle is in charge of the entire grant foundation, and he says if I'm not working here, he's going to shut down your entire study.
I'm sorry, what?
It gets worse.
He says that I am in charge, so I guess that kind of makes me your boss.
You're my boss?
And we start at 9:00 AM here.
And I think that our first priority should be making this an alcohol-free office.
Okay, why don't we take all the booze and put it in that room over there?
Dr. Feedler is touching himself.
Yeah, I thought you might enjoy that.
Who wants a drink now?
Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm late.
Doing some paperwork.
Nolan, you start.
What is bothering you today?
Well, for starters, you're wearing a woman's shirt.
All right, I wasn't doing paperwork.
I needed a shirt, it was dark, and luckily the nude girl in my bed wasn't wearing hers.
And there she goes now.
Bye, sweetie.
Now, on a more serious note,
Patrick, why are you Ed?
I took Nolan's chair because I've got to look at you straight on.
I hurt my neck in a car accident.
I rear-ended a guy and he got out of his car and punched me in the neck.
But you kept your cool, which I think is a testament to my mad skills as an anger management therapist.
Actually, my seat belt locked up on me and I couldn't reach the crowbar in my back seat.
Minor detail.
I am still putting this in the win column.
I'm very uncomfortable.
Everything's different today.
I'm sitting in the wrong chair and you look like my mom... but hotter.
Hey, Charlie.
I'm going on a talent scout tonight.
You got 40 singles on you?
Oh, hey, you guys are all here.
- Hey, Lacey.
- I'm not talking to you.
Too late.
You just did.
That was me just telling you I'm not talking to you, loser.
Cool, so now we're having a conversation.
Uh, Sean, I don't have any singles, but if you wanna make yourself some "coffee,"
there's a "coffee" can in the pantry.
Ahem.
There's a bunch of singles in there.
How could you be friends with that dirtbag?
That son of a bitch was sleeping with me while he was living with Charlie's ex-wife.
You slept with Sean?
This is turning into my favorite therapy session ever.
Except for that.
Ed, look at that.
Ow!
( Chuckles ) It had to be done.
Lacey, I don't like Sean, I'm just hanging out with him.
I mean, haven't you ever had a friend that you hated?
- I hate all my friends.
- Well, there you go.
( Phone chiming )
Excuse me.
You got Charlie.
Yeah?
What?
All right, I'll be right there.
Sorry, guys.
I gotta get down to the college.
It's an emergency.
A bunch of frat guys are throwing a party in my research lab.
Hey, you only had a dollar in the can.

I've been drinking a lot of coffee.
Hey, can you give me a ride to my office?
That girl drove me home last night.
I left my car where I met her.
- Where did you meet her?
- I have no idea.
Maybe afterwards you could drive me around Los Angeles while I click my car alarm?

He married my twin sister.
What was he looking for?
I'm really not sure.
You know what?
Thanks for stopping by.
All I wanted to do was come by and be super confident and have you give me the job on my merits.
Well, you failed.
I can't leave.
Why not?
I already have the job.
Okay, I see we're still trying to find a balance with the meds.
No, the grant foundation was worried that the project was becoming unstable, so they interviewed potential partners for you and they decided on me.
They hired you to add stability?
Yes.
I am supposed to give you a copy of this contract.
What the hell happened to it?
When I'm nervous, I eat paper.
I'm not proud of it.
I know, I know, I said I wanted to hire you.
But the grant foundation is forcing me to hire this emotional train wreck.
I can't.
She's looking right at me.
All right, bye-bye.
Look, I know you're not happy that I'm here, but I'm a professional and I am damn good.
And I would appreciate it if you would behave like a professional as well.
Okay.
Okay, then, why don't you watch the DVDs of the last run of couples and summarize the computer readouts?
What are the couples doing?
Well, let's see.
It's a sex study, so they are building furniture from Sweden.
They're having sex.
- Live sex?
- Yes, live.
Unless you're looking for the necrophilia study.
Well, that's down the hall.
Uh, wouldn't it be faster if I just looked at the computer readouts?
Oh, my God.
You're a sex researcher and you don't like watching people have sex.
Look, most of the research that I've done is dry, and this is... wet.
Oh, God.
Look what you made me say.
You think sex is dirty.
I think sex is beautiful.
I think people make it dirty.
That's what makes it beautiful.
So everything I've heard about you is true.
Wow, that is really judgmental coming from a gal who pees in elevators.
Hey, I was stood up on Valentine's Day and I had to drink an entire bottle of champagne by myself.
You know why you got stood up?
Because you only like sex when it's beautiful under an enchanted rainbow.
Well, guess what?
At the end of that rainbow, all the leprechauns and unicorns are watching you.
And they're all playing with themselves.
- You're disgusting.
- You're a prude.
- I'm leaving.
- No, I'm leaving.
Then we're both leaving.
Fine... but I'm taking the stairs.
I know what you do in elevators.
So, did you totally freak out when you looked down at your phone and saw it was me?
Well, when you called, I thought, "This is odd."
And then I thought, "I'm kinda cool."
You might wanna hang out with me."
Oh, God, no.
Did you know Sean is back in town?
- Ugh.
- God, I hate him.
You know he had the balls to call me and try and get back together?
He called you?
He didn't call me.
I thought you hated him.
Oh, yeah.
That's right.
That's why I wanted to see you.
We never got back at him for sleeping with both of us at the same time, so I say we should do it now.
What do you have in mind?
I have an idea, but we're gonna need some roofies and a tattoo gun.
Your evil little heart is in the right place, but I have a better idea.
Wow, not a good day to be ice.
It's my new PhD.
She's driving me nuts.
- Is she cute?
- Well, sure, if you think sexually repressed, emotionally screwed-up women are cute.
How are the boobs?
Those are adorable.
( Phone chimes )
It's Sean, go.
Hi, Sean, it's Jennifer.
Hey, Jen.
What's happening?
We need to talk.
Yeah, what's up?
I'm pregnant.
Oh, my God.
Are you sure it's mine?
Yes, I'm absolutely sure.
Uh, boy, wow.
I gotta think about this.
I'll call you back.
( Laughing )
He couldn't even talk.
He was like, "I guess, uh, hmm",
I'm gonna have to call you back.
"'Cause, hmm, I'm about to go crap my pants."
( Both laughing )
Of course she's not pregnant.
I had a vasectomy years ago.
Wow, a vasectomy.
Didn't you ever want kids?
No, kids are just little people you're not allowed to drink with.
- Hey there.
- Afternoon.
Sorry I'm late.
I had a thing this morning.
It's called sleeping in.
Anyway, in the spirit of compromise, today I will watch the DVDs, you analyze the data.
You know, I felt guilty all night that I didn't watch those DVDs.
- I can do that.
- Well, it obviously makes you uncomfortable, so today we'll switch.
It was eating me alive all night.
I have to do this.
I chewed through my mouth guard.
Okay, you can do it.
Thank you.
I take it back.
I can't.
You do it.
You're a guy, you like this stuff.
All right, we are gonna go about this in a different way.
How do you like your scotch?
I don't.
Look, we both need to relax so we can get over this hump and you can start watching people hump.
Alcohol and I don't mix.
Tequila?
I do like tequila.
But I shouldn't.
Look, booze can be our thing.
It's obviously not gonna be sex.
You said so yourself.
Can't it be psychology?
I'm sorry, I wish it could be, but booze and sex are the only two choices.
Fine.
Just one.
Great.
There, you happy now?
Uh, yes.
Are you?
Nope, not yet.
Well, that's the end of that.
- End of what?
- My sobriety.
Your sobriety?
Yep.
It's a battle, and I guess I lost today.
Wait a minute.
Are you a...
Alcoholic?
Oh, yeah.
Big-time.
So the Denny's incident,
Macy's, the elevator...
That was tequila.
( Whispers ) Should never drink tequila.
But you just drank, like, half the bottle.
I know, we should switch to rum.
Great idea.
There's a bottle under the bed in the observation room.
You grab that, I'll get us some real glasses, and we'll get some work done around here.
Oh, finally.
This was a great idea.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Let me out of here!
Not until you dry out.
I'm not gonna have your boozy meltdown on my head.
You open this door or I'm gonna knock it down.
I have been drinking tequila and I have the strength of four Mexicans.
Sorry, one of us has to be sober to do all of this work, and it's certainly not gonna be me.
( Chimes ) Hey, Sean.
I'm just out shopping for the baby.
What's up?
Listen, I've been thinking a lot about this.
- Ah, you're pretty freaked out, huh?
- What, are you kidding?
This is the best thing that has ever happened to me.
- What?
- Yeah, I've never been so excited in my life.
I hope it's cool, but I told my family.
My mom couldn't stop crying.
She's been in pretty poor health and she was afraid that I wouldn't have a baby before she died.
I'll call you later, okay?
I thought of a whole bunch of names.
I did.
( Whimpers )
( Chimes ) Lacey, go.
He's fine with it.
- What?
- He thinks I'm gonna be a wonderful mother.
He told his family.
What a dick.
Let's see how cool he can be when he thinks he's gonna have two babies with two wonderful moms.
I'll call you back.
- Sean, go.
- Hey, Sean.
Lacey, hey, I wasn't expecting to hear from you.
What's up?
I just got back from the doctor and I have some pretty shocking news.
I am completely pregnant with your baby.
Oh, really?
Yeah, this is a super big deal.
It's, like, growing inside me.
That sucks.
So, what do you need, like 300 bucks or something?
I mean, we kinda... we gotta get this taken care of pronto, right?
Before that thing starts sucking its thumb in there.
Have you seen those pictures?
It's really creepy.
So, uh, wait.
You don't want me to have your baby?
( Laughs ) No offense, but you as a mom?
Come on, you can barely feed yourself.
I am trying to stay thin!
( Laughs )
( Chimes ) Is he freaking out?
He said I would be a horrible mom!
Oh, I'm so sorry, Lacey.
I hate him so much!
Please, can we kill him?
Oh, wait.
I just remembered.
He had a vasectomy.
It's been four hours.
Let me out of here.
Not until you sober up.
Why don't you try sleeping it off in that bed?
It's like a little motel room in there.
Hundreds of people have had sex on that bed.
Okay, like a seedy little motel room.
Look, I am not even mad at you anymore, okay?
I'm mad at me.
I was really getting my sobriety back together again and I just threw it all away.
How long were you sober?
I was sober during the entire 10 years of my marriage.
And when my husband left me for my evil twin sister...
I went straight to the bar and I spent the last six months systematically destroying my career and winning wet T-shirt contests for beer money.
I'm not sure if this the right moment, but I recently mentioned to a friend of mine how adorable your boobs are.
Will you let me out now?
I'd really like to get back to work.
Sure.
( Sighs )
This has been pretty hard for me.
I know it's stupid, but I could really use a hug.
Come here.
- Oof.
- Ow.
Damn it.
Good luck getting all this work done without me.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
If you stay until Friday,
I'll let you knee me in the balls again.
Anyway, I thought I could do all of this by myself, but obviously I can't.
So, the best way that you can help me is to watch the tapes of the recent test couples and document their sexual activity.
I'm quite familiar with this process.
Please feel confident that you can do your work and I will accomplish...
Shh, Jimbo, I'm trying to work.
Hey, Charlie.
What the hell are you doing here?
- You quit.
- No, I didn't.
I was just proving a point.
So, to prove a point,
I had to sleep with a bag of frozen peas on my balls?
You had it coming.
- Who's that?
- Your replacement.
Oh, well, he can go now.
Look, I hired Dr. Feedler because he's a preeminent psychologist and a consummate professional.
Oh, yeah.
Give it to her.
Who comes highly recommended.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, Mommy, oh, yeah.
Come on.
- By many doctors.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, oh.
Gonna make Daddy cry.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, Jimbo?
Why don't you take this in the next room and actually write some notes?
Don't worry, it's soundproof, so knock yourself out.
Look, the board forced me to hire you, so I did.
But you quit and I replaced you.
My uncle is in charge of the entire grant foundation, and he says if I'm not working here, he's going to shut down your entire study.
( Stutters ) I'm sorry, what?
It gets worse.
He says that I am in charge, so I guess that kind of makes me your boss.
You're my boss?
And we start at 9:00 AM here.
And I think that our first priority should be making this an alcohol-free office.
Okay, why don't we take all the booze and put it in that room over there?
Dr. Feedler is touching himself.
Yeah, I thought you might enjoy that.
Who wants a drink now?
I intend to do business with Billy Kimber.
Is there any man here named Shelby?
I am planning an expansion.
Onto the racetracks.
It would be an honour to work with you, Mr Kimber.
Nobody works with me.
People work FOR me.
'Danny, you are a good man and a good soldier.'
Yes, Sergeant Major.
Freddie Thorne is at the very top of my list.
Well, cross him off.
He won't be returning to this city.
We're not going anywhere, Ada.
We are going to stay here and we'll marry here, with our baby.
I'm not afraid of Tommy Shelby.
Thomas, you sell those guns to anyone who has use for them, you will hang.
Dump them somewhere the police can find them.
No.
Thomas Shelby is now the beginning, middle and end of your mission.
So what shall I do?
You must do everything you can to get close to him.
Dig out a nice dress.
I want to take you to the races.
I warn you, I'll break your heart.
Already broken.
This programme contains some violent scenes and some strong language.
Give me a bottle of whiskey and three glasses please.
Scotch or Irish?
Irish.
I've decided not to go.
To the races.
Not unless you give me two pounds, ten shillings towards the dress.
I've already given you three.
How much did you pay for the suit you'll be wearing?
Oh, I don't pay for suits.
My suits are on the house or the house burns down.
So you want me to go looking like a flower girl?
What I want makes no difference.
It's not me you're dressing up for.
You'll forgive me, Mr Shelby, if I indulge a little.
Please.
It takes a lot for a man from Sparkbrook to step inside this pub.
Anyone with money and good intentions is welcome in the Garrison.
Now... you said you had business.
It's delicate, Mr Shelby.
It's a question of who knows what about what.
It concerns the factory down the road, at the BSA.
As you might know, most of the paint shop there is Irish.
Big old place like that, rumours get started.
Rumours that there was a robbery.
Robbery of what?
Guns, Mr Shelby.
A serious amount of guns.
What business is that of mine?
When it comes to speculation, you can't beat a factory night shift.
Some say there was word from the proofing bay it was the Peaky Blinders who took them.
Your night shift must be dreaming.
Maybe they are.
Maybe they're not.
What we are trying to say is, Mr Shelby, that if you were to hear about the whereabouts of said items...
..we'd pay good money.
You have good money?
We have collections from the pubs.
For who do you speak?
The people of Ireland.
The Irish Republican Army.
For a fact?
For a fucking fact.
You think we're jokers?
Am I laughing?
♪ Oh, father, why are you so sad
♪ On this bright Easter morn'... ♪
Maguire, will you shut up?
♪ When Irishmen are proud and glad
♪ Of the land Where they were born?
♪
Maguire, away and shite man, we're trying to talk business... ♪ Oh, son, I see sad mem'ries view
♪ Of far-off distant days
♪ When being just a boy like you
♪ I joined the IRA. ♪
Bravo!
♪ Where are the lads... ♪ All right, boys.
If I hear anything about who knows what about what, I'll let you know.
♪ Gra mo chree, I long to see
♪ The boys of the old IRA... ♪
I thought you only allowed singing on a Saturday.
Whiskey is good proofing water.
It tells you who's real and who isn't.
And what did my countrymen want?
They're nobodies.
They drink in The Black Swan in Sparkbrook.
They're only rebels because they like the songs.
You have sympathies with them?
I have no sympathies of any description.
Their accents were so thick, it's a wonder you could understand them.
Next time, I could translate.
You'd work for me?
I thought I already was.
So you are coming to the races?
Two pounds, ten shillings.
Ten shillings.
Buy something red.
To match his handkerchief.
Whose handkerchief?
Ada, what the hell?
I dared myself to run through their territory in my dress.
Are you mad?
Yeah.
Mad as hell with all of them.
I love you.
I love you too.
The more they try to stop us, the madder I'll be.
Come on, princess, the vicar's waiting.
Wait...
How do I look?
Like an angel.
Moss?
What do we know about The Black Swan?
An operative has provided intelligence that it is a place where IRA men gather.
It's just a lot of drunken navigators singing songs, sir.
The IRA wouldn't go near them.
Then why are two of them looking to buy guns?
Do you have names?
Must she do everything for you?
"She", sir?
One female operative has proved more useful than any of you great lumps of men.
We are regular police officers, sir.
Not spies.
We can only act when a crime has been committed.
Perhaps I should send some men down to The Black Swan to ask questions.
And scare them all into hiding?
Not the best of tactics, Sergeant.
My tactics come from my experiences in France.
Most of my great lumps of men served in France too, sir.
I serve my country every day.
That will be all, Sergeant.
Away and shite!
Fancy me, do ya?
What are you?
A copper?
Oh!
Proddy bitch!
I've seen you.
I've seen your face, serving in the Garrison.
Come here...
I am taking you in for interrogation on behalf of the Irish Free State.
All right?
Are you armed?
No.
Then I'll tell you.
Ada and Freddie Thorne were married today.
They defied your orders, they haven't left the city.
I'll deal with it.
Thomas...
I'll deal with it.
Where are they?
Freddie's comrades have safe houses.
Why do you want to know?
I want to send them flowers.
Why do you think?
Would it be so bad if they stayed?
I promised I'd run Freddie out of town.
Promised who?
I told the coppers Freddie wouldn't come back.
It's part of the deal.
What bloody deal?
What happened to family votes?
What happened to meetings?
If you let me deal with Ada and Freddie, it'll end in peace.
Christ knows you've had your fill of war.
You get Freddie out of town, Poll.
Or else I'll deal with it myself.
The victim had been drinking in The Black Swan pub, sir - the pub you told me about.
And a neighbour said she saw a young woman leaving the street where the body was found.
A woman, sir.
I was wondering if there was a connection.
A connection with what, Sergeant?
You said your spy was a woman, sir.
I wondered if now there was now a policy.
Shoot to kill.
Like there was in Belfast.
The Republicans are famously factional.
He was killed by one of his own.
That will be all, Sergeant.
And they're not called spies.
They're called operatives.
Operatives, sir.
Right, sir.
It's how you say things.
Yeah...
What the bloody hell is she doing here?
ã200, Freddie.
For what?
For us.
For a honeymoon that goes on for ever.
Where did it come from?
Family fund.
The pockets of widows and desperate men.
See sense, Freddie.
Tommy is not going to let this rest.
Times like these, a communist in the family is bad for business.
You have to leave the city.
You think I can't handle Tommy Shelby?
You can't.
I'm having trouble these days and I'm twice the man you are.
I went into town.
The Cunard office.
I booked you both tickets on the next boat from Liverpool to New York.
America, Freddie.
They've already had their revolution.
You won't have to bother.
Will you ladies at least let a man sleep on it?
You had no business...
Observe and report.
That is your remit.
I decided we needed to know where he lived.
I warned you not to let your personal history cloud your judgment.
You went after him because he was IRA.
I followed him because I thought he might have information.
According to the rules,
I should pull you out of Garrison Lane immediately.
No.
Cheltenham is tomorrow.
You take too much upon yourself.
This is an active military mission - your words.
I'm doing my job.
Grace, the death of a base Fenian doesn't concern me.
Your welfare does.
Killing a man affects the heart.
And as for my heart...
I know that because of our family connections, you take my progress personally.
But I don't need you to be my father.
I will be thinking of you.
Mr Shelby, sir.
Mr Zhang.
That suit is sold, sir.
It's being collected this morning.
I know.
Please, gentlemen.
No fighting in here.
It's all right.
I come as a friend.
You're collecting your suit for Cheltenham - it's very nice.
How the bloody hell do you know?
I know a lot of things, Mr Kimber.
And as I told you before, I know the Lee brothers.
And I know they're going to be at the Cheltenham races as well.
They're going to lose a lot of money on fast women and slow nags.
No.
They're planning on showing up in numbers and robbing your bookies.
Running chalk and rafflers.
You think I can't handle the Lees?
Just a word of warning from a friend.
That's all.
I'll see you at Cheltenham.
I'll wave at you from my box.
If you're coming to the races, bring that pretty barmaid of yours.
Already invited.
Comrades - as you know, to even gather like this today is illegal.
Chief Inspector Campbell has ordered that we are not allowed to assemble in groups of more than three people.
So, to comply with the law, please now clump together in groups of three.
You hear that, boys?
The same whistles they used to blow to send us over the top, they now blow to try and break us up.
So before the Specials get here, raise a hand, all those who want to strike...
Now disperse!
Disperse and take the message home!
United, we will never be defeated!
Tommy!
Oi, Tommy.
What the hell's been happening?
The police had just raided a rally at the factory.
You thinking Freddie Thorne's back?
I know he is.
And he's with Ada.
How hard can it be to find the only girl in Birmingham with four-inch heels, eh?
She's with the commies.
They have little rat holes all over the city.
I just want to know where she is.
Tommy, you'd best have a word with Arthur as well.
What's wrong with bloody Arthur?
He's got the Flanders blues again.
People keep asking me questions that I don't know the answer to.
"Is it true your Ada got married?"
I say, "I don't know."
"Where is she living now?"
"I don't know."
"Arthur...
"..who killed the Paddy from The Black Swan?"
I go, "What Paddy?"
They say... .."Is it you, Peaky Blinders, who stole the guns from the BSA?"
What guns, Tommy?
Arthur, after your beating, I thought you needed a break...
What bloody guns, Tommy?
!
Arthur, I was going to tell you.
You were going to tell me.
Arthur, listen to me.
You've had a hard time these past few years.
God knows you have.
You deserve some rest.
We had some luck.
Some bloody luck.
It fell off a wagon into our laps.
And all you need to know is, it's us that has the machine guns now.
And it's them that's in the mud.
All right?
Come on.
I have a surprise for you.
Come on.
A surprise?
Where is she?
What is it you've always wanted, Arthur?
Eh?
When we were in France, you used to say,
"When I get back to England, I want to own my own pub."
Well...
You've gone soft.
You've gone soft, Tommy.
How do we know it's for sale?
Everything's for sale to us, Arthur.
We're making a lot of money these days.
We need a legitimate business to pass the money from the shop.
I wouldn't know what to do.
You've spent two-thirds of your life in pubs.
Just pour it instead of drinking it.
But I can still drink it, right?
Your pub - you do what you want.
Ah - sorry, gentlemen, I didn't hear you come in.
What can I get you?
Bloody kids.
The other one's punctured as well.
Mr Campbell wants an explanation.
Today, some rabble-rouser Union man brought the BSA out on strike.
It was Freddie Thorne.
I thought you promised he wouldn't come back.
I know he's in town.
I'm dealing with it.
Inspector Campbell thought you controlled your territories.
Yeah.
I said I'm dealing with it.
I heard that, er... ..Freddie married your sister.
Some family you've got, eh?
Bet you can't wait for Christmas.
Deliver Freddie Thorne to us or we'll take your sister in as an accomplice.
She'll get four years for sedition.
Or you can turn him in and your sister goes free.
I'll say good night then, Tom.
Have you seen Freddie Thorne?
No.
Or Tommy?
Ahh!
I have to find Freddie.
Drink this first.
No, I have to find them, I think they are going to kill each other.
Who is going to kill who?
We need to talk.
What exactly is it that you want, Freddie?
I came to tell you...
..that's not going to work, Tommy.
Polly came round.
She gave me that.
Well, Polly must have had a rush of blood.
Or port wine.
Your honesty is appreciated.
Now, if you're not going to use that thing...
I'm not finished.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Sit.
Talk to me about the guns.
Do you remember we used to jump in here, see who could swim the fastest...?
I'm here to talk business, Tommy.
Do you reckon we could still do it?
Ah!
You loaded Ada with your bastard because she's a Shelby.
You thought it'd mean you'd be somebody.
I won't let you fuck up my sister's life for your cause.
My God.
You actually believe that.
I love her, Tommy.
I've loved her since she was nine and I was 12.
And she loves me the same.
You even know the word?
This marriage will not stand.
Shh...
Freddie didn't want your money.
And now the coppers are saying if we don't turn Freddie in, they'll put Ada on the arrest warrant as well.
That's where your compassion gets you, Poll.
From now on, we do it my way.
Or what?
Ready?
They're getting closer.
I'll lead.
Watch yourself, Danny.
Tommy.
Be careful, Danny.
Tommy!
Tommy!
Aargh!
Arrrggghhh!
Arrrggghhh!
Tommy!
Tommy?
Tommy!
Tommy?
It's open.
Private Whizz Bang reporting, sir.
At ease.
So, what news from London?
I was in a pub - it was called Mother Redcap.
An Irish pub.
I got talking to some old bloke about Birmingham.
He said there's been trouble.
An IRA man shot.
He said a lot, but the only bit I heard... was that their high command think it's the Peaky Blinders who shot him.
Came up on the next boat to warn you.
Is it true?
No.
But lies travel faster than the truth.
Get a message to them.
Tell them to send someone to parley.
Tell them there's been a misunderstanding and we don't want any trouble.
You've got enough trouble - right, Tommy?
A whisky and a smoke.
I can smell it in the air.
I use it sometimes myself.
I call it "my sweetheart".
They gave us the worst job, Tommy.
Yeah... ..and we fucking volunteered.
Sometimes, it lasts all night.
I lie here and I listen to the shovels and the picks against that wall there.
And I pray the sun will come up at the curtains before they break through.
'No, I don't pray
- I hope.
'And sometimes, it happens.
'The sun beats them.
'But mostly...
'..the shovels beat the sun.'
Your sister was here.
She was worried.
You and Freddie.
It had made her sick...
She's all right, but in her condition, she needs peace.
Women talk.
That is something they do.
She talked about you.
She said you keep everything locked up.
Well, that's what men do.
Your sister's nice.
I like her.
It can't be easy for her.
Her brother and her husband, fighting over the same thing.
Men should talk, too.
To you?
Why not?
I'm a barmaid.
It's my job.
Men always tell their troubles to a barmaid.
What is it you and Freddie are fighting over?
I'll meet you here at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.
Did you buy a dress?
Yes.
I bought a dress.
How does it look?
He's changed the oil and greased her up.
So will it get me all the way to Cheltenham, Curly?
He's good with motors, but it pains him.
No heart in motorcars.
I can't talk with them.
Yeah
- Tommy might need to make a fast getaway.
The Lees will be all over the track.
And Kimber's men.
And his coppers.
They control the law down there, Tommy.
Give her a turn for me, Charlie.
This car only seats four.
You'll need more men than that if you're to come back alive.
It'll be just me and a girl.
Is it just the two of us going to the races?
Something like that.
Attention!
Right.
This is what was known as the final briefing before going over the top.
60 miles down that road is Cheltenham racetrack.
Johnny, what's our mission, boy?
To stick it to the Lee family, Arthur.
That's right.
The Lees are skimming money off legal bookies.
Running chalk, selling rafflers, beating up them as won't buy.
But today, we're going to stop them.
What about Kimber's men?
I thought he had his own protection.
Kimber's let his troops go rotten.
They're on the take from the Lees to look the other way.
We are going to show Kimber how it should be done.
Now take what you're good at.
Those of you with guns, keep them out of it, unless a gun is pulled on you.
We want this done quietly.
So when do we share out the cash?
We don't.
We're not keeping the cash.
You're in Tommy's army now, boys.
Trust only kin.
Let's go.
Are you sure we're allowed in here?
Well, I prefer to come to the races the back way.
It keeps me out of trouble.
Tracks are lawless places.
I can't stand petty criminals.
This way.
Will we get to lay a bet?
No - gambling is for mugs.
This way...
You're lucky you're with me or you'd be wasting your money on fixed races.
I always wondered, how do you fix a race?
How should I know?
OK, you do the talking.
What?
Tell security you are Lady Sarah Duggan...
Excuse us, excuse us... ..Lady Sarah Duggan of Connemara.
You got lost when you went to look for the boy riding your horse
- Dandy Flower.
If they ask about me, say I'm Prussian and don't speak a word of English.
Come on, posh girl.
Earn your three quid.
I still prefer the Garrison.
Do you dance?
If I'm asked properly.
Lady Sarah of Connemara, will you dance with me?
Roberts.
The Peaky Blinders are here.
I told you, Mr Kimber.
He's got some balls, that one.
And she's got some body, that one.
Chalk for your blackboards.
Five pounds a stick.
It's a pleasure doing business with you.
Hello, Raz.
How's business?
Argh!
Ugh!
Fucking... get up!
Fucking...
ARRGGHH!
Stay still, Raz, or I'll take the whole ear off.
And you're going to need your ears to listen.
No more chalking on Billy Kimber's boys.
Right?
We're the protection now.
I commandeer this stolen money by order of the Peaky Blinders.
Agghh!
Either your left leg is stronger than your right or we're making a getaway.
Neither.
I hope this doesn't involve razor blades.
I've decided to move up in the world.
Become a legitimate businessman.
My gosh.
You're serious.
I'm always serious.
We chased the Lees across the track, right the way down the Devon road.
We got every penny back.
Nice dress.
You can wear that to my pub.
Buy the boys a drink.
Anybody hurt?
A few cuts and bruises.
Off we go, Lady Sarah.
Steady on...
Excuse me.
Your money, Mr Kimber.
Rescued from the Lee brothers and returned to you with a request for a fair hearing.
Your own protection is failing, Mr Kimber.
Your boys are taking cuts.
I want to suggest that from now on, you contract out your racetrack security to the Peaky Blinders.
We would be saving you a lot of money, Mr Kimber.
A lot of money.
In return, you give us... ..5% of the take and three legal betting pitches at every race meeting north of the River Severn, rising to six after one year if we are all satisfied with the service.
What do you say, Mr Kimber?
I say you talk business to my accountant.
I want to dance.
Your man said it was all right for me to have this dance.
How many men can you put in the field at one time?
There's a lot of men out of work at the moment.
Two guards for every bookie.
At every meeting?
We have contacts with good people among the gypsies.
We'll always know where the Lees plan to attack.
With all the strikes and troubles, you can't depend on the police.
Anyway... we're more honest.
Looks like you two are making a deal.
We are making progress.
Then let me throw a small condition into the mix.
So, listen... we're going to go for dinner at Kimber's house.
He has a place a couple of miles away.
I have some business to settle first with his accountant, so...
You go on ahead, with Kimber.
Just me and him?
Yeah... until I'm done here.
Is that all right?
I'll throw in an extra three quid for your extra time.
You think I'm a whore?
Everybody's a whore, Grace.
We just sell different parts of ourselves.
You said you wanted to work for me.
To do that, you have to sharpen up.
The deal is I give him two hours with you.
He thinks he's a ladies' man.
He thinks he can seduce you.
Whenever you want, just kick him in the balls.
I'm a clause in a contract.
If you want to be part of my organisation, you have to make sacrifices.
Do we have a deal?
As a sweetener, you can try your luck with mine.
Yes, we have a deal.
Two hours?
Yeah.
Side bet.
Ten pounds says I'll have her fucked in one.
Mademoiselle.
I bet he said you could have me, didn't he?
While he has her.
That's the arrangement, isn't it?
Yours might be a prostitute, but I'm not.
I was a milliner when I met him.
I was independent.
I made this hat.
I was a good milliner.
It's a very pretty hat.
It really is.
So is she a prostitute?
God's honest truth?
I don't know what she is.
You showed me up back there at the races.
Why don't you teach me how to dance properly?
The music is too slow.
Put on a Charleston.
Then we'd be far away.
I want to dance like this.
Come on.
You weren't so stiff back there, were you?
You ever been in a house this big?
Hm?
Look at you.
You look like a bloody film star.
I want a cigarette.
Oh, look, I dropped something.
Pick it up.
Pick it up yourself.
You're a fucking barmaid.
If I drop a glass on the floor, you pick it up.
I want to watch you pick it up.
Right, you little slag.
I have tried to be nice.
If I drop a glass on the floor, you bend over and fucking pick up the fucking glass, OK?
What?
!
No, sir... no.
What are you doing here?
I've got another hour.
Just wait - listen to me.
Just listen to me.
I was going to let you go through with it, but in the end, my conscience got the better of me.
She looks good on the outside... ..but she has the clap.
Yeah.
Syphilis.
When you took a shine to her, I thought I'd use her.
Somebody told me she had syph and I thought, "What the hell?"
Call it my better nature.
She's... she's a whore.
Just go and wait in the car.
I can walk on my own!
Can we shake hands and forget this ever happened?
Start of the day, I was Lady Sarah of Connemara.
By the end, I was a whore with the clap.
You're a fucking bastard, offering me like that.
But then you changed your mind.
Why did you change your mind, Thomas?
I intend to do business with Billy Kimber.
Is there any man here named Shelby?
I am planning an expansion.
Onto the racetracks.
It would be an honour to work with you, Mr Kimber.
Nobody works with me.
People work FOR me.
'Danny, you are a good man and a good soldier.'
Yes, Sergeant Major.
Freddie Thorne is at the very top of my list.
Well, cross him off.
He won't be returning to this city.
We're not going anywhere, Ada.
We are going to stay here and we'll marry here, with our baby.
I'm not afraid of Tommy Shelby.
Thomas, you sell those guns to anyone who has use for them, you will hang.
Dump them somewhere the police can find them.
No.
Thomas Shelby is now the beginning, middle and end of your mission.
So what shall I do?
You must do everything you can to get close to him.
Dig out a nice dress.
I want to take you to the races.
I warn you, I'll break your heart.
Already broken.
This programme contains some violent scenes and some strong language.
Give me a bottle of whiskey and three glasses please.
Scotch or Irish?
Irish.
I've decided not to go.
To the races.
Not unless you give me two pounds, ten shillings towards the dress.
I've already given you three.
How much did you pay for the suit you'll be wearing?
Oh, I don't pay for suits.
My suits are on the house or the house burns down.
So you want me to go looking like a flower girl?
What I want makes no difference.
It's not me you're dressing up for.
You'll forgive me, Mr Shelby, if I indulge a little.
Please.
It takes a lot for a man from Sparkbrook to step inside this pub.
Anyone with money and good intentions is welcome in the Garrison.
Now... you said you had business.
It's delicate, Mr Shelby.
It's a question of who knows what about what.
It concerns the factory down the road, at the BSA.
As you might know, most of the paint shop there is Irish.
Big old place like that, rumours get started.
Rumours that there was a robbery.
Robbery of what?
Guns, Mr Shelby.
A serious amount of guns.
What business is that of mine?
When it comes to speculation, you can't beat a factory night shift.
Some say there was word from the proofing bay it was the Peaky Blinders who took them.
Your night shift must be dreaming.
Maybe they are.
Maybe they're not.
What we are trying to say is, Mr Shelby, that if you were to hear about the whereabouts of said items...
..we'd pay good money.
You have good money?
We have collections from the pubs.
For who do you speak?
The people of Ireland.
The Irish Republican Army.
For a fact?
For a fucking fact.
You think we're jokers?
Am I laughing?
♪ Oh, father, why are you so sad
♪ On this bright Easter morn'... ♪
Maguire, will you shut up?
♪ When Irishmen are proud and glad
♪ Of the land Where they were born?
♪
Maguire, away and shite man, we're trying to talk business... ♪ Oh, son, I see sad mem'ries view
♪ Of far-off distant days
♪ When being just a boy like you
♪ I joined the IRA. ♪
Bravo!
♪ Where are the lads... ♪ All right, boys.
If I hear anything about who knows what about what, I'll let you know.
♪ Gra mo chree, I long to see
♪ The boys of the old IRA... ♪
I thought you only allowed singing on a Saturday.
Whiskey is good proofing water.
It tells you who's real and who isn't.
And what did my countrymen want?
They're nobodies.
They drink in The Black Swan in Sparkbrook.
They're only rebels because they like the songs.
You have sympathies with them?
I have no sympathies of any description.
Their accents were so thick, it's a wonder you could understand them.
Next time, I could translate.
You'd work for me?
I thought I already was.
So you are coming to the races?
Two pounds, ten shillings.
Ten shillings.
Buy something red.
To match his handkerchief.
Whose handkerchief?
Ada, what the hell?
I dared myself to run through their territory in my dress.
Are you mad?
Yeah.
Mad as hell with all of them.
I love you.
I love you too.
The more they try to stop us, the madder I'll be.
Come on, princess, the vicar's waiting.
Wait...
How do I look?
Like an angel.
Moss?
What do we know about The Black Swan?
An operative has provided intelligence that it is a place where IRA men gather.
It's just a lot of drunken navigators singing songs, sir.
The IRA wouldn't go near them.
Then why are two of them looking to buy guns?
Do you have names?
Must she do everything for you?
"She", sir?
One female operative has proved more useful than any of you great lumps of men.
We are regular police officers, sir.
Not spies.
We can only act when a crime has been committed.
Perhaps I should send some men down to The Black Swan to ask questions.
And scare them all into hiding?
Not the best of tactics, Sergeant.
My tactics come from my experiences in France.
Most of my great lumps of men served in France too, sir.
I serve my country every day.
That will be all, Sergeant.
Away and shite!
Fancy me, do ya?
What are you?
A copper?
Oh!
Proddy bitch!
I've seen you.
I've seen your face, serving in the Garrison.
Come here...
I am taking you in for interrogation on behalf of the Irish Free State.
All right?
Are you armed?
No.
Then I'll tell you.
Ada and Freddie Thorne were married today.
They defied your orders, they haven't left the city.
I'll deal with it.
Thomas...
I'll deal with it.
Where are they?
Freddie's comrades have safe houses.
Why do you want to know?
I want to send them flowers.
Why do you think?
Would it be so bad if they stayed?
I promised I'd run Freddie out of town.
Promised who?
I told the coppers Freddie wouldn't come back.
It's part of the deal.
What bloody deal?
What happened to family votes?
What happened to meetings?
If you let me deal with Ada and Freddie, it'll end in peace.
Christ knows you've had your fill of war.
You get Freddie out of town, Poll.
Or else I'll deal with it myself.
The victim had been drinking in The Black Swan pub, sir - the pub you told me about.
And a neighbour said she saw a young woman leaving the street where the body was found.
A woman, sir.
I was wondering if there was a connection.
A connection with what, Sergeant?
You said your spy was a woman, sir.
I wondered if now there was now a policy.
Shoot to kill.
Like there was in Belfast.
The Republicans are famously factional.
He was killed by one of his own.
That will be all, Sergeant.
And they're not called spies.
They're called operatives.
Operatives, sir.
Right, sir.
It's how you say things.
Yeah...
What the bloody hell is she doing here?
£200, Freddie.
For what?
For us.
For a honeymoon that goes on for ever.
Where did it come from?
Family fund.
The pockets of widows and desperate men.
See sense, Freddie.
Tommy is not going to let this rest.
Times like these, a communist in the family is bad for business.
You have to leave the city.
You think I can't handle Tommy Shelby?
You can't.
I'm having trouble these days and I'm twice the man you are.
I went into town.
The Cunard office.
I booked you both tickets on the next boat from Liverpool to New York.
America, Freddie.
They've already had their revolution.
You won't have to bother.
Will you ladies at least let a man sleep on it?
You had no business...
Observe and report.
That is your remit.
I decided we needed to know where he lived.
I warned you not to let your personal history cloud your judgment.
You went after him because he was IRA.
I followed him because I thought he might have information.
According to the rules,
I should pull you out of Garrison Lane immediately.
No.
Cheltenham is tomorrow.
You take too much upon yourself.
This is an active military mission - your words.
I'm doing my job.
Grace, the death of a base Fenian doesn't concern me.
Your welfare does.
Killing a man affects the heart.
And as for my heart...
I know that because of our family connections, you take my progress personally.
But I don't need you to be my father.
I will be thinking of you.
Mr Shelby, sir.
Mr Zhang.
That suit is sold, sir.
It's being collected this morning.
I know.
Please, gentlemen.
No fighting in here.
It's all right.
I come as a friend.
You're collecting your suit for Cheltenham - it's very nice.
How the bloody hell do you know?
I know a lot of things, Mr Kimber.
And as I told you before, I know the Lee brothers.
And I know they're going to be at the Cheltenham races as well.
They're going to lose a lot of money on fast women and slow nags.
No.
They're planning on showing up in numbers and robbing your bookies.
Running chalk and rafflers.
You think I can't handle the Lees?
Just a word of warning from a friend.
That's all.
I'll see you at Cheltenham.
I'll wave at you from my box.
If you're coming to the races, bring that pretty barmaid of yours.
Already invited.
Comrades - as you know, to even gather like this today is illegal.
Chief Inspector Campbell has ordered that we are not allowed to assemble in groups of more than three people.
So, to comply with the law, please now clump together in groups of three.
You hear that, boys?
The same whistles they used to blow to send us over the top, they now blow to try and break us up.
So before the Specials get here, raise a hand, all those who want to strike...
Now disperse!
Disperse and take the message home!
United, we will never be defeated!
Tommy!
Oi, Tommy.
What the hell's been happening?
The police had just raided a rally at the factory.
You thinking Freddie Thorne's back?
I know he is.
And he's with Ada.
How hard can it be to find the only girl in Birmingham with four-inch heels, eh?
She's with the commies.
They have little rat holes all over the city.
I just want to know where she is.
Tommy, you'd best have a word with Arthur as well.
What's wrong with bloody Arthur?
He's got the Flanders blues again.
People keep asking me questions that I don't know the answer to.
"Is it true your Ada got married?"
I say, "I don't know."
"Where is she living now?"
"I don't know."
"Arthur...
"..who killed the Paddy from The Black Swan?"
I go, "What Paddy?"
They say... .."Is it you, Peaky Blinders, who stole the guns from the BSA?"
What guns, Tommy?
Arthur, after your beating, I thought you needed a break...
What bloody guns, Tommy?
!
Arthur, I was going to tell you.
You were going to tell me.
Arthur, listen to me.
You've had a hard time these past few years.
God knows you have.
You deserve some rest.
We had some luck.
Some bloody luck.
It fell off a wagon into our laps.
And all you need to know is, it's us that has the machine guns now.
And it's them that's in the mud.
All right?
Come on.
I have a surprise for you.
Come on.
A surprise?
Where is she?
What is it you've always wanted, Arthur?
Eh?
When we were in France, you used to say,
"When I get back to England, I want to own my own pub."
Well...
You've gone soft.
You've gone soft, Tommy.
How do we know it's for sale?
Everything's for sale to us, Arthur.
We're making a lot of money these days.
We need a legitimate business to pass the money from the shop.
I wouldn't know what to do.
You've spent two-thirds of your life in pubs.
Just pour it instead of drinking it.
But I can still drink it, right?
Your pub - you do what you want.
Ah - sorry, gentlemen, I didn't hear you come in.
What can I get you?
Bloody kids.
The other one's punctured as well.
Mr Campbell wants an explanation.
Today, some rabble-rouser Union man brought the BSA out on strike.
It was Freddie Thorne.
I thought you promised he wouldn't come back.
I know he's in town.
I'm dealing with it.
Inspector Campbell thought you controlled your territories.
Yeah.
I said I'm dealing with it.
I heard that, er... ..Freddie married your sister.
Some family you've got, eh?
Bet you can't wait for Christmas.
Deliver Freddie Thorne to us or we'll take your sister in as an accomplice.
She'll get four years for sedition.
Or you can turn him in and your sister goes free.
I'll say good night then, Tom.
Have you seen Freddie Thorne?
No.
Or Tommy?
Ahh!
I have to find Freddie.
Drink this first.
No, I have to find them, I think they are going to kill each other.
Who is going to kill who?
We need to talk.
What exactly is it that you want, Freddie?
I came to tell you...
..that's not going to work, Tommy.
Polly came round.
She gave me that.
Well, Polly must have had a rush of blood.
Or port wine.
Your honesty is appreciated.
Now, if you're not going to use that thing...
I'm not finished.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Sit.
Talk to me about the guns.
Do you remember we used to jump in here, see who could swim the fastest...?
I'm here to talk business, Tommy.
Do you reckon we could still do it?
Ah!
You loaded Ada with your bastard because she's a Shelby.
You thought it'd mean you'd be somebody.
I won't let you fuck up my sister's life for your cause.
My God.
You actually believe that.
I love her, Tommy.
I've loved her since she was nine and I was 12.
And she loves me the same.
You even know the word?
This marriage will not stand.
Shh...
Freddie didn't want your money.
And now the coppers are saying if we don't turn Freddie in, they'll put Ada on the arrest warrant as well.
That's where your compassion gets you, Poll.
From now on, we do it my way.
Or what?
Ready?
They're getting closer.
I'll lead.
Watch yourself, Danny.
Tommy.
Be careful, Danny.
Tommy!
Tommy!
Aargh!
Arrrggghhh!
Arrrggghhh!
Tommy!
Tommy?
Tommy!
Tommy?
It's open.
Private Whizz Bang reporting, sir.
At ease.
So, what news from London?
I was in a pub - it was called Mother Redcap.
An Irish pub.
I got talking to some old bloke about Birmingham.
He said there's been trouble.
An IRA man shot.
He said a lot, but the only bit I heard... was that their high command think it's the Peaky Blinders who shot him.
Came up on the next boat to warn you.
Is it true?
No.
But lies travel faster than the truth.
Get a message to them.
Tell them to send someone to parley.
Tell them there's been a misunderstanding and we don't want any trouble.
You've got enough trouble - right, Tommy?
A whisky and a smoke.
I can smell it in the air.
I use it sometimes myself.
I call it "my sweetheart".
They gave us the worst job, Tommy.
Yeah... ..and we fucking volunteered.
Sometimes, it lasts all night.
I lie here and I listen to the shovels and the picks against that wall there.
And I pray the sun will come up at the curtains before they break through.
'No, I don't pray
- I hope.
'And sometimes, it happens.
'The sun beats them.
'But mostly...
'..the shovels beat the sun.'
Your sister was here.
She was worried.
You and Freddie.
It had made her sick...
She's all right, but in her condition, she needs peace.
Women talk.
That is something they do.
She talked about you.
She said you keep everything locked up.
Well, that's what men do.
Your sister's nice.
I like her.
It can't be easy for her.
Her brother and her husband, fighting over the same thing.
Men should talk, too.
To you?
Why not?
I'm a barmaid.
It's my job.
Men always tell their troubles to a barmaid.
What is it you and Freddie are fighting over?
I'll meet you here at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.
Did you buy a dress?
Yes.
I bought a dress.
How does it look?
He's changed the oil and greased her up.
So will it get me all the way to Cheltenham, Curly?
He's good with motors, but it pains him.
No heart in motorcars.
I can't talk with them.
Yeah
- Tommy might need to make a fast getaway.
The Lees will be all over the track.
And Kimber's men.
And his coppers.
They control the law down there, Tommy.
Give her a turn for me, Charlie.
This car only seats four.
You'll need more men than that if you're to come back alive.
It'll be just me and a girl.
Is it just the two of us going to the races?
Something like that.
Attention!
Right.
This is what was known as the final briefing before going over the top.
60 miles down that road is Cheltenham racetrack.
Johnny, what's our mission, boy?
To stick it to the Lee family, Arthur.
That's right.
The Lees are skimming money off legal bookies.
Running chalk, selling rafflers, beating up them as won't buy.
But today, we're going to stop them.
What about Kimber's men?
I thought he had his own protection.
Kimber's let his troops go rotten.
They're on the take from the Lees to look the other way.
We are going to show Kimber how it should be done.
Now take what you're good at.
Those of you with guns, keep them out of it, unless a gun is pulled on you.
We want this done quietly.
So when do we share out the cash?
We don't.
We're not keeping the cash.
You're in Tommy's army now, boys.
Trust only kin.
Let's go.
Are you sure we're allowed in here?
Well, I prefer to come to the races the back way.
It keeps me out of trouble.
Tracks are lawless places.
I can't stand petty criminals.
This way.
Will we get to lay a bet?
No - gambling is for mugs.
This way...
You're lucky you're with me or you'd be wasting your money on fixed races.
I always wondered, how do you fix a race?
How should I know?
OK, you do the talking.
What?
Tell security you are Lady Sarah Duggan...
Excuse us, excuse us... ..Lady Sarah Duggan of Connemara.
You got lost when you went to look for the boy riding your horse
- Dandy Flower.
If they ask about me, say I'm Prussian and don't speak a word of English.
Come on, posh girl.
Earn your three quid.
I still prefer the Garrison.
Do you dance?
If I'm asked properly.
Lady Sarah of Connemara, will you dance with me?
Roberts.
The Peaky Blinders are here.
I told you, Mr Kimber.
He's got some balls, that one.
And she's got some body, that one.
Chalk for your blackboards.
Five pounds a stick.
It's a pleasure doing business with you.
Hello, Raz.
How's business?
Argh!
Ugh!
Fucking... get up!
Fucking...
ARRGGHH!
Stay still, Raz, or I'll take the whole ear off.
And you're going to need your ears to listen.
No more chalking on Billy Kimber's boys.
Right?
We're the protection now.
I commandeer this stolen money by order of the Peaky Blinders.
Agghh!
Either your left leg is stronger than your right or we're making a getaway.
Neither.
I hope this doesn't involve razor blades.
I've decided to move up in the world.
Become a legitimate businessman.
My gosh.
You're serious.
I'm always serious.
We chased the Lees across the track, right the way down the Devon road.
We got every penny back.
Nice dress.
You can wear that to my pub.
Buy the boys a drink.
Anybody hurt?
A few cuts and bruises.
Off we go, Lady Sarah.
Steady on...
Excuse me.
Your money, Mr Kimber.
Rescued from the Lee brothers and returned to you with a request for a fair hearing.
Your own protection is failing, Mr Kimber.
Your boys are taking cuts.
I want to suggest that from now on, you contract out your racetrack security to the Peaky Blinders.
We would be saving you a lot of money, Mr Kimber.
A lot of money.
In return, you give us... ..5% of the take and three legal betting pitches at every race meeting north of the River Severn, rising to six after one year if we are all satisfied with the service.
What do you say, Mr Kimber?
I say you talk business to my accountant.
I want to dance.
Your man said it was all right for me to have this dance.
How many men can you put in the field at one time?
There's a lot of men out of work at the moment.
Two guards for every bookie.
At every meeting?
We have contacts with good people among the gypsies.
We'll always know where the Lees plan to attack.
With all the strikes and troubles, you can't depend on the police.
Anyway... we're more honest.
Looks like you two are making a deal.
We are making progress.
Then let me throw a small condition into the mix.
So, listen... we're going to go for dinner at Kimber's house.
He has a place a couple of miles away.
I have some business to settle first with his accountant, so...
You go on ahead, with Kimber.
Just me and him?
Yeah... until I'm done here.
Is that all right?
I'll throw in an extra three quid for your extra time.
You think I'm a whore?
Everybody's a whore, Grace.
We just sell different parts of ourselves.
You said you wanted to work for me.
To do that, you have to sharpen up.
The deal is I give him two hours with you.
He thinks he's a ladies' man.
He thinks he can seduce you.
Whenever you want, just kick him in the balls.
I'm a clause in a contract.
If you want to be part of my organisation, you have to make sacrifices.
Do we have a deal?
As a sweetener, you can try your luck with mine.
Yes, we have a deal.
Two hours?
Yeah.
Side bet.
Ten pounds says I'll have her fucked in one.
Mademoiselle.
I bet he said you could have me, didn't he?
While he has her.
That's the arrangement, isn't it?
Yours might be a prostitute, but I'm not.
I was a milliner when I met him.
I was independent.
I made this hat.
I was a good milliner.
It's a very pretty hat.
It really is.
So is she a prostitute?
God's honest truth?
I don't know what she is.
You showed me up back there at the races.
Why don't you teach me how to dance properly?
The music is too slow.
Put on a Charleston.
Then we'd be far away.
I want to dance like this.
Come on.
You weren't so stiff back there, were you?
You ever been in a house this big?
Hm?
Look at you.
You look like a bloody film star.
I want a cigarette.
Oh, look, I dropped something.
Pick it up.
Pick it up yourself.
You're a fucking barmaid.
If I drop a glass on the floor, you pick it up.
I want to watch you pick it up.
Right, you little slag.
I have tried to be nice.
If I drop a glass on the floor, you bend over and fucking pick up the fucking glass, OK?
What?
!
No, sir... no.
What are you doing here?
I've got another hour.
Just wait - listen to me.
Just listen to me.
I was going to let you go through with it, but in the end, my conscience got the better of me.
She looks good on the outside... ..but she has the clap.
Yeah.
Syphilis.
When you took a shine to her, I thought I'd use her.
Somebody told me she had syph and I thought, "What the hell?"
Call it my better nature.
She's... she's a whore.
Just go and wait in the car.
I can walk on my own!
Can we shake hands and forget this ever happened?
Start of the day, I was Lady Sarah of Connemara.
By the end, I was a whore with the clap.
You're a fucking bastard, offering me like that.
But then you changed your mind.
Why did you change your mind, Thomas?
I intend to do business with Billy Kimber.
Is there any man here named Shelby?
I am planning an expansion.
Onto the racetracks.
It would be an honour to work with you, Mr Kimber.
Nobody works with me.
People work FOR me.
'Danny, you are a good man and a good soldier.'
Yes, Sergeant Major.
Freddie Thorne is at the very top of my list.
Well, cross him off.
He won't be returning to this city.
We're not going anywhere, Ada.
We are going to stay here and we'll marry here, with our baby.
I'm not afraid of Tommy Shelby.
Thomas, you sell those guns to anyone who has use for them, you will hang.
Dump them somewhere the police can find them.
No.
Thomas Shelby is now the beginning, middle and end of your mission.
So what shall I do?
You must do everything you can to get close to him.
Dig out a nice dress.
I want to take you to the races.
I warn you, I'll break your heart.
Already broken.

Scotch or Irish?
Irish.
I've decided not to go.
To the races.
Not unless you give me two pounds, ten shillings towards the dress.
I've already given you three.
How much did you pay for the suit you'll be wearing?
Oh, I don't pay for suits.
My suits are on the house or the house burns down.
So you want me to go looking like a flower girl?
What I want makes no difference.
It's not me you're dressing up for.
You'll forgive me, Mr Shelby, if I indulge a little.
Please.
It takes a lot for a man from Sparkbrook to step inside this pub.
Anyone with money and good intentions is welcome in the Garrison.
Now...you said you had business.
It's delicate, Mr Shelby.
It's a question of who knows what about what.
It concerns the factory down the road, at the BSA.
As you might know, most of the paint shop there is Irish.
Big old place like that, rumours get started.
Rumours that there was a robbery.
Robbery of what?
Guns, Mr Shelby.
A serious amount of guns.
What business is that of mine?
When it comes to speculation, you can't beat a factory night shift.
Some say there was word from the proofing bay it was the Peaky Blinders who took them.
Your night shift must be dreaming.
Maybe they are.
Maybe they're not.
What we are trying to say is, Mr Shelby, that if you were to hear about the whereabouts of said items...
..we'd pay good money.
You have good money?
We have collections from the pubs.
For who do you speak?
The people of Ireland.
The Irish Republican Army.
For a fact?
For a fucking fact.
You think we're jokers?
Am I laughing?

I thought you only allowed singing on a Saturday.
Whiskey is good proofing water.
It tells you who's real and who isn't.
And what did my countrymen want?
They're nobodies.
They drink in The Black Swan in Sparkbrook.
They're only rebels because they like the songs.
You have sympathies with them?
I have no sympathies of any description.
Their accents were so thick, it's a wonder you could understand them.
Next time, I could translate.
You'd work for me?
I thought I already was.
So you are coming to the races?
Two pounds, ten shillings.
Ten shillings.
Buy something red.
To match his handkerchief.
Whose handkerchief?
Ada, what the hell?
I dared myself to run through their territory in my dress.
Are you mad?
Yeah.
Mad as hell with all of them.
I love you.
I love you too.
The more they try to stop us, the madder I'll be.
Come on, princess, the vicar's waiting.
Wait...
How do I look?
Like an angel.
Moss?
What do we know about The Black Swan?
An operative has provided intelligence that it is a place where IRA men gather.
It's just a lot of drunken navigators singing songs, sir.
The IRA wouldn't go near them.
Then why are two of them looking to buy guns?
Do you have names?
Must she do everything for you?
"She", sir?
One female operative has proved more useful than any of you great lumps of men.
We are regular police officers, sir.
Not spies.
We can only act when a crime has been committed.
Perhaps I should send some men down to The Black Swan to ask questions.
And scare them all into hiding?
Not the best of tactics, Sergeant.
My tactics come from my experiences in France.
Most of my great lumps of men served in France too, sir.
I serve my country every day.
That will be all, Sergeant.
Away and shite!
Fancy me, do ya?
What are you?
A copper?
Oh!
Proddy bitch!
I've seen you.
I've seen your face, serving in the Garrison.
Come here...
I am taking you in for interrogation on behalf of the Irish Free State.
All right?
Are you armed?
No.
Then I'll tell you.
Ada and Freddie Thorne were married today.
They defied your orders, they haven't left the city.
I'll deal with it.
Thomas...
I'll deal with it.
Where are they?
Freddie's comrades have safe houses.
Why do you want to know?
I want to send them flowers.
Why do you think?
Would it be so bad if they stayed?
I promised I'd run Freddie out of town.
Promised who?
I told the coppers Freddie wouldn't come back.
It's part of the deal.
What bloody deal?
What happened to family votes?
What happened to meetings?
If you let me deal with Ada and Freddie, it'll end in peace.
Christ knows you've had your fill of war.
You get Freddie out of town, Poll.
Or else I'll deal with it myself.
The victim had been drinking in The Black Swan pub, sir - the pub you told me about.
And a neighbour said she saw a young woman leaving the street where the body was found.
A woman, sir.
I was wondering if there was a connection.
A connection with what, Sergeant?
You said your spy was a woman, sir.
I wondered if now there was now a policy.
Shoot to kill.
Like there was in Belfast.
The Republicans are famously factional.
He was killed by one of his own.
That will be all, Sergeant.
And they're not called spies.
They're called operatives.
Operatives, sir.
Right, sir.
It's how you say things.
Yeah...
What the bloody hell is she doing here?
£200, Freddie.
For what?
For us.
For a honeymoon that goes on for ever.
Where did it come from?
Family fund.
The pockets of widows and desperate men.
See sense, Freddie.
Tommy is not going to let this rest.
Times like these, a communist in the family is bad for business.
You have to leave the city.
You think I can't handle Tommy Shelby?
You can't.
I'm having trouble these days and I'm twice the man you are.
I went into town.
The Cunard office.
I booked you both tickets on the next boat from Liverpool to New York.
America, Freddie.
They've already had their revolution.
You won't have to bother.
Will you ladies at least let a man sleep on it?
You had no business...
Observe and report.
That is your remit.
I decided we needed to know where he lived.
I warned you not to let your personal history cloud your judgment.
You went after him because he was IRA.
I followed him because I thought he might have information.
According to the rules,
I should pull you out of Garrison Lane immediately.
No.
Cheltenham is tomorrow.
You take too much upon yourself.
This is an active military mission - your words.
I'm doing my job.
Grace, the death of a base Fenian doesn't concern me.
Your welfare does.
Killing a man affects the heart.
And as for my heart...
I know that because of our family connections, you take my progress personally.
But I don't need you to be my father.
I will be thinking of you.
Mr Shelby, sir.
Mr Zhang.
That suit is sold, sir.
It's being collected this morning.
I know.
Please, gentlemen.
No fighting in here.
It's all right.
I come as a friend.
You're collecting your suit for Cheltenham - it's very nice.
How the bloody hell do you know?
I know a lot of things, Mr Kimber.
And as I told you before, I know the Lee brothers.
And I know they're going to be at the Cheltenham races as well.
They're going to lose a lot of money on fast women and slow nags.
No.
They're planning on showing up in numbers and robbing your bookies.
Running chalk and rafflers.
You think I can't handle the Lees?
Just a word of warning from a friend.
That's all.
I'll see you at Cheltenham.
I'll wave at you from my box.
If you're coming to the races, bring that pretty barmaid of yours.
Already invited.
Comrades - as you know, to even gather like this today is illegal.
Chief Inspector Campbell has ordered that we are not allowed to assemble in groups of more than three people.
So, to comply with the law, please now clump together in groups of three.
You hear that, boys?
The same whistles they used to blow to send us over the top, they now blow to try and break us up.
So before the Specials get here, raise a hand, all those who want to strike...
Now disperse!
Disperse and take the message home!
United, we will never be defeated!
Tommy!
Oi, Tommy.
What the hell's been happening?
The police had just raided a rally at the factory.
You thinking Freddie Thorne's back?
I know he is.
And he's with Ada.
How hard can it be to find the only girl in Birmingham with four-inch heels, eh?
She's with the commies.
They have little rat holes all over the city.
I just want to know where she is.
Tommy, you'd best have a word with Arthur as well.
What's wrong with bloody Arthur?
He's got the Flanders blues again.
People keep asking me questions that I don't know the answer to.
"Is it true your Ada got married?"
I say, "I don't know."
"Where is she living now?"
"I don't know."
"Arthur...
"..who killed the Paddy from The Black Swan?"
I go, "What Paddy?"
They say... .."Is it you, Peaky Blinders, who stole the guns from the BSA?"
What guns, Tommy?
Arthur, after your beating, I thought you needed a break...
What bloody guns, Tommy?
!
Arthur, I was going to tell you.
You were going to tell me.
Arthur, listen to me.
You've had a hard time these past few years.
God knows you have.
You deserve some rest.
We had some luck.
Some bloody luck.
It fell off a wagon into our laps.
And all you need to know is, it's us that has the machine guns now.
And it's them that's in the mud.
All right?
Come on.
I have a surprise for you.
Come on.

A surprise?
Where is she?
What is it you've always wanted, Arthur?
Eh?
When we were in France, you used to say,
"When I get back to England, I want to own my own pub."
Well...
You've gone soft.
You've gone soft, Tommy.
How do we know it's for sale?
Everything's for sale to us, Arthur.
We're making a lot of money these days.
We need a legitimate business to pass the money from the shop.
I wouldn't know what to do.
You've spent two-thirds of your life in pubs.
Just pour it instead of drinking it.
But I can still drink it, right?
Your pub - you do what you want.
Ah - sorry, gentlemen, I didn't hear you come in.
What can I get you?
♪ When I hear my name
♪ I want to disappear
♪ Whoa. ♪
Bloody kids.
The other one's punctured as well.
Mr Campbell wants an explanation.
Today, some rabble-rouser Union man brought the BSA out on strike.
It was Freddie Thorne.
I thought you promised he wouldn't come back.
I know he's in town.
I'm dealing with it.
Inspector Campbell thought you controlled your territories.
Yeah.
I said I'm dealing with it.
I heard that, er... ..Freddie married your sister.
Some family you've got, eh?
Bet you can't wait for Christmas.
Deliver Freddie Thorne to us or we'll take your sister in as an accomplice.
She'll get four years for sedition.
Or you can turn him in and your sister goes free.
I'll say good night then, Tom.
Have you seen Freddie Thorne?
No.
Or Tommy?
Ahh!
I have to find Freddie.
Drink this first.
No, I have to find them, I think they are going to kill each other.
Who is going to kill who?
We need to talk.
What exactly is it that you want, Freddie?
I came to tell you...
..that's not going to work, Tommy.
Polly came round.
She gave me that.
Well, Polly must have had a rush of blood.
Or port wine.
Your honesty is appreciated.
Now, if you're not going to use that thing...
I'm not finished.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Sit.
Talk to me about the guns.
Do you remember we used to jump in here, see who could swim the fastest...?
I'm here to talk business, Tommy.
Do you reckon we could still do it?
Ah!
You loaded Ada with your bastard because she's a Shelby.
You thought it'd mean you'd be somebody.
I won't let you fuck up my sister's life for your cause.
My God.
You actually believe that.
I love her, Tommy.
I've loved her since she was nine and I was 12.
And she loves me the same.
You even know the word?
This marriage will not stand.
Shh...
Freddie didn't want your money.
And now the coppers are saying if we don't turn Freddie in, they'll put Ada on the arrest warrant as well.
That's where your compassion gets you, Poll.
From now on, we do it my way.
Or what?
Ready?
They're getting closer.
I'll lead.
Watch yourself, Danny.
Tommy.
Be careful, Danny.
Tommy!
Tommy!
Aargh!
Arrrggghhh!
Arrrggghhh!
Tommy!
Tommy?
Tommy!
Tommy?
It's open.
Private Whizz Bang reporting, sir.
At ease.
So, what news from London?
I was in a pub - it was called Mother Redcap.
An Irish pub.
I got talking to some old bloke about Birmingham.
He said there's been trouble.
An IRA man shot.
He said a lot, but the only bit I heard...was that their high command think it's the Peaky Blinders who shot him.
Came up on the next boat to warn you.
Is it true?
No.
But lies travel faster than the truth.
Get a message to them.
Tell them to send someone to parley.
Tell them there's been a misunderstanding and we don't want any trouble.
You've got enough trouble - right, Tommy?
A whisky and a smoke.
I can smell it in the air.
I use it sometimes myself.
I call it "my sweetheart".
They gave us the worst job, Tommy.
Yeah... ..and we fucking volunteered.
Sometimes, it lasts all night.
I lie here and I listen to the shovels and the picks against that wall there.
And I pray the sun will come up at the curtains before they break through.
'No, I don't pray
- I hope.
'And sometimes, it happens.
'The sun beats them.
'But mostly...
'..the shovels beat the sun.'

Your sister was here.
She was worried.
You and Freddie.
It had made her sick...
She's all right, but in her condition, she needs peace.
Women talk.
That is something they do.
She talked about you.
She said you keep everything locked up.
Well, that's what men do.
Your sister's nice.
I like her.
It can't be easy for her.
Her brother and her husband, fighting over the same thing.
Men should talk, too.
To you?
Why not?
I'm a barmaid.
It's my job.
Men always tell their troubles to a barmaid.
What is it you and Freddie are fighting over?
I'll meet you here at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.
Did you buy a dress?
Yes.
I bought a dress.
How does it look?
He's changed the oil and greased her up.
So will it get me all the way to Cheltenham, Curly?
He's good with motors, but it pains him.
No heart in motorcars.
I can't talk with them.
Yeah
- Tommy might need to make a fast getaway.
The Lees will be all over the track.
And Kimber's men.
And his coppers.
They control the law down there, Tommy.
Give her a turn for me, Charlie.
This car only seats four.
You'll need more men than that if you're to come back alive.
It'll be just me and a girl.
Is it just the two of us going to the races?
Something like that.

Attention!
Right.
This is what was known as the final briefing before going over the top.
60 miles down that road is Cheltenham racetrack.
Johnny, what's our mission, boy?
To stick it to the Lee family, Arthur.
That's right.
The Lees are skimming money off legal bookies.
Running chalk, selling rafflers, beating up them as won't buy.
But today, we're going to stop them.
What about Kimber's men?
I thought he had his own protection.
Kimber's let his troops go rotten.
They're on the take from the Lees to look the other way.
We are going to show Kimber how it should be done.
Now take what you're good at.
Those of you with guns, keep them out of it, unless a gun is pulled on you.
We want this done quietly.
So when do we share out the cash?
We don't.
We're not keeping the cash.
You're in Tommy's army now, boys.
Trust only kin.
Let's go.
Are you sure we're allowed in here?
Well, I prefer to come to the races the back way.
It keeps me out of trouble.
Tracks are lawless places.
I can't stand petty criminals.
This way.
Will we get to lay a bet?
No - gambling is for mugs.
This way...
You're lucky you're with me or you'd be wasting your money on fixed races.
I always wondered, how do you fix a race?
How should I know?
OK, you do the talking.
What?
Tell security you are Lady Sarah Duggan...
Excuse us, excuse us... ..Lady Sarah Duggan of Connemara.
You got lost when you went to look for the boy riding your horse
- Dandy Flower.
If they ask about me, say I'm Prussian and don't speak a word of English.
Come on, posh girl.
Earn your three quid.
I still prefer the Garrison.
Do you dance?
If I'm asked properly.
Lady Sarah of Connemara, will you dance with me?
Roberts.
The Peaky Blinders are here.
I told you, Mr Kimber.
He's got some balls, that one.
And she's got some body, that one.
Chalk for your blackboards.
Five pounds a stick.
It's a pleasure doing business with you.
Hello, Raz.
How's business?
Argh!
Ugh!
Fucking...get up!
Fucking...
ARRGGHH!
Stay still, Raz, or I'll take the whole ear off.
And you're going to need your ears to listen.
No more chalking on Billy Kimber's boys.
Right?
We're the protection now.
I commandeer this stolen money by order of the Peaky Blinders.
Agghh!
Either your left leg is stronger than your right or we're making a getaway.
Neither.
I hope this doesn't involve razor blades.
I've decided to move up in the world.
Become a legitimate businessman.
My gosh.
You're serious.
I'm always serious.
We chased the Lees across the track, right the way down the Devon road.
We got every penny back.
Nice dress.
You can wear that to my pub.
Buy the boys a drink.
Anybody hurt?
A few cuts and bruises.
Off we go, Lady Sarah.
Steady on...
Excuse me.
Your money, Mr Kimber.
Rescued from the Lee brothers and returned to you with a request for a fair hearing.
Your own protection is failing, Mr Kimber.
Your boys are taking cuts.
I want to suggest that from now on, you contract out your racetrack security to the Peaky Blinders.
We would be saving you a lot of money, Mr Kimber.
A lot of money.
In return, you give us... ..5% of the take and three legal betting pitches at every race meeting north of the River Severn, rising to six after one year if we are all satisfied with the service.
What do you say, Mr Kimber?
I say you talk business to my accountant.
I want to dance.
Your man said it was all right for me to have this dance.
How many men can you put in the field at one time?
There's a lot of men out of work at the moment.
Two guards for every bookie.
At every meeting?
We have contacts with good people among the gypsies.
We'll always know where the Lees plan to attack.
With all the strikes and troubles, you can't depend on the police.
Anyway...we're more honest.
Looks like you two are making a deal.
We are making progress.
Then let me throw a small condition into the mix.
So, listen...we're going to go for dinner at Kimber's house.
He has a place a couple of miles away.
I have some business to settle first with his accountant, so...
You go on ahead, with Kimber.
Just me and him?
Yeah...until I'm done here.
Is that all right?
I'll throw in an extra three quid for your extra time.
You think I'm a whore?
Everybody's a whore, Grace.
We just sell different parts of ourselves.
You said you wanted to work for me.
To do that, you have to sharpen up.
The deal is I give him two hours with you.
He thinks he's a ladies' man.
He thinks he can seduce you.
Whenever you want, just kick him in the balls.
I'm a clause in a contract.
If you want to be part of my organisation, you have to make sacrifices.
Do we have a deal?
As a sweetener, you can try your luck with mine.
Yes, we have a deal.
Two hours?
Yeah.
Side bet.
Ten pounds says I'll have her fucked in one.
Mademoiselle.
I bet he said you could have me, didn't he?
While he has her.
That's the arrangement, isn't it?
Yours might be a prostitute, but I'm not.
I was a milliner when I met him.
I was independent.
I made this hat.
I was a good milliner.
It's a very pretty hat.
It really is.
So is she a prostitute?
God's honest truth?
I don't know what she is.
You showed me up back there at the races.
Why don't you teach me how to dance properly?
The music is too slow.
Put on a Charleston.
Then we'd be far away.
I want to dance like this.
Come on.
You weren't so stiff back there, were you?
You ever been in a house this big?
Hm?
Look at you.
You look like a bloody film star.
I want a cigarette.
Oh, look, I dropped something.
Pick it up.
Pick it up yourself.
You're a fucking barmaid.
If I drop a glass on the floor, you pick it up.
I want to watch you pick it up.
Right, you little slag.
I have tried to be nice.
If I drop a glass on the floor, you bend over and fucking pick up the fucking glass, OK?
What?
!
No, sir...no.
What are you doing here?
I've got another hour.
Just wait - listen to me.
Just listen to me.
I was going to let you go through with it, but in the end, my conscience got the better of me.
She looks good on the outside... ..but she has the clap.
Yeah.
Syphilis.
When you took a shine to her, I thought I'd use her.
Somebody told me she had syph and I thought, "What the hell?"
Call it my better nature.
She's...she's a whore.
Just go and wait in the car.
I can walk on my own!
Can we shake hands and forget this ever happened?
Start of the day, I was Lady Sarah of Connemara.
By the end, I was a whore with the clap.
You're a fucking bastard, offering me like that.
But then you changed your mind.
Why did you change your mind, Thomas?

Is there any man here named Shelby?
TOMMY:
I'm planning an expansion onto the racetracks.
It would be an honour to work with you, Mr Kimber.
Nobody works "with" me.
People work "for" me.

Danny, you're a good man and a good soldier.
Yes, Sergeant Major.

Freddie Thorne is at the very top of my list.
Well, cross him off.
He won't be returning to the city.
THORNE:
We're not going anywhere, Ada.
We're gonna stay here, we're gonna marry here, with our baby.
I'm not afraid of Tommy Shelby.
Thomas, you sell those guns to anyone who has use to them, you will hang.
POLLY:
Dump them somewhere the police can find them.
No.
Thomas Shelby is now the beginning, the middle and the end of your mission.
So what shall I do?
CAMPBELL:
You must do everything you can to get close to him.
Dig out a nice dress, I want to take you to the races.
I warn you, I'll break your heart.
Already broken.

Give me a bottle of whisky and three glasses, please.
- Scotch or Irish?
-Irish.
I've decided not to go to the races.
Not unless you give me another two pound ten shilling towards the dress.
I've already given you three.
How much did you pay for the suit you'll be wearing?
Oh, I don't pay for suits.
My suits are on the house.
Or the house burns down.
So, you want me to go looking like a flower girl?
- What I want makes no difference.

It's not me you're dressing up for.
You'll forgive me, Mr Shelby, if I indulge a little bit?
Please.
It takes a lot for a man from Sparkbrook to step inside this pub.
(CHUCKLES)
Anyone with money and good intentions is welcome at The Garrison.
(MATCH STRIKING)
Now, you said you had business.
It's delicate, Mr Shelby.
It's a question of who knows what about what.
Concerns the factory down the road at the BSA.
Now, as you might know, most of the paint shop there is Irish.
Big old place like that, rumours get started.
Rumours that there was a robbery.
Robbery of what?
MAN:
Guns, Mr Shelby.
A serious amount of guns.
TOMMY:
And what business is that of mine?
When it comes to speculation, you can't beat a factory night shift.
Some say there was word from the proofing bay it was the Peaky Blinders that took them.
Your night shift must be dreaming.
- Maybe they are.
-Maybe they're not.
What we're trying to say is, Mr Shelby, that if you were to hear about the whereabouts of said items,
we'd pay good money.
- You have good money?
-We have the collections from the pubs.

- For who do you speak?
-The people of Ireland.
The Irish Republican Army.

#I long to see the boys of the old IRA #
I thought you only allowed singing on Saturday.
Whisky's good proofing water.
Tells you who's real and who isn't.
And what did my countrymen want?
Oh, they're nobodies.
They drink in The Black Swan in Sparkbrook.
They're only rebels because they like the songs.
You have sympathies with them?
I have no sympathies of any description.
Their accents are so thick, it's a wonder you could understand them.
Next time, I could translate.
You would work for me?
I thought I already was.
So you are coming to the races.
Two pounds, ten shillings.
Ten shillings.
Buy something red.
To match his handkerchief.
Whose handkerchief?
Ada, what the hell?
I dared myself to run through their territory in my dress.
- Are you mad?
-Yeah.
Mad as hell with all of them.
I love you.
I love you, too.
The more they try and stop us, the madder I'll be.
- Come on, princess.
The vicar's waiting.
-Wait.
How do I look?
Like an angel.
Moss, what do we know about The Black Swan?
An operative has provided intelligence and it is a place where IRA men gather.
It's just a lot of drunken navigators singing songs, sir.
The IRA wouldn't go near them.
Then why are two of them looking to buy guns?
Do you have names?
Must she do everything for you?
She, sir?
One female operative has proved more useful than any of you great lumps of men.
We are regular police officers, sir, not spies.
We can only act when a crime has been committed.
Perhaps I should send some men down to The Black Swan to ask questions.
And scare them all into hiding?
Not the best of tactics, Sergeant.
My tactics come from my experiences in France.
Most of my great lumps of men served in France too, sir.
I serve my country every day.
That'll be all, Sergeant.
Away and shite.
Fancy me, do you?
What are you?
Copper?
Prodie bitch!
I've seen you.
I've seen your face serving at The Garrison.
Come here.
I'm taking you in for interrogation.
On behalf of the Irish Free State.
(GUNSHOT)
All right?
Are you armed?
No.
Then I'll tell you.
Ada and Freddie Thorne were married today.
They defied your orders.
They haven't left the city.
(SIGHS)
(SIGHS HEAVILY)
I'll deal with it.
Thomas.
I'll deal with it.
Where are they?
Freddie's comrades have safe houses.
Why do you want to know?
I want to send them flowers.
Why do you think?
Would it be so bad if they stayed?
I promised I'd run Freddie out of town.
Promised who?
I told the coppers Freddie wouldn't come back.
- It was part of the deal.
-What bloody deal?
What happened to family votes?
What happened to meetings?
If you let me deal with Ada and Freddie, it'll end in peace.
Christ knows you've had your fill of war.
You get Freddie out of town, Pol.
Or else I'll deal with it myself.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
(RETCHES)
(COUGHS)
(SHUDDERS)
MOSS:
The victim had been drinking in The Black Swan pub, sir.
The pub that you told me about.
And the neighbour said that she saw a young woman leaving the street where the body was found.
A woman, sir.
I was wondering if there was a connection.
A connection with what, Sergeant?
You said that your spy was a woman, sir.
I wondered if there was now a policy.
Shoot to kill.
Like there was in Belfast.
Republicans are famously factional.
He was killed by one of his own.
That'll be all, Sergeant.
And they're not called spies.
They're called operatives.
Operatives, sir.
Right, sir.
THORNE:
It's how you say things.
ADA:
Yeah.
THORNE:
What the bloody hell is she doing here?
200 pounds, Freddie.
For what?
For us.
For a honeymoon that goes on forever.
- Where did it come from?
-Family fund.
Pockets of widows and desperate men.
See sense, Freddie.
POLLY:
Tommy's not gonna let this rest.
Times like these, communists in the family is bad for business.
You have to leave the city.
You think I can't handle Tommy Shelby?
You can't.
I'm having trouble these days and I'm twice the man you are.
(CHUCKLES)
I went into town.
The Cunard office.
I booked you both tickets for the next boat from Liverpool to New York.
ADA:
America, Freddie.
They've already had their revolution.
You won't have to bother.
Would you ladies at least let a man sleep on it?
(SIGHS)
You had no business.
Observe and report, that is your remit.
I decided we needed to know where he lived.
I warned you not to let your...
Your personal history cloud your judgement.
You went after him because he was IRA.
I followed him because I thought he might have information.
According to the rules, I should pull you out of Garrison Lane immediately.
No.
Cheltenham's tomorrow.
You take too much upon yourself.
This is an "active military mission".
Your words.
I'm doing my job.
Grace, the death of a base Fenian doesn't concern me.
Your welfare does.
Killing a man affects the heart.
And as for my heart...
I know that, because of our family connections, you take my progress personally.
But I don't need you to be my father.
I will be thinking of you.
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
Mr Shelby, sir?
Mr Zhang.
That suit is sold, sir.
It's being collected this morning.
I know.
ZHANG:
Please, gentlemen, no fighting in here.
It's all right.
I come as a friend.
You're collecting your suit for Cheltenham.
It's very nice.
How the bloody hell do you know?
I know a lot of things, Mr Kimber.
And as I told you before, I know the Lee brothers.
And 1 know they're gonna be at the Cheltenham races as well.
Yes, well they're gonna lose a lot of money on fast women and slow nags.
No.
They're planning on showing up in numbers and robbing your bookies, running chalk and rafflers.
You think I can't handle the Lees?
Just a word of warning from a friend.
That's all.
TOMMY:
I'll see you at Cheltenham.
KIMBER:
I'll wave at you from my box.
If you're coming to the races, bring that pretty barmaid of yours.
Already invited.
MAN 1:
Come on, Freddie.
MAN 2:
Comrades.
Comrades, as you know, to even gather like this today is illegal.
Chief Inspector Campbell has ordered that we're not allowed to assemble in groups of more than three people.
So, to comply with the law, please now clump together in groups of three.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Do you hear that, boys?
The same whistles they used to blow to send us over the top they now blow to try and break us up.
So before the Specials get in, raise your hands all those who want to strike.
(ALL CHEERING)
Now disperse.
Disperse and take the message home.
United, we will never be defeated.
MAN:
Yes!
Yes!
(MEN CLAMOURING)
JOHN:
Tommy.
Oi, Tommy.
What the hell's being happening?
The police have just raided a rally at the factory.
We're thinking Freddie Thorne's back.
I know he is, and he's with Ada.
How hard can it be to find the only girl in Birmingham with four-inch heels, eh?
She's with the commies.
They have little rat holes all over the city.
Just wanna know where she is.
Tommy, you'd best have a word with Arthur as well.
What's wrong with bloody Arthur?
He's got the Flanders blues again.
People keep asking me questions that I don't know the answer to.
Is it true your Ada got married?
I say, "I don't know."
"Where is she living then?"
"I don't know.'
"Arthur,
"who killed the Paddy from The Black Swan?
'
I go, "What Paddy?"
They say,
"Is it you Peaky Blinders
"who stole the guns
"from the BSA?
'
What guns, Tommy?
Arthur, after your beating, I thought you needed a break.
(SHOUTING) What bloody guns, Tommy?
Arthur, I was gonna tell you.
You were gonna tell me?
Arthur, listen to me.
You've had a hard time these past few years.
God knows you have.
You deserve some rest.
We had some luck.
Some bloody luck.
It fell off a wagon into our laps.
And all you need to know is, it's us that has the machine guns now.
And it's them that's in the mud.
All right?
Come on.
I have a surprise for you.
Come on.
ARTHUR:
Surprise.
Where is she?
What is it you've always wanted, Arthur?
Eh?
When we were in France, you used to say,
"when I go back to England, I want to own my own pub."
Well.
Now you've gone soft.
You've gone soft, Tommy.
How do we know it's for sale?
Everything is for sale to us, Arthur.
We're making a lot of money these days.
We need a legitimate business to pass the money from the shop.
I wouldn't know what to do.
You spent two-thirds of your life in pubs, just pour it.
Instead of drinking it.
But I can stilt drink it though, right?
Your pub, you do what you want.
Ah.
Sorry, gentlemen.
Didn't hear you come in.
What can I get you?
MOSS:
Bloody kids.
Think the other one's punctured as well.
Mr Campbell wants an explanation.
Today.
Some rebel-rousing union man brought the BSA out on strike.
Freddie Thorne.
I thought you promised he wouldn't come back.
I know he's in town.
I'm dealing with it.
Mr Campbell thought that you controlled these territories.
Yeah.
I said I'm dealing with it.
I heard that, er,
Freddie married your sister.
Some family you've got, eh?
Bet you can't wait for Christmas.
Deliver Freddie Thorne to us, or we'll take your sister in as an accomplice.
She'll get four years for sedition.
Or you can turn him in.
And your sister goes free.
I'll say goodnight then, Tom.
(PANTING)
ADA:
Have you seen Freddie Thorne?
- No.
-Or Tommy?
(GROANS)
- ADA:
We have to find Freddie.
-Drink this first.
No, we have to find them.
I think they're gonna kill each other.
Wait.
Who's going to kill who?
We need to talk.
What exactly is it that you want, Freddie?
I came to tell you.
That's not gonna work, Tommy.
Polly came round.
She gave me that.
Well,
Polly must've had a rush of blood.
Or port wine.
Your honesty is appreciated.
Now, if you're not gonna use that thing...
I'm not finished!
Sit down.
Sit down.
Sit!
Talk to me about the guns.
Do you remember we used to jump in here and see who could swim across...
I'm here to talk business, Tommy.
Do you reckon we could still do it?
(GRUNTING)
(BOTH PANTING)
You loaded Ada with your bastard because she's a Shelby.
You thought it'd mean you'd be somebody.
I won't let you fuck up my sister's life for your cause.
My God,
you actually believe that?
I love her, Tommy.
I've loved her since she was nine and I was twelve.
She loves me the same.
Do you even know the word?
This marriage will not stand.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Shh.
(SIGHS)
Freddie didn't want your money.
And now the coppers are saying that if we don't turn Freddie in, they'll put Ada on the arrest warrant as well.
That's where your compassion gets you, Pol.
From now on, we do it my way.
Or what?

So, what news from London?
I Was in a pub.
It was called The Mother Red Cap.
An Irish pub.
I got talking to some old bloke about Birmingham.
He said there's been trouble.
An IRA man shot.
He said a lot, but the only bit I heard was that their high command think it's the Peaky Blinders who shot him.
I came up on the next boat to warn you.
Is it true?
No.
- But lies travel faster than the truth.
-Hmm.
Get a message to them.
Tell 'em to send someone to parlay.
Tell 'em there's been a misunderstanding and we don't want any trouble.
You've got enough trouble, right, Tommy?
The whisky and the smoke.
I can smell it in the air.
(SIGHS)
Use it sometimes myself.
{all it my sweetheart.
-(CHUCKLES)
They gave us the worst job, Tommy.
Yeah... (HUFFS)
And we fucking volunteered.
(CHUCKLING)
Sometimes it lasts all night.
And I lie here and I listen to the shovels...
And the picks against that wall there.
And I pray the sun will come up with the curtains before they break through.
TOMMY:
No, I don't pray.
I hope.
- But sometimes it happens.

She was worried you and Freddie...
It had made her sick.
She's all right, but in her condition she needs peace.
Women talk.
That is something they do.
She talked about you.
She said you keep everything locked up.
Well...
That's what men do.
Your sister's nice.
I like her.
Can't be easy for her.
Her brother and her husband fighting over the same thing.
Men should talk too.
To you?
Why not?
I'm a barmaid.
It's my job.
Men always tell their troubles to a barmaid.
What is it you and Freddie are fighting over?
(SIGHS)
I'll meet you here at 9:00 tomorrow morning.
Did you buy a dress?
Yes, I bought a dress.
How does it look?
(TRAIN CHUGGING)
CHARLIE:
He's changed the oil and greased her up.
So will it get me all the way to Cheltenham, Curly?
He's good with motors but it pains him.
No heart in motor cars.
I can't talk to them.
Yeah...
Tommy might need to make a fast getaway.
The Lees will be all over the track.
And Kimber's men.
And his coppers, they control the law down there, Tommy.
Give 'er a turn for me, Charlie.
(ENGINE STARTING)
This car only seats four.
You'll need more men than that if you're to come back alive.
But it's just me and the girl.
Is it just the two of us going to the races?
Something like that.
Attention!
- ARTHUR:
Right.
-(THUDDING)
This is what's known as your final briefing before going over the top.
Sixty miles down that road is Cheltenham race track.
Johnny, what's our mission, boy?
To stick it to the Lee family, Arthur!
That's right.
The Lees are skimming money off legal bookies, running chalk, selling rafflers.
And beating up them as won't buy.
But, today...
- We're gonna stop them.
-What about Kimber's men?
Thought he had his own protection.
Kimber's let his troops go rotten.
They're on the take from the Lees to look the other way.
We're gonna show Kimber how it should be done.
Now take what you're good at.
Those of you with guns, keep them out of it unless a gun is pulled on you.
We want this done quietly.
MAN:
So when do we share out the cash?
We don't.
We're not keeping the cash.
You're in Tommy's army now, boys.

Nah.

We got every penny back.

Your money, Mr Kimber.
Rescued from the Lee brothers and returned to you with a request for a fair hearing.
Your own protection is failing, Mr Kimber.
Your boys are taking cuts.
I want to suggest that from now on, you contract out your racetrack security to the Peaky Blinders.
We'd be saving you a lot of money, Mr Kimber.
Lot of money.
- In return, you give us...
-(MATCH STRIKING)
Five percent of the take and three legal betting pitches at every race meeting north of the River Severn.
Rising to six after one year if we're all satisfied with the service.
What do you say, Mr Kimber?
I say you talk business to my accountant.
I want a dance.
Your man said it was all right for me to have this dance.
How many men can you put in the field at one time?
TOMMY:
There's a lot of men out of work at the moment.
Two guards for every bookie.
ROBERTS:
At every meeting.
We have contacts with good people among the gypsies.
(CLEARING THROAT) We'll always know when the Lees plan to attack.
With all the strikes and troubles, can't really depend on the police.
Anyway, we're more honest.
Looks like you two are making a deal.
We are making progress.
Then let me throw a small condition into the mix.
So, listen, uh...
We're gonna go for dinner at Kimber's house.
He has a place a couple of miles away.
I have some business to settle first with his accountant, so...
You go on ahead with Kimber.
Just me and him?
Yeah.
Till I'm done here.
Is that all right?
Look, I'll throw in an extra three quid for your extra time.
You think I'm a whore.
(SIGHS)
Everyone's a whore, Grace.
We just sell different parts of ourselves.
You said you wanted to work for me.
To do that you have to sharpen up.
The deal is, I'll give him two hours with you.
He thinks he's a ladies' man.
He thinks he can seduce you.
Whenever you want, just kick him in the balls.
I'm a clause in a contract.
If you wanna be part of my organisation, you have to make sacrifices.
Do we have a deal?
As a sweetener, you can try your luck with mine.
Yeah, we have a deal.
- Two hours?
-Yeah.
Side bet,10 pounds says I'll have her fucked in one.
KIMBER:
Mademoiselle.
I bet he said you could have me, didn't he?
While he has her.
That's the arrangement, isn't it?
Yours might be a prostitute, but I'm not.
I was a milliner when I met him.
I was independent.
I made this hat.
I was a good milliner.
It's a very pretty hat.
Really is.
So is she a prostitute?
(SIGHING) God's honest truth,
I don't know what she is.

You showed me up back there at the races.

Why don't you teach me how to dance properly?
The music's too slow.
Put on a Charleston.
Well, then we'd be far away.
I want to dance like this.

I was going to let you go through with this but, in the end, my conscience got the better of me.
She looks good on the outside, but she has the clap.
TOMMY:
Yeah.
Syphilis.
When you took a shine to her, I thought I'd use her.
Someone told me she had the syph, I thought, "What the hell?"
Call it my better nature.
She's, uh, she's a whore.
- Well, just go and wait in the oar.
-I can walk on my own.
Can we shake hands and forget this ever happened?
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)
(GATE CREAKING)
Start of the day, I was Lady Sarah of Connemara.
By the end, I was a whore with the clap.
You're a fucking bastard, offering me like that.
But then you change your mind.
Why did you change your mind, Thomas?

Kove:
Trent, report.
Have you taken out the target?
Trent:
Negative.
He's got your burn book, and he's moving fast.
If that gets into the wrong hands--
Kove:
You don't have to tell me what would happen.
That burn book is where I keep all my private thoughts, my internet passwords, and a list of who's cool and who's a backstabbing bitch.
Alphonse, do you have a shot?
Alphonse:
I can't tell them apart.
They look exactly alike.
Kove:
Okay, then, shoot them both.
Trent:
- Wait, what?
Alphonse:
- What?
!
Kove:
Look, Sam and I can't sit around like Ross waiting for
Rachel trying to figure out who's the terrorist and who's Trent.
Kill them both.
We'll work it out afterwards.
Sam:
- Why don't we use tranqs?
Kove:
- Tranqs?
!
Did Rachel "use tranqs" when Ross cheated on her with that girl from the copy place?
No!
She killed the relationship.
Doesn't matter if they were on a break.
Right, SAM?
Of course-- right.
That's two against one.
Alphonse, take the shot.
That's an order.

Sam:
I always said he had a lot of... hang-ups.
Kove:
I appreciate you trying, but it's no use.
Let's face it.
Puns were Trent's thing.
Your thing is awkward hugs.
Sam:
Hey.
Um, still no sign of either body, huh?
Kove:
No.
Trent hated the idea of a proper burial.
He would have wanted it this way.
He also said he would have preferred being eaten by rats or used as bonfire wood by local hobos.
That was his way.
You've been hacked.
You've been hacked.
You've been hacked.
Kove:
Oh, no!
We've been hacked.
Daisy:
Oh, no.
My bad.
Sorry, that was just a funny gif I was working on.
Do you like it?
SAM:
What is happening to me?
Kove:
Robot SAM, this is no time for dancing.
SAM:
I seem to have lost control of my faculties.
Daisy:
Oh, wait.
Yeah, now we've been hacked.
Security shutdown.
Alphonse:
Ooh, are you watching "The Matrix"?
Daisy:
No, we've been hacked again, and by the locks of it, they have access to our entire system.
Kove's been a bad girl.
Kove's been a bad girl.
Kove:
Well, all I know is this has nothing to do with my burn book being stolen and not being recovered.
We need to figure out who's behind this, which should be hard, because everyone likes me.
Daisy:
So, um, this might be a bit of a bad time... but I was wondering, does anyone want to see one of Gadget Girl's new gadgets?
Hmm?
It's a snow globe that actually shoots bullets.
Sam:
A gadget-
- Gadget Girl?
- Who's Gadget Girl?
Daisy:
- Me.
Me.
I'm Gadget Girl.
Did you not get my e-mail?
I'm just trying to define myself in the workplace a little bit.
Alphonse:
- Get off me.
Kove:
- Damn it.
Daisy and her gifs.
It's pronounced "jiff."
Kove:
You!
Hello... mom.
Kove: [ Shouts ]
Daisy: [ Breathing heavily ]
Guys, guys, guys, stop!
It's an emergency.
Alphonse:
- Not now, Daisy.
Daisy:
- No, it's an emergency.
Sam:
Daisy, I'm about to beat Alphonse.
- Give me one second.
Daisy:
- Go, go, Gadget Girl.
[ Grunts ]
Sam:
What?
!
Damn it!
Okay.
All right.
You win.
What's so important, Daisy?
Daisy: [ Panting ] Kove...
kidnapped... hacker.
Alphonse:
Use conjunctions, woman.
Sam:
Kove's been kidnapped.
You guys find out where the hacker's signal is coming from, and I'll go to Kove's house and pretend to be her nanny so that her kids don't get suspicious.
Good?
Okay.
- Break!
Alphonse:
- Wait.
What?
Sam:
Okay.
Trent:
I guess the reason why I own a hybrid is because it's like saying "Thank you" to mother earth.
SAM:
Trent?
Trent:
I don't have a swimming pool, but what I like to do is fill the bathtub up with water and go underneath it.
It's like a private swimming pool.
SAM:
Trent is alive!
Kove: [ Groans ]
Rise and shine, mama.
Kove:
Kathleen.
No.
It's Gail-- your only daughter, Gail.
Kove:
Oh.
Right.
Gail.
What do you want?
Didn't I send you a Christmas card?
No.
You didn't.
It's time you start paying attention to me.
Kove:
Can't you see I'm busy?
We're dealing with a very important hacker right now.
I'm the hacker!
Kove:
Very funny, Gail, but jokes aren't your thing.
Your thing is crying and being a baby.
How do you know what my thing is?
You left when I was born.
Kove:
Well, that's what I remember from the delivery room.
You were crying, and you were being a real baby.
Why did you leave?
Kove:
Because you were a girl.
Now I have two boys, and I couldn't be happier.
Couldn't be happier.
[ Growls ]
[ Doorbell rings ]
Sam: [ High-pitched ] Hello.
My name is Mrs. Sugar Blossom.
I'm your new nanny.
We're going to be the best of friends.
Do you guys like singing or dancing?
Mom's been kidnapped.
Get the go bags.
Sam: [ Chuckling ] No.
We've only just begun.
Come.
It's time for a hug.
Yes, that's good.
[ Electricity crackles ]
[ Shouts ] What?
!
[ Groans ]
[ Groans ]
No!
What happened?
!
SAM:
There he is.
Trent:
I joined Sam's club.
I mean, it's worth it, you know?
SAM:
Where have you been?
I thought you were dead.
Alphonse:
No, SAM.
Trent, there you are.
I knew you faked your death, started your life all over, and worked at mall kiosk selling penguins.
We always fall for that.
Trent:
I am not Trent.
I am...
Guy Person, assistant manager of Pick-a-Puffin.
Daisy:
Name tag checks out.
Let's go.
Alphonse:
No, Daisy.
Kove's been kidnapped.
Trent:
What?
!
[ Gasps, cries ]
Alphonse:
Look, man, we need you back.
Hey, baby.
What's wrong?
Who are these people?
Trent:
Look, I love you more than life itself, and you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
But I got some poopy news.
You're gonna have to forget about me forever.
What?
No, that's impossible.
You're everything to me.
Daisy:
Gadget Girl to the rescue.
Ma'am, look at this.
What you just saw, you actually didn't see.
[ Groans ]
Daisy:
Now, who is that man?
Guy Person, my fiancé.
[ Grunts ]
Daisy:
She won't remember that.
Trent:
Great.
What was that?
You've completely forgotten about me.
I hacked your computer, and I'm not even in your address book.
You didn't even write about me in your burn book.
You act like I don't even exist.
So I made a page all about me.
- Do you like it?
Kove:
- No.
It's derivative.
- New subject-- what is this place?
- Oh.
[ Telephones ringing, chatter ]
Well, with all the hacking and the stealing and the plans to kidnap you, it became a real chore working from home--
Roommates. [ Gags ]
So I got one of those rent-an-office facilities.
Plus, I have a small etsy company, so it's a great place to ship from.
Kove:
So let me get this straight.
You're going to kidnap me to spend more time with me?
Take a hint, sister.
I'm just not that into you.
Well, maybe...
I'll just get into you.
Kove: [ Chuckles ] How original, Amanda.
At this point, you know it's Gail.
You're just messing with me.
Say, "Gail."
[ Beeping ] You know it's Gail.
Daisy:
Kove's distress signal is coming from inside here.
Trent:
Office building.
I don't trust it.
Too many people parking in different spaces, notes up on the walls, too many people's lunches go missing, too many windows, too many ways to die.
Daisy:
Which means you're gonna need some help from Gadget Girl.
Trent:
You're Gadget Girl?
I thought I killed her in 2010.
What the hell's all this crap?
Daisy:
This is a stapler that shoots bullets or a gun that shoots staples.
It's really whatever way you want to look at it.
And now this is really cool.
So, it's a scissor, but it's also a gun that shoots bullets and it's also... a stapler.
Trent:
So, wait, they're just all guns?
Daisy:
So, the, uh-- the next time you're in a fix, just call the Gadget Girl.
Trent:
I need a nickname, then, I think, too.
- Call me Paunch.
Daisy:
- Why Paunch?
Trent:
I feel kind of paunchy.
- Paunchy.
Daisy:
- Oh.
Trent:
So, actually, you call me Gadget Girl.
Daisy:
No, you-- you can't be Gadget Girl.
- I'm Gadget Girl!
Trent:
- You'll be Paunch.
Just tell me that you love me and that you're proud of me.
Kove:
No.
I'm never one to coddle.
Then at least just tell me you're sorry.
Kove:
And if I apologize, you'll let me go and give me
- back my burn book?
- Yes.
And then we can get a Chinese chicken salad and pretend like
- this whole thing never happened.
Kove:
- Never!
Trent:
Freeze!
NTSF!
This gun means we never have to apologize.
Kove:
Trent, you're alive!
Trent:
Yeah.
Faked my death.
Kove:
Just like when we got our third divorce.
Trent:
It's an oldie but a goodie.
- Who the hell is this?
Kove:
- This is Gina, my daughter.
Gail!
The name is Gail!
[ Screams ]
[ Rips ] [ Yells ]
Trent:
He faked his death, too?
!
Damn it, Alphonse.
Can't you kill anyone?
!
You're a terrible shot.
Kove:
Get him, Trent.
- Yes!
Trent:
- Damn it.
That was supposed to be a bullet, not a staple.
What the hell?
!
Come on, guys!
How are we gonna throw Frank's birthday party in this mess?
Trent:
Okay, look, I can explain.
[ Gunshot ]
Aah!
Geez!
Trent:
This thing is tricky.
[ Doorbell rings ]
- This summer...
Sam: [ High-pitched ]
- Hello!
[ Shouts ]
- ...being a woman...
Sam: - [ Shouts ] ...just got nuttier.
Sam: [ Shouts ]
- Because to be a lady...
Sam: - [ Shouts ] ...it takes balls.
Trent:
I guess, if you were to ask me, my favorite dessert would be mochi.
It's funny.
It's like kind of a-a dough ice cream.
You know, we got a bunk bed for the spare room.
We figure the guests will like it.
You know, it's kind of fun.
It brings you back to being a kid.
I've been journaling a lot, writing a lot of my thoughts down.
It's kind of like my own version of poetry.
I'm a type of guy who says,
"Hell, even though I'm an adult,
I'll still eat a fruit roll-up."
Got to say, can't miss my Kathie Lee and Hoda.
[ Chuckling ] I mean, those two are wild.
So, I'm taking this spin class, right?
And all of a sudden, I'm like,
"Why do they call it a spin class?
They should call it a sweat class."
[ Chuckles ] I'm joking, of course.
It's a great workout.
Well, it looks like a half-sandwich day.
- Hey, daddy.
- Hey, honey.
How's ninth grade?
You have fun?
You need advice about boys?
You're a smart strong young girl, so...
Screw boys!
Just so we're clear,
I'm not saying "screw boys" like go do that.
What's happening right now?
I'm single-parenting.
Sort of.
I read a book last night.
Some of it.
Maybe if you read to the end, it would've said we don't need to do this.
Come on, Ellie, your mom just moved away,
I just got a new and very weird boss.
There're all sorts of things we could be exploring together, sharing our feelings about...
There it is.
OK, there is something I wanna know.
Great!
Is it how I'm coping with my new boss?
If you're gay, then how did you and mom have sex?
What was that?
It's OK, we don't have to talk.
All right.
It was a long time ago, here's what happend.
Gay.
Tried not to be.
Was.
Was again.
Was one more time because it was not unpleasant.
Am.
So was "was" and all the other was-es with one guy or...
I mean, I mean first of all,
There wasn't a lot "was-ing".
Although, one "was-ing" was with a bear with no hair, so wasn't a very fuzzy "was-ing", was it?
It's a rhyme.
OK, that's grandma.
She's gonna take you to school, all right?
Now listen, I know I haven't been around much for dinner since you've been here.
Fine with me, upseting for you, go on.
There was a big project at work, but now it's over,
So I promise you
I will be home tonight.
And I'm gonna make you the best dinner to celebrate our one-week anniversary of living together, yeah!
Our new life, full of love, and patience, and calm down...
You maniac, I'm parenting!
Good ones can do it and open the door at the same time.
It is still Monday?
Cause I've been out here since Monday!
Please, come in.
Your voice got here ten minutes ago and has been looking for you.
How was my baby?
I don't know, mom.
Honestly, going from being a fun weekend dad to a responsible full-time dad...
Oh, well you think I'm talking about you?
That's funny.
I'm talking about Ellie!
Poor kid, fourteen years old and her mother abandons her.
Now she has no one, no one!
Mom, Jill didn't abandon her.
She took a job!
And Ellie chose to stay and keep going to school with her friends.
Wait a minute.
I just remembered someone she has...
Wait a minute, it's coming to me.
Give me a second.
That's right, me.
Of course she has you.
Oh, sage, I need this.
You have so much on your plate.
A teenage daughter, a terrible new boss.
That fantastic gorgeous man you finally found, who dumped you.
This whole thing could be a disaster.
Sometimes, you negative.
You hear how you tear into me?
Hi, grandma.
Hello, beautiful.
Are you sharing your feelings with your son?
Apparently that's super important.
Well, I'm trying, sweetheart.
But he never makes it easy.
Well, time for grandma to go back out in the hall.
Come here.
Now, don't be late, all right?
We're having our special dinner tonight to bond as a family.
Wow, can I come?
Oh God no.
I hate the new owner.
He's mean, he knows nothing about online retail...
And...
Why are you shaking your head?
Cuz he's on the phone with the new owner.
Oh, No!
No, I'm not talking about you, Max.
You're great.
I was talking about the new owner
- of...
Uh-uh... - the deli down the street.
Yeah!
That guy!
He knows nothing about online retail, and so I...
Hate him.
I'll take a look at those numbers when I come in, Sean.
And I'll see you later, too, Liz.
OK, sounds great, Max.
Love you.
You love him?
Well, now that's confusing.
No, it's just something I say sometimes when I'm nerves.
I actually said it once to my mom.
Well, maybe you shouldn't just walk in the rooms talking.
Well, how was I suppose to know you were on speakerphone?
Yes?
I was waiting to see you if you're on speakerphone.
Serious?
That's a thing?
Sean, have you see this new non-stick skillets that Max wants us to sell?
They stick.
Are we gonna go from a place that sells quality products to one that sells garbage?
because I would not stand for that!
I will, if I had to.
But it is not OK, unless that's the drill.
Now look, I don't wanna be any confusion,
I need this job.
My band is not making as much money as I hoped, plus I think our bass player is ripping us off.
Yeah, but he's cute and distracts from the music, which is good.
which is good.
I know these last two weeks with Max haven't been easy.
Yeah, and I've been thinking about that.
What if we pool our money, buy this place, and all own it together?
But you don't have any money.
I said, "Pool it."
As in everyone chips in.
But you can't chip in.
"Pool it," Sean.
Sean, people are really upset about Max.
You should talk to everyone.
All right, fine.
I'll go saddle up, ride out, and save the day.
"Saddle up and ride out"?
That's new.
Yeah, I tried reading a parenting book last night, but ended up watching a western instead.
Hey, can I get everybody's attention, please?
I want to talk to you about Max.
Did he quit?
No, Howard.
He's the owner.
Owners don't quit their jobs owning things.
Did he die?
Because owners do die, Sean.
They totally die.
What's happening?
Did somebody die?
Hey, Max,
We were all just getting psyched up because this is the hardest-working, most enthusiastic group of people in online retail, huh?
Come on!
I say online, you say retail.
- Online!
- Retail!
- Online!
- Retail!
Stop it!
Sorry.
Look, I know you've all been working late recently, and I just want you to know that's gonna be a permanent thing.
Or just to build on what you're saying, maybe we take your excellent idea and not... do that.
Sean, our competition killed us again last week with those throw pillows.
They cut open our stomachs, ripped out our entrails, and stuffed our gaping cavities with their cheap, asinine decoratives.
If working harder is a problem for you people, for what I spend on that guy,
I could get a billion chinese people in here.
Hey, Liz.
Love you.
Love you too, Max.
Is that gonna be our thing?
'cause that is not gonna be fun.
What am I gonna do?
I can't work late tonight.
I don't even want to work today.
No, I have to be home.
I promised Ellie I'd make her a special dinner.
Plus, the book was very clear.
A real man has to stand tall against a miserable hombre.
Maybe that was the western.
Either way, I have to be home.
Eh, Max.
I have a daughter, Ellie.
Her mom and I divorced right after she was born.
Long story, she wasn't a gay man.
Anyway,
Ellie just moved in with me,
And keeping my word is very important--
All the books and westerns say so--
And I promised her I'd have dinner with her tonight.
Sean, we all have families.
I don't specifically, but, if I did, they would understand that I have to work late.
And so do you.
It's just that I haven't been around much, and I promised I'd make her favorite, Chicken Parmesan.
Oh.
Chicken Parmesan.
Why didn't you say so?
That changes everything.
Really?
No.
Why would it?
I didn't think it would, but you just said it did.
I was kidding, Sean.
Humor is important in the workplace.
I read that somewhere.
I don't think they meant humor at the expense of the employee.
Oh, so you read it too?
I don't see how that's possible.
I didn't even say what it was.
I'm just saying, whatever it was.
So you have not read it, and yet you're an authority on it?
Okay, forget what you read.
I may not have read anything.
I may have made it up.
It doesn't matter.
I didn't make it up.
Is that a new chair?
Yes.
Sir, the point is, my daughter, Ellie--
Beautiful.
Ooh.
Oh, it's like sitting on a pile of baby seals.
Sean, one of the reasons
I bought this company is because of you.
really?
You are a genius at picking products for this company to sell.
No...
You're also an excellent manager.
Well...
You set an example for everyone.
Yeah.
So you can never leave early.
Hahahaha...
I'm sorry?
Ha!
I outwitted you.
Okay.
Forget Chicken Parmesan.
What if I left early enough to make a simple soup?
Soup is better.
When you get home, which will be after dinner.
Again, I have outwitted you.
My prize is your chair.
Ellie.
Hey, dad.
I was just on my way home from school and felt like saying hello.
Hello.
I'm just so glad I'm living with you.
Oh, that's nice.
I like this part.
You don't have an agenda, do you?
Of course not.
This suspicious mind is why you can't hold onto a lady.
Okay, so Liz said that you guys are kind of busy, and I've got a lot going on, so it's okay if we can't have dinner tonight.
Oh, really?
That'd be great,
Because my boss is being a total di...fficult guy.
Well, that's a drag.
- I'll see you when I get home.
- Okay, honey.
Oh, wait a minute, you mean you'll see me when I get home.
We'll both see each other at home.
That's what's important.
No, no, because saying you'll see me when you get home implies that you're going out.
Let's talk about this tonight when we both get home in no particular order.
Okay, all right, all right.
One second, one second.
Oh, so that's what that's for.
Why don't you want to have dinner with me tonight?
- Because you can't.
- Ellie.
Okay, my friends Emma and Tess invited me to see this band--
- A-ha!
An agenda.
- A-ha!
No, it's not.
We had plans to have dinner tonight, and that's what we're gonna do.
But you can't.
And I outwitted you.
What?
Outwitted you again.
What about this for a description?
"These eye-catching side tables give any room a touch of drama."
As do I, by the way, thank you very much.
Okay, it's 6:00.
I ran out earlier and got a chicken.
It's waiting for me in the break room.
- I have to go.
- Then go.
- I can't go.
- Then stay.
- I can't stay.
- Then stay.
- You mean go.
- You said you can't go.
- I can't.
- So go.
- You mean stay.
- You can't stay.
Don't stop.
You just about figured it out.
Sean, be bold.
Sneak out the bathroom window and run like hell.
I'm not gonna sneak out the bathroom window.
But the rear door is alarmed, and it's the only window that opens.
Clearly, they do not want us leaving.
I'm just gonna go tell Max I'm leaving.
I-I'm not afraid of him.
Max!
If this is about you leaving early,
No, you can't.
No, I can't.
You dropped your chicken.
Thank you.
It never worked when it was on the wall.
You dropped your chicken again!
No, no, don't.
No, no, don't--don't!
Oh, god.
Wow, those side tables really do add drama to any room.
Help me out of these, all right?
Come on.
Okay, move those tables.
Move those tables.
Chicken, all right.
Now cup your hands.
- Hoist me up, okay?
- Come on.
One, two, three.
Oh, don't look at my ass.
Don't look at my ass.
Don't look at my ass!
I know you're annoyed.
You wanted to go out, and I'm making you eat a meal that may or may not have asphalt in it.
We didn't have to have dinner together.
I realize mom's not around.
She left.
Thank you, mom.
But that doesn't mean I need your help adjusting or with anything.
"Thank you, mom"?
That seems worth exploring.
I'm fine.
I think we should talk about her leaving.
You.
Leaving you.
I could have gone with her if I wanted,
And I didn't want to, so I don't need you trying to help me with my feelings.
It's probably grandma.
She gets upset when people yell at me and she can't pile on.
Hello.
Max.
Hey.
No, great, yeah, no, totally.
All right.
Yeah, I'll see you real soon.
Okay, love you.
That was my boss.
He wants to see me.
I'm gonna have to call grandma to babysit.
I don't need a babysitter, and why does your boss want to see you now?
I snuck out to get home, and I... cracked his windshield with a chicken.
You snuck out?
Are you gonna get fired?
No, no, no, honey.
He just wants me to run over to the Silverado and talk to him.
The Silverado?
Is that a strip club?
No, it's a hotel.
He's only been here a few weeks.
- He doesn't have a place yet.
- No, you're lying.
Liz said Max is a bad man.
He's gonna take you into a back room at a strip joint and beat you with a golf club.
Dad, I have seen the movies.
What kind of business do you think I'm in?
I told you we didn't have to have dinner.
- I told you.
- Ellie, come on!
It's gonna be fine.
God, I hope the Silverado's a hotel.
Oh, sure, when you need something,
Door opens right away.
Thanks for watching Ellie, mom.
You bet.
Wow, you look nice.
Thanks.
I have a date later.
I don't want to know.
His name is Daniel.
I don't want to know.
We've kissed.
Gonna move things along tonight.
Seriously, we don't have to be this close.
All right, so Ellie's up in her room, mad at me.
Kids are tough.
You were a pain in the ass.
Thank you.
A real pain in the ass.
Got it.
Just horrible.
So why is Ellie mad?
Because I don't know what I'm doing.
She wanted to hang out with her friends instead of having dinner, should I have let her?
I don't know.
And now she knows I'm in trouble with work.
Should I have told her?
I don't know, because
I don't know anything about parenting.
Nobody does.
It's all a mess.
Fish have it right.
Just drop 'em and go.
You tried that once at a food court, but I found you.
My sweet boy.
The only thing you can do is keep trying.
Don't give up.
Never let her push you away.
I just don't want to blow it.
She's a good girl.
She deserves a good dad.
Hey, she has the best dad.
All right.
I gotta run.
Listen, if I'm not back in an hour,
I've been murdered with a golf club.
- Then what?
- I don't know.
Mourn me.
What's that gonna do?
Boy, that Daniel sure is a lucky guy.
He will be tonight.
Sir, I was wrong.
I hope you'll accept my apology.
And this $20 coffee gift card.
That barista was right, now 20 doesn't seem like enough.
Hey, dad.
Hi, sweetheat.
Ellie!
What are you doing here?
You're in trouble because you want it to be with me.
And now I wanna be with you.
No,no,no, that's very sweet.
I really appreciate that.
But go home.
And tell grandma nice job with the babysitting.
Sorry, I'm here to back you up.
Just like the town drunk in that western you're obsessed with.
Ellie, please, this ain't your fight.
Now go on, get.
What's it?
It's a daughter?
Enter.
Oh, you have a cockatoo.
Tiel.
Cockatiel.
A cockatoo would be five times Hector's size.
I don't know birds.
I knew it was a bird.
Please...
Continue to stand.
- This is Ellie.
- Ellie, this is Max and
Hector.
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hector, please.
- Hector, please.
I hate this part of you.
Sean, why don't you start with the best apology you can muster, and then let's see where that takes us.
No.
No?
No.
I'm not going to apologize.
Who are you to make me choose between my job and my daughter?
!
Your boss.
That!
is a truth.
But this girl is the most important thing in my life.
And her world has been turned upside-down, whether she realizes that or not, and I'm going to be there for her whether she wants me there or not.
So I will be having dinner with her.
And I got you a coffee card.
The first of two.
Well, this is too bad, Sean.
I had hoped that we could keep working together.
My mom abandoned me.
What?
- What?
- What?
My mom, she left.
She moved away.
I didn't want to go, and I thought She wouldn't leave without me, but she did.
And that sucks.
She sucks.
And now, all I have is my dad, and we don't have the same shorthand, and he thinks dinner is way too important, but
I need him.
And I'd really like him to keep having a job, if possible.
Clever in bringing the girl.
Your mom abandoned you?
Okay, I just said that for his benefit.
Oh, we are so going to be talking about that.
Whatever.
Can we eat first?
Yes, definitely, I'm starving.
Oh, this looks great.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, this looks great.
Thank you, sir.
The room's a mess.
We'll just take it from here.
Thank you.
Have a good day.
Buh-bye now.
Pull up a chair.
Salmon.
Nice.
Yeah.
And no asphalt.
Your boss won't mind?
Oh, who cares?
I promised you we'd have a special dinner tonight,
And that's what we're gonna do.
And that's what we're gonna do.
Okay, let's just say I've done everything that you said I'm doing.
How long should I be punished for this?
What is the statute... - until you realize that you're wrong.
Both:
Thank you.
Don't worry about it.
It's fine.
Oh, you're very quick to give up on that, weren't you?
What is that supposed to mean?
Well, we're having this argument.
It's gonna go on for weeks.
But when it comes to the check, don't worry about it.
Old Jim will pay for it.
Oh, that's fair.
Yeah.
How much do drinks cost here, or anywhere?
I don't know, Jim.
I don't.
Sorry.
Hi.
How are you?
Hi.
Good, thank you.
Eating alone?
Yeah.
It's fun, isn't it?
Yeah.
How much do drinks cost here?
Well, drinks are $6.
Call drinks are $8.
And...
How much is a beer?
A draft is $5.
A draft is $5, Peggy.
It's $5 for a draft.
Would you like one?
No.
Are you paying?
Of course.
I would love one!
All right.
Thank you so much.
You're so welcome.
See, she knows how much drinks cost because she's what they call "unattractive."
You're not.
You've never bought a drink in your entire life!
This is why I'd love to be gay.
Oh, it would suit me.
I wouldn't enjoy the sex at first, but I'd muscle through it...
I'm a trooper.
I'd have it in my mouth.
Tears would be streaming down my face, but it'd all be worth it, just so I could split the occasional bill.
That's why lesbians are so bloody angry... neither of them know who's gonna pay.
One of them's sitting there thinking, "well, I put the effort in."
I've shaved my head.
I've got a brand-new plaid shirt.
"She better treat me like a princess."
Yep, you're an asshole.
Why do they always look like men if they hate us so much?
You never see a Jew dressed as a Nazi!
Hi.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Awkward.
You two are splitting the bill, right?
Yeah.
Good for you.
Civilized.
It's very hard to keep your anger in.
I don't think I'm yelling, you know?
I'll be having a discussion with a girl, and I'll say, "look, I"
don't agree with you."
And then she'll be, "stop yelling at me!"
I'll be, "I'm not yelling!"
And then, all of a sudden, of course you're yelling.
And then she looks at you like you're a murderer or acting like a child or someone who's killing a child.
Oh, it's a woman's world, mate.
I think I'd prefer to be gay.
You know?
But I could never have the sex, never enjoy that.
Therein lies the rub, so to speak.
Could never have sex with something I respect.
[Scoffs]
That joke kills onstage.
Hey, Jim, are you gonna bring a suit?
It's Omaha.
Are there nice places there?
It's Omaha.
Hey, Steve, don't forget the k-y.
That's funny.
We don't even use it anymore.
Beginning of the relationship, we did... he was very tender.
Jim, please stop, all right?
You know I have a thing about sharing a room.
And flying.
You have a problem with everything, Steve.
He's afraid to fly.
Seriously, I've been on more flights than he has.
When you fly, do you go economy or cargo?
Cargo.
That's nice.
Steve, you didn't tell me you sucked at flying, as well.
Where's my damn floss?
Billy, did you take my floss?
You're going mad, Steve!
Billy didn't take your floss.
How could he?
How do you get like this?
Hey, mom!
We're watching "hoarders."
Shut up.
I had to stop by and pick up your damn pain medication, and then your father was telling me a story that I'd heard a thousand times before.
Which story?
Oh, I don't know.
One with a tent?
Is that a hoarder reference?
It's surprisingly nice of you to take Steve to the show.
Steve, you guys need to go to the airport, okay?
Steve!
This is disgusting!
It's like a health hazard in here!
Oh, come on, mom.
Nobody can live at your house.
And why are you, of all people, cleaning?
Shut up!
Will you both just stop it?
!
Jim, are you ready?
I'm ready.
Is this old food?
Oh, Steve, this is disgusting!
Look at this!
No wanking near me, Steve.
There will be no drugs or hookers.
Janice, it's Omaha.
I've called...
they're both busy.
You are so sick.
We flew to San Francisco once.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And I threw up the whole way.
And he screamed, "we're gonna crash!
We're gonna die!"
I love this story, too.
You're being picked on by a 110-pound man in a wheelchair.
He was nervous.
I gave up my room for you, you little shit.
Okay, just go.
Just go.
Give me a kiss.
Go, go.
Get out.
Both of you, get out.
Bye, Steve!
Don't forget to crash and die!
I won't Billy.
Don't forget to have mom wash your balls for you!
You're gonna burn.
Stop it!
This one's shorter.
Trust me.
Your jacket, sir.
I'm gonna wear it on the plane, though.
All jackets must be removed, sir.
Okay.
Proceed.
[Beeping]
Step back, please.
Belt?
Oh, sorry.
Hey, mom!
I got to pee.
You don't have to pee, Billy!
You peed 10 minutes ago.
What are you doing?
I'm cleaning!
Yes, I know that, mother.
But why?
Why?
Yes.
Because these boys are inadequate to take care of you, and I can't keep coming over to do this.
So, um, we are going to hire and interview help today.
What?
Yeah!
Mm-hmm.
We are going to get a home-care nurse for you.
No, we're not!
Is this your bag, sir?
Yes.
Bag check.
What?
What's wrong with it?
They're all over 3 ounces.
Well, that's cough syrup.
Nope.
Yes, we are.
No, we're not!
Yes, we are!
No, we're not, mom.
Steve and Jim are doing fine.
They are not.
[Groans]
You want to leave the room, that's fine.
But we are hiring somebody today whether you like it or not.
Mom?
Yep?
You're a hoarder.
I am a collector, and there is a big, big difference.
Face scrub.
Nope.
Aftershave?
Nope.
That's shaving cream.
Nope.
That's just lotion for hands.
I only use it on my hands!
No.
It's a shampoo and conditioner in one.
Back and sides are very hard to manage.
Nope.
No, not that one.
That's for my tinea cruris.
Jock itch.
Yes.
Absolutely not.
Thank you, sir.
Have a wonderful flight.
Thank you.
Next, please.
Hey!
Hold it!
Drop the bag, sir.
Security?
What?
!
No, it's... it's...
I'm afraid you're gonna have to come with me.
Jim!
You're gonna be a while, Steve!
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Dead.
Dead.
Dead.
Eh, alive.
They cavity-searched me.
Who's a lucky boy, then?
Alive.
Dead.
What are you doing?
Playing the alive/dead game, Steve.
Stop it.
When the plane crashes and we're all living on a deserted island.
[Bell dings]
Oh, God.
You don't have to go as soon as they call.
If I don't go now, I'm never gonna go!
Steve?
What?
!
Dead.
[Cackles]
You're such a dick.
Excuse me.
Oh, God.
Pardon me.
I have to get a...
excuse me.
There's no... excuse me.
I need to get past.
Mine's full, and I... [Grunts]
Excuse me.
I need to get through.
Excuse me.
What?
!
Can you hold her a sec?
No, I really can't.
She's a service dog.
What kind of service does she perform?
Therapy.
Really?
What kind of therapy?
Emotional.
I got it.
The dog is gonna have to go in its carrier under the seat.
It's not my dog.
It's mine, and it's a therapy dog.
Really?
That's what I said.
Wha... okay.
Help.
Steve, get out of my seat.
I got to look out the window, or else I'll get sick.
Here, please.
What's this?
It's supposed to be a therapy dog.
It's roxy!
Who's roxy?
She's a therapy dog to help your friend with his nerves, 'cause he's pretty keyed up.
She's very cute.
Thank you!
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
Hey, Steve?
Get out of my seat.
Can't.
Steve, get out of my seat.
What's the problem here?
This man is being very rude.
Your dog's not gonna help me get my seat!
Yes, he would.
Steve, get out of my seat.
Sir, please.
Just take the middle seat.
No, I booked this seat months ago!
This is my seat!
This man's sitting in my seat.
Give me my seat, Steve.
I can't!
He obviously cannot, so please, sir, please just take the middle seat.
Thank you.
Maybe you'll get lucky and no one sits in the aisle.
Steve, I haven't been on a plane for four years that hasn't been completely full.
God!
What are you doing?
!
I can't get comfortable!
I can't get comfortable!
Will you bring me a pillow?
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Also, I still have to pee.
Okay, well, hold it.
Okay.
You can pee later.
The doctor said that it is good to hold it in.
Mom, does this look comfortable?
Take the pillow away.
Oh, I can't get comfortable!
Don't think you're gonna go to the toilet whenever you want to.
Then what am I gonna do?
You're gonna sit there!
I wish they would just let you stay with me.
The state won't let me stay with you, mom... thank God.
[Knock on door]
Oh!
Our first candidate.
Try to look healthy.
That's never gonna happen.
What?
!
Come on.
Why can't I have a hot one?
Because you are not wheeling around in that wheelchair with an erection.
I've seen it.
It's offensive.
It's not offensive.
It's very disturbing.
It's magnificent.
All these people are dead.
The child's dead.
Please.
These people are dead.
I'm alive.
It's a desert island.
She's there, too.
We're eating you, Steve.
Hi.
There's only two more seats, and...
No.
Don't ever sit next to me, Steve.
Why can't I find a girl like that?
Maybe because you're an asshole?
You're right, you know.
That's what twiggy said to me.
Peggy.
Peggy said to me.
You know, when they always talk about movies, like, in the 1960s, whenever you see them, they always depict air stewardesses as being, like, these hot, young things with a pillbox hat and the hair and the perfect makeup and the perfect
eyes and the little waist and the great tits?
Yeah.
I don't think any of those women have retired.
Look at her!
50 years of recycled air have made her face drip off her skull like the end of "raiders of the lost ark."
Oh, Jim, please.
Cybil.
You just got lucky.
[Sighs]
Uhoh.
Oh, my God.
Get out of my seat, Steve.
I can't.
I'm losing it here, Jim.
Swap seats with me, Steve.
I'm losing it.
Give it back to me, Steve.
I can't!
You want roxy now?
I really do.
Too late.
I think you're in my seat.
Yeah.
Will you hold this for me, please?
You're a dead man.
He's massive.
Ma'am, there's no room.
Whose backpack is this?
It's his.
Sir, you'll have to put your backpack under your seat.
I only bring a single one so I don't have to have anything under the seat!
Sir, put it in front of your seat.
This woman brought three and a dog!
Service animal.
Is there a problem?
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I have to pee.
You have to wait.
We're actively taxiing.
Why didn't you put your bagunder your seat?
This is my seat.
Sir, please, put your bag under your seat.
This is my seat.
I tried to explain to... - now.
Don't bother the man.
He's angry.
I am angry!
I have the middle seat!
Welcome to trans-voyage air flight 27, nonstop to Omaha, Nebraska.
This is a non-smoking flight.
What?
Wait.
I don't remember that memo.
Surely, you can't smoke in the airport, but you think you'd be able to smoke in a cylinder in the sky.
Oh, please, Jim.
Please pay attention.
This is for your safety, as well as the safety of everyone else on board.
[British accent] It's very important that my instructions be carried out to the letter.
After all, everything I do, I do to ensure his safety.
Billy, pay attention.
This is about your safety.
I'm gonna pee my pants.
I've heard that for 30 years.
[Soft-music playing]
[Grunting]
Did you see that?
Please, Jim, don't talk.
Don't cause a scene, please.
I think you are perfect.
Are you crazy?
!
No, she's not!
Yes!
I think I know what's best.
But I can't work weekends.
Oh, thank God.
And I don't think I want to work for you, anyway.
You're too angry.
Well, you'd be angry, too, if you had a mother like her.
[British accent] And a rather magnificent but apparently offensive cock, and you couldn't jerk it off.
[Normal voice] Bitch!
Just let it go, man.
It's just an armrest.
Yeah, but I'll just say, like, nicely, like, kindly, like, "excuse me, good sir, but you are taking my armrest."
No, you will not say, "kindly," "good sir," or,
"excuse me," or any of that!
Yeah, I am a lot nicer in my head.
Look, you can have mine.
Steve, I've already got yours.
I get both of them.
There's certain things that people should already know, all right... things like don't kill people, try not to rape.
When you're in an airplane, there's a thing called plane etiquette, and it goes like this...
window gets an armrest and a wall.
Middle gets two armrests.
Aisle gets an armrest and a little bit of extra leg.
We're not animals!
We live in a society!
It's not that big a deal.
Oh, it's all right for you, Steve.
We haven't all been pleasurably cavity-searched today.
I'm going for it.
I'm in.
I'm in.
Don't.
He's black.
He's also very gay.
Go.
[Grunting]
[Grunting]
[Groans]
What are you doing?
I got to do this, Steve.
He's been fighting for this armrest for 20 minutes, but now he's met the wall of Jim.
So why are you squashing me?
It's a principle thing, Steve.
[Both grunt]
[Panting]
[Gasps]
Mommy, the lady man is being mean to the angry man.
Good.
Why are you such a...
[Bell dings]
Hey!
[All gasp, murmur]
[Bell dings]
Mommy, what's a "can't"?
Did he just say the "c" word?
Yep, he dropped the c-bomb.
Oh, my God.
Excuse me?
What did you call me?
A [Ding] Sir.
I called you a [Ding]
[All gasp]
Oh, grow up, the lot of you!
Now, I get it... it's not as popular a word as it should be in this country.
Hear, hear.
Thank you.
But in other countries, like the u.K., it's used... - all the time.
It's used in Shakespeare, chaucer.
It's the oldest expletive in the book.
Are you upset because you're trying to take my armrest?
Oh, here we go.
Your armrest?
Your armrest?
You don't know plane etiquette.
Window gets an armrest and a wall.
Middle gets two armrests.
Aisle gets an armrest and a little bit of extra leg.
We're not animals!
We live in a society!
He's got a point.
Sorry, man.
I didn't know.
Will you move your elbow?
I am only taking the back of the armrest.
You can have all the rest.
You take the back, you take the whole damn thing.
No one's ever gone, "thanks for the front of the armrest."
He's right about that, too.
Spot on.
And you're not just taking my armrest!
You're almost coming over the armrest, and it's digging into my ribcage.
Well, if someone lost a little weight...
- Oh, God.
He didn't say that!
Oh, this is gonna get good.
You bitchy queen.
How dare you?
[Laughter]
Oh, piss off.
Isn't "bitch" a bad word?
Nowhere near as bad as that other word.
He's a very angry man.
I'm not angry!
This is a civil-rights thing.
I'm standing up for middle seats everywhere!
Yeah!
Sit down!
Oh, here she comes, without her Walker.
Shh!
What is the problem now?
I want this asshole away from me.
You know, there is no need for that kind of language.
This is the exact reason that that type of language was invented, all right?
We're both angry.
We're having a fight.
When do you swear?
He's right again.
I swear all the time.
Even I swear when I get upset.
All right, then.
There is no need for name-calling.
Thank you.
I didn't call him any names.
Yeah, you called him a bitchy queen.
Thank you.
I'm just trying to help.
You're not helping, Steve.
Yes, you are.
Listen, cybil.
Can I call you cybil?
No.
Cybil, you're right.
There is never a need for name-calling.
But... as a proud gay man myself, I feel like I've earned the right to say such words.
This liar's trying to take my armrest.
Oh, please.
Everyone knows that the middle seat gets both armrests.
Thank you, cybil.
We're not animals!
We live in a society!
Hear, hear.
But he's not gay!
Ah!
That is upsetting.
All right, I'm gonna have to separate the two of you.
Hmm!
And you will have to find a new seat in the back.
[Scoffs]
Get to the back of the plane!
Ooh, that is so wrong!
Sit down, you limey bastard!
Steady on!
Oh, shut up, you pommy cock.
That's the British!
I'm Australian, you bloody racist!
That's not racism.
That's bigotry.
Shut up, Steve!
Australia's a nationality.
Shut up, Steve!
No way.
What?
You know her.
She took care of you.
And I need to get out of that damn place.
I want out real bad.
They blame me for the boys escaping.
No.
Mom, I hate the way she cleans my... - what, your taint?
Yes, my taint.
What are you talking like that for?
I thought I raised you better.
She said it first!
Yeah, well, she's a professional.
I'm going to piss myself.
I understand that you collect porcelain dolls.
Yes, I do.
I just love those.
You do?
!
Yeah, they're some of my favorite things.
[Urinating]
Oh, they're mine, too.
Hey, do you have any idea how hard it is to pee while you stand around talking about those creepy-ass dolls?
It's your mama and me, son.
She carried you for nine months.
She was ripped from her "v" to her "a."
She done seen your little pee-pee, and I've been washing your taint for longer than I care to remember.
So I suggest that you relax about that shit right now.
Mom?
Hmm?
Can I talk to you alone for a second?
Yeah.
Can we just have a second?
Mmhmm.
What is wrong with you?
She's great!
I love her!
She just wants the job!
She probably hates porcelain dolls.
And as for what's wrong with me, it's you, because you're always trying to control me, not letting me be a guy!
You make it like everything that happens, it's the end of the world, like I'm an ax murderer killing children!
Let me live, woman!
I kept you alive all these years.
They're gonna kill you.
No, you're going to kill me by trying to control me.
This is roxy!
She makes me happy.
Hi.
[High-pitched] Hi!
[Deep voice] Roxy the therapy dog.
So much roxy.
[Sighs]
[Normal voice] I'm sorry about everything.
You're looking great.
Middle seat.
No armrest here, dickhead.
[All murmuring]
Get to your seat now.
He's in that seat that folds down with the seatbelt overtop like he's stuck in a go-kart.
And the old bitch is in the toilet.
She's got nowhere to sit, and... hey.
Guess you have to sit here if he's sitting there.
Hey, aren't you Jim jefferies?
Yeah, man.
How you doing?
I'm good.
Hey, I had no idea you were gay.
Yeah.
Love cock.
It's a big one for me.
Love the cocks.
As many as I can get.
Little dogs?
Thank you.
Little dogs with bows.
Is that your boyfriend?
Which one are we looking.
...Still feeling nervous?
[Chuckles]
We're married.
Hey, man.
That's cool.
I just want to tell you I'm sorry.
I was in the wrong, and I said some things that I didn't mean, and I'm sorry.
I was angry at my girlfriend, and I took it out on you, and it was wrong.
Thank you.
I actually like you people.
I do... gays, not blacks.
Not that I dislike blacks.
Who would dislike...
I think you should be able to get married.
Once again, gays, not blacks.
Black people can get married.
They can in Australia.
We're very tolerant of you people... gays and blacks.
We like... we don't have many blacks.
Lots of gays.
But we like them both.
Anyway, I believe that gay people should get married, because I believe that gay people should have equal rights, have the same level of misery as the rest of us.
Why should gay people be able to have a relationship and keep all their money, eh, don't have to get lawyers involved?
So, to reiterate, I'm sorry.
[Scoffs]
Have you got anything you want to say to me?
No.
Why should I?
Well, you did say I was fat, and it hurt.
Unless that's what you're into.
Do you like fat, white guys, like, sexually?
Is that a thing?
You know, like how black heterosexual guys like white, fat, blond chicks?
Because it would be good if you did, 'cause it would really make me feel better.
Hey, Jimmy.
Just standing, listening to this bigoted, racist asshole Australian.
Yes, I do like the accent.
I'm in town for a few hours.
Want to hook up?
Cool.
I'll be right there.
Did you see that?
Yeah, he called you a racist, bigoted asshole.
No, not that.
He just rang up the only gay guy in Omaha and got himself sex for, like, in 30 minutes time.
Of course.
These people.
Gays, not blacks.
Right.
Hello, penny?
Peggy.
Peggy.
Hi, it's Jim.
I've been thinking about things.
Look, I'm gonna be back in a couple of days, and I think it'd be great if we could get together and just lay in bed all day and just... you're still angry about the dinner?
Peggy?
That's Penny for you.
♪ Ready or not, Omaha, Nebraska, 'cause here we come ♪
Bianca?
Hi.
I'm in Omaha.
Yeah, it's Jim Jefferies...
you think she would have been able to tell just from my accent.
Okay, let's just say I've done everything that you said I'm doing.
How long should I be punished for this?
What is the statute... - until you realize that you're wrong.
Thank you.
Don't worry about it.
It's fine.
Oh, you're very quick to give up on that, weren't you?
What is that supposed to mean?
Well, we're having this argument.
It's gonna go on for weeks.
But when it comes to the check, don't worry about it.
Old Jim will pay for it.
Oh, that's fair.
Yeah.
How much do drinks cost here, or anywhere?
I don't know, Jim.
I don't.
Sorry.
Hi.
How are you?
Hi.
Good, thank you.
Eating alone?
Yeah.
It's fun, isn't it?
Yeah.
How much do drinks cost here?
Well, drinks are $6.
Call drinks are $8.
And...
How much is a beer?
A draft is $5.
A draft is $5, Peggy.
It's $5 for a draft.
Would you like one?
No.
Are you paying?
Of course.
I would love one!
All right.
Thank you so much.
You're so welcome.
See, she knows how much drinks cost because she's what they call "unattractive."
You're not.
You've never bought a drink in your entire life!
This is why I'd love to be gay.
Oh, it would suit me.
I wouldn't enjoy the sex at first, but I'd muscle through it...
I'm a trooper.
I'd have it in my mouth.
Tears would be streaming down my face, but it'd all be worth it, just so I could split the occasional bill.
That's why lesbians are so bloody angry... neither of them know who's gonna pay.
One of them's sitting there thinking, "well, I put the effort in."
I've shaved my head.
I've got a brand-new plaid shirt.
"She better treat me like a princess."
Yep, you're an asshole.
Why do they always look like men if they hate us so much?
You never see a Jew dressed as a Nazi!
Hi.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Awkward.
You two are splitting the bill, right?
Yeah.
Good for you.
Civilized.
It's very hard to keep your anger in.
I don't think I'm yelling, you know?
I'll be having a discussion with a girl, and I'll say, "look, I"
don't agree with you."
And then she'll be, "stop yelling at me!"
I'll be, "I'm not yelling!"
And then, all of a sudden, of course you're yelling.
And then she looks at you like you're a murderer or acting like a child or someone who's killing a child.
Oh, it's a woman's world, mate.
I think I'd prefer to be gay.
You know?
But I could never have the sex, never enjoy that.
Therein lies the rub, so to speak.
Could never have sex with something I respect.
That joke kills onstage.
Hey, Jim, are you gonna bring a suit?
It's Omaha.
Are there nice places there?
It's Omaha.
Hey, Steve, don't forget the k-y.
That's funny.
We don't even use it anymore.
Beginning of the relationship, we did... he was very tender.
Jim, please stop, all right?
You know I have a thing about sharing a room.
And flying.
You have a problem with everything, Steve.
He's afraid to fly.
Seriously, I've been on more flights than he has.
When you fly, do you go economy or cargo?
Cargo.
That's nice.
Steve, you didn't tell me you sucked at flying, as well.
Where's my damn floss?
Billy, did you take my floss?
You're going mad, Steve!
Billy didn't take your floss.
How could he?
How do you get like this?
Hey, mom!
We're watching "hoarders."
Shut up.
I had to stop by and pick up your damn pain medication, and then your father was telling me a story that I'd heard a thousand times before.
Which story?
Oh, I don't know.
One with a tent?
Is that a hoarder reference?
It's surprisingly nice of you to take Steve to the show.
Steve, you guys need to go to the airport, okay?
Steve!
This is disgusting!
It's like a health hazard in here!
Oh, come on, mom.
Nobody can live at your house.
And why are you, of all people, cleaning?
Shut up!
Will you both just stop it?
!
Jim, are you ready?
I'm ready.
Is this old food?
Oh, Steve, this is disgusting!
Look at this!
No wanking near me, Steve.
There will be no drugs or hookers.
Janice, it's Omaha.
I've called...
they're both busy.
You are so sick.
We flew to San Francisco once.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And I threw up the whole way.
And he screamed, "we're gonna crash!
We're gonna die!"
I love this story, too.
You're being picked on by a 110-pound man in a wheelchair.
He was nervous.
I gave up my room for you, you little shit.
Okay, just go.
Just go.
Give me a kiss.
Go, go.
Get out.
Both of you, get out.
Bye, Steve!
Don't forget to crash and die!
I won't Billy.
Don't forget to have mom wash your balls for you!
You're gonna burn.
Stop it!
This one's shorter.
Trust me.
Your jacket, sir.
I'm gonna wear it on the plane, though.
All jackets must be removed, sir.
Okay.
Proceed.
Step back, please.
Belt?
Oh, sorry.
Hey, mom!
I got to pee.
You don't have to pee, Billy!
You peed 10 minutes ago.
What are you doing?
I'm cleaning!
Yes, I know that, mother.
But why?
Why?
Yes.
Because these boys are inadequate to take care of you, and I can't keep coming over to do this.
So, um, we are going to hire and interview help today.
What?
Yeah!
Mm-hmm.
We are going to get a home-care nurse for you.
No, we're not!
Is this your bag, sir?
Yes.
Bag check.
What?
What's wrong with it?
They're all over 3 ounces.
Well, that's cough syrup.
Nope.
Yes, we are.
No, we're not!
Yes, we are!
No, we're not, mom.
Steve and Jim are doing fine.
They are not.
You want to leave the room, that's fine.
But we are hiring somebody today whether you like it or not.
Mom?
Yep?
You're a hoarder.
I am a collector, and there is a big, big difference.
Face scrub.
Nope.
Aftershave?
Nope.
That's shaving cream.
Nope.
That's just lotion for hands.
I only use it on my hands!
No.
It's a shampoo and conditioner in one.
Back and sides are very hard to manage.
Nope.
No, not that one.
That's for my tinea cruris.
Jock itch.
Yes.
Absolutely not.
Thank you, sir.
Have a wonderful flight.
Thank you.
Next, please.
Hey!
Hold it!
Drop the bag, sir.
Security?
What?
!
No, it's... it's...
I'm afraid you're gonna have to come with me.
Jim!
You're gonna be a while, Steve!
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Dead.
Dead.
Dead.
Eh, alive.
They cavity-searched me.
Who's a lucky boy, then?
Alive.
Dead.
What are you doing?
Playing the alive/dead game, Steve.
Stop it.
When the plane crashes and we're all living on a deserted island.
Oh, God.
You don't have to go as soon as they call.
If I don't go now, I'm never gonna go!
Steve?
What?
!
Dead.
You're such a dick.
Excuse me.
Oh, God.
Pardon me.
I have to get a...
excuse me.
There's no... excuse me.
I need to get past.
Mine's full, and I...
Excuse me.
I need to get through.
Excuse me.
What?
!
Can you hold her a sec?
No, I really can't.
She's a service dog.
What kind of service does she perform?
Therapy.
Really?
What kind of therapy?
Emotional.
I got it.
The dog is gonna have to go in its carrier under the seat.
It's not my dog.
It's mine, and it's a therapy dog.
Really?
That's what I said.
Wha... okay.
Help.
Steve, get out of my seat.
I got to look out the window, or else I'll get sick.
Here, please.
What's this?
It's supposed to be a therapy dog.
It's roxy!
Who's roxy?
She's a therapy dog to help your friend with his nerves, 'cause he's pretty keyed up.
She's very cute.
Thank you!
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
Hey, Steve?
Get out of my seat.
Can't.
Steve, get out of my seat.
What's the problem here?
This man is being very rude.
Your dog's not gonna help me get my seat!
Yes, he would.
Steve, get out of my seat.
Sir, please.
Just take the middle seat.
No, I booked this seat months ago!
This is my seat!
This man's sitting in my seat.
Give me my seat, Steve.
I can't!
He obviously cannot, so please, sir, please just take the middle seat.
Thank you.
Maybe you'll get lucky and no one sits in the aisle.
Steve, I haven't been on a plane for four years that hasn't been completely full.
God!
What are you doing?
!
I can't get comfortable!
I can't get comfortable!
Will you bring me a pillow?
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Also, I still have to pee.
Okay, well, hold it.
Okay.
You can pee later.
The doctor said that it is good to hold it in.
Mom, does this look comfortable?
Take the pillow away.
Oh, I can't get comfortable!
Don't think you're gonna go to the toilet whenever you want to.
Then what am I gonna do?
You're gonna sit there!
I wish they would just let you stay with me.
The state won't let me stay with you, mom... thank God.
Oh!
Our first candidate.
Try to look healthy.
That's never gonna happen.
What?
!
Come on.
Why can't I have a hot one?
Because you are not wheeling around in that wheelchair with an erection.
I've seen it.
It's offensive.
It's not offensive.
It's very disturbing.
It's magnificent.
All these people are dead.
The child's dead.
Please.
These people are dead.
I'm alive.
It's a desert island.
She's there, too.
We're eating you, Steve.
Hi.
There's only two more seats, and...
No.
Don't ever sit next to me, Steve.
Why can't I find a girl like that?
Maybe because you're an asshole?
You're right, you know.
That's what twiggy said to me.
Peggy.
Peggy said to me.
You know, when they always talk about movies, like, in the 1960s, whenever you see them, they always depict air stewardesses as being, like, these hot, young things with a pillbox hat and the hair and the perfect makeup and the perfect
eyes and the little waist and the great tits?
Yeah.
I don't think any of those women have retired.
Look at her!
50 years of recycled air have made her face drip off her skull like the end of "raiders of the lost ark."
Oh, Jim, please.
Cybil.
You just got lucky.
Uhoh.
Oh, my God.
Get out of my seat, Steve.
I can't.
I'm losing it here, Jim.
Swap seats with me, Steve.
I'm losing it.
Give it back to me, Steve.
I can't!
You want roxy now?
I really do.
Too late.
I think you're in my seat.
Yeah.
Will you hold this for me, please?
You're a dead man.
He's massive.
Ma'am, there's no room.
Whose backpack is this?
It's his.
Sir, you'll have to put your backpack under your seat.
I only bring a single one so I don't have to have anything under the seat!
Sir, put it in front of your seat.
This woman brought three and a dog!
Service animal.
Is there a problem?
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I have to pee.
You have to wait.
We're actively taxiing.
Why didn't you put your bagunder your seat?
This is my seat.
Sir, please, put your bag under your seat.
This is my seat.
I tried to explain to... - now.
Don't bother the man.
He's angry.
I am angry!
I have the middle seat!
Welcome to trans-voyage air flight 27, nonstop to Omaha, Nebraska.
This is a non-smoking flight.
What?
Wait.
I don't remember that memo.
Surely, you can't smoke in the airport, but you think you'd be able to smoke in a cylinder in the sky.
Oh, please, Jim.
Please pay attention.
This is for your safety, as well as the safety of everyone else on board.
It's very important that my instructions be carried out to the letter.
After all, everything I do, I do to ensure his safety.
Billy, pay attention.
This is about your safety.
I'm gonna pee my pants.
I've heard that for 30 years.
Did you see that?
Please, Jim, don't talk.
Don't cause a scene, please.
I think you are perfect.
Are you crazy?
!
No, she's not!
Yes!
I think I know what's best.
But I can't work weekends.
Oh, thank God.
And I don't think I want to work for you, anyway.
You're too angry.
Well, you'd be angry, too, if you had a mother like her.
And a rather magnificent but apparently offensive cock, and you couldn't jerk it off.
Bitch!
Just let it go, man.
It's just an armrest.
Yeah, but I'll just say, like, nicely, like, kindly, like, "excuse me, good sir, but you are taking my armrest."
No, you will not say, "kindly," "good sir," or,
"excuse me," or any of that!
Yeah, I am a lot nicer in my head.
Look, you can have mine.
Steve, I've already got yours.
I get both of them.
There's certain things that people should already know, all right... things like don't kill people, try not to rape.
When you're in an airplane, there's a thing called plane etiquette, and it goes like this...
window gets an armrest and a wall.
Middle gets two armrests.
Aisle gets an armrest and a little bit of extra leg.
We're not animals!
We live in a society!
It's not that big a deal.
Oh, it's all right for you, Steve.
We haven't all been pleasurably cavity-searched today.
I'm going for it.
I'm in.
I'm in.
Don't.
He's black.
He's also very gay.
Go.
What are you doing?
I got to do this, Steve.
He's been fighting for this armrest for 20 minutes, but now he's met the wall of Jim.
So why are you squashing me?
It's a principle thing, Steve.
Mommy, the lady man is being mean to the angry man.
Good.
Why are you such a...
Hey!
Mommy, what's a "can't"?
Did he just say the "c" word?
Yep, he dropped the c-bomb.
Oh, my God.
Excuse me?
What did you call me?
A Sir.
I called you a
Oh, grow up, the lot of you!
Now, I get it... it's not as popular a word as it should be in this country.
Hear, hear.
Thank you.
But in other countries, like the u.K., it's used... - all the time.
It's used in Shakespeare, chaucer.
It's the oldest expletive in the book.
Are you upset because you're trying to take my armrest?
Oh, here we go.
Your armrest?
Your armrest?
You don't know plane etiquette.
Window gets an armrest and a wall.
Middle gets two armrests.
Aisle gets an armrest and a little bit of extra leg.
We're not animals!
We live in a society!
He's got a point.
Sorry, man.
I didn't know.
Will you move your elbow?
I am only taking the back of the armrest.
You can have all the rest.
You take the back, you take the whole damn thing.
No one's ever gone, "thanks for the front of the armrest."
He's right about that, too.
Spot on.
And you're not just taking my armrest!
You're almost coming over the armrest, and it's digging into my ribcage.
Well, if someone lost a little weight...
- Oh, God.
He didn't say that!
Oh, this is gonna get good.
You bitchy queen.
How dare you?
Oh, piss off.
Isn't "bitch" a bad word?
Nowhere near as bad as that other word.
He's a very angry man.
I'm not angry!
This is a civil-rights thing.
I'm standing up for middle seats everywhere!
Yeah!
Sit down!
Oh, here she comes, without her Walker.
Shh!
What is the problem now?
I want this asshole away from me.
You know, there is no need for that kind of language.
This is the exact reason that that type of language was invented, all right?
We're both angry.
We're having a fight.
When do you swear?
He's right again.
I swear all the time.
Even I swear when I get upset.
All right, then.
There is no need for name-calling.
Thank you.
I didn't call him any names.
Yeah, you called him a bitchy queen.
Thank you.
I'm just trying to help.
You're not helping, Steve.
Yes, you are.
Listen, cybil.
Can I call you cybil?
No.
Cybil, you're right.
There is never a need for name-calling.
But... as a proud gay man myself, I feel like I've earned the right to say such words.
This liar's trying to take my armrest.
Oh, please.
Everyone knows that the middle seat gets both armrests.
Thank you, cybil.
We're not animals!
We live in a society!
Hear, hear.
But he's not gay!
Ah!
That is upsetting.
All right, I'm gonna have to separate the two of you.
Hmm!
And you will have to find a new seat in the back.
Get to the back of the plane!
Ooh, that is so wrong!
Sit down, you limey bastard!
Steady on!
Oh, shut up, you pommy cock.
That's the British!
I'm Australian, you bloody racist!
That's not racism.
That's bigotry.
Shut up, Steve!
Australia's a nationality.
Shut up, Steve!
No way.
What?
You know her.
She took care of you.
And I need to get out of that damn place.
I want out real bad.
They blame me for the boys escaping.
No.
Mom, I hate the way she cleans my... - what, your taint?
Yes, my taint.
What are you talking like that for?
I thought I raised you better.
She said it first!
Yeah, well, she's a professional.
I'm going to piss myself.
I understand that you collect porcelain dolls.
Yes, I do.
I just love those.
You do?
!
Yeah, they're some of my favorite things.
Oh, they're mine, too.
Hey, do you have any idea how hard it is to pee while you stand around talking about those creepy-ass dolls?
It's your mama and me, son.
She carried you for nine months.
She was ripped from her "v" to her "a."
She done seen your little pee-pee, and I've been washing your taint for longer than I care to remember.
So I suggest that you relax about that shit right now.
Mom?
Hmm?
Can I talk to you alone for a second?
Yeah.
Can we just have a second?
Mmhmm.
What is wrong with you?
She's great!
I love her!
She just wants the job!
She probably hates porcelain dolls.
And as for what's wrong with me, it's you, because you're always trying to control me, not letting me be a guy!
You make it like everything that happens, it's the end of the world, like I'm an ax murderer killing children!
Let me live, woman!
I kept you alive all these years.
They're gonna kill you.
No, you're going to kill me by trying to control me.
This is roxy!
She makes me happy.
Hi.
Hi!
Roxy the therapy dog.
So much roxy.
I'm sorry about everything.
You're looking great.
Middle seat.
No armrest here, dickhead.
Get to your seat now.
He's in that seat that folds down with the seatbelt overtop like he's stuck in a go-kart.
And the old bitch is in the toilet.
She's got nowhere to sit, and... hey.
Guess you have to sit here if he's sitting there.
Hey, aren't you Jim jefferies?
Yeah, man.
How you doing?
I'm good.
Hey, I had no idea you were gay.
Yeah.
Love cock.
It's a big one for me.
Love the cocks.
As many as I can get.
Little dogs?
Thank you.
Little dogs with bows.
Is that your boyfriend?
Which one are we looking.
...Still feeling nervous?
We're married.
Hey, man.
That's cool.
I just want to tell you I'm sorry.
I was in the wrong, and I said some things that I didn't mean, and I'm sorry.
I was angry at my girlfriend, and I took it out on you, and it was wrong.
Thank you.
I actually like you people.
I do... gays, not blacks.
Not that I dislike blacks.
Who would dislike...
I think you should be able to get married.
Once again, gays, not blacks.
Black people can get married.
They can in Australia.
We're very tolerant of you people... gays and blacks.
We like... we don't have many blacks.
Lots of gays.
But we like them both.
Anyway, I believe that gay people should get married, because I believe that gay people should have equal rights, have the same level of misery as the rest of us.
Why should gay people be able to have a relationship and keep all their money, eh, don't have to get lawyers involved?
So, to reiterate, I'm sorry.
Have you got anything you want to say to me?
No.
Why should I?
Well, you did say I was fat, and it hurt.
Unless that's what you're into.
Do you like fat, white guys, like, sexually?
Is that a thing?
You know, like how black heterosexual guys like white, fat, blond chicks?
Because it would be good if you did, 'cause it would really make me feel better.
Hey, Jimmy.
Just standing, listening to this bigoted, racist asshole Australian.
Yes, I do like the accent.
I'm in town for a few hours.
Want to hook up?
Cool.
I'll be right there.
Did you see that?
Yeah, he called you a racist, bigoted asshole.
No, not that.
He just rang up the only gay guy in Omaha and got himself sex for, like, in 30 minutes time.
Of course.
These people.
Gays, not blacks.
Right.
Hello, penny?

Great.
You can show Michael the perfect spot to put that Buddha in the yoga studio.

Well, on board the Andrea Doria was this, a case of McKinney 1947.
It was recovered from the wreck and holds enormous historical value.
Nineteen forty-seven is considered the finest year.
And these six bottles are the very last remaining of the 1947 vintage.
For scotch lovers, this is the Holy Grail.
It was held by one owner for decades, but was recently sold in private for an undisclosed amount.
Which I can disclose to you.
It went for over a million dollars.
- And you know this how?
- Because I know the man who bought it,
David Brown.
The David Brown?
The man who I pay $200 a month to for my cell phone?
I've known David personally since before he was a telecom billionaire.
Yesterday, David's wife Heather fell victim to a con artist.
That is not just any con artist.
That is Bridget Connoly.
She's been on my radar for ages.
Mine too.
She allegedly conned the president of Air Belgium into buying a Banff ski resort that doesn't exist.
I thought she worked with a partner.
Gone solo, according to latest intel.
Point is, she's good.
No one's ever gotten close enough to arrest her.
Not yet.
My husband, he's quite the avid collector of rare vintages.
The '47 is about as rare as they come.
How did you guys acquire it?
Private sale.
Our broker, Tina, knew the original owner, who has since passed on.
- Strange old man.
- Strange how?
Well, he kept warning David that if he bought the '47, he'd have to guard it
- from this man who was obsessed with it.
- Did you get his name?
No, but he said he was really bad news.
Maybe he was working with Sandra.
- How long did you knew her?
- About a month.
And I must say, she didn't seem like a con artist.
The good ones usually don't.
But my connection with her was real.
At least it felt real.
And I love the things she bought for my house.
They were all perfect.
Perfectly fake, as it turns out.
She blanked out all of the cameras, so we can't actually see how she got the case out of the house.
Well, I had complained to her about an old trunk of my husband's.
She had her mover take it away for me.
Did you get his name?
Michael or Mickey, I think.
I didn't get a last name.
- What about the truck?
- Just a regular old truck, no markings that I can recall.
But he must have been in on it with her.
How could I have been so stupid?
Well, even smart women get conned sometimes.
(Elevator ding)
Hey.
What's our status?
We've got some units out looking for Bridget Connoly.
- Still nothing.
- OK, what about her vehicle?
We got her plates from a security camera.
They were stolen from a car parked at the airport long-term parking.
No reports of a stolen Mercedes.
We'll have Dev check in with the luxury car rental companies.
How'd it go with Heather Brown?
Well, she said something about the original owner's warning about someone obsessed with the '47.
Think this guy could be connected?
Could be.
I have to admit, I feel kinda bad for Heather.
- You do?
Come on.
- Yeah.
She got taken in.
Come on.
You've gotta give it to Bridget, though.
Give her a little bit of a hand.
What she did took some skill.
- If you think lying is a skill.
- Everybody lies, but a conman lies with sophistication.
My dad always said don't trust anyone who lies for a living.
I got something on Bridget's accomplice.
His name is Mickey Asano.
He's the owner and operator of Asano Movers.
- How did you find him?
- It was easy.
I just pulled his plate up off the security camera feed.
Maybe too easy.
- Sure, I know her.
It's Sandra Woodson.
- Real name's Bridget Connoly.
And you helped her carry out a million dollars' worth of product yesterday.
Whoa, hold on.
All I did was move some furniture in and out.
I don't know anything about stolen product.
Where's the trunk that you helped her carry out?
- It's gone.
She came by and picked it up.
- What time?
She was waiting for me this morning when I got in, right at nine.
Thank you.
He has no idea he was part of a con.
So, the scotch is gone and we're back to square one.
I wouldn't say that.
She rented a Mercedes 350 from YYZ Luxury Car Rentals on Airport Road under the name Julia Cohen.
But wait, there's more.
She traded it in for a black Escalade.
Way to steal my thunder.
Yeah, the manager told me that
- this morning.
- OK.
But to rent from the same company using the same phony credentials?
I don't buy it.
She's smarter than that.
- After leaving Mickey, she headed north on the 427.
- Four twenty-seven?
There's cameras posted the whole way.
We can track her.
- I just need a timeline.
- She left around nine.
Nine.
All right, let's start around that mark.
Black Escalade, heading north.
- All right, this might be it.
Huh.
- Can you magnify it?
Yeah.
I think I can get the plate.
Got her.
It looks like she's getting off at Dixon.
There's a camera at Dixon and Airport Road.
OK, there she is.
She's turning into the parking lot at the Ventura Hotel.
- Let's pay her a visit.
- She'll be watching the doors.
So we get her outside.
The manager said one of the valets dinged my car.
Yeah, my partner's rolling it up right now.
- Where you headed, Bridget?
- My name's not Bridget, it's Chloe Robinson.
And that's not my car.
So, if we search this car, we're not gonna find anything incriminating?
What do we have here?
Looks like a few K in cash.
Multiple ID's.
It's not what it looks like.
I can explain everything.
Yeah, I'm sure you can, Bridget, and I'm sure not a word of it will be true.
So, Bridget... where'd you hide the scotch?
Do you have a buyer lined up?
(Bridget):
Shark's going to bite.
See, when we spoke to Heather Brown, she told us that a dangerous man wanted to buy the scotch, that he was like a shark.
Is he your buyer?
(Bridget):
They know about Tarkanian?
Because we know you've been talking to Tarkanian.
You're good.
Oh, you have no idea.
- Toby?
- Yeah.
A minute?
This is Andrei Tarkanian.
He's Armenian-Ukrainian.
Mercifully nicknamed The Shark.
Made his fortune in human trafficking in the early '90s and has since retired.
Yeah, I read his file.
He kidnapped hundreds of underage girls and pressed them into prostitution.
He is a repugnant human being and a prime target of INTERPOL, But he's also a man with appetites... women, wine, but especially fine scotch.
In my reads of Bridget, it looks like she's trying to hook up a deal with him.
Well, he'd be one hell of a big fish if we can net him.
- It would be a great career move.
- I'm not saying that.
I know, this would be a great bust.
It just means that we have to work with her, and I do not trust her at all.
You shouldn't.
She's a con artist.
But don't forget we have a secret weapon.
She's not gonna pull one over on us.
Right, Toby?
No pressure.
- No pressure.
- No pressure.
Bridget.
Let's get to know each other.
Nice photograph.
Your father ran out on you when you were an infant, and your mother raised you until her death.
You were... 16 years old?
You have the file;
you tell me.
Well, you were put into foster care, you ran away, and you were recruited by Jimmy "The Bricks" Foster.
Are you writing my biography, or do you want to talk about a deal?
Give us the location of the scotch, and I'll see what I can do about reducing your charges against you.
No.
Let's talk about what I want, then we can talk about what you want.
You have the floor.
You drop all the charges, and I walk away.
- I'll need further incentive.
- You want to catch The Shark,
I can help.
What exactly do you know about Tarkanian?
(Bridget):
More than he knows about me.
I've never dealt with the man personally, but I've dealt with people like him.
Well, I'm pretty sure that we can handle it.
Really?
He's never been caught by any law enforcement agency anywhere.
You can use all the help you can get.
All right.
You help us bring in Tarkanian, I'll let you skate the charges on the scotch.
All the other outstanding charges against you are still your problem.
Deal.
Tell us where the '47 is.
Trident Storage on Weston Road, Unit 517.
I'll draw up the papers.
It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
Our latest intelligence says that Tarkanian has bases in Buenos Aires, Capetown, and Toronto.
He puts up firewalls between himself and the rest of the world, and the only way to access him is through trusted middlemen such as this man,
Christian Dufrense.
He's a former appraiser at some of the top-end auction houses.
According to those in the know, if you want to sell to Tarkanian, Christian's the man to talk to.
And luckily he's not hard to find.
He owns a very high-end club called the Montgomery.
It's uber elite.
- Excuse me.
Hello?
- So, we go to Christian's club, we tell him we have the '47, and he leads us to Tarkanian.
- Simple.
Sounds like a plan.
- Except for the X factor.
I know Bridget is working another angle here.
Have you been able to read her?
Not much yet.
She has incredible control over her thoughts.
- She's tough to read?
- She is tough to read.
But it'll get easier.
I'll find the cracks.
Guys.
Very good news.
The scotch has been recovered.
It's on its way
- to lockup as we speak.
- Excellent.
Tell them to beef up security.
That's over a million dollars' worth of merchandise.
Yes, we wouldn't want your friend to lose his precious whiskey again.
- Scotch.
- Get to work.
So, from this point forward, you will be known as Sarah Watson.
We have worked up a back story for you,
- so please get to know it.
- Thanks.
I've done this before.
Nice watch.
You know it's fake, right?
Actually, it's authentic.
Sure it is.
OK.
Um, I will be working alongside you as Rochelle Lawrence.
What's our story?
Well, you and the lovely Rochelle here are high-end B E specialists.
We approach Tarkanian's man Christian at his club tonight, and we show him this to prove we have the goods.
Christian is an appraiser.
He needs actual product to appraise.
That's impossible.
Klein won't sign off on us using a bottle for a meet like this.
IIB has a forensic lab, right?
- Yeah.
- We need them to mock up an empty bottle of the '47.
Are they capable?
- The best in the country.
- Get them on it.
Now I'm going to tell you the play, and I want you to listen carefully, because I'm only gonna tell you once.
The mock-up bottle is called "the show".
We're gonna fill it with store-bought McKinney, 25 year.
We present the show tonight.
I draw and sample using a syringe.
I squirt the sample into a test tube.
I give Christian the test tube so he can do a gas chromatograph analysis.
What Christian doesn't know is that I've swapped the show scotch with a sample of the real '47 McKinney.
And how do we get our hands on the real sample?
We only need 10 mils.
Your boss is friends with the owner, right?
- How did you know that?
- I do my research.
Tell Brown that his precious '47 will never be safe with Tarkanian out there.
It's in his best interest to help us take him down.
OK, I'll ask Klein to speak with Brown.
(Bridget):
All according to the plan.
Oh, another thing.
If you can get your hands on Christian's cell phone and grab his SIM card, it'll help us; we can clone his phone.
But he'll see you pulling out the SIM card.
There's a better way to do it.
All you need to clone a cell is an ESN and MAC address.
This is yours.
What?
I palmed it while admiring your "authentic" watch.
A few keystrokes and I'd have all I need.
You play the game well.
Well, if you're not playing the game, the game's playing you.
Let you in on a little secret, though.
I'm done with it.
All of it.
I've heard that before.
Happens to be true.
I look at other people.
They have real jobs, real boyfriends.
I don't think I'll ever have that.
You're a smart girl.
You can get whatever you want.
Is that right?
Hey
I need you on op tonight with Dev.
Huh?
- Are you going to be ready?
- Yeah.
I'll be there.
All right, all right!
Who's ready for a frosty-cold game of NBA action and a down-to-the-wire back-and-forth beer?
I got that backwards.
Toby, where are you, bud?
- Hey.
I'm working tonight.
- Oh!
What are you, auditioning for Magic Mike 2?
- Undercover operation.
- OK, well, here's to your mission.
You know, seeing you all gussied up like that, I figured you had a date tonight.
- No, no.
- No?
I mean it's been a while since, uh...
- Tia left, yeah.
- Yeah.
Yes, I, uh, think about that night often... the look on her face.
You know, she said she needed time to think.
- It's been six weeks.
- Six weeks?
And she hasn't called or emailed?
Nothing?
No.
I know I'm not as good as you at reading signs, but I think it might be time to move on, my friend.
- No, I'm not ready to date.
- I'm not talking about dating, my brother.
I'm talking about a little rebound fling.
It's exactly what the doctor ordered.
There's this new nurse in the ER.
Her name is Kayla, which I believe is Gaelic for "lower back tattoo".
- Let me just get a little...
- What are you doing?
No, no, hey, come on!
There we go.
Snap a little picture, I'm gonna show Kayla.
Kayla.
Oh, nice navel ring, Kayla.
No, they're all yours.
Enjoy.
Hey, be safe tonight, bud.
- All right, have a good night.
- Expect a phone call.

Welcome to the Montgomery.
I'm Christian.
We know who you are.
Then you know I make it a point to get well acquainted with my clientele.
Especially ones so beautiful.
What are you ladies drinking tonight?
Scotch.
What's your best?
The McKinney, of course.
That's the best glass of scotch money can buy.
We have the 12, 16, or the 25 year.
There are better bottles available.
- If there are, I'm not aware.
- The 25 is the oldest you can buy off the rack, but there are much older, much finer vintages out there.
All held in private collections, last time I checked.
We might know about six bottles that have come onto the market recently.
Tell me more.
How's your naval history, Christian?
- Do I look like a history major?
- But you have heard of the Andrea Doria?
The '47 is in the open.
Find it.
In the back.

I'll need to take this with me.
Think we're going to let you walk out of here with $200,000 worth of our property?
I need to appraise the product before I take it to my employer.
You mean Tarkanian?
I don't use his name unless it's necessary.
Neither should you.
My apologies.
But we still can't let you walk out of here with our bottle.
No appraisal, no deal.
You can have 10mL... more than enough to do a gas chromatograph analysis.
Allow me.
You know what, actually, it's better if we do it.
- Do you have something to hide?
- Of course not.
All right.
All done.
I'll be in touch.
Christian, don't you want a taste?
A taste of what, exactly?
A taste of the '47.
Hm.
Mmm.
(He chuckles.)
How does it taste?
Like the McKinney.
Only the GC analysis can tell if it's the real thing.
It's the real thing.
That's my number.
Call me.
Don't forget.
(He chuckles.)
You did good.
Thanks to the ESN numbers acquired by our con-artist friend and a little bit of my own Kung Fu,
I was able to hack into Christian's cell phone.
Take a listen.
He left this message earlier.
(Christian):
It's me.
You were right.
It's in the open.
You know how to find me.
- That could be for anyone.
- Well, in my read,
I heard Tarkanian say, "It's in the open".
This message could be for him.
Can you trace it?
They used what's called a dead drop server.
It's the preferred method of communication of international bad guys and big-time drug dealers.
- It's totally untraceable.
- So, Tarkanian can check his messages anywhere anonymously.
Pretty much, yeah.
And I have no way of tracking him. (Cell phone ringing)
It's Christian.
- This is Rochelle.
Meet me tonight- 4025 Gray Avenue.
We'll talk numbers.
- Will your boss be there?
- What difference does it make?
We'll only talk numbers with him.
You should have told me this before.
- Well, I'm telling you now.
- Just be there by nine.
I need you to set up a surveillance team to 4025 Gray Avenue.
I'll set up an arrest team.
- OK, I'll work on a warrant.
- OK, I'm gonna have a chat
- with our friend Bridget.
- OK.
Wanna grab a coffee?
You know someplace good?
I do.
I thought you meant someplace fun.
Well, this coffee isn't bad, and it's free.
- Free is good.
- How do you take it?
- Black.
- Black?
Perfect.
Me too.
You know, I can still remember a time when I didn't know where my next meal was coming from.
This is you trying to get me to talk.
Just saying we have some things in common.
You spent time in group homes, and so did I.
It was an awful time.
I really don't like talking about it.
Yeah, me neither.
Just saying I get it.
We all have our wounds.
So, what happened to your partner, uh, James?
Jimmy.
Jimmy Foster.
He's in Mount Pleasant Cemetery now.
Oh.
I'm sorry to hear that.
How'd he die?
Aneurysm.
They did all they could.
He was my mentor.
Like a father.
Only you can do this.
It's the last one, and then you're out.
(Bridget sniffling)
So, was he the one who set up this score up for you?
He did, as a matter of fact.
He did business with Tarkanian.
He knew he'd pay dearly for the '47.
- What kind of business?
- I don't know.
He never even let me meet Tarkanian.
Why not?
He kept me at an arm's length from certain people.
People he didn't trust.
So, once we get this extra space, I mean, I'm going to be able to open
- all of this up.
- Wow.
- You know?
- It's beautiful.
I love it, man, I love, yeah.
So, what you gonna do with that spot over there?
- Uh, second-floor lounge.
- Yeah, about that...
I got a few ideas about what we could do with it.
- We?
- Well, I am an investor.
I just wanna make a room where people can hang out, have some drinks, do whatever they want.
It can't be anything that would jeopardize my licence.
You know that, right?
Look, Adam...
I can make this whole thing happen.
You're just gonna have to decide how badly you want it.
Hmm?
According to the M.E. report, James Foster died of multiple gunshot wounds.
The murder was never solved.
She said he died of an aneurysm.
- Yeah, well, she lied.
- Obviously.
- So, what's she hiding?
- That's the question, isn't it?
Jimmy told her to do this score from his death bed.
That's interesting, but what does it have to do with the case we're working?
I don't know, but I'll figure it out.
I love a good mystery.
Yeah, so do I when they look like her.
Yeah.
How's Toby?
Oh, he's the mayor of Mopesville.
Still totally hung up on Tia.
Yeah, well, he should be.
I mean, she's the best thing that ever happened to him.
And I know that she was crazy about him too.
Thanks, Nicky.
Yeah, but she bailed on him, right?
I mean, she hasn't so much as responded to an email in six weeks.
Because she's still figuring it all out.
I mean, if she didn't care about Toby at all, she'd email him right back.
The fact that she's completely ignoring Toby is a good thing?
- It means there's still hope.
- I will never understand women.
Just want you to know that.
Thank you.
♪ You showed me life was more than... ♪
Please come in.
It's just us?
Patience, Rochelle.
If you're angling for more money...
Oh, my finder's fee is adequate.
I just thought we'd get to know each other a bit better.
This is not happening.
You don't have to cross any lines;
Just dance around them.
I love your home, Christian.
- You have exquisite taste.
- Thank you.
I've always had an eye for beauty.
And I like what I see tonight.
You are very light on your feet.
And you, you're not.
Are you tense?
I'm just the kind of girl who likes to know what's gonna happen next.
I know what I'd like to have happen.
Patience, Christian.
You're going to make me wait?
Business first, and then we can play.
OK.
Get your coats.
(Dev):
All right, guys.
We're on the move.
We have to catch up.
If I follow, he'll know he has a tail.
You're right.
Let's circle the block.
All right, there they are.
Andrei, this is Rochelle and Sarah.
Christian told me you have something that interests me, if the price is right.
Well, there's no need to be coy.
Everyone knows that you're obsessed with the '47.
I've tested the sample.
It's authentic.
- Your price?
- It's worth a million, so we'll give it to you for a million and a half.
I should walk right now.
And miss your opportunity of getting your hands on the '47?
Seven hundred and fifty K.
Nine.
Done.
You've been awfully quiet.
- Problem?
- No.
Hey, don't you want to hear how we got hold of the '47?
It's one hell of a story.
Another time, perhaps.
But if you try to cross me, you'll become a story as well.
What's our status?
Waiting for Christian to set up the meet with Tarkanian.
Everything goes well, we will get him today.
Today is good, but last night would have been better.
He gave us the slip.
The guy's a pro.
That guy's been avoiding capture for over a decade.
Which begs the question, if he's so cautious, why expose yourself to capture only to walk away?
He wanted to sniff us out.
It's his thing.
Sounds like you've done business with him before.
What's your relationship with Tarkanian, exactly?
My partner did business with him.
I wasn't part of the transaction, I just saw it getting wrapped up.
So, hold on.
During this transaction with your partner, did he see you?
(Bridget):
Let me try this.
For a second, at most.
It's impossible he would remember me.
(Cell phone ringing) That's my phone.
Got it.
It's Christian.
This is Rochelle.
Bryer's Pier.
Half-an-hour.
- Bring the product.
- We'll be there.
We have to move now.
- Can I speak to you guys for a minute?
- Yeah.
There's a problem with my reads of Bridget.
All right, I've seen the same event with two different outcomes.
- I'm not sure I follow.
- When she first mentioned
Tarkanian, I read her and she was nowhere near him.
Just now I heard her think, "Let me try this", and then I saw a different version of the same event, where she was right beside him.
Also, she said that her partner Jimmy died of an aneurysm when he was actually shot to death.
- OK, so, what, you're reading her lies?
- Yeah, it feels like that.
- I thought you could only read the truth.
- I've encountered a lot of unusual minds, but, uh, this is a new one.
I read an article once about MRI tests on pathological liars.
Apparently they actually see the lies they tell.
- Yeah, it feels like that.
- Toby Logan, meet your Kryptonite.
I think we should reassess this meet.
I don't like
- what you're walking into.
- It's fine, I'll be fine.
Michelle, I just...
This could be our only shot to get to Tarkanian.
- Michelle, let's go, it's time.
- Yeah.
All right, go.
But for God's sakes, be careful.
You stay behind and you sweat Bridget.
Figure out what she's up to.
All right, I'll bring my A game.
I didn't know you liked it rough.
This is not a game, Bridget.
I thought we were good.
I thought we had a connection.
You've been playing some kind of angle this whole time.
I need to know what it is.
You really think I have some kind of secret agenda?
You all played your parts.
I do.
And somehow we all fit into it.
You took advantage of us;
you made the IIB work for you.
Or is this all a part of your plan?
To get arrested?
You think I like this?
What really happened between Tarkanian and Jimmy?
I don't know.
He wanted you to do this score on his deathbed.
Why?
That's between me and him.
Jimmy didn't die of an aneurysm.
You lied to me.
That's why we don't have a connection.
I'm not gonna talk about Jimmy.
You don't have to.
You're the only one who can do it.
- The last score, then you're out.
- Daddy.
He wasn't your mentor.
He wasn't your partner.
He was your father.
So, what happened?
He came back after your mother died?
Took you under his wing?
So, you got me all figured out.
Satisfied?
You were there when he died.
You want revenge on Tarkanian.
So, what's the next move, Bridget?
(Bridget):
Tell Tarkanian I can make a better deal, just him and me alone.
Got it.
She's been in contact with Tarkanian behind our backs.
We need to get Michelle out of there.
Where's your partner?
With the product, waiting for my signal.
- Mm.
- Where's Tarkanian?
He sends his regrets.
(Police siren)
Michelle.
Are you good?
- You OK?
- Yeah, I will be, once someone tells me what the hell is going on.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Bridget escaped.
- IIB's under lockdown.
- What's her endgame?
Revenge.
Tarkanian killed Jimmy Foster, who was her father, by the way.
I spoke with the evidence locker guards at IIB.
No sign of Bridget,
- but the McKinney is still there.
- OK, let's double up on security.
- Let's talk to Christian.
- Yeah.
Save your breath.
My lawyer will be here any second.
Well, I hope you have a good one, because a pretty man like yourself is gonna make a lot of friends in jail.
Why did Tarkanian send you to kill me?
He wanted you dealt with.
You and your so-called partner.
She thinks she could pull one over on Tarkanian, but... she can't fool him.
What did he find out?
You think I'm going to tell you?
- How could you miss that?
- I checked her record myself.
It was fixed!
I'll fix it myself!
Tarkanian wants to kill her.
How's he gonna do it?
He said he'll meet with you today, at the club.
We gotta get to the Montgomery.
So, you decided to cut out your partner.
Just looking out for number one.
I know a little bit about looking after number one.
So, this was about getting
- to Tarkanian.
- Mmhmm.
She played us perfectly.
She needed our help, so she got herself caught.
Think of all the bread crumbs...
Mickey, the rental car...
Why would she want to get caught?
We helped her get past Christian.
We gave her a new identity, we fixed her records, we helped her pass Christian's
- security checks.
- And what about Tarkanian?
Like Christian said, you can't fool The Shark.
Somehow he found out we fixed her records.
So, she's walking into a trap.
I have a car waiting.
I get into a car with you, and I'm never coming back.
Just like Jimmy.
Open that case, right now.
(Explosion) Ah!
Please.
I'll give you whatever you want.
You've already taken the only thing that mattered to me.
Please.
Relax.
Put your gun down.
(Two gunshots)
(Body hitting the ground)
(Michelle):
How's the bodyguard?
He was rushed to St. Mike's.
Concussion, powder burns, but he's gonna be all right.
The proverbial smoking gun.
She left us with a living witness and a gun with her prints on it.
She wants us to know she did it.
Hey.
I have coordinated with Metro, they've got
- every available unit looking.
- Border Services?
Every airport and checkpoint has her photo.
She's not gonna get very far.
She's been red-flagged.
Come on, this is Bridget we're talking about.
We're never gonna see her again.
You look happy.
Because I just received a call of kudos from the upper brass, seeing how I just closed the case on Tarkanian.
YOU closed the case on Tarkanian?
I gave credit to the whole team, of course.
Of course.
Never trust anyone who lies for a living.

- Her advice:
Call Tia.
Tell her that she can take as much time as she needs, and when she's ready to come back, you'll be there for her.
K, I thought I'm supposed to move on.
No, no no.
See, you don't move on from a girl like Tia.
You dig in and you fight for her.
Good night, my friend.

Tia.
Uh, it's Toby.
This is a Qum rug, made from Persian silk, the most beautiful fibers in the world;
Also the most expensive.
I love it.
It's so rich and warm.
Now, there is one more piece that I saw and thought, "Heather just has to have this".
The Buddha.
- From the Thai highlands.
- For my yoga studio.
You know how much I love my practice.
Let's have Michael bring it downstairs.
And I want you to take a look at these wall colours.
Great.
You can show Michael the perfect spot to put that Buddha in the yoga studio.
Oh.
This old chest.
Didn't you want to get rid of it?
More than you know.
I'll have Michael take it to the dump.
You're an angel.
Thank you.
I need to grab my notepad.
You guys go ahead.
And don't forget to pick a colour.
Follow me.
I need to talk to you.
Rock Clay, or Burnt Sienna?
Burnt Sienna all the way.
Thanks again, Sandra.
It was my pleasure.
- I'll see you at yoga?
- Oh, yes.
The Listener 04x10 The Long Con Original Air Date August 7,2013
Here.
Thank you.
Hey.
Hey.
What're you so smiley about?
Maybe it's just that new sexy hairdo of yours.
No.
What's going on?
OK, I was gonna save it as a surprise, but you know the panini shop beside the club?
- Yeah.
- It's up for sale.
- That's my surprise?
- Yeah, that's your surprise, all right?
I know.
But just think about it.
All that square footage, right?
It's right there, it's beside the club.
Faisal and I, we've become friends.
He's gonna give it to me at a good deal.
OK.
Um...
Wow.
I mean, that's...
- that's just a lot, right?
- Yeah.
It is a lot.
But I found an investor.
A friend of a friend.
Apparently he's a good guy.
Jerry Gaines.
OK, so, this is happening?
This is moving really fast.
An opportunity like this comes up, you gotta go for it, right?
I can put in a VIP lounge, a second bar.
Really take it to the next level, Mich.
OK, no, you're right.
This is exciting.
It is.
I just, I mean, are you sure you want to take on more debt
- right now?
- I think I have to, you know?
To stay competitive with the downtown clubs,
I gotta, I gotta step it up.
I think it'll be good.
What do you think?
- OK.
- Yeah?
Yeah, I'm behind you a hundred percent.
That's why I love you.
Come on in, kids.
Sharpen your pencils and open your notebooks, 'cause we're starting the day off with a history lesson.
Who can tell me what this is?
- I needed a change, OK?
- I think it looks great.
- Very pretty.
- Thank you.
- Guys?
- That's the Andrea Doria.
Sank off the coast of Massachusetts in, uh... what, '54?
Fifty-six.
Very close.
Gold star for him.
With more than 50 dead, it remains the worst naval disaster in US waters.
Can anyone tell me what... this is?
I think I can help here.
This is McKinney single malt scotch whiskey, the pride of Scotland.
And I can personally vouch for its excellence.
So, what does the pride of Scotland have to do with Andrea Doria?
Well, on board the Andrea Doria was this, a case of McKinney 1947.
It was recovered from the wreck and holds enormous historical value.
Nineteen forty-seven is considered the finest year.
And these six bottles are the very last remaining of the 1947 vintage.
For scotch lovers, this is the Holy Grail.
It was held by one owner for decades, but was recently sold in private for an undisclosed amount.
Which I can disclose to you.
It went for over a million dollars.
- And you know this how?
- Because I know the man who bought it,
David Brown.
The David Brown?
The man who I pay $200 a month to for my cell phone?
I've known David personally since before he was a telecom billionaire.
Yesterday, David's wife Heather fell victim to a con artist.
That is not just any con artist.
That is Bridget Connoly.
She's been on my radar for ages.
Mine too.
She allegedly conned the president of Air Belgium into buying a Banff ski resort that doesn't exist.
I thought she worked with a partner.
Gone solo, according to latest intel.
Point is, she's good.
No one's ever gotten close enough to arrest her.
Not yet.
My husband, he's quite the avid collector of rare vintages.
The '47 is about as rare as they come.
How did you guys acquire it?
Private sale.
Our broker, Tina, knew the original owner, who has since passed on.
- Strange old man.
- Strange how?
Well, he kept warning David that if he bought the '47, he'd have to guard it
- from this man who was obsessed with it.
- Did you get his name?
No, but he said he was really bad news.
Maybe he was working with Sandra.
- How long did you knew her?
- About a month.
And I must say, she didn't seem like a con artist.
The good ones usually don't.
But my connection with her was real.
At least it felt real.
And I love the things she bought for my house.
They were all perfect.
Perfectly fake, as it turns out.
She blanked out all of the cameras, so we can't actually see how she got the case out of the house.
Well, I had complained to her about an old trunk of my husband's.
She had her mover take it away for me.
Did you get his name?
Michael or Mickey, I think.
I didn't get a last name.
- What about the truck?
- Just a regular old truck, no markings that I can recall.
But he must have been in on it with her.
How could I have been so stupid?
Well, even smart women get conned sometimes.
Hey.
What's our status?
We've got some units out looking for Bridget Connoly.
- Still nothing.
- OK, what about her vehicle?
We got her plates from a security camera.
They were stolen from a car parked at the airport long-term parking.
No reports of a stolen Mercedes.
We'll have Dev check in with the luxury car rental companies.
How'd it go with Heather Brown?
Well, she said something about the original owner's warning about someone obsessed with the '47.
Think this guy could be connected?
Could be.
I have to admit, I feel kinda bad for Heather.
- You do?
Come on.
- Yeah.
She got taken in.
Come on.
You've gotta give it to Bridget, though.
Give her a little bit of a hand.
What she did took some skill.
- If you think lying is a skill.
- Everybody lies, but a conman lies with sophistication.
My dad always said don't trust anyone who lies for a living.
I got something on Bridget's accomplice.
His name is Mickey Asano.
He's the owner and operator of Asano Movers.
- How did you find him?
- It was easy.
I just pulled his plate up off the security camera feed.
Maybe too easy.
- Sure, I know her.
It's Sandra Woodson.
- Real name's Bridget Connoly.
And you helped her carry out a million dollars' worth of product yesterday.
Whoa, hold on.
All I did was move some furniture in and out.
I don't know anything about stolen product.
Where's the trunk that you helped her carry out?
- It's gone.
She came by and picked it up.
- What time?
She was waiting for me this morning when I got in, right at nine.
Thank you.
He has no idea he was part of a con.
So, the scotch is gone and we're back to square one.
I wouldn't say that.
She rented a Mercedes 350 from YYZ Luxury Car Rentals on Airport Road under the name Julia Cohen.
But wait, there's more.
She traded it in for a black Escalade.
Way to steal my thunder.
Yeah, the manager told me that
- this morning.
- OK.
But to rent from the same company using the same phony credentials?
I don't buy it.
She's smarter than that.
- After leaving Mickey, she headed north on the 427.
- Four twenty-seven?
There's cameras posted the whole way.
We can track her.
- I just need a timeline.
- She left around nine.
Nine.
All right, let's start around that mark.
Black Escalade, heading north.
- All right, this might be it.
Huh.
- Can you magnify it?
Yeah.
I think I can get the plate.
Got her.
It looks like she's getting off at Dixon.
There's a camera at Dixon and Airport Road.
OK, there she is.
She's turning into the parking lot at the Ventura Hotel.
- Let's pay her a visit.
- She'll be watching the doors.
So we get her outside.
The manager said one of the valets dinged my car.
Yeah, my partner's rolling it up right now.
- Where you headed, Bridget?
- My name's not Bridget, it's Chloe Robinson.
And that's not my car.
So, if we search this car, we're not gonna find anything incriminating?
What do we have here?
Looks like a few K in cash.
Multiple ID's.
It's not what it looks like.
I can explain everything.
Yeah, I'm sure you can, Bridget, and I'm sure not a word of it will be true.
So, Bridget... where'd you hide the scotch?
Do you have a buyer lined up?
Shark's going to bite.
See, when we spoke to Heather Brown, she told us that a dangerous man wanted to buy the scotch, that he was like a shark.
Is he your buyer?
They know about Tarkanian?
Because we know you've been talking to Tarkanian.
You're good.
Oh, you have no idea.
- Toby?
- Yeah.
A minute?
This is Andrei Tarkanian.
He's Armenian-Ukrainian.
Mercifully nicknamed The Shark.
Made his fortune in human trafficking in the early '90s and has since retired.
Yeah, I read his file.
He kidnapped hundreds of underage girls and pressed them into prostitution.
He is a repugnant human being and a prime target of INTERPOL, But he's also a man with appetites... women, wine, but especially fine scotch.
In my reads of Bridget, it looks like she's trying to hook up a deal with him.
Well, he'd be one hell of a big fish if we can net him.
- It would be a great career move.
- I'm not saying that.
I know, this would be a great bust.
It just means that we have to work with her, and I do not trust her at all.
You shouldn't.
She's a con artist.
But don't forget we have a secret weapon.
She's not gonna pull one over on us.
Right, Toby?
No pressure.
- No pressure.
- No pressure.
Bridget.
Let's get to know each other.
Nice photograph.
Your father ran out on you when you were an infant, and your mother raised you until her death.
You were... 16 years old?
You have the file;
you tell me.
Well, you were put into foster care, you ran away, and you were recruited by Jimmy "The Bricks" Foster.
Are you writing my biography, or do you want to talk about a deal?
Give us the location of the scotch, and I'll see what I can do about reducing your charges against you.
No.
Let's talk about what I want, then we can talk about what you want.
You have the floor.
You drop all the charges, and I walk away.
- I'll need further incentive.
- You want to catch The Shark,
I can help.
What exactly do you know about Tarkanian?
More than he knows about me.
I've never dealt with the man personally, but I've dealt with people like him.
Well, I'm pretty sure that we can handle it.
Really?
He's never been caught by any law enforcement agency anywhere.
You can use all the help you can get.
All right.
You help us bring in Tarkanian, I'll let you skate the charges on the scotch.
All the other outstanding charges against you are still your problem.
Deal.
Tell us where the '47 is.
Trident Storage on Weston Road, Unit 517.
I'll draw up the papers.
It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
Our latest intelligence says that Tarkanian has bases in Buenos Aires, Capetown, and Toronto.
He puts up firewalls between himself and the rest of the world, and the only way to access him is through trusted middlemen such as this man,
Christian Dufrense.
He's a former appraiser at some of the top-end auction houses.
According to those in the know, if you want to sell to Tarkanian, Christian's the man to talk to.
And luckily he's not hard to find.
He owns a very high-end club called the Montgomery.
It's uber elite.
- Excuse me.
Hello?
- So, we go to Christian's club, we tell him we have the '47, and he leads us to Tarkanian.
- Simple.
Sounds like a plan.
- Except for the X factor.
I know Bridget is working another angle here.
Have you been able to read her?
Not much yet.
She has incredible control over her thoughts.
- She's tough to read?
- She is tough to read.
But it'll get easier.
I'll find the cracks.
Guys.
Very good news.
The scotch has been recovered.
It's on its way
- to lockup as we speak.
- Excellent.
Tell them to beef up security.
That's over a million dollars' worth of merchandise.
Yes, we wouldn't want your friend to lose his precious whiskey again.
- Scotch.
- Get to work.
So, from this point forward, you will be known as Sarah Watson.
We have worked up a back story for you,
- so please get to know it.
- Thanks.
I've done this before.
Nice watch.
You know it's fake, right?
Actually, it's authentic.
Sure it is.
OK.
Um, I will be working alongside you as Rochelle Lawrence.
What's our story?
Well, you and the lovely Rochelle here are high-end B E specialists.
We approach Tarkanian's man Christian at his club tonight, and we show him this to prove we have the goods.
Christian is an appraiser.
He needs actual product to appraise.
That's impossible.
Klein won't sign off on us using a bottle for a meet like this.
IIB has a forensic lab, right?
- Yeah.
- We need them to mock up an empty bottle of the '47.
Are they capable?
- The best in the country.
- Get them on it.
Now I'm going to tell you the play, and I want you to listen carefully, because I'm only gonna tell you once.
The mock-up bottle is called "the show".
We're gonna fill it with store-bought McKinney, 25 year.
We present the show tonight.
I draw and sample using a syringe.
I squirt the sample into a test tube.
I give Christian the test tube so he can do a gas chromatograph analysis.
What Christian doesn't know is that I've swapped the show scotch with a sample of the real '47 McKinney.
And how do we get our hands on the real sample?
We only need 10 mils.
Your boss is friends with the owner, right?
- How did you know that?
- I do my research.
Tell Brown that his precious '47 will never be safe with Tarkanian out there.
It's in his best interest to help us take him down.
OK, I'll ask Klein to speak with Brown.
All according to the plan.
Oh, another thing.
If you can get your hands on Christian's cell phone and grab his SIM card, it'll help us; we can clone his phone.
But he'll see you pulling out the SIM card.
There's a better way to do it.
All you need to clone a cell is an ESN and MAC address.
This is yours.
What?
I palmed it while admiring your "authentic" watch.
A few keystrokes and I'd have all I need.
You play the game well.
Well, if you're not playing the game, the game's playing you.
Let you in on a little secret, though.
I'm done with it.
All of it.
I've heard that before.
Happens to be true.
I look at other people.
They have real jobs, real boyfriends.
I don't think I'll ever have that.
You're a smart girl.
You can get whatever you want.
Is that right?
Hey
I need you on op tonight with Dev.
Huh?
- Are you going to be ready?
- Yeah.
I'll be there.
All right, all right!
Who's ready for a frosty-cold game of NBA action and a down-to-the-wire back-and-forth beer?
I got that backwards.
Toby, where are you, bud?
- Hey.
I'm working tonight.
- Oh!
What are you, auditioning for Magic Mike 2?
- Undercover operation.
- OK, well, here's to your mission.
You know, seeing you all gussied up like that, I figured you had a date tonight.
- No, no.
- No?
I mean it's been a while since, uh...
- Tia left, yeah.
- Yeah.
Yes, I, uh, think about that night often... the look on her face.
You know, she said she needed time to think.
- It's been six weeks.
- Six weeks?
And she hasn't called or emailed?
Nothing?
No.
I know I'm not as good as you at reading signs, but I think it might be time to move on, my friend.
- No, I'm not ready to date.
- I'm not talking about dating, my brother.
I'm talking about a little rebound fling.
It's exactly what the doctor ordered.
There's this new nurse in the ER.
Her name is Kayla, which I believe is Gaelic for "lower back tattoo".
- Let me just get a little...
- What are you doing?
No, no, hey, come on!
There we go.
Snap a little picture, I'm gonna show Kayla.
Kayla.
Oh, nice navel ring, Kayla.
No, they're all yours.
Enjoy.
Hey, be safe tonight, bud.
- All right, have a good night.
- Expect a phone call.

I'm Christian.
We know who you are.
Then you know I make it a point to get well acquainted with my clientele.
Especially ones so beautiful.
What are you ladies drinking tonight?
Scotch.
What's your best?
The McKinney, of course.
That's the best glass of scotch money can buy.
We have the 12, 16, or the 25 year.
There are better bottles available.
- If there are, I'm not aware.
- The 25 is the oldest you can buy off the rack, but there are much older, much finer vintages out there.
All held in private collections, last time I checked.
We might know about six bottles that have come onto the market recently.
Tell me more.
How's your naval history, Christian?
- Do I look like a history major?
- But you have heard of the Andrea Doria?

I don't use his name unless it's necessary.
Neither should you.
My apologies.
But we still can't let you walk out of here with our bottle.
No appraisal, no deal.
You can have 10mL... more than enough to do a gas chromatograph analysis.
Allow me.
You know what, actually, it's better if we do it.
- Do you have something to hide?
- Of course not.
All right.
All done.
I'll be in touch.
Christian, don't you want a taste?
A taste of what, exactly?
A taste of the '47.
Hm.
Mmm.
How does it taste?
Like the McKinney.
Only the GC analysis can tell if it's the real thing.
It's the real thing.
That's my number.
Call me.
Don't forget.
You did good.
Thanks to the ESN numbers acquired by our con-artist friend and a little bit of my own Kung Fu,
I was able to hack into Christian's cell phone.
Take a listen.
He left this message earlier.
It's me.
You were right.
It's in the open.
You know how to find me.
- That could be for anyone.
- Well, in my read,
I heard Tarkanian say, "It's in the open".
This message could be for him.
Can you trace it?
They used what's called a dead drop server.
It's the preferred method of communication of international bad guys and big-time drug dealers.
- It's totally untraceable.
- So, Tarkanian can check his messages anywhere anonymously.
Pretty much, yeah.
And I have no way of tracking him.
It's Christian.
- This is Rochelle.
Meet me tonight- 4025 Gray Avenue.
We'll talk numbers.
- Will your boss be there?
- What difference does it make?
We'll only talk numbers with him.
You should have told me this before.
- Well, I'm telling you now.
- Just be there by nine.
I need you to set up a surveillance team to 4025 Gray Avenue.
I'll set up an arrest team.
- OK, I'll work on a warrant.
- OK, I'm gonna have a chat
- with our friend Bridget.
- OK.
Wanna grab a coffee?
You know someplace good?
I do.
I thought you meant someplace fun.
Well, this coffee isn't bad, and it's free.
- Free is good.
- How do you take it?
- Black.
- Black?
Perfect.
Me too.
You know, I can still remember a time when I didn't know where my next meal was coming from.
This is you trying to get me to talk.
Just saying we have some things in common.
You spent time in group homes, and so did I.
It was an awful time.
I really don't like talking about it.
Yeah, me neither.
Just saying I get it.
We all have our wounds.
So, what happened to your partner, uh, James?
Jimmy.
Jimmy Foster.
He's in Mount Pleasant Cemetery now.
Oh.
I'm sorry to hear that.
How'd he die?
Aneurysm.
They did all they could.
He was my mentor.
Like a father.
Only you can do this.
It's the last one, and then you're out.
So, was he the one who set up this score up for you?
He did, as a matter of fact.
He did business with Tarkanian.
He knew he'd pay dearly for the '47.
- What kind of business?
- I don't know.
He never even let me meet Tarkanian.
Why not?
He kept me at an arm's length from certain people.
People he didn't trust.
So, once we get this extra space, I mean, I'm going to be able to open
- all of this up.
- Wow.
- You know?
- It's beautiful.
I love it, man, I love, yeah.
So, what you gonna do with that spot over there?
- Uh, second-floor lounge.
- Yeah, about that...
I got a few ideas about what we could do with it.
- We?
- Well, I am an investor.
I just wanna make a room where people can hang out, have some drinks, do whatever they want.
It can't be anything that would jeopardize my licence.
You know that, right?
Look, Adam...
I can make this whole thing happen.
You're just gonna have to decide how badly you want it.
Hmm?
According to the M.E. report, James Foster died of multiple gunshot wounds.
The murder was never solved.
She said he died of an aneurysm.
- Yeah, well, she lied.
- Obviously.
- So, what's she hiding?
- That's the question, isn't it?
Jimmy told her to do this score from his death bed.
That's interesting, but what does it have to do with the case we're working?
I don't know, but I'll figure it out.
I love a good mystery.
Yeah, so do I when they look like her.
Yeah.
How's Toby?
Oh, he's the mayor of Mopesville.
Still totally hung up on Tia.
Yeah, well, he should be.
I mean, she's the best thing that ever happened to him.
And I know that she was crazy about him too.
Thanks, Nicky.
Yeah, but she bailed on him, right?
I mean, she hasn't so much as responded to an email in six weeks.
Because she's still figuring it all out.
I mean, if she didn't care about Toby at all, she'd email him right back.
The fact that she's completely ignoring Toby is a good thing?
- It means there's still hope.
- I will never understand women.
Just want you to know that.
Thank you.

If you're angling for more money...
Oh, my finder's fee is adequate.
I just thought we'd get to know each other a bit better.
This is not happening.
You don't have to cross any lines;
Just dance around them.
I love your home, Christian.
- You have exquisite taste.
- Thank you.
I've always had an eye for beauty.
And I like what I see tonight.
You are very light on your feet.

Business first, and then we can play.
OK.
Get your coats.
All right, guys.
We're on the move.
We have to catch up.
If I follow, he'll know he has a tail.
You're right.
Let's circle the block.
All right, there they are.
Andrei, this is Rochelle and Sarah.
Christian told me you have something that interests me, if the price is right.
Well, there's no need to be coy.
Everyone knows that you're obsessed with the '47.
I've tested the sample.
It's authentic.
- Your price?
- It's worth a million, so we'll give it to you for a million and a half.
I should walk right now.
And miss your opportunity of getting your hands on the '47?
Seven hundred and fifty K.
Nine.
Done.
You've been awfully quiet.
- Problem?
- No.
Hey, don't you want to hear how we got hold of the '47?
It's one hell of a story.
Another time, perhaps.
But if you try to cross me, you'll become a story as well.
What's our status?
Waiting for Christian to set up the meet with Tarkanian.
Everything goes well, we will get him today.
Today is good, but last night would have been better.
He gave us the slip.
The guy's a pro.
That guy's been avoiding capture for over a decade.
Which begs the question, if he's so cautious, why expose yourself to capture only to walk away?
He wanted to sniff us out.
It's his thing.
Sounds like you've done business with him before.
What's your relationship with Tarkanian, exactly?
My partner did business with him.
I wasn't part of the transaction, I just saw it getting wrapped up.
So, hold on.
During this transaction with your partner, did he see you?
Let me try this.
For a second, at most.
It's impossible he would remember me.
That's my phone.
Got it.
It's Christian.
This is Rochelle.
Bryer's Pier.
Half-an-hour.
- Bring the product.
- We'll be there.
We have to move now.
- Can I speak to you guys for a minute?
- Yeah.
There's a problem with my reads of Bridget.
All right, I've seen the same event with two different outcomes.
- I'm not sure I follow.
- When she first mentioned
Tarkanian, I read her and she was nowhere near him.
Just now I heard her think, "Let me try this", and then I saw a different version of the same event, where she was right beside him.
Also, she said that her partner Jimmy died of an aneurysm when he was actually shot to death.
- OK, so, what, you're reading her lies?
- Yeah, it feels like that.
- I thought you could only read the truth.
- I've encountered a lot of unusual minds, but, uh, this is a new one.
I read an article once about MRI tests on pathological liars.
Apparently they actually see the lies they tell.
- Yeah, it feels like that.
- Toby Logan, meet your Kryptonite.
I think we should reassess this meet.
I don't like
- what you're walking into.
- It's fine, I'll be fine.
Michelle, I just...
This could be our only shot to get to Tarkanian.
- Michelle, let's go, it's time.
- Yeah.
All right, go.
But for God's sakes, be careful.
You stay behind and you sweat Bridget.
Figure out what she's up to.
All right, I'll bring my A game.
I didn't know you liked it rough.
This is not a game, Bridget.
I thought we were good.
I thought we had a connection.
You've been playing some kind of angle this whole time.
I need to know what it is.
You really think I have some kind of secret agenda?
You all played your parts.
I do.
And somehow we all fit into it.
You took advantage of us;
you made the IIB work for you.
Or is this all a part of your plan?
To get arrested?
You think I like this?
What really happened between Tarkanian and Jimmy?
I don't know.
He wanted you to do this score on his deathbed.
Why?
That's between me and him.
Jimmy didn't die of an aneurysm.
You lied to me.
That's why we don't have a connection.
I'm not gonna talk about Jimmy.
You don't have to.
You're the only one who can do it.
- The last score, then you're out.
- Daddy.
He wasn't your mentor.
He wasn't your partner.
He was your father.
So, what happened?
He came back after your mother died?
Took you under his wing?
So, you got me all figured out.
Satisfied?
You were there when he died.
You want revenge on Tarkanian.
So, what's the next move, Bridget?
Tell Tarkanian I can make a better deal, just him and me alone.
Got it.
She's been in contact with Tarkanian behind our backs.
We need to get Michelle out of there.
Where's your partner?
With the product, waiting for my signal.
- Mm.
- Where's Tarkanian?
He sends his regrets.
Michelle.
Are you good?
- You OK?
- Yeah, I will be, once someone tells me what the hell is going on.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Bridget escaped.
- IIB's under lockdown.
- What's her endgame?
Revenge.
Tarkanian killed Jimmy Foster, who was her father, by the way.
I spoke with the evidence locker guards at IIB.
No sign of Bridget,
- but the McKinney is still there.
- OK, let's double up on security.
- Let's talk to Christian.
- Yeah.
Save your breath.
My lawyer will be here any second.
Well, I hope you have a good one, because a pretty man like yourself is gonna make a lot of friends in jail.
Why did Tarkanian send you to kill me?
He wanted you dealt with.
You and your so-called partner.
She thinks she could pull one over on Tarkanian, but... she can't fool him.
What did he find out?
You think I'm going to tell you?
- How could you miss that?
- I checked her record myself.
It was fixed!
I'll fix it myself!
Tarkanian wants to kill her.
How's he gonna do it?
He said he'll meet with you today, at the club.
We gotta get to the Montgomery.
So, you decided to cut out your partner.
Just looking out for number one.
I know a little bit about looking after number one.
So, this was about getting
- to Tarkanian.
- Mmhmm.
She played us perfectly.
She needed our help, so she got herself caught.
Think of all the bread crumbs...
Mickey, the rental car...
Why would she want to get caught?
We helped her get past Christian.
We gave her a new identity, we fixed her records, we helped her pass Christian's
- security checks.
- And what about Tarkanian?
Like Christian said, you can't fool The Shark.
Somehow he found out we fixed her records.
So, she's walking into a trap.
I have a car waiting.
I get into a car with you, and I'm never coming back.
Just like Jimmy.
Open that case, right now.
Ah!
Please.
I'll give you whatever you want.
You've already taken the only thing that mattered to me.
Please.
Relax.
Put your gun down.
How's the bodyguard?
He was rushed to St. Mike's.
Concussion, powder burns, but he's gonna be all right.
The proverbial smoking gun.
She left us with a living witness and a gun with her prints on it.
She wants us to know she did it.
Hey.
I have coordinated with Metro, they've got
- every available unit looking.
- Border Services?
Every airport and checkpoint has her photo.
She's not gonna get very far.
She's been red-flagged.
Come on, this is Bridget we're talking about.
We're never gonna see her again.
You look happy.
Because I just received a call of kudos from the upper brass, seeing how I just closed the case on Tarkanian.
YOU closed the case on Tarkanian?
I gave credit to the whole team, of course.
Of course.

Tell her that she can take as much time as she needs, and when she's ready to come back, you'll be there for her.
K, I thought I'm supposed to move on.
No, no no.
See, you don't move on from a girl like Tia.

Also the most expensive.
I love it.
It's so rich and warm.
Now, there is one more piece that I saw and thought, "Heather just has to have this".
The Buddha.
- From the Thai highlands.
- For my yoga studio.
You know how much I love my practice.
Let's have Michael bring it downstairs.
And I want you to take a look at these wall colours.
Great.
You can show Michael the perfect spot to put that Buddha in the yoga studio.
Oh.
This old chest.
Didn't you want to get rid of it?
More than you know.
I'll have Michael take it to the dump.
You're an angel.
Thank you.
I need to grab my notepad.
You guys go ahead.
And don't forget to pick a colour.
Follow me.
I need to talk to you.
Rock Clay, or Burnt Sienna?
Burnt Sienna all the way.
Thanks again, Sandra.
It was my pleasure.
- I'll see you at yoga?
- Oh, yes.
The Listener 04x10 The Long Con Original Air Date August 7,2013 Here.
Thank you.
Hey.
Hey.
What're you so smiley about?
Maybe it's just that new sexy hairdo of yours.
No.
What's going on?
OK, I was gonna save it as a surprise, but you know the panini shop beside the club?
- Yeah.
- It's up for sale.
- That's my surprise?
- Yeah, that's your surprise, all right?
I know.
But just think about it.
All that square footage, right?
It's right there, it's beside the club.
Faisal and I, we've become friends.
He's gonna give it to me at a good deal.
OK.
Um...
Wow.
I mean, that's...
- that's just a lot, right?
- Yeah.
It is a lot.
But I found an investor.
A friend of a friend.
Apparently he's a good guy.
Jerry Gaines.
OK, so, this is happening?
This is moving really fast.
An opportunity like this comes up, you gotta go for it, right?
I can put in a VIP lounge, a second bar.
Really take it to the next level, Mich.
OK, no, you're right.
This is exciting.
It is.
I just, I mean, are you sure you want to take on more debt
- right now?
- I think I have to, you know?
To stay competitive with the downtown clubs,
I gotta, I gotta step it up.
I think it'll be good.
What do you think?
- OK.
- Yeah?
Yeah, I'm behind you a hundred percent.
That's why I love you.
Come on in, kids.
Sharpen your pencils and open your notebooks, 'cause we're starting the day off with a history lesson.
Who can tell me what this is?
- I needed a change, OK?
- I think it looks great.
- Very pretty.
- Thank you.
- Guys?
- That's the Andrea Doria.
Sank off the coast of Massachusetts in, uh... what, '54?
Fifty-six.
Very close.
Gold star for him.
With more than 50 dead, it remains the worst naval disaster in US waters.
Can anyone tell me what... this is?
I think I can help here.
This is McKinney single malt scotch whiskey, the pride of Scotland.
And I can personally vouch for its excellence.
So, what does the pride of Scotland have to do with Andrea Doria?
Well, on board the Andrea Doria was this, a case of McKinney 1947.
It was recovered from the wreck and holds enormous historical value.
Nineteen forty-seven is considered the finest year.
And these six bottles are the very last remaining of the 1947 vintage.
For scotch lovers, this is the Holy Grail.
It was held by one owner for decades, but was recently sold in private for an undisclosed amount.
Which I can disclose to you.
It went for over a million dollars.
- And you know this how?
- Because I know the man who bought it,
David Brown.
The David Brown?
The man who I pay $200 a month to for my cell phone?
I've known David personally since before he was a telecom billionaire.
Yesterday, David's wife Heather fell victim to a con artist.
That is not just any con artist.
That is Bridget Connoly.
She's been on my radar for ages.
Mine too.
She allegedly conned the president of Air Belgium into buying a Banff ski resort that doesn't exist.
I thought she worked with a partner.
Gone solo, according to latest intel.
Point is, she's good.
No one's ever gotten close enough to arrest her.
Not yet.
My husband, he's quite the avid collector of rare vintages.
The '47 is about as rare as they come.
How did you guys acquire it?
Private sale.
Our broker, Tina, knew the original owner, who has since passed on.
- Strange old man.
- Strange how?
Well, he kept warning David that if he bought the '47, he'd have to guard it
- from this man who was obsessed with it.
- Did you get his name?
No, but he said he was really bad news.
Maybe he was working with Sandra.
- How long did you knew her?
- About a month.
And I must say, she didn't seem like a con artist.
The good ones usually don't.
But my connection with her was real.
At least it felt real.
And I love the things she bought for my house.
They were all perfect.
Perfectly fake, as it turns out.
She blanked out all of the cameras, so we can't actually see how she got the case out of the house.
Well, I had complained to her about an old trunk of my husband's.
She had her mover take it away for me.
Did you get his name?
Michael or Mickey, I think.
I didn't get a last name.
- What about the truck?
- Just a regular old truck, no markings that I can recall.
But he must have been in on it with her.
How could I have been so stupid?
Well, even smart women get conned sometimes.
Hey.
What's our status?
We've got some units out looking for Bridget Connoly.
- Still nothing.
- OK, what about her vehicle?
We got her plates from a security camera.
They were stolen from a car parked at the airport long-term parking.
No reports of a stolen Mercedes.
We'll have Dev check in with the luxury car rental companies.
How'd it go with Heather Brown?
Well, she said something about the original owner's warning about someone obsessed with the '47.
Think this guy could be connected?
Could be.
I have to admit, I feel kinda bad for Heather.
- You do?
Come on.
- Yeah.
She got taken in.
Come on.
You've gotta give it to Bridget, though.
Give her a little bit of a hand.
What she did took some skill.
- If you think lying is a skill.
- Everybody lies, but a conman lies with sophistication.
My dad always said don't trust anyone who lies for a living.
I got something on Bridget's accomplice.
His name is Mickey Asano.
He's the owner and operator of Asano Movers.
- How did you find him?
- It was easy.
I just pulled his plate up off the security camera feed.
Maybe too easy.
- Sure, I know her.
It's Sandra Woodson.
- Real name's Bridget Connoly.
And you helped her carry out a million dollars' worth of product yesterday.
Whoa, hold on.
All I did was move some furniture in and out.
I don't know anything about stolen product.
Where's the trunk that you helped her carry out?
- It's gone.
She came by and picked it up.
- What time?
She was waiting for me this morning when I got in, right at nine.
Thank you.
He has no idea he was part of a con.
So, the scotch is gone and we're back to square one.
I wouldn't say that.
She rented a Mercedes 350 from YYZ Luxury Car Rentals on Airport Road under the name Julia Cohen.
But wait, there's more.
She traded it in for a black Escalade.
Way to steal my thunder.
Yeah, the manager told me that
- this morning.
- OK.
But to rent from the same company using the same phony credentials?
I don't buy it.
She's smarter than that.
- After leaving Mickey, she headed north on the 427.
- Four twenty-seven?
There's cameras posted the whole way.
We can track her.
- I just need a timeline.
- She left around nine.
Nine.
All right, let's start around that mark.
Black Escalade, heading north.
- All right, this might be it.
Huh.
- Can you magnify it?
Yeah.
I think I can get the plate.
Got her.
It looks like she's getting off at Dixon.
There's a camera at Dixon and Airport Road.
OK, there she is.
She's turning into the parking lot at the Ventura Hotel.
- Let's pay her a visit.
- She'll be watching the doors.
So we get her outside.
The manager said one of the valets dinged my car.
Yeah, my partner's rolling it up right now.
- Where you headed, Bridget?
- My name's not Bridget, it's Chloe Robinson.
And that's not my car.
So, if we search this car, we're not gonna find anything incriminating?
What do we have here?
Looks like a few K in cash.
Multiple ID's.
It's not what it looks like.
I can explain everything.
Yeah, I'm sure you can, Bridget, and I'm sure not a word of it will be true.
So, Bridget... where'd you hide the scotch?
Do you have a buyer lined up?
Shark's going to bite.
See, when we spoke to Heather Brown, she told us that a dangerous man wanted to buy the scotch, that he was like a shark.
Is he your buyer?
They know about Tarkanian?
Because we know you've been talking to Tarkanian.
You're good.
Oh, you have no idea.
- Toby?
- Yeah.
A minute?
This is Andrei Tarkanian.
He's Armenian-Ukrainian.
Mercifully nicknamed The Shark.
Made his fortune in human trafficking in the early '90s and has since retired.
Yeah, I read his file.
He kidnapped hundreds of underage girls and pressed them into prostitution.
He is a repugnant human being and a prime target of INTERPOL, But he's also a man with appetites... women, wine, but especially fine scotch.
In my reads of Bridget, it looks like she's trying to hook up a deal with him.
Well, he'd be one hell of a big fish if we can net him.
- It would be a great career move.
- I'm not saying that.
I know, this would be a great bust.
It just means that we have to work with her, and I do not trust her at all.
You shouldn't.
She's a con artist.
But don't forget we have a secret weapon.
She's not gonna pull one over on us.
Right, Toby?
No pressure.
- No pressure.
- No pressure.
Bridget.
Let's get to know each other.
Nice photograph.
Your father ran out on you when you were an infant, and your mother raised you until her death.
You were... 16 years old?
You have the file;
you tell me.
Well, you were put into foster care, you ran away, and you were recruited by Jimmy "The Bricks" Foster.
Are you writing my biography, or do you want to talk about a deal?
Give us the location of the scotch, and I'll see what I can do about reducing your charges against you.
No.
Let's talk about what I want, then we can talk about what you want.
You have the floor.
You drop all the charges, and I walk away.
- I'll need further incentive.
- You want to catch The Shark,
I can help.
What exactly do you know about Tarkanian?
More than he knows about me.
I've never dealt with the man personally, but I've dealt with people like him.
Well, I'm pretty sure that we can handle it.
Really?
He's never been caught by any law enforcement agency anywhere.
You can use all the help you can get.
All right.
You help us bring in Tarkanian, I'll let you skate the charges on the scotch.
All the other outstanding charges against you are still your problem.
Deal.
Tell us where the '47 is.
Trident Storage on Weston Road, Unit 517.
I'll draw up the papers.
It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
Our latest intelligence says that Tarkanian has bases in Buenos Aires, Capetown, and Toronto.
He puts up firewalls between himself and the rest of the world, and the only way to access him is through trusted middlemen such as this man,
Christian Dufrense.
He's a former appraiser at some of the top-end auction houses.
According to those in the know, if you want to sell to Tarkanian, Christian's the man to talk to.
And luckily he's not hard to find.
He owns a very high-end club called the Montgomery.
It's uber elite.
- Excuse me.
Hello?
- So, we go to Christian's club, we tell him we have the '47, and he leads us to Tarkanian.
- Simple.
Sounds like a plan.
- Except for the X factor.
I know Bridget is working another angle here.
Have you been able to read her?
Not much yet.
She has incredible control over her thoughts.
- She's tough to read?
- She is tough to read.
But it'll get easier.
I'll find the cracks.
Guys.
Very good news.
The scotch has been recovered.
It's on its way
- to lockup as we speak.
- Excellent.
Tell them to beef up security.
That's over a million dollars' worth of merchandise.
Yes, we wouldn't want your friend to lose his precious whiskey again.
- Scotch.
- Get to work.
So, from this point forward, you will be known as Sarah Watson.
We have worked up a back story for you,
- so please get to know it.
- Thanks.
I've done this before.
Nice watch.
You know it's fake, right?
Actually, it's authentic.
Sure it is.
OK.
Um, I will be working alongside you as Rochelle Lawrence.
What's our story?
Well, you and the lovely Rochelle here are high-end B E specialists.
We approach Tarkanian's man Christian at his club tonight, and we show him this to prove we have the goods.
Christian is an appraiser.
He needs actual product to appraise.
That's impossible.
Klein won't sign off on us using a bottle for a meet like this.
IIB has a forensic lab, right?
- Yeah.
- We need them to mock up an empty bottle of the '47.
Are they capable?
- The best in the country.
- Get them on it.
Now I'm going to tell you the play, and I want you to listen carefully, because I'm only gonna tell you once.
The mock-up bottle is called "the show".
We're gonna fill it with store-bought McKinney, 25 year.
We present the show tonight.
I draw and sample using a syringe.
I squirt the sample into a test tube.
I give Christian the test tube so he can do a gas chromatograph analysis.
What Christian doesn't know is that I've swapped the show scotch with a sample of the real '47 McKinney.
And how do we get our hands on the real sample?
We only need 10 mils.
Your boss is friends with the owner, right?
- How did you know that?
- I do my research.
Tell Brown that his precious '47 will never be safe with Tarkanian out there.
It's in his best interest to help us take him down.
OK, I'll ask Klein to speak with Brown.
All according to the plan.
Oh, another thing.
If you can get your hands on Christian's cell phone and grab his SIM card, it'll help us; we can clone his phone.
But he'll see you pulling out the SIM card.
There's a better way to do it.
All you need to clone a cell is an ESN and MAC address.
This is yours.
What?
I palmed it while admiring your "authentic" watch.
A few keystrokes and I'd have all I need.
You play the game well.
Well, if you're not playing the game, the game's playing you.
Let you in on a little secret, though.
I'm done with it.
All of it.
I've heard that before.
Happens to be true.
I look at other people.
They have real jobs, real boyfriends.
I don't think I'll ever have that.
You're a smart girl.
You can get whatever you want.
Is that right?
Hey
I need you on op tonight with Dev.
Huh?
- Are you going to be ready?
- Yeah.
I'll be there.
All right, all right!
Who's ready for a frosty-cold game of NBA action and a down-to-the-wire back-and-forth beer?
I got that backwards.
Toby, where are you, bud?
- Hey.
I'm working tonight.
- Oh!
What are you, auditioning for Magic Mike 2?
- Undercover operation.
- OK, well, here's to your mission.
You know, seeing you all gussied up like that, I figured you had a date tonight.
- No, no.
- No?
I mean it's been a while since, uh...
- Tia left, yeah.
- Yeah.
Yes, I, uh, think about that night often... the look on her face.
You know, she said she needed time to think.
- It's been six weeks.
- Six weeks?
And she hasn't called or emailed?
Nothing?
No.
I know I'm not as good as you at reading signs, but I think it might be time to move on, my friend.
- No, I'm not ready to date.
- I'm not talking about dating, my brother.
I'm talking about a little rebound fling.
It's exactly what the doctor ordered.
There's this new nurse in the ER.
Her name is Kayla, which I believe is Gaelic for "lower back tattoo".
- Let me just get a little...
- What are you doing?
No, no, hey, come on!
There we go.
Snap a little picture, I'm gonna show Kayla.
Kayla.
Oh, nice navel ring, Kayla.
No, they're all yours.
Enjoy.
Hey, be safe tonight, bud.
- All right, have a good night.
- Expect a phone call.

We know who you are.
Then you know I make it a point to get well acquainted with my clientele.
Especially ones so beautiful.
What are you ladies drinking tonight?
Scotch.
What's your best?
The McKinney, of course.
That's the best glass of scotch money can buy.
We have the 12, 16, or the 25 year.
There are better bottles available.
- If there are, I'm not aware.
- The 25 is the oldest you can buy off the rack, but there are much older, much finer vintages out there.
All held in private collections, last time I checked.
We might know about six bottles that have come onto the market recently.
Tell me more.
How's your naval history, Christian?
- Do I look like a history major?

But we still can't let you walk out of here with our bottle.
No appraisal, no deal.
You can have 10mL... more than enough to do a gas chromatograph analysis.
Allow me.
You know what, actually, it's better if we do it.
- Do you have something to hide?
- Of course not.
All right.
All done.
I'll be in touch.
Christian, don't you want a taste?
A taste of what, exactly?
A taste of the '47.
Hm.
Mmm.
How does it taste?
Like the McKinney.
Only the GC analysis can tell if it's the real thing.
It's the real thing.
That's my number.
Call me.
Don't forget.
You did good.
Thanks to the ESN numbers acquired by our con-artist friend and a little bit of my own Kung Fu,
I was able to hack into Christian's cell phone.
Take a listen.
He left this message earlier.
It's me.
You were right.
It's in the open.
You know how to find me.
- That could be for anyone.
- Well, in my read,
I heard Tarkanian say, "It's in the open".
This message could be for him.
Can you trace it?
They used what's called a dead drop server.
It's the preferred method of communication of international bad guys and big-time drug dealers.
- It's totally untraceable.
- So, Tarkanian can check his messages anywhere anonymously.
Pretty much, yeah.
And I have no way of tracking him.
It's Christian.
- This is Rochelle.
Meet me tonight- 4025 Gray Avenue.
We'll talk numbers.
- Will your boss be there?
- What difference does it make?
We'll only talk numbers with him.
You should have told me this before.
- Well, I'm telling you now.
- Just be there by nine.
I need you to set up a surveillance team to 4025 Gray Avenue.
I'll set up an arrest team.
- OK, I'll work on a warrant.
- OK, I'm gonna have a chat
- with our friend Bridget.
- OK.
Wanna grab a coffee?
You know someplace good?
I do.
I thought you meant someplace fun.
Well, this coffee isn't bad, and it's free.
- Free is good.
- How do you take it?
- Black.
- Black?
Perfect.
Me too.
You know, I can still remember a time when I didn't know where my next meal was coming from.
This is you trying to get me to talk.
Just saying we have some things in common.
You spent time in group homes, and so did I.
It was an awful time.
I really don't like talking about it.
Yeah, me neither.
Just saying I get it.
We all have our wounds.
So, what happened to your partner, uh, James?
Jimmy.
Jimmy Foster.
He's in Mount Pleasant Cemetery now.
Oh.
I'm sorry to hear that.
How'd he die?
Aneurysm.
They did all they could.
He was my mentor.
Like a father.
Only you can do this.
It's the last one, and then you're out.
So, was he the one who set up this score up for you?
He did, as a matter of fact.
He did business with Tarkanian.
He knew he'd pay dearly for the '47.
- What kind of business?
- I don't know.
He never even let me meet Tarkanian.
Why not?
He kept me at an arm's length from certain people.
People he didn't trust.
So, once we get this extra space, I mean, I'm going to be able to open
- all of this up.
- Wow.
- You know?
- It's beautiful.
I love it, man, I love, yeah.
So, what you gonna do with that spot over there?
- Uh, second-floor lounge.
- Yeah, about that...
I got a few ideas about what we could do with it.
- We?
- Well, I am an investor.
I just wanna make a room where people can hang out, have some drinks, do whatever they want.
It can't be anything that would jeopardize my licence.
You know that, right?
Look, Adam...
I can make this whole thing happen.
You're just gonna have to decide how badly you want it.
Hmm?
According to the M.E. report, James Foster died of multiple gunshot wounds.
The murder was never solved.
She said he died of an aneurysm.
- Yeah, well, she lied.
- Obviously.
- So, what's she hiding?
- That's the question, isn't it?
Jimmy told her to do this score from his death bed.
That's interesting, but what does it have to do with the case we're working?
I don't know, but I'll figure it out.
I love a good mystery.
Yeah, so do I when they look like her.
Yeah.
How's Toby?
Oh, he's the mayor of Mopesville.
Still totally hung up on Tia.
Yeah, well, he should be.
I mean, she's the best thing that ever happened to him.
And I know that she was crazy about him too.
Thanks, Nicky.
Yeah, but she bailed on him, right?
I mean, she hasn't so much as responded to an email in six weeks.
Because she's still figuring it all out.
I mean, if she didn't care about Toby at all, she'd email him right back.
The fact that she's completely ignoring Toby is a good thing?
- It means there's still hope.
- I will never understand women.
Just want you to know that.
Thank you.
♪ You showed me life was more than... ♪
Please come in.
It's just us?
Patience, Rochelle.
If you're angling for more money...
Oh, my finder's fee is adequate.
I just thought we'd get to know each other a bit better.
This is not happening.
You don't have to cross any lines;
Just dance around them.
I love your home, Christian.
- You have exquisite taste.
- Thank you.
I've always had an eye for beauty.
And I like what I see tonight.
You are very light on your feet.
And you, you're not.
Are you tense?
I'm just the kind of girl who likes to know what's gonna happen next.
I know what I'd like to have happen.
Patience, Christian.
You're going to make me wait?
Business first, and then we can play.
OK.
Get your coats.
All right, guys.
We're on the move.
We have to catch up.
If I follow, he'll know he has a tail.
You're right.
Let's circle the block.
All right, there they are.
Andrei, this is Rochelle and Sarah.
Christian told me you have something that interests me, if the price is right.
Well, there's no need to be coy.
Everyone knows that you're obsessed with the '47.
I've tested the sample.
It's authentic.
- Your price?
- It's worth a million, so we'll give it to you for a million and a half.
I should walk right now.
And miss your opportunity of getting your hands on the '47?
Seven hundred and fifty K.
Nine.
Done.
You've been awfully quiet.
- Problem?
- No.
Hey, don't you want to hear how we got hold of the '47?
It's one hell of a story.
Another time, perhaps.
But if you try to cross me, you'll become a story as well.
What's our status?
Waiting for Christian to set up the meet with Tarkanian.
Everything goes well, we will get him today.
Today is good, but last night would have been better.
He gave us the slip.
The guy's a pro.
That guy's been avoiding capture for over a decade.
Which begs the question, if he's so cautious, why expose yourself to capture only to walk away?
He wanted to sniff us out.
It's his thing.
Sounds like you've done business with him before.
What's your relationship with Tarkanian, exactly?
My partner did business with him.
I wasn't part of the transaction, I just saw it getting wrapped up.
So, hold on.
During this transaction with your partner, did he see you?
Let me try this.
For a second, at most.
It's impossible he would remember me.
That's my phone.
Got it.
It's Christian.
This is Rochelle.
Bryer's Pier.
Half-an-hour.
- Bring the product.
- We'll be there.
We have to move now.
- Can I speak to you guys for a minute?
- Yeah.
There's a problem with my reads of Bridget.
All right, I've seen the same event with two different outcomes.
- I'm not sure I follow.
- When she first mentioned
Tarkanian, I read her and she was nowhere near him.
Just now I heard her think, "Let me try this", and then I saw a different version of the same event, where she was right beside him.
Also, she said that her partner Jimmy died of an aneurysm when he was actually shot to death.
- OK, so, what, you're reading her lies?
- Yeah, it feels like that.
- I thought you could only read the truth.
- I've encountered a lot of unusual minds, but, uh, this is a new one.
I read an article once about MRI tests on pathological liars.
Apparently they actually see the lies they tell.
- Yeah, it feels like that.
- Toby Logan, meet your Kryptonite.
I think we should reassess this meet.
I don't like
- what you're walking into.
- It's fine, I'll be fine.
Michelle, I just...
This could be our only shot to get to Tarkanian.
- Michelle, let's go, it's time.
- Yeah.
All right, go.
But for God's sakes, be careful.
You stay behind and you sweat Bridget.
Figure out what she's up to.
All right, I'll bring my A game.
I didn't know you liked it rough.
This is not a game, Bridget.
I thought we were good.
I thought we had a connection.
You've been playing some kind of angle this whole time.
I need to know what it is.
You really think I have some kind of secret agenda?
You all played your parts.
I do.
And somehow we all fit into it.
You took advantage of us;
you made the IIB work for you.
Or is this all a part of your plan?
To get arrested?
You think I like this?
What really happened between Tarkanian and Jimmy?
I don't know.
He wanted you to do this score on his deathbed.
Why?
That's between me and him.
Jimmy didn't die of an aneurysm.
You lied to me.
That's why we don't have a connection.
I'm not gonna talk about Jimmy.
You don't have to.
You're the only one who can do it.
- The last score, then you're out.
- Daddy.
He wasn't your mentor.
He wasn't your partner.
He was your father.
So, what happened?
He came back after your mother died?
Took you under his wing?
So, you got me all figured out.
Satisfied?
You were there when he died.
You want revenge on Tarkanian.
So, what's the next move, Bridget?
Tell Tarkanian I can make a better deal, just him and me alone.
Got it.
She's been in contact with Tarkanian behind our backs.
We need to get Michelle out of there.
Where's your partner?
With the product, waiting for my signal.
- Mm.
- Where's Tarkanian?
He sends his regrets.
Michelle.
Are you good?
- You OK?
- Yeah, I will be, once someone tells me what the hell is going on.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Bridget escaped.
- IIB's under lockdown.
- What's her endgame?
Revenge.
Tarkanian killed Jimmy Foster, who was her father, by the way.
I spoke with the evidence locker guards at IIB.
No sign of Bridget,
- but the McKinney is still there.
- OK, let's double up on security.
- Let's talk to Christian.
- Yeah.
Save your breath.
My lawyer will be here any second.
Well, I hope you have a good one, because a pretty man like yourself is gonna make a lot of friends in jail.
Why did Tarkanian send you to kill me?
He wanted you dealt with.
You and your so-called partner.
She thinks she could pull one over on Tarkanian, but... she can't fool him.
What did he find out?
You think I'm going to tell you?
- How could you miss that?
- I checked her record myself.
It was fixed!
I'll fix it myself!
Tarkanian wants to kill her.
How's he gonna do it?
He said he'll meet with you today, at the club.
We gotta get to the Montgomery.
So, you decided to cut out your partner.
Just looking out for number one.
I know a little bit about looking after number one.
So, this was about getting
- to Tarkanian.
- Mmhmm.
She played us perfectly.
She needed our help, so she got herself caught.
Think of all the bread crumbs...
Mickey, the rental car...
Why would she want to get caught?
We helped her get past Christian.
We gave her a new identity, we fixed her records, we helped her pass Christian's
- security checks.
- And what about Tarkanian?
Like Christian said, you can't fool The Shark.
Somehow he found out we fixed her records.
So, she's walking into a trap.
I have a car waiting.
I get into a car with you, and I'm never coming back.
Just like Jimmy.
Open that case, right now.
Ah!
Please.
I'll give you whatever you want.
You've already taken the only thing that mattered to me.
Please.
Relax.
Put your gun down.
How's the bodyguard?
He was rushed to St. Mike's.
Concussion, powder burns, but he's gonna be all right.
The proverbial smoking gun.
She left us with a living witness and a gun with her prints on it.
She wants us to know she did it.
Hey.
I have coordinated with Metro, they've got
- every available unit looking.
- Border Services?
Every airport and checkpoint has her photo.
She's not gonna get very far.
She's been red-flagged.
Come on, this is Bridget we're talking about.
We're never gonna see her again.
You look happy.
Because I just received a call of kudos from the upper brass, seeing how I just closed the case on Tarkanian.
YOU closed the case on Tarkanian?
I gave credit to the whole team, of course.
Of course.

No, no no.

PUNDIT 1:
We're almost a month into the strike, and we've got millions of kids stuck home from school.
PUNDIT 2:
Do you blame the White House or Congress?
CALLER 1:
I personally have very little sympathy for the teachers-
PUNDIT 3:
We're over three weeks into this strike.
It's costing the country billions of dollars, and instead of offering solutions...
PUNDIT 4:
There's a big difference between taking a stand and sitting on your hands.
CALLER 2:
I don't know whether to call it cowardice...
PUNDIT 5:
It's his agenda.
And the problem is that he stole sound, conservative ideas.
The only smart thing he's done is lift his platform from the Republican platform.
I admit it, Linda.
This got away from me.
But we can't turn back time.
We have to hold our ground.
While our approval ratings continue to nosedive?
Spinella and I worked together for years on dozens of labor-related bills.
I thought he'd be reasonable.
Well, you were wrong about that.
Well, I didn't think he'd be insane enough to go on strike, and I didn't think the strike would last this long.
So you've been wrong twice about this.
Why should I believe you're right about holding out?
We threatened collective bargaining in order to get performance standards and charter funding.
That's the deal that we made.
We took that stand.
We lay down now, we lose it all.
There'll be no reform, just an empty bill.
I understand the logic Frank, but we're in damage control now.
But we can't close one wound by opening another.
But we're the Democrats.
We're the ones who are supposed to be defending the teachers.
But you can't have it both ways, Linda.
You can't have the reform you want and keep the teachers happy at the same time.
You knew that when we started.
Okay, then if we have to choose, we choose to keep the teachers happy.
That is a mistake, Linda.
We've already crossed the Rubicon.
I'm telling you this.
The President wants to change the bill.
We should've done it three weeks ago.
We didn't.
So you have to do it now.
Give me more time, Linda, please.
If I can break this strike and get everything we want in this bill, can we agree that's preferable to folding?
Of course.
If we can count on that...
Then count on me for just one more week.
If the strike isn't over by then, I'll change the bill.
Frank...
No.
One more week.
That's all.
This is the worst possible position to be in.
If I water down the bill, the President will still see me as a failure.
If the strike doesn't end in a week,
I've forced myself into a corner.
Only total victory will put me back in his good graces.
The alternative is exile, which would mean the last five months were for nothing.
I cannot abide falling back to square one.
Does the Congressman need me, ma'am?
No.
I just was wondering if you wanted a cup of coffee.
I just brewed a fresh pot.
I'm good, ma'am.
But thanks.
Are you sure?
My shift's done in a couple hours.
I'll be fine.
You know, come on.
Stretch your legs.
I won't take no for an answer.
What did you do before you joined the leadership detail?
I was a cop here in D.C.
Before that, I was in the Marines, ma'am.
Thank you.
Did you serve overseas?
I did, ma'am.
Bahrain, then Afghanistan.
Served most of my second tour in the Korengal Valley.
You wanna know if I killed anyone?
I think I know the answer.
I got a dinner meeting with Birch.
I'll be...
I invited him in for coffee.
Well, drink it fast.
We leave in five... (WINDOW SMASHING)
Get down!
Stay away from the windows!
Stop!
(PHONE RINGING)
You'll have six of my best men covering you around the clock.
I guess I'm wondering why we didn't at least have one of your best men covering us now.
He'll be disciplined, sir.
FRANCIS:
He shot a gun in a residential neighborhood.
I want him fired.
CARDIFF:
There will be a full investigation, and we'll take the necessary action.
Steve never would've let this happen.
Is he better yet?
Because I would feel a lot safer if he was with us.
Unfortunately, he won't be coming back, sir.
I thought he just had a gallbladder infection.
He did, they found more.
His pancreas, stage four.
- Jesus.
- Oh, my God.
That's awful.
FRANCIS:
How much longer does he have?
Not long.
A few weeks.
At least that's what his wife told me.
We have to go see him.
Can you get the information where he is?
Of course.
I'll make sure you get it right away.
- Thank you, Captain.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Good night.
- Front door.
- Yes, sir.
Your weapon.
Your badge, too.
Am I suspended, sir?
You had a suspect on foot, and you fire your gun?
Sir, I realize that...
Do you know how this reflects on me?
That one of our men could be so careless?
Not only do you abandon your post for coffee.
You could've killed a bystander.
That slug was found on somebody's front stoop.
What if it went in their house?
Your badge, Meechum.
Two reasons, which are really the same reason.
I was sick of working for other people, and I knew I could do a better job than my bosses.
They kept trying to suppress me, shutting me out.
So I said, "Fuck it.
I'll do it my way."
And then you just quit?
Not like you did.
(CHUCKLING)
I slaved away until I lined up the money to start Slugline.
Once Slugline gets big enough, what's the plan?
Are you gonna sell it like Arianna?
Probably.
And then who knows?
Whatever the next adventure is.
Maybe Shanghai.
So I shouldn't expect to have a job in two years?
Do you ever wanna have any job for more than two years?
What about you?
What's your big plan?
Uh, I don't know yet.
Come on.
Slugline is just a stepping stone for you.
(PHONE BUZZING)
You know what?
I should take this.
Go.
Do your thing.
Hey.
Do you have proof Spinella was behind it?
Put it in context.
Three weeks into a national teachers' strike...
At the home of Francis Underwood, who has led the charge on...
There you go.
Now post that before one of my neighbors calls a local 11:00 hack.
- When do I see you next?
- I'm background on this.
I'm not your source.
You can't talk now?
- No.
- When?
Soon, with bells on.
What about "more school books, less bricks"?
No, it's too broad.
We need a better sound bite.
Something specific, something that points the finger directly at Spinella.
- He'll deny any involvement.
- Well, of course he will.
So how do we get around that?
We say he can't control his troops.
There's no evidence it was a teacher.
Who else could it be?
Look, he's gonna shift blame for the strike back on Congress.
No.
We need something clear, something clean, something that sticks in your head.
"Teachers need a lesson in self-restraint."
No.
You're not hearing me.
People like teachers.
No.
We need something that makes Spinella the villain.
His lack of control, his inability...
Disorganized labor.
It's disorganized labor, plain and simple.
When you've got angry teachers throwing bricks through congressmen's windows, you've gotta blame the union leadership.
We'll be beefing up the security for the entire leadership.
And I strongly encourage Marty Spinella to keep his people in line.
This is starting to look like disorganized labor.
MALE REPORTER:
Do you really think Marty Spinella is to blame?
Whether Mr. Spinella is behind this or not, he might wanna tone down the rhetoric, before disorganized labor turns into organized crime.
No one can prove anything.
So that's the most cogent response.
Well, go on TV and say that.
You deplore violence in any form.
It's Congress that should take responsibility.
I don't want to degenerate to Frank's level.
We need to kill this brick thing.
It's distracting people from the issues.
MEDIA CONSULTANT:
She's right.
It'll eat up one cycle, and it'll disappear.
No.
This story is getting traction.
Support for the strike is dipping.
So is the President's approval ratings.
But he gets to stay in the Oval Office another three years, no matter what.
We can't afford another three weeks.
When I told the unions to strike,
I told them to prepare for the long haul.
All right?
Their accounts dry up, we keep going.
We figure it out.
I am not going to blink over something like this.
Fine.
But if we lose the public relations battle, none of that does us any good.
Frank wants us on the defensive.
I think this story is going to blow over.
If I'm wrong, we'll reevaluate.
But I wanna give it another day or two first.
Okay?
(PHONE BUZZING)
Hi, Adam.
You all right?
I saw the news.
Yes, I'm fine.
That's gotta rattle the nerves.
Brick coming through the window.
It did, some.
So are you staying in the house?
We've got extra security now, so...
Well, it made me think of you, so I figured I'd just check in.
I appreciate that.
We still haven't talked, have we?
- (SIGHING) There's no need to.
- I think we should.
Here's how I see it.
You asked me to come down.
I did.
We both had ideas about what that could mean.
Probably very similar ideas.
But then you changed your mind.
So be it.
There's no reason we can't be in touch or remain friends.
(SIGHING)
Let's not fool ourselves, Adam.
So I won't call again.
- Done.
- I'm not saying that.
What are you saying?
I just called because I care about you.
No agenda.
If you wanna talk again, call me.
If not, I understand It's up to you-
You think I'm being unreasonable?
I think you're doing whatever it is you need to do, and I'm not gonna question it.
It was sweet of you to call.
Listen, you probably need to get back to work.
I know I do.
I should go.
Yeah.
Okay.
- Take care.
- Okay.
Frank, you got a minute?
I'll see you inside.
I wanna be governor, and I want your help.
Am I still on the short list?
You are.
I haven't had a drink in over a month.
I'm clean.
Is that because I asked, or because it's what you want?
It was about time I took responsibility for myself.
Taking responsibility is one thing, and it's admirable.
But running for governor of a major state is a whole nother ball game.
Let me tell you something, Frank.
I got elected to Congress 'cause I seized the moment that opportunity struck.
You kept me on that list.
I wanna seize that opportunity.
If you help me out, I'll give you everything I got.
Well, that's all I've been waiting to hear.
All right.
I'll tell you what.
I need to make some calls, check in with some people.
Give me a few days.
I'll get back to you.
- Of course.
- And, Peter...
I feel like I've met the real you for the first time just now.
Janet
- Is this a bad time?
- No.
No, not at all.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were coming.
Here.
Take my chair.
Oh, no.
I'm fine.
I'll take these.
Thank you.
Hello, Steve.
Hey.
These could use some water.
I'll be right back.
Francis and I were so upset when we heard.
I'm sorry I haven't come sooner.
I didn't want too many people knowing.
Yes.
Francis wishes he could be here.
He wants you to know he's praying for you.
Couldn't make it, huh?
No, there's a big teachers' strike going on right now, and he's been stuck in his office for weeks.
I get it.
I saw the news.
The brick.
Right.
I told Francis that probably wouldn't have happened if you were there.
(LAUGHING) No.
Probably not.
I never seen him pray.
Not in eight years.
You said he was praying for me.
You've seen us in church.
Yeah, but I never went inside.
They're just gorgeous.
Mrs. Underwood, thank you so much.
Please, call me Claire.
I know you got things to do.
Of course.
If you need anything at all, call me.
You have my cell.
Anything at all.
And I'm sorry to have surprised you.
No.
It was so nice of you to come.
Thank you.
I know Steve appreciated it.
Check this out.
It's foam.
How many of these we have?
200.
But I can get more.
Get more.
(CROWD SHOUTING INDISTINGUISHABLY)
Bring it on!
You need to give the teachers the respect they deserve.
(CROWD BOOING)
(INAUDIBLE)
PRESS SECRETARY:
We can't back away from this, Marty.
We've gotta face it head-on.
They provoked us.
They were throwing foam.
Our guys were throwing punches.
We're gonna come off the bad guys here.
Okay.
Okay.
I get it.
I get it.
But I wanna be smart about this.
I wanna do something definitive that'll put this to bed and get us back on message.
CNN.
One-on-one, you and Underwood.
MEDIA CONSULTANT:
8:00 tonight.
Frank is excellent in debates.
Go strong against him.
Address the brick right to his face.
End of story.
Underwood says he's in if you are.
Okay.
But I want as much prep as possible, okay?
I want to run questions.
You moderate, you play Underwood.
Wear this one.
Then come in here.
I wanna put powder on you.
Well, there's somebody at the studio can do that.
Yes, and they always cake on too much.
I'm doing it.
(SIGHING)
War paint.
How bloody do you think it'll be?
I think I oughta be able to dispatch with him easily enough.
You remember Peter Russo?
He's doing well.
He hasn't had a drink in a month.
Good for him.
I like him.
Good, because he could use your help.
H ow?
We're running him for governor.
Ambitious.
Mm.
We wanna create jobs in his district.
It's on the Delaware River.
I thought we might be able to put a bill together.
Something with an economic upside.
This has to do with the shipyard closing?
We need the shipbuilders' support for his campaign.
You think you might be able to draft a bill that he can sponsor?
I'm really trying to focus on international projects, Francis.
Not domestic legislation.
I understand, but I could really use your help, Claire.
Does Catherine Durant still owe us?
When you make someone Secretary of State, they owe you for life.
We're having trouble getting our water filters through Sudanese customs.
I'll call from the car.
Tomorrow's fine.
I would have done that anyway.
I know.
I'm ready for battle.
You wanna come watch?
No.
You go on ahead.
Come on.
Watch me put the final nail in Spinella's coffin.
It'll be fun.
Marty.
Frank.
MAN:
Come on, people.
Take your marks.
REPORTER:
Congressman, would you like to respond to that?
Yes, I would.
$2 billion of taxpayers' money being wasted.
And Congress should be ashamed of itself for that, Frank.
What?
Did Congress force the teachers to go on strike, Marty?
- No, we didn't.
- Really, Frank?
When you threaten teachers' ability to negotiate as a union, when you threaten their job security, you threaten their livelihood, of course you force them to strike.
And did we also force them to start throwing bricks at people's houses?
You know what, I'm really glad you brought that up, because you know there's absolutely no proof that that incident had anything to do with this strike.
And I wanna take the opportunity to say publicly that we categorically condemn any use of violence whatsoever, or intimidation.
What you're saying, essentially, is that you can't control your own people.
- That's not what I'm saying.
- That is what you're saying.
You're disorganized.
Disorganized labor.
You know what, you could keep trotting out that phrase all you like, but you know what I'd like to do, Frank?
I would like to get back to the issue here of educating our children and the fact that Congress is not living up to their commitment.
Well, you know what I would like?
What?
An apology.
If not to me, then to my wife.
When that brick came through our window, it was terrifying.
She's standing right over there.
- Claire?
MAN 2:
We need camera two on the wife.
Now, why don't you look her in the eye and tell her that your people had nothing to do with that brick.
- Are you serious?
- Yes.
Okay.
Mrs. Underwood, Claire,
I am sincerely sorry that you had to go through that ordeal, truly.
And it actually sickens me that someone made you feel unsafe in your own home.
And I give you my word that to the best of my knowledge, none of our people had anything to do with it.
But you know what sickens me more?
That right now, your husband is using you as a prop on national television to try and win a debate.
So I think you're the one that owes your wife an apology, Frank.
And when you're done apologizing, can we please get back to the issue here of educating our children?
No.
You've got this wrong, Marty.
There is no "you" and "I" in education.
Well, I mean, yes, there's the letters,
"U" and "I" are in the word education.
But education with a capital "E
You know what I'm talking about.
I don't think I do.
Yes, you do, Marty.
"U" and "I", education.
So, we're gonna waste the rest of this debate naming all the vowels in...
I'm happy to play the vowel game.
You wanna play the vowel game with me?
All right. "U" think "I"
"O" "U"
"A" apology?
But no, no, no.
"U" "O" "I."
Interesting.
You left out "E" for "Education."
- So let...
- Defecation.
Edification.
I'm sorry.
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)
FRANCIS:
LOL.
Uh... (LAUGHING)
(STAMMERING)
SPINELLA:
You like Sesame Street so much?
Why don't you give the kids the money they deserve?
What I'm trying to say about education...
(LAUGHING) Well, I guess school's still in session.
I guess you schooled me there, Marty.
- Let's move on.
- Please.
Humor aside, there are more important issues out there.
I had no intention of bringing you into this.
It wasn't part of a plan.
I would've told you if it was.
I know.
The idea just struck me and I went with it.
I don't mind that you improvised.
I just wish you'd done it better.
Congressman Frank Underwood says he got, quote, schooled by AFT spokesman and chief strategist, Martin Spinella, during a debate last night on this network.
In the past 24 hours, reruns of the gaffe have played nonstop on TV news programs and the Internet.
A YouTube clip set to techno music has logged more than 300,000 hits and spawned dozens of other spoofs.
♪ No, no, no
♪ "E" "O" "I"
♪ With a capital "E"
♪ Education LOL ♪
That was as clumsy as the Lee Harvey Oswald prison transfer.
What was he thinking?
Just give me one second.
There's a deli down the street.
Patti, thanks for coming.
Sit down.
You want some coffee?
No, thanks.
I'm good.
Hey, did you see Bill Maher last night?
No, I didn't.
It was about the CNN thing.
I have to admit, Frank, it was kind of funny.
Well, I'll have to catch a rerun.
How you doing?
You holding up all right with the strike?
Let's talk about Pennsylvania.
I have your candidate.
Peter Russo.
1st Congressional District.
We crossed him off.
I know.
It's a mistake.
He's young, he's handsome.
He's bright.
Nobody knows who he is outside of Philadelphia.
There's no donor base, no infrastructure.
You start me off with funding from the DNC and I'll raise an army around this guy.
I will personally oversee his campaign.
Is that the best we can do?
What's better than a blank slate in the right hands?
Ed, you need to go.
Congressman, do you have a moment?
Thank you, Patti.
Have him call me.
I will
Ed?
Please.
- What is going on?
- I'm taking care of it.
One second, sir.
Please.
All right.
Make it fast, Meechum.
It's not easy for me to ask this, but I was wondering if you could put in a good word with my boss.
A good word?
They're going to discharge me, sir.
I messed up.
I'm fully aware.
But my job, it means everything to me, and I know a good word from you would...
Look, I have nothing against you personally, Meechum, but I can't get involved in these sort of affairs.
There's protocols and rules.
Sir, please, if you spoke to Cardiff...
There is nothing that I can do.
If anyone could convince the Captain, it would be you, Congressman.
I'm sorry.
I wish you all the best, Meechum.
Doug.
What did Barney Hull say?
That we'd be the first to know.
I can't believe there hasn't been a single 911 call.
There's been plenty.
It's just not the sort we're after.
We got that kid in Atlanta.
No, it's got to be here.
I can't be getting on a plane.
It looks too opportunistic.
Maybe if we open it up a little bit?
No, we cannot lower our standards.
We just have to be patient.
New rule.
Now that the debate's over,
Frank Underwood has to tell us what the hell that was.
Seriously, Congressman, was that a joke?
I haven't seen something just lay there like that since...
I gotta go all the way back to my prom night.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
Can we just settle this strike please?
Teachers have been out of the classroom for so long, middle-schoolers are starting to have sex with each other.
Enough.
I don't know why you had it on in the first place.
I love you, Francis.
I know.
We should say that more often to each other.
I need to clear my head.
...north and east of the airport.
I'm gonna need that in time for that meeting.
Peter, let's talk.
So.
I've spoken to Patricia Whittaker.
She's on board.
You'll be getting $4 million in start-up funding from the DNC.
I'll pick the team.
You announce in August.
But the campaign starts today.
Are you ready?
I've already put together a platform.
It's mostly broad strokes, but we can hone it.
Good.
The first thing we need to address is your sobriety.
You don't need to worry about that.
Have you been going to meetings?
You mean AA?
Yes.
That's not really my thing.
If you want my help, then going to meetings is my one requirement.
I know I had a problem, Frank.
I accept that.
And I've taken responsibility for that, but I don't think going to meetings is necessary.
You cannot white-knuckle your recovery, Peter.
This campaign will be the hardest thing you've ever done in your life.
I realize that.
I'm prepared for that.
You think you are.
But we can't take any chances.
The party's investing in you.
I need to make sure you're investing in yourself.
All right.
I'll do whatever I have to do.
Good.
You'll start tomorrow morning.
Doug will take you.
Stamper?
He's been sober 14 years.
Doug has a drinking problem?
Had.
Not anymore.
He'll be your sponsor.
In the meantime, I want you to meet with my wife, Claire.
She runs the Clean Water Initiative.
She's expecting you, so clear your schedule and head over there now.
Frank.
Thank you.
For believing in me.
You're gonna make a great candidate, Peter.
CLAIRE:
The shipyard closing frees up 1,100 acres of federal land.
Our goal is to pass a Watershed Act for the Delaware River.
We develop the land in an environmentally responsible way, creating jobs in the process.
- How many jobs?
- Thousands.
We're aiming for the $200 million mark.
We got a lot of work to do.
We do, but you can start with the congressmen whose districts fall within the watershed.
Do you have a draft of the bill you can show me?
We haven't sponsored any environmental legislation.
We'll draft it in consultation with your staff.
Gillian will be the point person on our end.
I don't have any legislation experience.
- I'll help you.
- When do we start?
We just did.
Will you introduce him to the research team?
I'll be there in one second.
Sure.
FRANCIS:
Mr. President?
I want it over.
As soon as possible.
Gut the bill, Frank.
Do whatever's necessary to end this.
Mr. President, if we give in now, the public won't credit you with a victory.
Not even a hollow one.
They'll chalk it up as a colossal defeat.
Well, that's on you, Frank.
You let this situation devolve to where it is.
I've already been blamed for the largest teachers' strike in U.S. history.
I won't be held accountable for it dragging on months and months.
Mr. President, we have to end this strike on your terms.
- Not anyone else's.
- How?
By debating Marty Spinella on CNN?
Sir, you have placed your faith in me thus far.
I would ask that you continue to do so.
Well, whatever you're doing, Frank, isn't working, so I'm stepping in.
Gut the bill.
Like Linda said.
No.
I'm sorry, Mr. President, but I will not do that.
Are you letting pride cloud your judgment, Frank?
Respectfully, sir, you're allowing fear to cloud yours.
Not an easy thing, to say no to the most powerful man in the free world.
But sometimes the only way to gain your superior's respect is to defy him.
What do we have on the schedule, Linda?
Your meeting with the Fed Oversight Committee.
Thank you, Mr. President.
- Do you have my briefing?
- Right here.
Good.
Let's look it over.
Hi.
How'd it go with Peter?
CLAIRE;
ll' went Well.
Is he game?
Completely.
(SIGHING) Thank you.
That's a big weight off my shoulders.
You sound tired.
Tired.
Impatient.
What can I do?
Nothing.
This one's up to fate.
I don't like when we leave things to fate.
Neither do I.
Does that mean I'm gonna have the bed to myself tonight?
Probably.
Can't Doug man the fort?
Well, he could, but I'd just toss and turn.
If I'm not gonna sleep, I might as well not sleep here.
Well, I'll leave the ringer on.
Call me if you want company.
I will.
Good night.
Good night.
You should go home.
I could take it from here.
Vigilance.
It's good for the soul.
DISPATCHER: 10-59.
Corner of 16th and Q. 10-59.
What's that?
Disorderly conduct.
Do you believe in karma?
Absolutely not.
Well, I do.
At least tonight.
Get Captain Cardiff on the phone.
Let's do something about Meechum.
- What?
- Get him his job back.
He fired his weapon.
He overreacted.
Cardiff.
On the phone.
Now.
Nancy, give me Captain Cardiff, please.
We might as well do one productive thing while we wait.
It requires very little of me and will mean the world to him.
It's a very inexpensive investment.
Hello, sir.
This is Doug Stamper.
I have Francis Underwood for you.
I got him on.
Captain, I know it's late, but I'd like to talk to you about Edward Meechum.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Are you hungry?
- Mm-hmm.
- (WHISTLES) - (FREDDY LAUGHING)
You have any trouble getting in?
No, they made me put it through the X-ray machine twice, so I hope it didn't overcook it.
Frank, you always pay too much.
This is way too much.
It's for the inconvenience.
You know, 20 years you been coming to my joint.
This is the first time I've been to yours.
What do you think?
I could get used to it.
Well, you're welcome any time.
Thank you, Freddy.
Always, Frank.
DISPATCHER:
We got a 27 Delta two. 4463rd Street...
That's a drive-by shooting.
Get details.
Sir, I want to thank you for talking to the Captain.
He told me you called, and I can't tell you how grateful I am.
I want you to listen very closely to what I'm about to say.
From this moment on, you are a rock.
You absorb nothing, you say nothing, and nothing breaks you.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
Welcome back.
Steve?
I'll leave you be.
Where...
Where's Janet?
She's been here every day for the last few weeks.
I told her, go home, get some rest.
Well, is everything okay?
Your text said it was important.
I don't know how to put this.
The thing is, I...
I've been thinking.
A lot.
About my life.
About the things I haven't done.
Things I haven't said.
I hate your husband.
A lot of people do.
The past eight years, I watched over him.
But it wasn't him I was watching.
And every time I saw you, every time I heard your voice, all I could think to myself was,
"Jesus, what I wouldn't give."
I can't tell you how many times I thought about that.
You know what Francis said to me when he proposed?
I remember his exact words.
He said, "Claire, if all you want is happiness,
"say no.
"I'm not gonna give you a couple of kids
"and count the days until retirement.
"I promise you freedom from that.
"I promise you'll never be bored."
You know, he was the only man, and there were a lot of others who proposed.
But he was the only one who understood me.
He didn't put me on some pedestal.
He knew that I didn't want to be adored or coddled.
So he took my hand and he put a ring on it.
Because he knew I'd say yes.
He's a man who knows how to take what he wants.
Is this what you wanted?
Is that the way you wanted it?
Stop.
Stop.
Please.
Please.
Stop.
Don't.
You told me your truth.
Now you know mine.
(PHONE RINGING)
(PHONE STOPS RINGING)
Hey, it's Peter.
I don't expect you to call me back, but I wanted to let you know I stopped drinking last night, and I went to my first AA meeting this morning.
I'm supposed to reach out and make amends to those I've hurt.
But I guess the real reason I called you is just to say I love you and I miss you
I hope you're well.
This is work, not play.
Then why'd you bother coming over?
I was hoping you'd answer the door naked.
That would be play.
That would be work with a view.
(SCOFFING) Sorry to disappoint.
How many characters in a tweet?
140.
Type this, let me know where you land.
Eight-year-old Washington D.C. boy killed by a stray bullet in gangland shoot-out.
61 characters left.
He should have been in school?
30 left.
Spinella to blame.
Question mark.
- 128.
- Press send.
Now give me a name, details.
Tyler Davis.
Third-grader at Vernon Baker Elementary.
Shot outside his home in Southeast just before noon today.
Sent.
Where are you going?
- To see the mother.
- You don't wanna...
There's work to do.
I'll see you later tonight.
Tyler never did anything wrong.
He was a good boy.
Everybody loved him.
It's okay.
If Tyler's school had been in session, this senseless killing would have never taken place.
We need to end this strike now and get all our children back in school where they belong, before we risk another death like this.
So, Mr. Spinella, lam headed to the Capitol right now, and I will remain there until you are ready to meet and talk so that we can end this pointless strike.
Thank you all for coming.
Let's go back inside.
REPORTER:
Mr. Spinella, one question.
PRESS SECRETARY:
Mr. Spinella is not gonna make comments at this time.
No comment.
No comment.
Thank you.
Frank.
So?
You said you wanted to talk.
You said you wanted to work out a compromise.
I lied.
Excuse me?
I have no intention of working out a compromise.
So then why the fuck are we here, Frank?
(TAPPING RING ON TABLE)
What the hell's the matter with you?
You think this is some kind of a game?
No.
These are real people with families to feed.
Would you please stop that?
Stop what?
In five seconds, I'm out of here.
One.
Two.
Three.
- Four
- Goodbye, Frank.
You know the difference between you and me, Marty?
What?
I'm a white-trash cracker from a white-trash town that no one would even bother to piss on.
But here's the difference.
I've made something of myself.
I have the keys to the Capitol.
People respect me.
But you, you're still nothing.
You're just an uppity dago in an expensive suit turning tricks for the unions.
Nobody respects the unions anymore, Marty.
They're dying.
And no one respects you.
The most you'll ever make of yourself is blowing men like me.
Men with real power.
Yes.
I can smell the cock on your breath from here.
You think you can get under my skin?
- I know I can.
- Yeah.
Kiss my ass, Frank.
- You can't afford to walk out.
- Watch me.
I've got a dead, underprivileged kid in my pocket.
What do you have?
I have two million honorable teachers.
Fair enough.
But I got something even better.
Go ahead.
Open it.
Okay.
I'll play your game.
You're an idiot.
Stamper threw it.
You're full of shit.
Oh no, Stamper threw the brick.
And I made sure Claire distracted my security.
Are you kidding me?
And to think you wanted me to apologize to my wife.
You would do something that low, Frank?
I arranged the brick, Marty, just like I arranged this meeting this afternoon.
Back off, Frank.
Why don't you just get down on your knees where you really belong?
Back off, Frank.
Because the only thing you're gonna get from me is cum on your...
Fuck you!
NANCY:
Everything okay in there, sir?
Look, I'll tell them you provoked me.
I'll tell them that you threw the brick yourself.
And who's going to believe you?
You just assaulted a United States Congressman, which is a felony.
But I'm not gonna press charges, Marty.
Because the strike ends now.
You think it'll leave a scar?
I have a thick skin.
The next time you ask me to invite someone in for coffee, will you please make sure no guns go off?
I'll do my best.
I saw Steve again today.
How is he?
In a lot of pain.
Should I go see him?
I don't think you need to.
(PHONE RINGS)
Zoe Barnes.
When he dies, we'll pay for his funeral.
(RINGING CONTINUES)
You don't need to take it?
No.
I'm done with work today.
We're almost a month into the strike, and we've got millions of kids stuck home from school.
Do you blame the White House or Congress?
I personally have very little sympathy for the teachers.
We're over three weeks into this strike.
It's costing the country billions of dollars, and instead of offering solutions...
There's a big difference between taking a stand and sitting on your hands.
I don't know whether to call it cowardice...
It's his agenda.
And the problem is that he stole sound, conservative ideas.
The only smart thing he's done is lift his platform from the Republican platform.
I admit it, Linda.
This got away from me.
But we can't turn back time.
We have to hold our ground.
While our approval ratings continue to nosedive?
Spinella and I worked together for years on dozens of labor-related bills.
I thought he'd be reasonable.
Well, you were wrong about that.
Well, I didn't think he'd be insane enough to go on strike, and I didn't think the strike would last this long.
So you've been wrong twice about this.
Why should I believe you're right about holding out?
We threatened collective bargaining in order to get performance standards and charter funding.
That's the deal that we made.
We took that stand.
We lay down now, we lose it all.
There'll be no reform, just an empty bill.
I understand the logic, Frank, but we're in damage control now.
But we can't close one wound by opening another.
But we're the Democrats.
We're the ones who are supposed to be defending the teachers.
But you can't have it both ways, Linda.
You can't have the reform you want and keep the teachers happy at the same time.
You knew that when we started.
Okay, then if we have to choose, we choose to keep the teachers happy.
That is a mistake, Linda.
We've already crossed the Rubicon.
I'm telling you this.
The President wants to change the bill.
We should've done it three weeks ago.
We didn't.
So you have to do it now.
Give me more time, Linda, please.
If I can break this strike and get everything we want in this bill, can we agree that's preferable to folding?
Of course.
If we can count on that...
Then count on me for just one more week.
If the strike isn't over by then, I'll change the bill.
Frank...
No.
One more week.
That's all.
This is the worst possible position to be in.
If I water down the bill, the President will still see me as a failure.
If the strike doesn't end in a week,
I've forced myself into a corner.
Only total victory will put me back in his good graces.
The alternative is exile, which would mean the last five months were for nothing.
I cannot abide falling back to square one.
Does the Congressman need me, ma'am?
No.
I just was wondering if you wanted a cup of coffee.
I just brewed a fresh pot.
I'm good, ma'am.
But thanks.
Are you sure?
My shift's done in a couple hours.
I'll be fine.
You know, come on.
Stretch your legs.
I won't take no for an answer.
What did you do before you joined the leadership detail?
I was a cop here in D.C.
Before that, I was in the Marines, ma'am.
Thank you.
Did you serve overseas?
I did, ma'am.
Bahrain, then Afghanistan.
Served most of my second tour in the Korengal Valley.
You wanna know if I killed anyone?
I think I know the answer.
I got a dinner meeting with Birch.
I'll be...
I invited him in for coffee.
Well, drink it fast.
We leave in five...
Get down!
Stay away from the windows!
Stop!
You'll have six of my best men covering you around the clock.
I guess I'm wondering why we didn't at least have one of your best men covering us now.
He'll be disciplined, sir.
He shot a gun in a residential neighborhood.
I want him fired.
There will be a full investigation, and we'll take the necessary action.
Steve never would've let this happen.
Is he better yet?
Because I would feel a lot safer if he was with us.
Unfortunately, he won't be coming back, sir.
I thought he just had a gallbladder infection.
He did, they found more.
His pancreas, stage four.
Jesus.
Oh, my God.
That's awful.
How much longer does he have?
Not long.
A few weeks.
At least that's what his wife told me.
We have to go see him.
Can you get the information where he is?
Of course.
I'll make sure you get it right away.
Thank you, Captain.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Good night.
Front door.
Yes, sir.
Your weapon.
Your badge, too.
Am I suspended, sir?
You had a suspect on foot, and you fire your gun?
Sir, I realize that...
Do you know how this reflects on me?
That one of our men could be so careless?
Not only do you abandon your post for coffee.
You could've killed a bystander.
That slug was found on somebody's front stoop.
What if it went in their house?
Your badge, Meechum.
Two reasons, which are really the same reason.
I was sick of working for other people, and I knew I could do a better job than my bosses.
They kept trying to suppress me, shutting me out.
So I said, "Fuck it.
I'll do it my way."
And then you just quit?
Not like you did.
I slaved away until I lined up the money to start Slugline.
Once Slugline gets big enough, what's the plan?
Are you gonna sell it like Arianna?
Probably.
And then who knows?
Whatever the next adventure is.
Maybe Shanghai.
So I shouldn't expect to have a job in two years?
Do you ever wanna have any job for more than two years?
What about you?
What's your big plan?
Uh, I don't know yet.
Come on.
Slugline is just a stepping stone for you.
You know what?
I should take this.
Go.
Do your thing.
Hey.
Do you have proof Spinella was behind it?
Put it in context.
Three weeks into a national teachers' strike...
At the home of Francis Underwood, who has led the charge on...
There you go.
Now post that before one of my neighbors calls a local 11:00 hack.
When do I see you next?
I'm background on this.
I'm not your source.
You can't talk now?
No.
When?
Soon, with bells on.
What about "more school books, less bricks"?
No, it's too broad.
We need a better sound bite.
Something specific, something that points the finger directly at Spinella.
He'll deny any involvement.
Well, of course he will.
So how do we get around that?
We say he can't control his troops.
There's no evidence it was a teacher.
Who else could it be?
Look, he's gonna shift blame for the strike back on Congress.
No.
We need something clear, something clean, something that sticks in your head.
"Teachers need a lesson in self-restraint."
No.
You're not hearing me.
People like teachers.
No.
We need something that makes Spinella the villain.
His lack of control, his inability...
Disorganized labor.
It's disorganized labor, plain and simple.
When you've got angry teachers throwing bricks through congressmen's windows, you've gotta blame the union leadership.
We'll be beefing up the security for the entire leadership.
And I strongly encourage Marty Spinella to keep his people in line.
This is starting to look like disorganized labor.
Do you really think Marty Spinella is to blame?
Whether Mr. Spinella is behind this or not, he might wanna tone down the rhetoric, before disorganized labor turns into organized crime.
No one can prove anything.
So that's the most cogent response.
Well, go on TV and say that.
You deplore violence in any form.
It's Congress that should take responsibility.
I don't want to degenerate to Frank's level.
We need to kill this brick thing.
It's distracting people from the issues.
She's right.
It'll eat up one cycle, and it'll disappear.
No.
This story is getting traction.
Support for the strike is dipping.
So is the President's approval ratings.
But he gets to stay in the Oval Office another three years, no matter what.
We can't afford another three weeks.
When I told the unions to strike,
I told them to prepare for the long haul.
All right?
Their accounts dry up, we keep going.
We figure it out.
I am not going to blink over something like this.
Fine.
But if we lose the public relations battle, none of that does us any good.
Frank wants us on the defensive.
I think this story is going to blow over.
If I'm wrong, we'll reevaluate.
But I wanna give it another day or two first.
Okay?
Hi, Adam.
You all right?
I saw the news.
Yes, I'm fine.
That's gotta rattle the nerves.
Brick coming through the window.
It did, some.
So are you staying in the house?
We've got extra security now, so...
Well, it made me think of you, so I figured I'd just check in.
I appreciate that.
We still haven't talked, have we?
There's no need to.
I think we should.
Here's how I see it.
You asked me to come down.
I did.
We both had ideas about what that could mean.
Probably very similar ideas.
But then you changed your mind.
So be it.
There's no reason we can't be in touch or remain friends.
Let's not fool ourselves, Adam.
So I won't call again.
Done.
I'm not saying that.
What are you saying?
I just called because I care about you.
No agenda.
If you wanna talk again, call me.
If not, I understand.
It's up to you.
You think I'm being unreasonable?
I think you're doing whatever it is you need to do, and I'm not gonna question it.
It was sweet of you to call.
Listen, you probably need to get back to work.
I know I do.
I should go.
Yeah.
Okay.
Take care.
Okay.
Frank, you got a minute?
I'll see you inside.
I wanna be governor, and I want your help.
Am I still on the short list?
You are.
I haven't had a drink in over a month.
I'm clean.
Is that because I asked, or because it's what you want?
It was about time I took responsibility for myself.
Taking responsibility is one thing, and it's admirable.
But running for governor of a major state is a whole nother ball game.
Let me tell you something, Frank.
I got elected to Congress 'cause I seized the moment that opportunity struck.
You kept me on that list.
I wanna seize that opportunity.
If you help me out, I'll give you everything I got.
Well, that's all I've been waiting to hear.
All right.
I'll tell you what.
I need to make some calls, check in with some people.
Give me a few days.
I'll get back to you.
Of course.
And, Peter...
I feel like I've met the real you for the first time just now.
Janet.
Is this a bad time?
No.
No, not at all.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were coming.
Here.
Take my chair.
Oh, no.
I'm fine.
I'll take these.
Thank you.
Hello, Steve.
Hey.
These could use some water.
I'll be right back.
Francis and I were so upset when we heard.
I'm sorry I haven't come sooner.
I didn't want too many people knowing.
Yes.
Francis wishes he could be here.
He wants you to know he's praying for you.
Couldn't make it, huh?
No, there's a big teachers' strike going on right now, and he's been stuck in his office for weeks.
I get it.
I saw the news.
The brick.
Right.
I told Francis that probably wouldn't have happened if you were there.
No.
Probably not.
I never seen him pray.
Not in eight years.
You said he was praying for me.
You've seen us in church.
Yeah, but I never went inside.
They're just gorgeous.
Mrs. Underwood, thank you so much.
Please, call me Claire.
I know you got things to do.
Of course.
If you need anything at all, call me.
You have my cell.
Anything at all.
And I'm sorry to have surprised you.
No.
It was so nice of you to come.
Thank you.
I know Steve appreciated it.
Check this out.
It's foam.
How many of these we have?
200.
But I can get more.
Get more.
Bring it on!
You need to give the teachers the respect they deserve.
We can't back away from this, Marty.
We've gotta face it head-on.
They provoked us.
They were throwing foam.
Our guys were throwing punches.
We're gonna come off the bad guys here.
Okay.
Okay.
I get it.
I get it.
But I wanna be smart about this.
I wanna do something definitive that'll put this to bed and get us back on message.
CNN.
One-on-one, you and Underwood.
8:00 tonight.
Frank is excellent in debates.
Go strong against him.
Address the brick right to his face.
End of story.
Underwood says he's in if you are.
Okay.
But I want as much prep as possible, okay?
I want to run questions.
You moderate, you play Underwood.
Wear this one.
Then come in here.
I wanna put powder on you.
Well, there's somebody at the studio can do that.
Yes, and they always cake on too much.
I'm doing it.
War paint.
How bloody do you think it'll be?
I think I oughta be able to dispatch with him easily enough.
You remember Peter Russo?
He's doing well.
He hasn't had a drink in a month.
Good for him.
I like him.
Good, because he could use your help.
How?
We're running him for governor.
Ambitious.
Mm.
We wanna create jobs in his district.
It's on the Delaware River.
I thought we might be able to put a bill together.
Something with an economic upside.
This has to do with the shipyard closing?
We need the shipbuilders' support for his campaign.
You think you might be able to draft a bill that he can sponsor?
I'm really trying to focus on international projects, Francis.
Not domestic legislation.
I understand, but I could really use your help, Claire.
Does Catherine Durant still owe us?
When you make someone Secretary of State, they owe you for life.
We're having trouble getting our water filters through Sudanese customs.
I'll call from the car.
Tomorrow's fine.
I would have done that anyway.
I know.
I'm ready for battle.
You wanna come watch?
No.
You go on ahead.
Come on.
Watch me put the final nail in Spinella's coffin.
It'll be fun.
Marty.
Frank.
Come on, people.
Take your marks.
Congressman, would you like to respond to that?
Yes, I would.
$2 billion of taxpayers' money being wasted.
And Congress should be ashamed of itself for that, Frank.
What?
Did Congress force the teachers to go on strike, Marty?
No, we didn't.
Really, Frank?
When you threaten teachers' ability to negotiate as a union, when you threaten their job security, you threaten their livelihood, of course you force them to strike.
And did we also force them to start throwing bricks at people's houses?
You know what, I'm really glad you brought that up, because you know there's absolutely no proof that that incident had anything to do with this strike.
And I wanna take the opportunity to say publicly that we categorically condemn any use of violence whatsoever, or intimidation.
What you're saying, essentially, is that you can't control your own people.
That's not what I'm saying.
That is what you're saying.
You're disorganized.
Disorganized labor.
You know what, you could keep trotting out that phrase all you like, but you know what I'd like to do, Frank?
I would like to get back to the issue here of educating our children and the fact that Congress is not living up to their commitment.
Well, you know what I would like?
What?
An apology.
If not to me, then to my wife.
When that brick came through our window, it was terrifying.
She's standing right over there.
Claire?
We need camera two on the wife.
Now, why don't you look her in the eye and tell her that your people had nothing to do with that brick.
Are you serious?
Yes.
Okay.
Mrs. Underwood, Claire,
I am sincerely sorry that you had to go through that ordeal, truly.
And it actually sickens me that someone made you feel unsafe in your own home.
And I give you my word that to the best of my knowledge, none of our people had anything to do with it.
But you know what sickens me more?
That right now, your husband is using you as a prop on national television to try and win a debate.
So I think you're the one that owes your wife an apology, Frank.
And when you're done apologizing, can we please get back to the issue here of educating our children?
No.
You've got this wrong, Marty.
There is no "you" and "I" in education.
Well, I mean, yes, there's the letters,
"U" and "I" are in the word education.
But education with a capital "E"...
You know what I'm talking about.
I don't think I do.
Yes, you do, Marty.
"U" and "I", education.
So, we're gonna waste the rest of this debate naming all the vowels in...
I'm happy to play the vowel game.
You wanna play the vowel game with me?
All right."U" think "I"
"O" "U"
"A" apology?
But no, no, no.
"U" "O" "I."
Interesting.
You left out "E" for "Education."
So let...
Defecation.
Edification.
I'm sorry.
LOL.
Uh...
You like Sesame Street so much?
Why don't you give the kids the money they deserve?
What I'm trying to say about education...
Well, I guess school's still in session.
I guess you schooled me there, Marty.
Let's move on.
Please.
Humor aside, there are more important issues out there.
I had no intention of bringing you into this.
It wasn't part of a plan.
I would've told you if it was.
I know.
The idea just struck me, and I went with it.
I don't mind that you improvised.
I just wish you'd done it better.
Congressman Frank Underwood says he got, quote, schooled by AFT spokesman and chief strategist, Martin Spinella, during a debate last night on this network.
In the past 24 hours, reruns of the gaffe have played nonstop on TV news programs and the Internet.
A YouTube clip set to techno music has logged more than 300,000 hits and spawned dozens of other spoofs.
♪ No, no, no
♪ "E" "O" "I"
♪ With a capital "E"
♪ Education LOL ♪
That was as clumsy as the Lee Harvey Oswald prison transfer.
What was he thinking?
Just give me one second.
There's a deli down the street.
Patti, thanks for coming.
Sit down.
You want some coffee?
No, thanks.
I'm good.
Hey, did you see Bill Maher last night?
No, I didn't.
It was about the CNN thing.
I have to admit, Frank, it was kind of funny.
Well, I'll have to catch a rerun.
How you doing?
You holding up all right with the strike?
Let's talk about Pennsylvania.
I have your candidate.
Peter Russo.
1st Congressional District.
We crossed him off.
I know.
It's a mistake.
He's young, he's handsome.
He's bright.
Nobody knows who he is outside of Philadelphia.
There's no donor base, no infrastructure.
You start me off with funding from the DNC and I'll raise an army around this guy.
I will personally oversee his campaign.
Is that the best we can do?
What's better than a blank slate in the right hands?
Ed, you need to go.
Congressman, do you have a moment?
Thank you, Patti.
Have him call me.
I will.
Ed?
Please.
What is going on?
I'm taking care of it.
One second, sir.
Please.
All right.
Make it fast, Meechum.
It's not easy for me to ask this, but I was wondering if you could put in a good word with my boss.
A good word?
They're going to discharge me, sir.
I messed up.
I'm fully aware.
But my job, it means everything to me, and I know a good word from you would...
Look, I have nothing against you personally, Meechum, but I can't get involved in these sort of affairs.
There's protocols and rules.
Sir, please, if you spoke to Cardiff...
There is nothing that I can do.
If anyone could convince the Captain, it would be you, Congressman.
I'm sorry.
I wish you all the best, Meechum.
Doug.
What did Barney Hull say?
That we'd be the first to know.
I can't believe there hasn't been a single 911 call.
There's been plenty.
It's just not the sort we're after.
We got that kid in Atlanta.
No, it's got to be here.
I can't be getting on a plane.
It looks too opportunistic.
Maybe if we open it up a little bit?
No, we cannot lower our standards.
We just have to be patient.
New rule.
Now that the debate's over,
Frank Underwood has to tell us what the hell that was.
Seriously, Congressman, was that a joke?
I haven't seen something just lay there like that since...
I gotta go all the way back to my prom night.
Can we just settle this strike please?
Teachers have been out of the classroom for so long, middle-schoolers are starting to have sex with each other.
Enough.
I don't know why you had it on in the first place.
I love you, Francis.
I know.
We should say that more often to each other.
I need to clear my head.
...north and east of the airport.
I'm gonna need that in time for that meeting.
Peter, let's talk.
So.
I've spoken to Patricia Whittaker.
She's on board.
You'll be getting $4 million in start-up funding from the DNC.
I'll pick the team.
You announce in August.
But the campaign starts today.
Are you ready?
I've already put together a platform.
It's mostly broad strokes, but we can hone it.
Good.
The first thing we need to address is your sobriety.
You don't need to worry about that.
Have you been going to meetings?
You mean AA?
Yes.
That's not really my thing.
If you want my help, then going to meetings is my one requirement.
I know I had a problem, Frank.
I accept that.
And I've taken responsibility for that, but I don't think going to meetings is necessary.
You cannot white-knuckle your recovery, Peter.
This campaign will be the hardest thing you've ever done in your life.
I realize that.
I'm prepared for that.
You think you are.
But we can't take any chances.
The party's investing in you.
I need to make sure you're investing in yourself.
All right.
I'll do whatever I have to do.
Good.
You'll start tomorrow morning.
Doug will take you.
Stamper?
He's been sober 14 years.
Doug has a drinking problem?
Had.
Not anymore.
He'll be your sponsor.
In the meantime, I want you to meet with my wife, Claire.
She runs the Clean Water Initiative.
She's expecting you, so clear your schedule and head over there now.
Frank.
Thank you.
For believing in me.
You're gonna make a great candidate, Peter.
The shipyard closing frees up 1,100 acres of federal land.
Our goal is to pass a Watershed Act for the Delaware River.
We develop the land in an environmentally responsible way, creating jobs in the process.
How many jobs?
Thousands.
We're aiming for the $200 million mark.
We got a lot of work to do.
We do, but you can start with the congressmen whose districts fall within the watershed.
Do you have a draft of the bill you can show me?
We haven't sponsored any environmental legislation.
We'll draft it in consultation with your staff.
Gillian will be the point person on our end.
I don't have any legislation experience.
I'll help you.
When do we start?
We just did.
Will you introduce him to the research team?
I'll be there in one second.
Sure.
Mr. President?
I want it over.
As soon as possible.
Gut the bill, Frank.
Do whatever's necessary to end this.
Mr. President, if we give in now, the public won't credit you with a victory.
Not even a hollow one.
They'll chalk it up as a colossal defeat.
Well, that's on you, Frank.
You let this situation devolve to where it is.
I've already been blamed for the largest teachers' strike in U.S. history.
I won't be held accountable for it dragging on months and months.
Mr. President, we have to end this strike on your terms.
Not anyone else's.
How?
By debating Marty Spinella on CNN?
Sir, you have placed your faith in me thus far.
I would ask that you continue to do so.
Well, whatever you're doing, Frank, isn't working, so I'm stepping in.
Gut the bill.
Like Linda said.
No.
I'm sorry, Mr. President, but I will not do that.
Are you letting pride cloud your judgment, Frank?
Respectfully, sir, you're allowing fear to cloud yours.
Not an easy thing, to say no to the most powerful man in the free world.
But sometimes the only way to gain your superior's respect is to defy him.
What do we have on the schedule, Linda?
Your meeting with the Fed Oversight Committee.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Do you have my briefing?
Right here.
Good.
Let's look it over.
Hi.
How'd it go with Peter?
It went well.
Is he game?
Completely.
Thank you.
That's a big weight off my shoulders.
You sound tired.
Tired.
Impatient.
What can I do?
Nothing.
This one's up to fate.
I don't like when we leave things to fate.
Neither do I.
Does that mean I'm gonna have the bed to myself tonight?
Probably.
Can't Doug man the fort?
Well, he could, but I'd just toss and turn.
If I'm not gonna sleep, I might as well not sleep here.
Well, I'll leave the ringer on.
Call me if you want company.
I will.
Good night.
Good night.
You should go home.
I could take it from here.
Vigilance.
It's good for the soul.
10-59.
Corner of 16th and Q. 10-59.
What's that?
Disorderly conduct.
Do you believe in karma?
Absolutely not.
Well, I do.
At least tonight.
Get Captain Cardiff on the phone.
Let's do something about Meechum.
What?
Get him his job back.
He fired his weapon.
He overreacted.
Cardiff.
On the phone.
Now.
Nancy, give me Captain Cardiff, please.
We might as well do one productive thing while we wait.
It requires very little of me and will mean the world to him.
It's a very inexpensive investment.
Hello, sir.
This is Doug Stamper.
I have Francis Underwood for you.
I got him on.
Captain, I know it's late, but I'd like to talk to you about Edward Meechum.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Are you hungry?
Mm-hmm.
You have any trouble getting in?
No, they made me put it through the X-ray machine twice, so I hope it didn't overcook it.
Frank, you always pay too much.
This is way too much.
It's for the inconvenience.
You know, 20 years you been coming to my joint.
This is the first time I've been to yours.
What do you think?
I could get used to it.
Well, you're welcome any time.
Thank you, Freddy.
Always, Frank.
We got a 27 Delta two. 446 3rd Street...
That's a drive-by shooting.
Get details.
Sir, I want to thank you for talking to the Captain.
He told me you called, and I can't tell you how grateful I am.
I want you to listen very closely to what I'm about to say.
From this moment on, you are a rock.
You absorb nothing, you say nothing, and nothing breaks you.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
Welcome back.
Steve?
I'll leave you be.
Where...
Where's Janet?
She's been here every day for the last few weeks.
I told her, go home, get some rest.
Well, is everything okay?
Your text said it was important.
I don't know how to put this.
The thing is, I...
I've been thinking.
A lot.
About my life.
About the things I haven't done.
Things I haven't said.
I hate your husband.
A lot of people do.
The past eight years, I watched over him.
But it wasn't him I was watching.
And every time I saw you, every time I heard your voice, all I could think to myself was,
"Jesus, what I wouldn't give."
I can't tell you how many times I thought about that.
You know what Francis said to me when he proposed?
I remember his exact words.
He said, "Claire, if all you want is happiness,
"say no.
"I'm not gonna give you a couple of kids
"and count the days until retirement.
"I promise you freedom from that.
"I promise you'll never be bored."
You know, he was the only man, and there were a lot of others who proposed.
But he was the only one who understood me.
He didn't put me on some pedestal.
He knew that I didn't want to be adored or coddled.
So he took my hand and he put a ring on it.
Because he knew I'd say yes.
He's a man who knows how to take what he wants.
Is this what you wanted?
Is that the way you wanted it?
Stop.
Stop.
Please.
Please.
Stop.
Don't.
You told me your truth.
Now you know mine.
Hey, it's Peter.
I don't expect you to call me back, but I wanted to let you know I stopped drinking last night, and I went to my first AA meeting this morning.
I'm supposed to reach out and make amends to those I've hurt.
But I guess the real reason I called you is just to say I love you and I miss you.
I hope you're well.
This is work, not play.
Then why'd you bother coming over?
I was hoping you'd answer the door naked.
That would be play.
That would be work with a view.
Sorry to disappoint.
How many characters in a tweet?
140.
Type this, let me know where you land.
Eight-year-old Washington D.C. boy killed by a stray bullet in gangland shoot-out.
61 characters left.
He should have been in school?
30 left.
Spinella to blame.
Question mark.
128.
Press send.
Now give me a name, details.
Tyler Davis.
Third-grader at Vernon Baker Elementary.
Shot outside his home in Southeast just before noon today.
Sent.
Where are you going?
To see the mother.
You don't wanna...
There's work to do.
I'll see you later tonight.
Tyler never did anything wrong.
He was a good boy.
Everybody loved him.
It's okay.
If Tyler's school had been in session, this senseless killing would have never taken place.
We need to end this strike now and get all our children back in school where they belong, before we risk another death like this.
So, Mr. Spinella, I am headed to the Capitol right now, and I will remain there until you are ready to meet and talk so that we can end this pointless strike.
Thank you all for coming.
Let's go back inside.
Mr. Spinella, one question.
Mr. Spinella is not gonna make comments at this time.
No comment.
No comment.
Thank you.
Frank.
So?
You said you wanted to talk.
You said you wanted to work out a compromise.
I lied.
Excuse me?
I have no intention of working out a compromise.
So then why the fuck are we here, Frank?
What the hell's the matter with you?
You think this is some kind of a game?
No.
These are real people with families to feed.
Would you please stop that?
Stop what?
In five seconds, I'm out of here.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Goodbye, Frank.
You know the difference between you and me, Marty?
What?
I'm a white-trash cracker from a white-trash town that no one would even bother to piss on.
But here's the difference.
I've made something of myself.
I have the keys to the Capitol.
People respect me.
But you, you're still nothing.
You're just an uppity dago in an expensive suit turning tricks for the unions.
Nobody respects the unions anymore, Marty.
They're dying.
And no one respects you.
The most you'll ever make of yourself is blowing men like me.
Men with real power.
Yes.
I can smell the cock on your breath from here.
You think you can get under my skin?
I know I can.
Yeah.
Kiss my ass, Frank.
You can't afford to walk out.
Watch me.
I've got a dead, underprivileged kid in my pocket.
What do you have?
I have two million honorable teachers.
Fair enough.
But I got something even better.
Go ahead.
Open it.
Okay.
I'll play your game.
You're an idiot.
Stamper threw it.
You're full of shit.
Oh no, Stamper threw the brick.
And I made sure Claire distracted my security.
Are you kidding me?
And to think you wanted me to apologize to my wife.
You would do something that low, Frank?
I arranged the brick, Marty, just like I arranged this meeting this afternoon.
Back off, Frank.
Why don't you just get down on your knees where you really belong?
Back off, Frank.
Because the only thing you're gonna get from me is cum on your...
Fuck you!
Everything okay in there, sir?
Look, I'll tell them you provoked me.
I'll tell them that you threw the brick yourself.
And who's going to believe you?
You just assaulted a United States Congressman, which is a felony.
But I'm not gonna press charges, Marty.
Because the strike ends now.
You think it'll leave a scar?
I have a thick skin.
The next time you ask me to invite someone in for coffee, will you please make sure no guns go off?
I'll do my best.
I saw Steve again today.
How is he?
In a lot of pain.
Should I go see him?
I don't think you need to.
Zoe Barnes.
When he dies, we'll pay for his funeral.
You don't need to take it?
No.
I'm done with work today.
SO, GIL, YOU NEED TO PREPARE A ZINGER FOR THE DEBATE.
- WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
YOU KNOW WHAT A ZINGER IS, RIGHT?
BRANDY AND CREME DE MENTHE.
I'M NOT A RUBE, ANDY.
NOT A...
NOT A STINGER, A ZINGER.
IT'S A COMEBACK LINE.
YOU KNOW, LIKE, "I SERVED WITH JACK KENNEDY,
"I KNEW JACK KENNEDY,
"JACK KENNEDY FUCKED A WIFE OF MINE...
BUT YOU, SENATOR..."
"ARE NO JACK KENNEDY."
YOU GAVE ME SIX CARDS.
OH, COME ON, GIL JOHN, YOU GOTTA THINK PREEMPTIVELY.
FOR INSTANCE, WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IF DIGGER WERE TO CALL YOU OUT FOR BEING, LIKE,
A HOTHEAD OR A LOOSE CANNON?
TELL HIM TO SUCK MY CANNON-SIZED...
OH, OH, OH, NO, NO,
SEE, YOU'RE PLAYING RIGHT INTO HIS POINT, RIGHT?
YOU GOTTA TAKE THE HIT, ACCEPT IT,
AND TURN IT AROUND AND USE IT AGAINST HIM,
LIKE JUJITSU.
- RIGHT?
SO FOR INSTANCE, YOU COULD SAY, "WELL, I MAY BE A LOOSE CANNON,
BUT AT LEAST I DON'T SHOOT BLANKS."
GOOD ONE, ROBERT.
THE MAN HAS SIX CHILDREN.
IT'S A POLITICAL METAPHOR, NOT SEXUAL.
AND YOU'LL BE THERE TO EXPLAIN IT TO EVERYONE?
SHOULDN'T GIL JOHN BE USING, LIKE, BASKETBALL METAPHORS?
LIKE "HOT HANDS" OR "GETTING GOOD LOOKS"
- OR "TAKING IT TO THE HOLE."
ENOUGH WITH THE KENNEDYS.
THAT'S ENOUGH OF THIS ASS-CLOWNERY.
I GOTTA GET TO BED, OR DIGGER WILL CLEAN MY CLOCK TOMORROW.
IF YOU THINK OF ANY MORE STINKERS, WRITE 'EM DOWN.
- ZONKERS.
- ZINGER.
- WHATEVER.
- HE'S GONNA BE FINE.
NO, HE'S FUCKED.
SENATOR BIGGS, DID YOU SUPPORT
ADDING ANTI-ABORTION RESTRICTIONS
TO THE NORTH CAROLINA MOTORCYCLE SAFETY BILL?
I DID.
THERE IS NO REASON YOU CAN'T SUPPORT TWO CONSTITUENCIES SIMULTANEOUSLY.
IF YOU CAN FIT BOTH THE UNBORN AND BIKERS UNDER THE SAME BILL,
THEN WHY WOULDN'T YOU?
SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE UNBORN SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO WEAR HELMETS?
- HUH?
- ROBERT!
WHAT?
I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP IT LIGHT.
HE'S TENSE.
WELL, I WANT HIM TENSE.
THIS IS A VERY BIG DEAL.
THERE'S ONLY ONE DEBATE.
- MADDIE...
- IF GIL BLOWS IT,
THIS TIME NEXT YEAR HE'LL BE SELLING REVERSE MORTGAGES.
MADDIE, CAN'T YOU SEE THE MAN'S BRAIN'S ABOUT TO EXPLODE?
HE'S NOT USED TO ALL THIS.
YOU BOTH KNOW I'M SITTING RIGHT HERE, RIGHT?
- SENATOR BIGGS...
- QUICK QUESTION, SENATOR.
MAY WE ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS?
A MOMENT, SIR?
WHAT?
TURNS OUT THERE'S BEEN SOME SORT OF MISCOMMUNICATION.
UM, UH...
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY A DEBATE.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
HOW COULD IT NOT BE A DEBATE?
IT'S A TOWN HALL.
- A TOWN HALL?
YOU MEAN WHERE A BUNCH OF YAHOOS CAN ASK
ANY RANDOM, DUMBASS QUESTIONS THEY WANT?
OH, SENATOR, WELL, IT'S NOT THAT BAD.
THE, UM, YAHOOS ARE HAND-PICKED,
AND THE DUMBASS QUESTIONS ARE SCREENED.
WELL, THERE'S YOUR QUALITY CONTROL RIGHT THERE.
YOU STILL GOT THIS, BIG GUY.
NOW, A TOWN HALL IS NOT A DEBATE, IT'S A PERFORMANCE.
IT'S ONE HALF SEDUCTION, ONE HALF MISDIRECTION,
- AND ONE HALF CONFRONTATION.
- THAT'S THREE HALVES.
YOU CAN'T HAVE THREE HALVES OF A WHOLE.
THIS FROM A MAN WHO'S ALWAYS PRIDED HIMSELF ON GIVING 110%.
IT WAS A CUSHION.
YOU PUT OUT 100% ON THE COURT,
IT LEAVES YOU 10% TO TAKE A SHOWER.
ALL RIGHT, NOW, LISTEN UP, GIL, THIS IS IMPORTANT.
THE TOWN HALL IS ALL ABOUT SITUATIONAL AWARENESS.
IT'S KNOWING WHERE YOU ARE AND WHERE YOUR OPPONENT IS
AT ALL TIMES.
SO WHEN IT'S YOUR TURN,
I WANT YOU TO GO DOWN INTO THE PAINT,
YOU MAKE CONTACT WITH THE CROWD,
THEN YOU GO BACK OUT, AND YOU SET A PICK.
THAT'S NEUTRAL SPACE.
NOW, WHEN IT'S DIGGER'S TURN,
HOLD YOUR GROUND,
FORCING HIM TO EITHER BREAK LEFT OR BREAK RIGHT.
AND WHEN HE MAKES HIS MOVE, YOU SUBTLY SHIFT,
GIVING YOURSELF A 50/50 CHANCE OF MAKING CONTACT.
AND WITH ANY LUCK, HE GOES DOWN, AND IF HE DOES, GIL,
SHOW CONCERN, THEN GENTLY HELP HIM UP.
- PLAY IT CLASSY.
- PLAY IT CLASSY.
AND REMEMBER, CAMERAS ARE ALWAYS ON, SO HOLD THAT SMILE.
NEVER LOOK AT YOUR WATCH, AND NEVER SCRATCH YOUR BALLS.
- PLAY IT CLASSY.
- PLAY IT CLASSY.
NOW, YOU CAN DO THIS, GIL.
NOW, YOU NEED A LITTLE ME TIME?
A LITTLE TIME TO GET IN THE ZONE?
I APPRECIATE THAT, ROBERT, THANK YOU.
SO ARE YOU MORMON, JAMES?
NO.
WELL, YES, BUT NOT REALLY.
MORMONS AREN'T USUALLY THAT AMBIVALENT.
I KNOW, I STRUGGLE WITH IT,
WHICH IS WHY I DON'T CALL MYSELF MORMON.
I THINK IF YOU CALL YOURSELF MORMON, YOU SHOULD BE ALL-IN.
OH, I AGREE.
I'M SORRY THAT YOU'RE NOT ALL-IN, JAMES.
AND I WISH YOU WERE.
I-I WISH I WERE ALL-IN TOO.
MAYBE I COULD BE.
OH, I'D LIKE THAT.
I'LL PRAY FOR YOU, OKAY?
I'LL PRAY FOR YOUR RETURN.
THAT'D BE...
WHOA, UH, HERE'S YOUR DAD.
SENATOR, IT'S LOLA, YOUR DAUGHTER.
SO IT IS.
HOW'D YOUR EXAMS GO, HONEY?
- GREAT.
-OH, GREAT.
I MEAN, YOU TELL.
UM, "A" IN EVERYTHING BUT ISAIAH STUDIES.
WHAT'D WE GET IN ISAIAH STUDIES?
B-PLUS.
THE PROFESSOR HATES ME.
I THINK HE'S A SOCIALIST.
THEN HE MUST BE HAVING THE TIME OF HIS LIFE
AT BRIGHAM YOUNG.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SARCASTIC, DADDY.
WHY DOES EVERYONE IN WASHINGTON USE IRONY SO MUCH?
I DON'T KNOW, HONEY.
- YOU CAN GO NOW.
- YES, SIR.
BUT LEAVE MY DAUGHTER.
OH, SORRY.
THAT WAS DUMB.
HOLD ON, SIR.
OH, NEVER MIND.
TOO MISERABLE TO TALK ANYWAY.
I'M REALLY SORRY, SIR.
WHEN I GET BACK TO THE OFFICE, I REALLY SHOULD FIND OUT
WHY WE HIRED THAT KID.
- WELL, HE'S YOUR GODSON, DEAR.
- OH.
RIGHT.
WHAT WOULD I DO WITHOUT YOU?
OH, YOU'D BE FINE, LITTLE GIANT.
GOD WOULD SHOW YOU THE WAY.
I DON'T KNOW.
HE SENT ME TO AFGHANISTAN.
AND SENATOR ANDY GUZMAN ARRIVED IN WILMINGTON TODAY
TO STUMP FOR SENATE COLLEAGUE LEMAR FARKUS.
SO I URGE ALL THE GOOD-LOOKING PEOPLE OF DELAWARE...
NO, NO, I NEED MORE THAN JUST THE GOOD-LOOKING ONES.
AS WELL AS THE...
PLEASANT-LOOKING PEOPLE OF DELAWARE?
YES, THOSE ARE MY PEOPLE.
STILL LEAVES OUT UGLY PEOPLE.
THEY'RE NOT ALL DEMOCRATS.
THERE'S A TIME TO BRING UGLY PEOPLE INTO THE TENT, KATHERINE.
AFTER DARK, SAY.
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THE EVENT BROUGHT IN 400K.
THAT'S TWICE AS MUCH AS LEMAR HAS EVER RAISED.
GREAT.
HE'LL REMEMBER.
QUICK QUESTION.
YEAH?
WHO'S THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
SOME FLACK, I GUESS.
I'LL BE IN THE HIDEAWAY.
FUCK ME.
WELL, OFF TO A GREAT START.
COULD'VE USED A HEADS-UP ON THAT.
OH, SORRY, MA'AM.
YOU JUST NEVER KNOW WHEN PEOPLE
ARE GOING TO START PRAYING AROUND HERE.
- SNACK, MA'AM?
- HELLO AND WELCOME.
I'M CHANNEL FIVE'S OWN DAN "THE TAN" CIPRIANIA-MALONEY.
NOW, SINCE I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE
OF REPORTING ON BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES
THROUGHOUT THEIR ILLUSTRATIVE SPORTS CAREERS,
STATION THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE FUN IF I MONITORED THIS TOWN HALL.
ALL RIGHT, SO LET'S GET IT GOING.
LET'S GET IT GOING.
HERE WE GO, WHO'S GOT A QUESTION?
FOR ANY OF THE CANDIDATES, EITHER ONE.
UH, HERE WE GO.
MA'AM, YES.
YES, I HAVE A QUESTION FOR COACH MANCUSI.
LOSING FOUR STARTERS LIKE YOU HAVE,
HOW DO YOU KEEP DUKE ON A WINNING TRACK?
SUCH A GOOD QUESTION, MA'AM.
AS YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T RESIGNED YET BECAUSE I'M NOT A QUITTER.
AND I WON'T LEAVE A TEAM MID-SEASON.
BUT IF I CAN KEEP MY BLUE DEVILS FOCUSED,
MAKE SURE THEY LEAVE NOTHING ON THE COURT,
THEN NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS IN THE POSTSEASON,
I CAN GO TO WASHINGTON WITH MY HEAD HELD HIGH.
UH, SENATOR BIGGS.
WHAT?
SIR, HOW WOULD YOU KEEP DUKE ON A WINNING TRACK?
WELL...
I'D CHANGE COACHES.
OKAY, A LITTLE STUMBLE.
GOOD LINE, COULD'VE WORKED.
AUDIENCE IS A LITTLE COLD.
NEXT...
NEXT QUESTION.
ANYONE?
SENATOR BIGGS,
DO YOU THINK ED...
EDUCATION RE...
RE...
REFORM?
NO, IT'S RE...
RA...
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T MAKE OUT MY WIFE'S HANDWRITING.
BEEN THERE, DUDE.
NOT ME, MY WIFE PATRICIA AND I
HAVE NO PROBLEMS AT ALL COMMUNICATING, VERY CLOSE.
- THAT'S NICE.
THAT'S SWEET.
UNFORCED ERROR.
"BEEN THERE, DUDE"?
CONGRESSMAN,
I'M SICK AND TIRED OF OUR NINNY GOVERNMENT
TELLING ME HOW TO SPEND MY OWN FOOD STAMPS.
- CAN YOU FIX THAT?
- DON'T TREAD ON ME.
GREAT QUESTION.
SENATOR.
FIX WHAT, SIR?
WHAT IS IT YOU CAN'T BUY?
FIREARMS.
I WORKED HARD FOR THOSE FOOD STAMPS.
AND I GOT A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO THE PURSUIT OF PLEASURE.
GUNS PLEASURE ME.
WHY CAN'T YOU BUY 'EM ON CREDIT LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE?
I'M SORRY, SENATOR, BUT I'LL JUMP IN HERE...
- SORRY, COACH, BUT YOU CAN'T.
- WELL, I'D LIKE TO.
'CAUSE WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME.
CHECK YOUR WATCH.
- NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO!
- OH.
STEP AWAY FOR A FEW.
PAY SOME BILLS,
GIVE THE GUYS A BATHROOM BREAK,
AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ROUND TWO.
I'M DAN "THE TAN." YOU STAY TUNED.
I THINK JAMES IS TAKEN WITH OUR LOLA.
CLEARLY.
YOU KNOW, BACK IN THE DAY, THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM.
SHE'D BE 3,000 MILES AWAY.
BUT, GOD, WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING ONLINE?
COULD BE SOMETHING PREMATURE OR INAPPROPRIATE.
- WE'D NEVER KNOW ABOUT IT.
- WELL, I TRUST OUR DAUGHTER.
TRUST, BUT VERIFY.
THAT'S WHAT REAGAN ALWAYS DID.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, HON?
TWO OF HIS KIDS BECAME DEMOCRATS.
SENATOR.
- MRS. LAFFER.
- OH, WHAT IS IT, SHELBY?
TIME FOR ME TO SAY GOOD-BYE.
I'M HEADED BACK TO RENO.
WHAT?
YOU'VE BEEN PULLED OFF THE STORY?
OH, NO, SIR.
I'M JUST PIVOTING TO YOUR BACKGROUND.
GONNA INTERVIEW SOME OF YOUR CHILDHOOD FRIENDS.
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY CHILDHOOD FRIENDS.
OH, DON'T WORRY, SIR.
I'M NOT GONNA BE ASKING ANYTHING EMBARRASSING.
SERIOUSLY, I DIDN'T HAVE ANY CHILDHOOD FRIENDS.
EXCEPT JESUS.
RIGHT, HON?
OKAY, JESUS.
BUT JESUS WAS FRIENDS WITH EVERYBODY.
IT'S NOT LIKE WE SHOT MARBLES.
I'LL DIG SOMETHING UP, SIR.
IT'S NO PROBLEM.
SHELBY, THAT'S THE VERY DEFINITION OF A PROBLEM.
TRUST ME, SIR.
YOUR STORY WRITES ITSELF.
SIR.
MA'AM.
I'LL SEE YA.
DO YOU TRUST THE STORY TO WRITE ITSELF?
WELL, DEPENDS ON WHETHER YOU'RE HIDING ANYTHING, DEAR.
ADRIANA DE PORTAGO.
SHE'S LIKE A SERIOUS PLAYER IN SOUTH FLORIDA, RIGHT?
I DID NOT KNOW THAT GOING IN,
BUT I'VE SINCE BEEN SCHOOLED ON THAT POINT.
AND SHE'S RIDICULOUSLY HOT, RIGHT?
LIKE, AT AN ELITE LEVEL?
YEAH, THAT'S HER.
- OH, SHIT.
YOU COME INTO MY HOUSE,
AND YOU SHOW ME THIS KIND OF DISRESPECT?
BEGINNER'S LUCK.
I WISH I CARED MORE.
AH, FUCK YOU.
COME ON.
- SHOULD I COME BACK?
- HELL, NO.
NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE, WE CAN GET SOMETHING DONE.
- SHIT'S TOO EASY.
- YEAH, WHEN NO ONE'S DEFENDING.
THAT'S YOUR WHOLE GAME, IS TO DISTRACT.
I'M SURE THERE'S A SIMILE FOR THIS MEETING IN THERE SOMEWHERE.
DON'T CARE FOR SIMILES.
NONE OF THIS "LIKE" BULLSHIT.
I'M A METAPHOR MAN.
IF I TELL YOU I'M GONNA RIP SOMEBODY'S FACE OFF,
I WANT YOU TO VISUALIZE IT.
YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO WATCH THE BIGGS DEBATE?
IT'S ALREADY STARTED.
CHANNEL 61.
HEY, THANKS.
HOPE YOU'LL JOIN US.
WE SHOULD TALK.
SORRY.
I REALLY DO HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO.
HMM, LIKE WHAT?
LIKE MAYBE GIVING A GUY A RECORD,
OF WHICH HE HAS NONE?
SERIOUSLY, KATHERINE, NOT A SINGLE BILL WITH HIS NAME ON IT.
ISN'T THAT WHAT A CHIEF OF STAFF DOES?
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE CREATING A NARRATIVE?
I'M GOING NOW.
SO I'M RIGHT.
YOU STILL GOT NOTHING.
ALL THE BETTER THAT I'M HERE TO HELP.
YOU BROUGHT A BILL?
YOU ARROGANT SON OF A BITCH.
GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY LANE.
WHOOPS, TOO LATE.
HEY, IT'S DAN "THE TAN."
WELCOME BACK TO THE SECOND HALF OF OUR TOWN HALL DEBATE.
AND KICKING IT OFF IS A STUDENT RIGHT HERE FROM ST.
JAMES HIGH.
HI, COACH MANCUSI.
MY NAME IS MICHAEL HICKENLOOPER.
LAST YEAR, THE STATE LEGISLATURE PASSED A BILL THAT SAYS
WE 17-YEAR-OLDS CAN NO LONGER PREREGISTER TO VOTE.
DO YOU THINK THAT'S RIGHT?
SON, I LIKE YOUNG PEOPLE.
I SPENT YEARS RECRUITING THEM.
I RESPECT THEIR SKILLS.
MA'AM?
I-I...
I THINK WE HAVE A BARN DOOR ISSUE.
- AND HE'S ON THE MOVE.
- MY GOD, WHERE IS HE GOING?
BUT AS A PARENT, I WANT MY KIDS TO VOTE RESPONSIBLY.
JUST AS I WOULD WANT THEM TO BINGE RESPONSIBLY
OR HOOK UP RESPONSIBLY.
YOU SEE, SON, HISTORY SHOWS US
THAT YOUNGER VOTERS JUST AREN'T READY.
IS IT OVER?
THEY'RE TOO LIKELY TO VOTE IMPULSIVELY.
TO MAKE BAD CHOICES.
THAT'S WHY THE NORTH CAROLINA LEGISLATURE
WISELY CREATED A COOLING-OFF PERIOD.
TO GIVE YOUNG PEOPLE EXTRA TIME TO MATURE.
THAT'S JUST COMMON SENSE.
YOU TRACKING ME, SON?
YES, SIR.
THANK YOU, COACH.
GREAT ANSWER, COACH.
ALL RIGHT, WHO'S GOT MY NEXT QUESTION?
YES, MA'AM.
LOVELY LADY.
HI, MY NAME IS CINDY TULL...
WHOA, WHOA, WHAT THE HEY, BUDDY?
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY TURN?
I'M SORRY, SENATOR.
DID YOU WANT TO WEIGH IN ON THAT QUESTION?
BECAUSE, WELL, I'M THINKING COACH MANCUSI
PRETTY MUCH NAILED THAT ONE.
WELL, THAT'S NOT HOW DEBATES WORK, YOU PINHEAD.
'SCUSE ME?
HELLO?
- I BELIEVE I HAVE THE FLOOR.
- NO, YOU DON'T.
I STILL HAVE TWO MINUTES LEFT TO REBUT.
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN A SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN
WOULD NEVER INTERRUPT A LADY.
I REMEMBER IT WELL, MS. TULL.
THAT'S HOW I WAS RAISED.
YES, SIR.
ALL RIGHT, COME ON, WHO'S GOT A TOUGH ONE FOR THE CANDIDATES?
HERE WE GO.
YOU, SIR.
COACH DIGGER, HOW IMPORTANT WOULD YOU SAY
DISCIPLINE AND SELF-CONTROL ARE IN THE GAME OF POLITICS?
I THINK THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT, SIR.
NOW, I KNOW MY OPPONENT AND I
DON'T SEE EYE-TO-EYE ON THIS ISSUE.
AND I RESPECT THAT.
AND FRANKLY,
I DON'T CARE HOW MANY ANGER MANAGEMENT CLASSES
SENATOR BIGGS MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE SKIPPED THROUGH THE YEARS,
BUT THE FACT IS HE IS STILL VERY MUCH A LOOSE CANNON.
I THINK NORTH CAROLINIANS DESERVE BETTER.
WELL, COACH, I MAY BE A LOOSE CANNON,
BUT AT LEAST I DON'T FIRE BLANKS.
MY...
SENATOR, AS EVERYONE KNOWS,
MY WIFE AND I, LIKE MANY OTHER COUPLES,
HAVE STRUGGLED WITH INFERTILITY.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M ANY LESS OF A FATHER
TO OUR SIX ADOPTED CHILDREN.
AND WE ARE OUTTA TIME!
OKAY, I WANT TO THANK COACH YOU'RE-THE-MAN-CUSI.
WHO THE FUCK GAVE HIM THAT LINE?
- ALWAYS AN HONOR, SIR.
- OH!
FOR ALL OF US HERE ON CHANNEL FIVE,
I'M DAN "THE TAN" CIPRIANIA-MALONEY,
SAYING, SEE YA, NORTH CAROLINA!
YOU READ ABOUT PEOPLE SETTING THEMSELVES ON FIRE,
BUT YOU NEVER REALLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN YOUR OWN LIFETIME.
COME ON!
COME ON, GIVE ME SOME.
GOTTA GET SOME AT THE TOP.
- THERE'S YOUR MONEY SHOT.
- GO, DIGGER.
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.
WAY TO GO, COACH.
- ALL RIGHT, COACH.
- ALL RIGHT.
DILLY.
GRAY.
YOU WATCH THE MANCUSI-BIGGS TOWN HALL?
I KNOW, I KNOW, HEY,
I TEACH A COURSE AT THE NEW SCHOOL IN CAMPAIGN TRAIN WRECKS,
AND THIS IS THE WORST I'VE EVER SEEN.
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK THE DAMAGE IS?
REALLY?
ALL RIGHT, THANKS.
TALK SOON.
DILLY DESANTIS.
ANALYTICS GUY I WORK WITH.
HE PREDICTS BIGGS WILL BE DOWN 9.75%
IN TOMORROW'S TRACKING POLL.
AND YOU HEARD THAT NUMBER IN REAL TIME.
OH, MEETING MUST BE OVER.
MIND IF I STAY AND PICK KATHERINE'S BIG BRAIN?
WHY ARE YOU ASKING HIM?
BECAUSE, KATHERINE, I'VE NOTICED
THAT EVEN THOUGH ANDY'S HAPPY TO WASTE HIS OWN TIME,
HE NEVER WASTES YOURS.
HAVE AT EACH OTHER.
THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL, LOUISE.
YOU'VE REALLY TAKEN YOUR CRAFT UP A LEVEL.
YOU THINK?
I WAS SO DISTRACTED BY YOUR PROCEDURES.
NO, NO, THEY'RE GREAT.
YOU COULD SELL THESE.
OH !
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE?
WOW.
HARD TO SAY.
BUT YOU KNOW, I'M PARTIAL TO AN AUTUMNAL PALETTE.
HEY, HURT LOCKER !
HOW'S IT GOING?
YOU MAKE ALL THOSE?
AMAZING.
ISN'T THE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY HERE THE BEST?
- I MADE 'EM, ROSE.
- WELL, SUCH A CREATIVE FAMILY.
LISTEN, I'VE GOT GREAT NEWS.
MY OFFICE FINALLY LINKED UP WITH THE STAIR LIFT PEOPLE,
AND THEY GOT IT ALL INSTALLED TODAY.
YOU, MY FRIEND, ARE GOOD TO GO.
REALLY?
THEY SAID THREE WEEKS!
- ROSE HAS JUICE.
- TELL THAT TO MY CABLE GUY.
DON'T GET LOUIS STARTED ON THAT SUBJECT.
YEAH, ONE OF MY HOT BUTTONS, FOR SURE.
ANYWAY, NOW THAT YOU'RE GOING HOME,
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A SMALL FAITH GATHERING IN THE HOUSE
TO THANK THE ALMIGHTY FOR THE BLESSING OF YOUR RETURN?
I THINK THAT'S A TERRIFIC IDEA.
DON'T YOU, LOUIS?
I DON'T KNOW, ROSE.
I'M NO HERO.
NOT SAYING YOU ARE, HONEY.
I JUST THINK A LITTLE PRAYER CIRCLE MIGHT BE IN ORDER.
ECUMENICAL, OF COURSE.
CAN'T JUST BE MORMONS.
WELL, THERE WON'T BE SHOUTING, WILL THERE, ROSE?
I HEAR YOU SHOUT IN CHICAGO.
NO, LOUISE.
NO CALL AND RESPONSE.
JUST A FEW PRAYERS.
WE DO THIS SORT OF THING ALL THE TIME NOW.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
I'LL BE HAPPY TO ORGANIZE IT.
YOU TWO HAVE YOUR HANDS FULL
WITH PHYSICAL THERAPY AND WHATNOT.
I'LL HAVE MY STAFF PUT THIS TOGETHER FOR NEXT SATURDAY.
NO, SUNDAY.
WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO FOLD IN THE JEWS.
JUST DON'T INVITE ANYONE
WITHOUT COORDINATING IT WITH MY OFFICE, THOUGH, OKAY?
THIS IS GOING TO BE STRESSFUL ENOUGH
PULLING TOGETHER A LIST OF NAMES
WHO ARE NOT GONNA BE AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS.
I'VE DONE A MILLION OF THESE, SO I KNOW ALL THE PITFALLS.
LATER!
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
I KNOW.
YIKES.
YEAH.
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT FOLDING IN JEWS?
OH, YEAH.
HEY.
HI, BEAUTIFUL LADY IN MY BEDROOM.
HEY, HANDSOME LAWMAKER IN A SILLY, LITTLE CHAIR.
YEAH, HERO GUY'S COMING HOME.
WE'RE GONNA TRICK OUT THE HOUSE.
WHAT YOU DOING?
THE SUITE AT THE RITZ IS READY,
SO BENNY IS HELPING ME MOVE IN THIS AFTERNOON.
- OH, BENNY?
- ANDY.
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A BUSINESS AND A LIFE,
AND IF I WASN'T SO CRAZY ABOUT MY HANDSOME LAWMAKER,
I WOULD BE CONDUCTING BOTH IN MIAMI INSTEAD OF COMMUTING.
SO GIVE ME A BREAK.
AND YOU KNOW, IT WOULDN'T HURT IF YOU WENT BACK
TO FLORIDA SOMETIME, YOU KNOW, INSTEAD OF, SAY, DELAWARE?
HEY, I THOUGHT YOU'D BE PLEASED.
WE'RE LAYING GROUNDWORK FOR THE BIG PUSH AHEAD.
SPEAKING OF BIG PUSH...
OH, YEAH, 'CAUSE THERE'S NOTHING
THAT TURNS ME ON MORE THAN A DOUBLE ENTENDRE.
OH, YOU WANT A SINGLE ENTENDRE?
HUH?
YOU WANT TO BE SINGLE ENTENDRE'D?
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
YES, PLEASE.
- I'M SORRY, MAN.
- NOT YOUR FAULT.
- KINDA IS.
I WAS ON THE ROPES BEFORE THE COUP DE GRAS.
GOT NO ONE BUT MYSELF TO BLAME.
I LET DIGGER GET INTO MY HEAD.
BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING, ROBERT?
IF YOU ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THAT DILL WEED,
WHICH I DID, SINCE I HAD A LOT OF FREE TIME OUT THERE,
THE GUY'S GOT NOTHING.
SERIOUSLY, HE'S A FUCKING FEATHER, AN AMATEUR.
- I CAN TAKE HIM.
- I BELIEVE YOU, GIL JOHN.
BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP,
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'VE GOT A LOT ON YOUR MIND.
WHAT WITH THIS ETHICS THING DOGGING YOU
AND POSSIBLE EXPULSION.
I APPRECIATE YOU TRYING TO HAVE MY BACK.
DON'T MENTION IT.
YES, SIR.
IF I APPLY MYSELF, I CAN WIN THIS PUPPY.
HEY, ANDY.
- LIKE THAT?
- MM-HMM.
- REALLY?
LIKE THAT?
- MM-HMM.
HEY, ROBERT.
I FORGOT MY YOGA MAT UPSTAIRS.
(c)CREATED AND SYNCH BY KIBERLINE
We're almost a month into the strike, and we've got millions of kids stuck home from school.
Do you blame the White House or Congress?
I personally have very little sympathy for the teachers.
We're over three weeks into this strike.
It's costing the country billions of dollars, and instead of offering solutions--
There's a big difference between taking a stand and sitting on your hands.
I don't know whether to call it cowardice...
It's his agenda, and the problem is that he stole sound, conservative ideas.
The only smart thing he's done is lift his platform from the republican platform.
I admit it, Linda.
This got away from me.
But we can't turn back time.
We have to hold our ground.
While our approval ratings continue to nosedive?
Spinella and I worked together for years on dozens of labor-related bills.
- I thought he'd be reasonable.
- You were wrong about that.
Well, I didn't think he'd be insane enough to go on strike, and I didn't think the strike would last this long.
So you've been wrong twice about this.
Why should I believe you're right about holding out?
We threatened collective bargaining in order to get performance standards and charter funding.
That's the deal that we made.
We took that stand.
We lay down now, we lose it all.
There'll be no reform, just an empty bill.
I understand the logic, Frank, but we're in damage control now.
We can't close one wound by opening another.
But we're the democrats.
We're the ones who are supposed to be defending the teachers.
But you can't have it both ways, Linda.
You can't have the reform you want and keep the teachers happy at the same time.
You knew that when we started.
Okay, then if we have to choose, we choose to keep the teachers happy.
That is a mistake, Linda.
We've already crossed the rubicon.
I'm telling you this-- the president wants to change the bill.
We should've done it three weeks ago.
We didn't.
So you have to do it now.
Give me more time, Linda, please.
If I can break this strike and get everything we want in this bill, can we agree that's preferable to folding?
Of course.
If we can count on that--
Then count on me for just one more week.
If the strike isn't over by then, I'll change the bill.
- Frank--
- No.
One more week.
That's all.
This is the worst possible position to be in.
If I water down the bill, the president will still me as a failure.
If the strike doesn't end in a week, I forced myself into a corner.
Only total victory will put me back in his good graces.
The alternative is exile, which would mean the last five months were for nothing.
I cannot abide falling back to square one.
You need me, ma'am?
No.
I just was wondering if you wanted a cup of coffee.
I just brewed a fresh pot.
- I'm good, ma'am.
But thanks.
- Are you sure?
My shift's done in a couple hours.
I'll be fine.
No.
Come on.
Stretch your legs.
I won't take no for an answer.
What did you do before you joined the leadership detail?
I was a cop here in DC.
Before that, I was in the Marines, ma'am.
- Thank you.
- Did you serve overseas?
I did, ma'am.
Bahrain, then Afghanistan.
Served most of my second tour in the Korangal Valley.
You wanna know if I killed anyone?
I think I know the answer.
- I got a dinner meeting with birch.
- I invited him in for coffee.
Well, drink it fast.
We leave in five...
Get down!
Stay away from the windows!
Stop!
You'll have six of my best men covering you around the clock.
I guess I'm wondering why we didn't at least have one of your best men covering us now.
He'll be disciplined, sir.
He shot a gun in a residential neighborhood.
- I want him fired.
- There will be a full investigation, and we'll take the necessary action.
Steve never would've let this happen.
Is he better yet?
Because I would feel a lot safer if he was with us.
Unfortunately, he won't be coming back, sir.
I thought he just had a gallbladder infection.
He did, but they found more.
His pancreas, stage four.
- Jesus.
- Oh, my God.
That's awful.
How much longer does he have?
Not long.
A few weeks.
At least that's what his wife told me.
We have to go see him.
Can you get the information where he is?
Of course.
I'll make sure you get it right away.
- Thank you, Captain.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Good night.
- Front door.
- Yes, sir.
Your weapon.
Your badge too.
Am I suspended, sir?
You had a suspect on foot, and you fire your gun?
- Sir, I realize that--
- Do you know how this reflects on me?
That one of our men could be so careless?
Not only do you abandon your post for coffee...
You could've killed a bystander.
That slug was found in somebody's front stoop.
What if it went in their house?
Your badge, Meechum.
Two reasons, which are really the same reason.
I was sick of working for other people, and I knew I could do a better job than my bosses.
They kept trying to suppress me, shutting me out.
So I said, "fuck it.
I'll do it my way."
- Then you just quit?
- Not like you did.
I slaved away until I lined up the money to start Slugline.
Once Slugline gets big enough, what's the plan?
Are you gonna sell it like Arianna?
Probably.
And then who knows?
Whatever the next adventure is.
Maybe Shanghai.
So I shouldn't expect to have a job in two years?
Do you ever wanna have any job for more than two years?
What about you?
What's your big plan?
Uh, I don't know yet.
Come on.
Slugline is just a stepping stone for you.
- You know what?
I should take this.
- Go.
Do your thing.
Hey.
You have proof Spinella was behind it?
Put it in context.
Three weeks into a national teachers' strike--
At the home of Francis Underwood, who has led the charge on--
There you go.
Now post that before one of my neighbors calls a local 11:00 hack.
- When do I see you next?
- I'm background on this.
I'm not your source.
You can't talk now?
- No.
- When?
Soon, with bells on.
What about "more school books, less bricks"?
Nah, it's too broad.
We need a better sound bite.
Something specific, something that points the finger directly at Spinella.
- He'll deny any involvement.
- Of course he will.
- So how do we get around that?
- We say he can't control his troops.
- There's no evidence it was a teacher.
- Who else could it be?
He's gonna shift blame for the strike back on congress.
No.
We need something clear, something clean, something that sticks in your head.
"Teachers need a lesson in self-restraint."
No.
You're not hearing me.
People like teachers.
No.
We need something that makes Spinella the villain.
- His lack of control, his inability--
- Disorganized labor.
It's disorganized labor, plain and simple.
When you've got angry teachers throwing bricks through congressmen's windows, you've gotta blame the union leadership.
We'll be beefing up the security for the entire leadership.
And I strongly encourage Marty Spinella to keep his people in line.
This is starting to look like disorganized labor.
Do you really think Marty Spinella is to blame?
Whether Mr. Spinella is behind this or not, he might wanna tone down the rhetoric before disorganized labor turns into organized crime.
No one can prove anything.
So that's the most cogent response.
Well, go on TV and say that.
You deplore violence in any form.
It's congress that should take responsibility.
I don't want to degenerate to Frank's level.
We need to kill this brick thing.
It's distracting people from the issues.
She's right.
It'll eat up one cycle, and it'll disappear.
No.
This story is getting traction.
Support for the strike is dipping.
So is the president's approval ratings.
But he gets to say in the oval office another three years, no matter what.
We can't afford another three weeks.
When I told the unions to strike,
I told them to prepare for the long haul.
All right?
Their accounts dry up, we keep going.
We figure it out.
I am not going to blink over something like this.
Fine.
But if we lose the public relations battle, none of that does us any good.
Frank wants us on the defensive.
I think this story is going to blow over.
If I'm wrong, we'll reevaluate.
But I wanna give it another day or two first.
Okay?
Hi, Adam.
You all right?
I saw the news.
Yes, I'm fine.
That's gotta rattle the nerves--
A brick coming through the window.
It did, some.
So are you staying in the house?
We've got extra security now, so...
Well, um, it made me think of you, so I figured I'd just check in.
I appreciate that.
We still haven't talked, have we?
- There's no need to.
- I think we should.
Here's how I see it.
You asked me to come down.
I did.
We both had ideas about what that could mean.
Probably very similar ideas.
But then you changed your mind.
So be it.
There's no reason we can't be in touch or remain friends.
Let's not fool ourselves, Adam.
So I won't call again.
- Done.
- I'm not saying that.
What are you saying?
I just called because I care about you.
No agenda.
If you wanna talk again, call me.
If not, I understand.
It's up to you.
You think I'm being unreasonable?
I think you're doing whatever it is you need to do, and I'm not gonna question it.
It was sweet of you to call.
Listen, you probably need to get back to work.
I know I do.
I should go.
Yeah.
Okay.
- Take care.
- Okay.
- Frank, you got a minute?
- I'll see you inside.
I wanna be governor, and I want your help.
- Am I still on the short list?
- You are.
I haven't had a drink in over a month.
I'm clean.
Is that because I asked, or because it's what you want?
It was about time I took responsibility for myself.
Taking responsibility is one thing, and it's admirable.
But running for governor of a major state is a whole other ball game.
Let me tell you something, Frank.
I got elected to congress 'cause I seized the moment that opportunity struck.
You kept me on that list.
I wanna seize that opportunity.
If you help me out, I'll give you everything I got.
Well, that's all I've been waiting to hear.
All right.
I'll tell you what.
I need to make some calls, check in with some people.
Give me a few days.
I'll get back to you.
- Of course.
- And, Peter...
I feel like I've met the real you for the first time just now.
Janet.
- Is this a bad time?
- No.
No, not at all.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were coming.
Here.
Take my chair.
- Oh, no.
I'm fine.
- I'll take these.
Thank you.
- Hello, Steve.
- Hey.
These could use some water.
I'll be right back.
Francis and I were so upset when we heard.
I'm sorry I haven't come sooner.
I didn't want too many people knowing.
Yes.
Francis wishes he could be here.
He wants you to know he's praying for you.
- Couldn't make it, huh?
- No, there's a big teachers' strike going on right now, and he's been stuck in his office for weeks.
I get it.
I saw on the news.
- The brick.
- Right.
I told Francis that probably wouldn't have happened if you were there.
No.
Probably not.
I never seen him pray.
Not in eight years.
You said he was praying for me.
You've seen us in church.
Yeah, but...
I never went inside.
They're just gorgeous.
Mrs. Underwood, thank you so much.
Please, call me Claire.
- I know you got things to do.
- Of course.
If you need anything at all, call me.
You have my cell.
Anything at all.
And I'm sorry to have surprised you.
No.
It was so nice of you to come.
Thank you.
I know Steve appreciated it.
Check this out.
It's foam.
- How many of these we have?
- 200.
But I can get more.
Get more.
Bring it on!
You need to give the teachers the respect they deserve.
We can't back away from this, Marty.
- We've gotta face it head-on.
- They provoked us.
They were throwing foam.
Our guys were throwing punches.
We're gonna come off the bad guys here.
Okay.
Okay.
I get it.
I get it.
But I wanna be smart about this.
I wanna do something definitive that'll put this to bed
- and get us back on message.
- CNN, one on one, you and Underwood.
8:00 tonight.
Frank is excellent in debates.
Go strong against him.
Address the brick right to his face.
- End of story.
- Underwood says he's in if you are.
Okay.
But I want as much prep as possible, okay?
I want to run questions.
You moderate, you play Underwood.
Wear this one.
Then come in here.
I wanna put powder on you.
Well, somebody at the studio can do that.
Yes, and they always cake on too much.
I'm doing it.
War paint.
How bloody do you think it'll be?
Oh, I think I oughta be able to dispatch with him easily enough.
Oh, you remember Peter Russo?
He's doing well.
He hasn't had a drink in a month.
Oh, good for him.
I like him.
Oh, good, because he could use your help.
- How?
- We're running him for Governor.
- Ambitious.
- Mmm.
We wanna create jobs in his district.
It's on the Delaware River.
I thought we might be able to put a bill together.
Something with an economic upside.
This has to do with the shipyard closing?
We need the shipbuilders' support for his campaign.
You think you might be able to draft a bill that he can sponsor?
I'm really trying to focus on international projects, Francis.
Not domestic legislation.
I understand, but I could really use your help, Claire.
Does Catherine durant still owe us?
When you make someone Secretary of State, they owe you for life.
We're having trouble getting our water filters through sudanese customs.
- I'll call from the car.
- Tomorrow's fine.
- I would have done that anyway.
- I know.
I'm ready for battle.
You wanna come watch?
- No.
You go on ahead.
- Oh, come on.
Watch me put the final nail in Spinella's coffin.
It'll be fun.
Marty.
Frank.
Come on, people.
Take your marks.
Congressman, would you like to respond to that?
Yes, I would.
Two billion dollars of taxpayer's money being wasted.
And congress should be ashamed of itself for that, Frank.
Oh, what?
Did congress force the teachers to go on strike?
- No, we didn't.
- Really, Frank?
When you threaten teachers' ability to negotiate as a union, when you threaten their job security, you threaten their livelihood, of course you force them to strike.
And did we also force them to start throwing bricks at people's houses?
I'm really glad you brought that up, because you know there's absolutely no proof that that incident had anything to do with this strike.
And I wanna take the opportunity to say publicly that we categorically condemn any use of violence whatsoever or intimidation.
What you're saying essentially is that you can't control your own people.
- That is not what I'm saying.
- That is what you're saying.
You're disorganized.
- Disorganized labor.
- You can keep trotting out that phrase all you like, but you know what I'd like to do, Frank?
I would like to get back to the issue here of educating our children and the fact that congress is not living up to their commitment.
Well, you know what I would like?
What?
An apology.
If not to me, then to my wife.
When that brick came through our window, it was terrifying.
She's standing right over there.
- Claire?
- We need camera two on the wife.
Now, why don't you look her in the eye and tell her that your people had nothing to do with that brick.
- Are you serious?
- Yes.
Okay.
Mrs. Underwood, Claire,
I am sincerely sorry that you had to go through that ordeal, truly.
And it actually sickens me that someone made you feel unsafe in your own home.
And I give you my word that to the best of my knowledge, none of our people had anything to do with it.
But you know what sickens me more?
That right now, your husband is using you as a prop on national television to try and win a debate.
So I think you're the one that owes your wife an apology, Frank.
And when you're done apologizing, can we please get back to the issue here of educating our children?
No.
You've got this wrong, Marty.
There is no "you" and "I" in education.
Well, I mean, yes, there's the letters
"U" and "I" are in the word "education."
But "Education" with a capital E...
You know what I'm talking about.
I don't think I do.
Yes, you do, Marty.
U and I-
- Education.
So, what, we're gonna waste the rest of this debate naming all the vowels in--
I'm happy to play the vowel game.
You wanna play the vowel game with me?
All right.
U think I O
U A apology.
But no, no, no.
U O I...
Interesting.
You left out E for "Education."
- So let--
- Defecation--
Edification.
I'm sorry.
LOL.
Uh, uh...
Uh...
You like sesame street so much?
Why don't you give the kids the money they deserve?
What I'm trying to say about education...
Well,
I guess school's still in session.
I guess you schooled me there, Marty.
Let's move on.
Please.
Humor aside, there are more important issues out there.
I had no intention of bringing you into this.
It wasn't part of a plan.
I would've told you if it was.
I know.
The idea just struck me, and I went with it.
I don't mind that you improvised.
I just wish you'd done it better.
Congressman Frank Underwood says he got, quote, "schooled"
by AFT spokesman and chief strategist, Martin Spinella, during a debate last night on this network.
In the past 24 hours, reruns of the gaffe have played non-stop on TV news programs and the internet.
A YouTube clip set to techno music has logged more than 300,000 hits and spawned dozens of other spoofs.
♪ No ♪
♪ No ♪
♪ E O I ♪
♪ with a capital "E" ♪
♪ education LOL ♪
That was as clumsy as the Lee Harvey Oswald prison transfer.
What was he thinking?
Just give me one second.
There's a deli.
Down the street.
Patti, thanks for coming.
Sit down.
You want some coffee?
No, thanks.
I'm good.
Hey, did you see bill Maher last night?
No, I didn't.
Oh, it was about the CNN thing.
I have to admit, Frank, it was kinda funny.
Well, I'll have to catch a rerun.
How you doing?
You holding up all right with the strike?
Let's talk about Pennsylvania.
I have your candidate.
Peter Russo.
First Congressional District.
We crossed him off.
I know.
It's a mistake.
He's young, he's handsome.
He's bright.
Nobody knows who he is outside of Philadelphia.
There's no donor base, no infrastructure.
You start me off with funding from the DNC and I'll raise an army around this guy.
I will personally oversee his campaign.
Is that the best we can do?
What's better than a blank slate in the right hands?
Ed, you need to go.
Congressman, do you have a moment?
Thank you, Patti.
- Have him call me.
- I will.
Ed?
Please.
- What is going on?
- I'm taking care of it.
One second, sir.
Please.
All right.
Make it fast, Meechum.
It's not easy for me to ask this, but I was wondering if you could put in a good word with my boss.
A good word?
They're going to discharge me, sir.
I messed up.
I'm fully aware.
But my job, it means everything to me, and I know a good word from you would...
Look, I have nothing against you personally, Meechum, but I can't get involved in these sort of affairs.
There's protocols and rules.
Sir, please, if you spoke to Cardiff--
There is nothing that I can do.
If anyone can convince the captain, it would be you, Congressman.
I'm sorry.
I wish you all the best, Meechum.
Doug.
What did Barney hull say?
That we'd be the first to know.
I can't believe there hasn't been a single 911 call.
There's been plenty.
It's just not the sort we're after.
We got that kid in Atlanta.
No, it's got to be here.
I can't be getting on a plane.
It looks too opportunistic.
Maybe if we open it up a little bit.
No, we cannot lower our standards.
We just have to be patient.
New rule-- now that the debate's over,
Frank Underwood has to tell us what the hell that was.
Seriously, Congressman, was that a joke?
I haven't seen something just lay there like that since, uh...
I gotta go all the way back to my prom night.
Can we just settle this strike please?
Teachers have been out of the classroom for so long, middle schoolers are starting to have sex with each other.
Enough.
I don't know why you had it on in the first place.
I love you, Francis.
I know.
We should say that more often to each other.
I need to clear my head.
...north and east of the airport.
I'm gonna need that in time for that meeting.
Peter, let's talk.
So.
I've spoken to Patricia Whittaker.
She's on board.
You'll be getting four million in start-up funding from the DNC.
I'll pick the team.
You announce in August.
But the campaign starts today.
Are you ready?
I've already put together a platform.
It's mostly broad strokes, but we can hone it.
Good.
The first thing we need to address is your sobriety.
Oh, you don't need to worry about that.
Have you been going to meetings?
You mean AA?
- Yes.
- That's not really my thing.
If you want my help, then going to meetings is my one requirement.
I know I had a problem, Frank.
I accept that.
And I've taken responsibility for that, but I don't think going to meetings is necessary.
You cannot white-knuckle your recovery, Peter.
This campaign will be the hardest thing you've ever done in your life.
I realize that.
I'm prepared for that.
You think you are.
But we can't take any chances.
The party's investing in you.
I need to make sure you're investing in yourself.
All right.
I'll do whatever I have to do.
Good.
You'll start tomorrow morning.
- Doug will take you.
- Stamper?
He's been sober 14 years.
Doug has a drinking problem?
Had.
Not anymore.
He'll be your sponsor.
In the meantime, I want you to meet with my wife, Claire.
She runs the clean water initiative.
She's expecting you, so clear your schedule and head over there now.
Frank.
Thank you.
For believing in me.
You're gonna make a great candidate, Peter.
The shipyard closing frees up 1,100 acres of federal land.
Our goal is to pass a watershed act for the Delaware River.
We develop the land in an environmentally-responsible way, creating jobs in the process.
How many jobs?
Thousands.
We're aiming for the $200-million mark.
We got a lot of work to do.
We do, but you can start with the congressman whose districts fall within the watershed.
Do you have a draft of the bill you can show me?
We haven't sponsored any environmental legislation.
We'll draft it in consultation with your staff.
Gillian will be the point person on our end.
I don't have any legislation experience.
- I'll help you.
- When do we start?
We just did.
Will you introduce him to the research team?
- I'll be there in one second.
- Sure.
Mr. President?
I want it over.
As soon as possible.
Gut the bill, Frank.
Do whatever's necessary to end this.
Mr. President, if we give in now, the public won't credit you with a victory.
Not even a hollow one.
They'll chalk it up as a colossal defeat.
Well, that's on you, Frank.
You let this situation devolve to where it is.
I've already been blamed for the largest teacher's strike in US history.
I won't be held accountable for it dragging on months and months.
Mr. President, we have to end this strike on your terms.
Not anyone else's.
How?
By debating Marty Spinella on CNN?
Sir, you have placed your faith in me thus far.
I would ask that you continue to do so.
Whatever you're doing, Frank, isn't working, so I'm stepping in.
Gut the bill.
Like Linda said.
No.
I'm sorry, Mr. President, but I will not do that.
Are you letting pride cloud your judgment, Frank?
Respectfully, sir, you're allowing fear to cloud yours.
Not an easy thing to say no to the most powerful man in the free world.
But sometimes the only way to gain your superior's respect is to defy him.
What do we have on the schedule, Linda?
Your meeting with the...
Thank you, Mr. President.
- Do you have my briefing?
- Right here.
Good.
Let's look it over.
Hi.
How'd it go with Peter?
It went well.
Is he game?
Completely.
Ugh.
Thank you.
That's a big weight off my shoulders.
You sound tired.
Tired.
Impatient.
What can I do?
Nothing.
This one's up to fate.
I don't like when we leave things to fate.
Neither do I.
Does that mean I'm gonna have the bed to myself tonight?
Probably.
Can't Doug man the fort?
Well, he could, but I'd just toss and turn.
If I'm not gonna sleep, I might as well not sleep here.
Well, I'll leave the ringer on.
Call me if you want company.
I will.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
You should go home.
I can take it from here.
Vigilance.
It's good for the soul.
10-59.
Corner of 16th and Q. 10-59.
What's that?
Disorderly conduct.
Do you believe in karma?
Absolutely not.
Well, I do.
At least tonight.
Get Captain Cardiff on the phone.
Let's do something about Meechum.
What?
Get him his job back.
He fired his weapon.
He overreacted.
Cardiff.
On the phone.
Now.
Nancy, give me Captain Cardiff, please.
We might as well do one productive thing while we wait.
It requires very little of me and will mean the world to him.
It's a very inexpensive investment.
Hello, sir.
This is Doug Stamper.
I have Francis Underwood for you.
I got him on.
Captain, I know it's late, but I'd like to talk to you about Edward Meechum.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Thank you.
- Are you hungry?
- Mm-hmm.
You have any trouble getting in?
Nah, they made me put it through the X-ray machine twice.
So I hope it didn't overcook it.
Frank, you always pay too much.
This is way too much.
For the inconvenience.
You know, 20 years you been coming to my joint.
This the first time I been to yours.
What do you think?
I could get used to it.
Well, you're welcome any time.
Thank you, Freddy.
Always, Frank.
Got a...
446 3rd Street...
That's a drive-by shooting.
Get details.
Sir, I want to thank you for talking to the captain.
He told me you called, and I can't tell you how grateful I am.
I want you to listen very closely to what I'm about to say.
From this moment on, you are a rock.
You absorb nothing, you say nothing, and nothing breaks you.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
Welcome back.
Steve?
I'll leave you be.
Where, uh-- where's Janet?
She's been here every day for the last few weeks.
I told her go home, get some rest.
Well, is everything okay?
Your text said it was important.
I don't know how to put this.
The thing is, I...
I've been thinking.
A lot.
About my life.
About the things I haven't done.
Things I haven't said.
I hate your husband.
A lot of people do.
The past eight years, I watched over him.
But it wasn't him I was watching.
And every time I saw you, every time I heard your voice, all I could think to myself was,
"Jesus, what I wouldn't give."
I can't tell you how many times I thought about that.
You know what Francis said to me when he proposed?
I remember his exact words.
He said, "Claire, if all you want is happiness, say no.
I'm not gonna give you a couple of kids and count the days until retirement.
I promise you freedom from that.
I promise you'll never be bored."
You know, he was the only man-- and there were a lot of others who proposed.
But he was the only one who understood me.
He didn't put me on some pedestal.
He knew that I didn't want to be adored or coddled.
So he took my hand and he put a ring on it.
Because he knew I'd say yes.
He's a man who knows how to take what he wants.
Is this what you wanted?
Is that the way you wanted it?
Stop.
Stop.
Please.
Please.
Stop.
Don't.
You told me your truth.
Now you know mine.
Hey, it's Peter.
I don't expect you to call me back, but I wanted to let you know I stopped drinking, and I went to my first AA meeting.
Um, I'm supposed to reach out and make amends to those I've hurt.
But I guess the real reason I called you is just to say I love you and I miss you.
I hope you're well.
This is work, not play.
Then why'd you bother coming over?
I was hoping you'd answer the door naked.
That would be play.
That would be work with a view.
Sorry to disappoint.
How many characters in a tweet?
140.
Type this, let me know where you land.
"Eight-year-old Washington DC boy killed by a stray bullet in gangland shoot-out."
61 characters left.
"Should have been in school"?
30 left.
"Spinella to blame?"
128.
Press "send."
Now give me a name, details.
Tyler Davis.
Third grader at Vernon Baker Elementary.
Shot outside his home in southeast just before noon today.
Sent.
Where are you going?
- To see the mother.
- You don't wanna...?
There's work to do.
I'll see you later tonight.
Tyler never did anything wrong.
He was a good boy.
Everybody loved him.
It's okay.
If Tyler's school had been in session, this senseless killing would have never taken place.
We need to end this strike now and get all our children back in school where they belong before we risk another death like this.
So, Mr. Spinella, I am headed to the capitol right now, and I will remain there until you are ready to meet and talk so that we can end this pointless strike.
Thank you all for coming.
Let's go back inside.
Mr. Spinella, one question...
Mr. Spinella is not to make a comment at this time.
No comment.
No comment.
Thank you.
Frank.
So?
You said you wanted to talk.
You said you wanted to work out a compromise.
I lied.
Excuse me?
I have no intention of working out a compromise.
So then why the fuck are we here, Frank?
What the hell's the matter with you?
You think this is some kind of a game?
No.
These are real people with families to feed.
Would you please stop that?
Stop what?
In five seconds, I'm out of here.
One.
Two.
Three.
- Four.
- Goodbye, Frank.
You know the difference between you and me, Marty?
What?
I'm a white-trash cracker from a white-trash town that no one would even bother to piss on.
But here's the difference--
I've made something of myself.
I have the keys to the capitol.
People respect me.
But you, you're still nothing.
You're just an uppity dago in an expensive suit turning tricks for the unions.
Nobody respects the unions anymore, Marty.
They're dying.
And no one respects you.
The most you'll ever make of yourself is blowing men like me.
Men with real power.
Yes.
I can smell the cock on your breath from here.
You think you can get under my skin?
I know I can.
Kiss my ass, Frank.
You can't afford to walk out.
Watch me.
I've got a dead, underprivileged kid in my pocket.
What do you have?
I have 2 million honorable teachers.
Fair enough.
But I got something even better.
Go ahead.
Open it.
Okay.
I'll play your game.
You're an idiot.
Stamper threw it.
You're full of shit.
Oh, no, Stamper threw the brick.
And I made sure Claire distracted my security.
Are you kidding me?
And to think you wanted me to apologize to my wife.
You would do something that low, Frank?
I arranged the brick, Marty, just like I arranged this meeting this afternoon.
Back off, Frank.
Why don't you just get down on your knees
- where you really belong?
- Back off, Frank.
Because the only thing you're gonna get from me
- is come on your--
- Fuck you!
Everything okay in there?
Ugh.
Look, I'll-
- I'll tell them you provoked me.
I'll tell them that you threw the brick yourself.
And who's going to believe you?
You just assaulted a United States congressman, which is a felony.
But I'm not gonna press charges, Marty.
Because the strike ends now.
You think it'll leave a scar?
I have a thick skin.
The next time you ask me to invite someone in for coffee, will you please make sure no guns go off?
I'll do my best.
I saw Steve again today.
How is he?
In a lot of pain.
Should I go see him?
I don't think you need to.
Zoe Barnes.
When he dies, we'll pay for his funeral.
You don't need to take it?
No.
I'm done with work today.
Previously on House of Cards...
Pictures.
The kind I wouldn't want my father to see.
The reporter?
What does she offer us?
A mouthpiece, when we need one.
She's been very useful so far.
Sounds like she's getting the better side of the bargain.
- Peter Russo.
- He's a drunk.
Well, we turn that into an asset, not a liability.
We're talking 12,000 jobs here.
We're the ones who got you fuckin' elected in the first place.
I made them keep you in contention.
I'm the only person who believes in you, Peter.
It's up to you.
Either you assure me right now that amendment is out, or I am walking out that door and I am gonna start launching missiles.
And I can't keep having my work take these hits on behalf of yours.
It's more than just an inconvenience.
You tell me right now, is that amendment in or out?
Do not start a war you know you're gonna lose.
We strike at midnight tomorrow.
We're almost a month into the strike, and we've got millions of kids stuck home from school.
Do you blame the White House or Congress?
I personally have very little sympathy for the teachers.
We're over three weeks into this strike.
It's costing the country billions of dollars,
- and instead of offering solutions...
- There's a big difference between taking a stand and sitting on your hands.
I don't know whether to call it cowardice...
It's his agenda.
And the problem is that he stole sound, conservative ideas.
The only smart thing he's done is lift his platform from the Republican platform.
I admit it, Linda.
This got away from me.
But we can't turn back time.
We have to hold our ground.
While our approval ratings continue to nosedive?
Spinella and I worked together for years on dozens of labor-related bills.
- I thought he'd be reasonable.
- Well, you were wrong about that.
Well, I didn't think he'd be insane enough to go on strike, and I didn't think the strike would last this long.
So you've been wrong twice about this.
Why should I believe you're right about holding out?
We threatened collective bargaining in order to get performance standards and charter funding.
That's the deal that we made.
We took that stand.
We lay down now, we lose it all.
There'll be no reform, just an empty bill.
I understand the logic, Frank, but we're in damage control now.
But we can't close one wound by opening another.
But we're the Democrats.
We're the ones who are supposed to be defending the teachers.
But you can't have it both ways, Linda.
You can't have the reform you want and keep the teachers happy at the same time.
You knew that when we started.
Okay, then if we have to choose, we choose to keep the teachers happy.
That is a mistake, Linda.
We've already crossed the Rubicon.
I'm telling you this.
The President wants to change the bill.
We should've done it three weeks ago.
We didn't.
So you have to do it now.
Give me more time, Linda, please.
If I can break this strike and get everything we want in this bill, can we agree that's preferable to folding?
Of course.
If we can count on that...
Then count on me for just one more week.
If the strike isn't over by then, I'll change the bill.
- Frank...
- No.
One more week.
That's all.
This is the worst possible position to be in.
If I water down the bill, the President will still see me as a failure.
If the strike doesn't end in a week, I've forced myself into a corner.
Only total victory will put me back in his good graces.
The alternative is exile, which would mean the last five months were for nothing.
I cannot abide falling back to square one.
Does the Congressman need me, ma'am?
No.
I just was wondering if you wanted a cup of coffee.
I just brewed a fresh pot.
- I'm good, ma'am.
But thanks.
- Are you sure?
My shift's done in a couple hours.
I'll be fine.
You know, come on.
Stretch your legs.
I won't take no for an answer.
What did you do before you joined the leadership detail?
I was a cop here in D.C.
Before that, I was in the Marines, ma'am.
- Thank you.
- Did you serve overseas?
I did, ma'am.
Bahrain, then Afghanistan.
Served most of my second tour in the Korengal Valley.
You wanna know if I killed anyone?
I think I know the answer.
I got a dinner meeting with Birch.
I'll be...
I invited him in for coffee.
Well, drink it fast.
We leave in five...
Get down!
Stay away from the windows!
Stop!
You'll have six of my best men covering you around the clock.
I guess I'm wondering why we didn't at least have one of your best men covering us now.
He'll be disciplined, sir.
He shot a gun in a residential neighborhood.
- I want him fired.
- There will be a full investigation, and we'll take the necessary action.
Steve never would've let this happen.
Is he better yet?
Because I would feel a lot safer if he was with us.
Unfortunately, he won't be coming back, sir.
I thought he just had a gallbladder infection.
He did, they found more.
His pancreas, stage four.
- Jesus.
- Oh, my God.
That's awful.
How much longer does he have?
Not long.
A few weeks.
At least that's what his wife told me.
We have to go see him.
Can you get the information where he is?
Of course.
I'll make sure you get it right away.
- Thank you, Captain.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Good night.
- Front door.
- Yes, sir.
Your weapon.
Your badge, too.
Am I suspended, sir?
You had a suspect on foot, and you fire your gun?
- Sir, I realize that...
- Do you know how this reflects on me?
That one of our men could be so careless?
Not only do you abandon your post for coffee.
You could've killed a bystander.
That slug was found on somebody's front stoop.
What if it went in their house?
Your badge, Meechum.
Two reasons, which are really the same reason.
I was sick of working for other people, and I knew I could do a better job than my bosses.
They kept trying to suppress me, shutting me out.
So I said, "Fuck it.
I'll do it my way."
- And then you just quit?
- Not like you did.
I slaved away until I lined up the money to start Slugline.
Once Slugline gets big enough, what's the plan?
Are you gonna sell it like Arianna?
Probably.
And then who knows?
Whatever the next adventure is.
Maybe Shanghai.
So I shouldn't expect to have a job in two years?
Do you ever wanna have any job for more than two years?
What about you?
What's your big plan?
I don't know yet.
Come on.
Slugline is just a stepping stone for you.
- You know what?
I should take this.
- Go.
Do your thing.
Hey.
Do you have proof Spinella was behind it?
Put it in context.
Three weeks into a national teachers' strike...
At the home of Francis Underwood, who has led the charge on...
There you go.
Now post that before one of my neighbors calls a local 11:00 hack.
- When do I see you next?
- I'm background on this.
- I'm not your source.
- You can't talk now?
- No.
- When?
Soon, with bells on.
What about "more school books, less bricks"?
No, it's too broad.
We need a better sound bite.
Something specific, something that points the finger directly at Spinella.
- He'll deny any involvement.
- Well, of course he will.
- So how do we get around that?
- We say he can't control his troops.
- There's no evidence it was a teacher.
- Who else could it be?
Look, he's gonna shift blame for the strike back on Congress.
No.
We need something clear, something clean, something that sticks in your head.
"Teachers need a lesson in self-restraint."
No.
You're not hearing me.
People like teachers.
No.
We need something that makes Spinella the villain.
- His lack of control, his inability...
- Disorganized labor.
It's disorganized labor, plain and simple.
When you've got angry teachers throwing bricks through congressmen's windows, you've gotta blame the union leadership.
We'll be beefing up the security for the entire leadership.
And I strongly encourage Marty Spinella to keep his people in line.
This is starting to look like disorganized labor.
Do you really think Marty Spinella is to blame?
Whether Mr. Spinella is behind this or not, he might wanna tone down the rhetoric, before disorganized labor turns into organized crime.
No one can prove anything.
So that's the most cogent response.
Well, go on TV and say that.
You deplore violence in any form.
It's Congress that should take responsibility.
I don't want to degenerate to Frank's level.
We need to kill this brick thing.
It's distracting people from the issues.
- She's right.
- It'll eat up one cycle, and it'll disappear.
No.
This story is getting traction.
- Support for the strike is dipping.
- So is the President's approval ratings.
But he gets to stay in the Oval Office another three years, no matter what.
We can't afford another three weeks.
When I told the unions to strike, I told them to prepare for the long haul.
All right?
Their accounts dry up, we keep going.
We figure it out.
I am not going to blink over something like this.
Fine.
But if we lose the public relations battle, none of that does us any good.
Frank wants us on the defensive.
I think this story is going to blow over.
If I'm wrong, we'll reevaluate.
But I wanna give it another day or two first.
Okay?
Hi, Adam.
You all right?
I saw the news.
Yes, I'm fine.
That's gotta rattle the nerves.
Brick coming through the window.
It did, some.
So are you staying in the house?
We've got extra security now, so...
Well, it made me think of you, so I figured I'd just check in.
I appreciate that.
We still haven't talked, have we?
- There's no need to.
- I think we should.
Here's how I see it.
You asked me to come down.
I did.
We both had ideas about what that could mean.
Probably very similar ideas.
But then you changed your mind.
So be it.
There's no reason we can't be in touch or remain friends.
Let's not fool ourselves, Adam.
So I won't call again.
- Done.
- I'm not saying that.
What are you saying?
I just called because I care about you.
No agenda.
If you wanna talk again, call me.
If not, I understand.
It's up to you.
You think I'm being unreasonable?
I think you're doing whatever it is you need to do, and I'm not gonna question it.
It was sweet of you to call.
Listen, you probably need to get back to work.
I know I do.
I should go.
Yeah.
Okay.
- Take care.
- Okay.
- Frank, you got a minute?
- I'll see you inside.
I wanna be governor, and I want your help.
- Am I still on the short list?
- You are.
I haven't had a drink in over a month.
I'm clean.
Is that because I asked, or because it's what you want?
It was about time I took responsibility for myself.
Taking responsibility is one thing, and it's admirable.
But running for governor of a major state is a whole other ball game.
Let me tell you something, Frank.
I got elected to Congress 'cause I seized the moment that opportunity struck.
You kept me on that list.
I wanna seize that opportunity.
If you help me out, I'll give you everything I got.
Well, that's all I've been waiting to hear.
All right.
I'll tell you what.
I need to make some calls, check in with some people.
Give me a few days.
I'll get back to you.
- Of course.
- And, Peter...
I feel like I've met the real you for the first time just now.
Janet.
- Is this a bad time?
- No.
No, not at all.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were coming.
Here.
Take my chair.
- No.
I'm fine.
- I'll take these.
Thank you.
- Hello, Steve.
- Hey.
These could use some water.
I'll be right back.
Francis and I were so upset when we heard.
I'm sorry I haven't come sooner.
I didn't want too many people knowing.
Yes.
Francis wishes he could be here.
He wants you to know he's praying for you.
Couldn't make it?
No, there's a big teachers' strike going on right now, and he's been stuck in his office for weeks.
I get it.
I saw the news.
- The brick.
- Right.
I told Francis that probably wouldn't have happened if you were there.
No.
Probably not.
I never seen him pray.
Not in eight years.
You said he was praying for me.
You've seen us in church.
Yeah, but I never went inside.
They're just gorgeous.
Mrs. Underwood, thank you so much.
Please, call me Claire.
- I know you got things to do.
- Of course.
If you need anything at all, call me.
You have my cell.
Anything at all.
And I'm sorry to have surprised you.
No.
It was so nice of you to come.
Thank you.
I know Steve appreciated it.
Check this out.
It's foam.
- How many of these we have?
- 200.
But I can get more.
Get more.
Bring it on!
You need to give the teachers the respect they deserve.
We can't back away from this, Marty.
- We've gotta face it head-on.
- They provoked us.
They were throwing foam.
Our guys were throwing punches.
We're gonna come off the bad guys here.
Okay.
Okay.
I get it.
I get it.
But I wanna be smart about this.
I wanna do something definitive that'll put this to bed
- and get us back on message.
- CNN.
One-on-one, you and Underwood.
8:00 tonight.
Frank is excellent in debates.
Go strong against him.
Address the brick right to his face.
- End of story.
- Underwood says he's in if you are.
Okay.
But I want as much prep as possible, okay?
I want to run questions.
You moderate, you play Underwood.
Wear this one.
Then come in here.
I wanna put powder on you.
Well, there's somebody at the studio can do that.
Yes, and they always cake on too much.
I'm doing it.
War paint.
How bloody do you think it'll be?
I think I oughta be able to dispatch with him easily enough.
You remember Peter Russo?
He's doing well.
He hasn't had a drink in a month.
Good for him.
I like him.
Good, because he could use your help.
- How?
- We're running him for governor.
Ambitious.
We wanna create jobs in his district.
It's on the Delaware River.
I thought we might be able to put a bill together.
Something with an economic upside.
This has to do with the shipyard closing?
We need the shipbuilders' support for his campaign.
You think you might be able to draft a bill that he can sponsor?
I'm really trying to focus on international projects, Francis.
Not domestic legislation.
I understand, but I could really use your help, Claire.
Does Catherine Durant still owe us?
When you make someone Secretary of State, they owe you for life.
We're having trouble getting our water filters through Sudanese customs.
- I'll call from the car.
- Tomorrow's fine.
- I would have done that anyway.
- I know.
I'm ready for battle.
You wanna come watch?
- No.
You go on ahead.
- Come on.
Watch me put the final nail in Spinella's coffin.
It'll be fun.
Marty.
Frank.
Come on, people.
Take your marks.
Congressman, would you like to respond to that?
Yes, I would.
$2 billion of taxpayers' money being wasted.
And Congress should be ashamed of itself for that, Frank.
What?
Did Congress force the teachers to go on strike, Marty?
- No, we didn't.
- Really, Frank?
When you threaten teachers' ability to negotiate as a union, when you threaten their job security, you threaten their livelihood, of course you force them to strike.
And did we also force them to start throwing bricks at people's houses?
You know what, I'm really glad you brought that up, because you know there's absolutely no proof that that incident had anything to do with this strike.
And I wanna take the opportunity to say publicly that we categorically condemn any use of violence whatsoever, or intimidation.
What you're saying, essentially, is that you can't control your own people.
- That's not what I'm saying.
- That is what you're saying.
You're disorganized.
Disorganized labor.
You know what, you could keep trotting out that phrase all you like, but you know what I'd like to do, Frank?
I would like to get back to the issue here of educating our children and the fact that Congress is not living up to their commitment.
Well, you know what I would like?
What?
An apology.
If not to me, then to my wife.
When that brick came through our window, it was terrifying.
She's standing right over there.
- Claire?
- We need camera two on the wife.
Now, why don't you look her in the eye and tell her that your people had nothing to do with that brick.
- Are you serious?
- Yes.
Okay.
Mrs. Underwood, Claire,
I am sincerely sorry that you had to go through that ordeal, truly.
And it actually sickens me that someone made you feel unsafe in your own home.
And I give you my word that to the best of my knowledge, none of our people had anything to do with it.
But you know what sickens me more?
That right now, your husband is using you as a prop on national television to try and win a debate.
So I think you're the one that owes your wife an apology, Frank.
And when you're done apologizing, can we please get back to the issue here of educating our children?
No.
You've got this wrong, Marty.
There is no "you" and "l" in education.
Well, I mean, yes, there's the letters,
"U" and "l" are in the word education.
But education with a capital "E"...
You know what I'm talking about.
I don't think I do.
Yes, you do, Marty.
"U" and "l", education.
So, we're gonna waste the rest of this debate naming all the vowels in...
I'm happy to play the vowel game.
You wanna play the vowel game with me?
All right. "U" think "l"
"O" "U"
"A" apology?
But no, no, no.
"U" "O" "I."
Interesting.
You left out "E" for "Education."
- So let...
- Defecation.
Edification.
I'm sorry.
LOL.
You like Sesame Street so much?
Why don't you give the kids the money they deserve?
What I'm trying to say about education...
Well, I guess school's still in session.
I guess you schooled me there, Marty.
- Let's move on.
- Please.
Humor aside, there are more important issues out there.
I had no intention of bringing you into this.
It wasn't part of a plan.
I would've told you if it was.
I know.
The idea just struck me, and I went with it.
I don't mind that you improvised.
I just wish you'd done it better.
Congressman Frank Underwood says he got, quote, schooled by AFT spokesman and chief strategist, Martin Spinella, during a debate last night on this network.
In the past 24 hours, reruns of the gaffe have played nonstop on TV news programs and the Internet.
A YouTube clip set to techno music has logged more than 300,000 hits and spawned dozens of other spoofs.
No, no, no
"E" "O" "l"
With a capital "E"
Education LOL
That was as clumsy as the Lee Harvey Oswald prison transfer.
What was he thinking?
Just give me one second.
There's a deli down the street.
Patti, thanks for coming.
Sit down.
You want some coffee?
No, thanks.
I'm good.
Hey, did you see Bill Maher last night?
No, I didn't.
It was about the CNN thing.
I have to admit, Frank, it was kind of funny.
Well, I'll have to catch a rerun.
How you doing?
You holding up all right with the strike?
Let's talk about Pennsylvania.
I have your candidate.
Peter Russo. 1 st Congressional District.
We crossed him off.
I know.
It's a mistake.
He's young, he's handsome.
He's bright.
Nobody knows who he is outside of Philadelphia.
There's no donor base, no infrastructure.
You start me off with funding from the DNC and I'll raise an army around this guy.
I will personally oversee his campaign.
Is that the best we can do?
What's better than a blank slate in the right hands?
Ed, you need to go.
Congressman, do you have a moment?
Thank you, Patti.
- Have him call me.
- I will.
Ed?
Please.
- What is going on?
- I'm taking care of it.
One second, sir.
Please.
All right.
Make it fast, Meechum.
It's not easy for me to ask this, but I was wondering if you could put in a good word with my boss.
A good word?
They're going to discharge me, sir.
I messed up.
I'm fully aware.
But my job, it means everything to me, and I know a good word from you would...
Look, I have nothing against you personally, Meechum, but I can't get involved in these sort of affairs.
There's protocols and rules.
Sir, please, if you spoke to Cardiff...
There is nothing that I can do.
If anyone could convince the Captain, it would be you, Congressman.
I'm sorry.
I wish you all the best, Meechum.
Doug.
What did Barney Hull say?
That we'd be the first to know.
I can't believe there hasn't been a single 911 call.
There's been plenty.
It's just not the sort we're after.
We got that kid in Atlanta.
No, it's got to be here.
I can't be getting on a plane.
It looks too opportunistic.
Maybe if we open it up a little bit?
No, we cannot lower our standards.
We just have to be patient.
New rule.
Now that the debate's over,
Frank Underwood has to tell us what the hell that was.
Seriously, Congressman, was that a joke?
I haven't seen something just lay there like that since...
I gotta go all the way back to my prom night.
Can we just settle this strike please?
Teachers have been out of the classroom for so long, middle-schoolers are starting to have sex with each other.
Enough.
I don't know why you had it on in the first place.
I love you, Francis.
I know.
We should say that more often to each other.
I need to clear my head.
...north and east of the airport.
I'm gonna need that in time for that meeting.
Peter, let's talk.
So.
I've spoken to Patricia Whittaker.
She's on board.
You'll be getting $4 million in start-up funding from the DNC.
I'll pick the team.
You announce in August.
But the campaign starts today.
Are you ready?
I've already put together a platform.
It's mostly broad strokes, but we can hone it.
Good.
The first thing we need to address is your sobriety.
You don't need to worry about that.
Have you been going to meetings?
You mean AA?
- Yes.
- That's not really my thing.
If you want my help, then going to meetings is my one requirement.
I know I had a problem, Frank.
I accept that.
And I've taken responsibility for that, but I don't think going to meetings is necessary.
You cannot white-knuckle your recovery, Peter.
This campaign will be the hardest thing you've ever done in your life.
I realize that.
I'm prepared for that.
You think you are.
But we can't take any chances.
The party's investing in you.
I need to make sure you're investing in yourself.
All right.
I'll do whatever I have to do.
Good.
You'll start tomorrow morning.
- Doug will take you.
- Stamper?
He's been sober 14 years.
Doug has a drinking problem?
Had.
Not anymore.
He'll be your sponsor.
In the meantime, I want you to meet with my wife, Claire.
She runs the Clean Water Initiative.
She's expecting you, so clear your schedule and head over there now.
Frank.
Thank you.
For believing in me.
You're gonna make a great candidate, Peter.
The shipyard closing frees up 1,100 acres of federal land.
Our goal is to pass a Watershed Act for the Delaware River.
We develop the land in an environmentally responsible way, creating jobs in the process.
- How many jobs?
- Thousands.
We're aiming for the $200 million mark.
We got a lot of work to do.
We do, but you can start with the congressmen whose districts fall within the watershed.
Do you have a draft of the bill you can show me?
We haven't sponsored any environmental legislation.
We'll draft it in consultation with your staff.
Gillian will be the point person on our end.
I don't have any legislation experience.
- I'll help you.
- When do we start?
We just did.
Will you introduce him to the research team?
- I'll be there in one second.
- Sure.
Mr. President?
I want it over.
- As soon as possible.
- Gut the bill, Frank.
Do whatever's necessary to end this.
Mr. President, if we give in now, the public won't credit you with a victory.
Not even a hollow one.
They'll chalk it up as a colossal defeat.
Well, that's on you, Frank.
You let this situation devolve to where it is.
I've already been blamed for the largest teachers' strike in U.S. History.
I won't be held accountable for it dragging on months and months.
Mr. President, we have to end this strike on your terms.
- Not anyone else's.
- How?
By debating Marty Spinella on CNN?
Sir, you have placed your faith in me thus far.
I would ask that you continue to do so.
Well, whatever you're doing, Frank, isn't working, so I'm stepping in.
Gut the bill.
Like Linda said.
No.
I'm sorry, Mr. President, but I will not do that.
Are you letting pride cloud your judgment, Frank?
Respectfully, sir, you're allowing fear to cloud yours.
Not an easy thing, to say no to the most powerful man in the free world.
But sometimes the only way to gain your superior's respect is to defy him.
What do we have on the schedule, Linda?
Your meeting with the Fed Oversight Committee.
Thank you, Mr. President.
- Do you have my briefing?
- Right here.
Good.
Let's look it over.
Hi.
How'd it go with Peter?
It went well.
- Is he game?
- Completely.
Thank you.
That's a big weight off my shoulders.
You sound tired.
Tired.
Impatient.
What can I do?
Nothing.
This one's up to fate.
I don't like when we leave things to fate.
Neither do I.
Does that mean I'm gonna have the bed to myself tonight?
Probably.
Can't Doug man the fort?
Well, he could, but I'd just toss and turn.
If I'm not gonna sleep, I might as well not sleep here.
Well, I'll leave the ringer on.
Call me if you want company.
I will.
Good night.
Good night.
You should go home.
I could take it from here.
Vigilance.
It's good for the soul.
10-59.
Corner of 16th and Q. 10-59.
What's that?
Disorderly conduct.
Do you believe in karma?
Absolutely not.
Well, I do.
At least tonight.
Get Captain Cardiff on the phone.
Let's do something about Meechum.
- What?
- Get him his job back.
He fired his weapon.
He overreacted.
Cardiff.
On the phone.
Now.
Nancy, give me Captain Cardiff, please.
We might as well do one productive thing while we wait.
It requires very little of me and will mean the world to him.
It's a very inexpensive investment.
Hello, sir.
This is Doug Stamper.
I have Francis Underwood for you.
I got him on.
Captain, I know it's late, but I'd like to talk to you about Edward Meechum.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Are you hungry?
You have any trouble getting in?
No, they made me put it through the X-ray machine twice, so I hope it didn't overcook it.
Frank, you always pay too much.
This is way too much.
It's for the inconvenience.
You know, 20 years you been coming to my joint.
This is the first time I've been to yours.
What do you think?
- I could get used to it.
- Well, you're welcome any time.
- Thank you, Freddy.
- Always, Frank.
We got a 27 Delta two. 4463rd Street...
- That's a drive-by shooting.
- Get details.
Sir, I want to thank you for talking to the Captain.
He told me you called, and I can't tell you how grateful I am.
I want you to listen very closely to what I'm about to say.
From this moment on, you are a rock.
You absorb nothing, you say nothing, and nothing breaks you.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
Welcome back.
Steve?
I'll leave you be.
Where...
Where's Janet?
She's been here every day for the last few weeks.
I told her, go home, get some rest.
Well, is everything okay?
Your text said it was important.
I don't know how to put this.
The thing is, I...
I've been thinking.
A lot.
About my life.
About the things I haven't done.
Things I haven't said.
I hate your husband.
A lot of people do.
The past eight years, I watched over him.
But it wasn't him I was watching.
And every time I saw you, every time I heard your voice, all I could think to myself was,
"Jesus, what I wouldn't give."
I can't tell you how many times I thought about that.
You know what Francis said to me when he proposed?
I remember his exact words.
He said, "Claire, if all you want is happiness,
"say no.
"I'm not gonna give you a couple of kids
"and count the days until retirement.
"I promise you freedom from that.
"I promise you'll never be bored."
You know, he was the only man, and there were a lot of others who proposed.
But he was the only one who understood me.
He didn't put me on some pedestal.
He knew that I didn't want to be adored or coddled.
So he took my hand and he put a ring on it.
Because he knew I'd say yes.
He's a man who knows how to take what he wants.
Is this what you wanted?
Is that the way you wanted it?
Stop.
Stop.
Please.
Please.
Stop.
Don't.
You told me your truth.
Now you know mine.
Hey, it's Peter.
I don't expect you to call me back, but I wanted to let you know I stopped drinking last night, and I went to my first AA meeting this morning.
I'm supposed to reach out and make amends to those I've hurt.
But I guess the real reason I called you is just to say I love you and I miss you.
I hope you're well.
This is work, not play.
Then why'd you bother coming over?
I was hoping you'd answer the door naked.
That would be play.
That would be work with a view.
Sorry to disappoint.
How many characters in a tweet?
140.
Type this, let me know where you land.
Eight-year-old Washington D.C. Boy killed by a stray bullet in gangland shoot-out.
61 characters left.
He should have been in school?
30 left.
Spinella to blame.
Question mark.
- 128.
- Press send.
Now give me a name, details.
Tyler Davis.
Third-grader at Vernon Baker Elementary.
Shot outside his home in Southeast just before noon today.
Sent.
Where are you going?
- To see the mother.
- You don't wanna...
There's work to do.
I'll see you later tonight.
Tyler never did anything wrong.
He was a good boy.
Everybody loved him.
It's okay.
If Tyler's school had been in session, this senseless killing would have never taken place.
We need to end this strike now and get all our children back in school where they belong, before we risk another death like this.
So, Mr. Spinella, I am headed to the Capitol right now, and I will remain there until you are ready to meet and talk so that we can end this pointless strike.
Thank you all for coming.
Let's go back inside.
Mr. Spinella, one question.
Mr. Spinella is not gonna make comments at this time.
No comment.
No comment.
Thank you.
Frank.
So?
You said you wanted to talk.
You said you wanted to work out a compromise.
I lied.
Excuse me?
I have no intention of working out a compromise.
So then why the fuck are we here, Frank?
What the hell's the matter with you?
You think this is some kind of a game?
No.
These are real people with families to feed.
Would you please stop that?
Stop what?
In five seconds, I'm out of here.
One.
Two.
Three.
- Four.
- Goodbye, Frank.
You know the difference between you and me, Marty?
What?
I'm a white-trash cracker from a white-trash town that no one would even bother to piss on.
But here's the difference.
I've made something of myself.
I have the keys to the Capitol.
People respect me.
But you, you're still nothing.
You're just an uppity dago in an expensive suit turning tricks for the unions.
Nobody respects the unions anymore, Marty.
They're dying.
And no one respects you.
The most you'll ever make of yourself is blowing men like me.
Men with real power.
Yes.
I can smell the cock on your breath from here.
You think you can get under my skin?
- I know I can.
- Yeah.
Kiss my ass, Frank.
- You can't afford to walk out.
- Watch me.
I've got a dead, underprivileged kid in my pocket.
What do you have?
I have two million honorable teachers.
Fair enough.
But I got something even better.
Go ahead.
Open it.
Okay.
I'll play your game.
You're an idiot.
Stamper threw it.
You're full of shit.
No, Stamper threw the brick.
And I made sure Claire distracted my security.
Are you kidding me?
And to think you wanted me to apologize to my wife.
You would do something that low, Frank?
I arranged the brick, Marty, just like I arranged this meeting this afternoon.
Back off, Frank.
Why don't you just get down on your knees
- where you really belong?
- Back off, Frank.
Because the only thing you're gonna get from me
- is cum on your...
- Fuck you!
Everything okay in there, sir?
Look, I'll tell them you provoked me.
I'll tell them that you threw the brick yourself.
And who's going to believe you?
You just assaulted a United States Congressman, which is a felony.
But I'm not gonna press charges, Marty.
Because the strike ends now.
You think it'll leave a scar?
I have a thick skin.
The next time you ask me to invite someone in for coffee, will you please make sure no guns go off?
I'll do my best.
I saw Steve again today.
- How is he?
- In a lot of pain.
Should I go see him?
I don't think you need to.
Zoe Barnes.
When he dies, we'll pay for his funeral.
You don't need to take it?
No.
I'm done with work today.
We're almost a month into the strike, and we've got millions of kids stuck home from school.
Do you blame the White House or Congress?
I personally have very little sympathy for the teachers.
We're over three weeks into this strike.
It's costing the country billions of dollars, and instead of offering solutions--
There's a big difference between taking a stand and sitting on your hands.
I don't know whether to call it cowardice...
It's his agenda, and the problem is that he stole sound, conservative ideas.
The only smart thing he's done is lift his platform from the republican platform.
I admit it, Linda.
This got away from me.
But we can't turn back time.
We have to hold our ground.
While our approval ratings continue to nosedive?
Spinella and I worked together for years on dozens of labor-related bills.
- I thought he'd be reasonable.
- You were wrong about that.
Well, I didn't think he'd be insane enough to go on strike, and I didn't think the strike would last this long.
So you've been wrong twice about this.
Why should I believe you're right about holding out?
We threatened collective bargaining in order to get performance standards and charter funding.
That's the deal that we made.
We took that stand.
We lay down now, we lose it all.
There'll be no reform, just an empty bill.
I understand the logic, Frank, but we're in damage control now.
We can't close one wound by opening another.
But we're the democrats.
We're the ones who are supposed to be defending the teachers.
But you can't have it both ways, Linda.
You can't have the reform you want and keep the teachers happy at the same time.
You knew that when we started.
Okay, then if we have to choose, we choose to keep the teachers happy.
That is a mistake, Linda.
We've already crossed the rubicon.
I'm telling you this-- the president wants to change the bill.
We should've done it three weeks ago.
We didn't.
So you have to do it now.
Give me more time, Linda, please.
If I can break this strike and get everything we want in this bill, can we agree that's preferable to folding?
Of course.
If we can count on that--
Then count on me for just one more week.
If the strike isn't over by then, I'll change the bill.
- Frank--
- No.
One more week.
That's all.
This is the worst possible position to be in.
If I water down the bill, the president will still me as a failure.
If the strike doesn't end in a week, I forced myself into a corner.
Only total victory will put me back in his good graces.
The alternative is exile, which would mean the last five months were for nothing.
I cannot abide falling back to square one.

You need me, ma'am?
No.
I just was wondering if you wanted a cup of coffee.
I just brewed a fresh pot.
- I'm good, ma'am.
But thanks.
- Are you sure?
My shift's done in a couple hours.
I'll be fine.
No.
Come on.
Stretch your legs.
I won't take no for an answer.
What did you do before you joined the leadership detail?
I was a cop here in DC.
Before that, I was in the Marines, ma'am.
- Thank you.
- Did you serve overseas?
I did, ma'am.
Bahrain, then Afghanistan.
Served most of my second tour in the Korangal Valley.
You wanna know if I killed anyone?
I think I know the answer.
- I got a dinner meeting with birch.
- I invited him in for coffee.
Well, drink it fast.
We leave in five...
Get down!
Stay away from the windows!
Stop!
You'll have six of my best men covering you around the clock.
I guess I'm wondering why we didn't at least have one of your best men covering us now.
He'll be disciplined, sir.
He shot a gun in a residential neighborhood.
- I want him fired.
- There will be a full investigation, and we'll take the necessary action.
Steve never would've let this happen.
Is he better yet?
Because I would feel a lot safer if he was with us.
Unfortunately, he won't be coming back, sir.
I thought he just had a gallbladder infection.
He did, but they found more.
His pancreas, stage four.
- Jesus.
- Oh, my God.
That's awful.
How much longer does he have?
Not long.
A few weeks.
At least that's what his wife told me.
We have to go see him.
Can you get the information where he is?
Of course.
I'll make sure you get it right away.
- Thank you, Captain.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Good night.
- Front door.
- Yes, sir.
Your weapon.
Your badge too.
Am I suspended, sir?
You had a suspect on foot, and you fire your gun?
- Sir, I realize that--
- Do you know how this reflects on me?
That one of our men could be so careless?
Not only do you abandon your post for coffee...
You could've killed a bystander.
That slug was found in somebody's front stoop.
What if it went in their house?
Your badge, Meechum.
Two reasons, which are really the same reason.
I was sick of working for other people, and I knew I could do a better job than my bosses.
They kept trying to suppress me, shutting me out.
So I said, "fuck it.
I'll do it my way."
- Then you just quit?
- Not like you did.
I slaved away until I lined up the money to start Slugline.
Once Slugline gets big enough, what's the plan?
Are you gonna sell it like Arianna?
Probably.
And then who knows?
Whatever the next adventure is.
Maybe Shanghai.
So I shouldn't expect to have a job in two years?
Do you ever wanna have any job for more than two years?
What about you?
What's your big plan?
Uh, I don't know yet.
Come on.
Slugline is just a stepping stone for you.
- You know what?
I should take this.
- Go.
Do your thing.
Hey.
You have proof Spinella was behind it?
Put it in context.
Three weeks into a national teachers' strike--
At the home of Francis Underwood, who has led the charge on--
There you go.
Now post that before one of my neighbors calls a local 11:00 hack.
- When do I see you next?
- I'm background on this.
I'm not your source.
You can't talk now?
- No.
- When?
Soon, with bells on.
What about "more school books, less bricks"?
Nah, it's too broad.
We need a better sound bite.
Something specific, something that points the finger directly at Spinella.
- He'll deny any involvement.
- Of course he will.
- So how do we get around that?
- We say he can't control his troops.
- There's no evidence it was a teacher.
- Who else could it be?
He's gonna shift blame for the strike back on congress.
No.
We need something clear, something clean, something that sticks in your head.
"Teachers need a lesson in self-restraint."
No.
You're not hearing me.
People like teachers.
No.
We need something that makes Spinella the villain.
- His lack of control, his inability--
- Disorganized labor.
It's disorganized labor, plain and simple.
When you've got angry teachers throwing bricks through congressmen's windows, you've gotta blame the union leadership.
We'll be beefing up the security for the entire leadership.
And I strongly encourage Marty Spinella to keep his people in line.
This is starting to look like disorganized labor.
Do you really think Marty Spinella is to blame?
Whether Mr. Spinella is behind this or not, he might wanna tone down the rhetoric before disorganized labor turns into organized crime.
No one can prove anything.
So that's the most cogent response.
Well, go on TV and say that.
You deplore violence in any form.
It's congress that should take responsibility.
I don't want to degenerate to Frank's level.
We need to kill this brick thing.
It's distracting people from the issues.
She's right.
It'll eat up one cycle, and it'll disappear.
No.
This story is getting traction.
Support for the strike is dipping.
So is the president's approval ratings.
But he gets to say in the oval office another three years, no matter what.
We can't afford another three weeks.
When I told the unions to strike,
I told them to prepare for the long haul.
All right?
Their accounts dry up, we keep going.
We figure it out.
I am not going to blink over something like this.
Fine.
But if we lose the public relations battle, none of that does us any good.
Frank wants us on the defensive.
I think this story is going to blow over.
If I'm wrong, we'll reevaluate.
But I wanna give it another day or two first.
Okay?
Hi, Adam.
You all right?
I saw the news.
Yes, I'm fine.
That's gotta rattle the nerves--
A brick coming through the window.
It did, some.
So are you staying in the house?
We've got extra security now, so...
Well, um, it made me think of you, so I figured I'd just check in.
I appreciate that.
We still haven't talked, have we?
- There's no need to.
- I think we should.
Here's how I see it.
You asked me to come down.
I did.
We both had ideas about what that could mean.
Probably very similar ideas.
But then you changed your mind.
So be it.
There's no reason we can't be in touch or remain friends.
Let's not fool ourselves, Adam.
So I won't call again.
- Done.
- I'm not saying that.
What are you saying?
I just called because I care about you.
No agenda.
If you wanna talk again, call me.
If not, I understand.
It's up to you.
You think I'm being unreasonable?
I think you're doing whatever it is you need to do, and I'm not gonna question it.
It was sweet of you to call.
Listen, you probably need to get back to work.
I know I do.
I should go.
Yeah.
Okay.
- Take care.
- Okay.
- Frank, you got a minute?
- I'll see you inside.
I wanna be governor, and I want your help.
- Am I still on the short list?
- You are.
I haven't had a drink in over a month.
I'm clean.
Is that because I asked, or because it's what you want?
It was about time I took responsibility for myself.
Taking responsibility is one thing, and it's admirable.
But running for governor of a major state is a whole other ball game.
Let me tell you something, Frank.
I got elected to congress 'cause I seized the moment that opportunity struck.
You kept me on that list.
I wanna seize that opportunity.
If you help me out, I'll give you everything I got.
Well, that's all I've been waiting to hear.
All right.
I'll tell you what.
I need to make some calls, check in with some people.
Give me a few days.
I'll get back to you.
- Of course.
- And, Peter...
I feel like I've met the real you for the first time just now.
Janet.
- Is this a bad time?
- No.
No, not at all.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were coming.
Here.
Take my chair.
- Oh, no.
I'm fine.
- I'll take these.
Thank you.
- Hello, Steve.
- Hey.
These could use some water.
I'll be right back.
Francis and I were so upset when we heard.
I'm sorry I haven't come sooner.
I didn't want too many people knowing.
Yes.
Francis wishes he could be here.
He wants you to know he's praying for you.
- Couldn't make it, huh?
- No, there's a big teachers' strike going on right now, and he's been stuck in his office for weeks.
I get it.
I saw on the news.
- The brick.
- Right.
I told Francis that probably wouldn't have happened if you were there.
No.
Probably not.
I never seen him pray.
Not in eight years.
You said he was praying for me.
You've seen us in church.
Yeah, but...
I never went inside.
They're just gorgeous.
Mrs. Underwood, thank you so much.
Please, call me Claire.
- I know you got things to do.
- Of course.
If you need anything at all, call me.
You have my cell.
Anything at all.
And I'm sorry to have surprised you.
No.
It was so nice of you to come.
Thank you.
I know Steve appreciated it.
Check this out.
It's foam.
- How many of these we have?
- 200.
But I can get more.
Get more.
Bring it on!
You need to give the teachers the respect they deserve.
We can't back away from this, Marty.
- We've gotta face it head-on.
- They provoked us.
They were throwing foam.
Our guys were throwing punches.
We're gonna come off the bad guys here.
Okay.
Okay.
I get it.
I get it.
But I wanna be smart about this.
I wanna do something definitive that'll put this to bed
- and get us back on message.
- CNN, one on one, you and Underwood.
8:00 tonight.
Frank is excellent in debates.
Go strong against him.
Address the brick right to his face.
- End of story.
- Underwood says he's in if you are.
Okay.
But I want as much prep as possible, okay?
I want to run questions.
You moderate, you play Underwood.
Wear this one.
Then come in here.
I wanna put powder on you.
Well, somebody at the studio can do that.
Yes, and they always cake on too much.
I'm doing it.
War paint.
How bloody do you think it'll be?
Oh, I think I oughta be able to dispatch with him easily enough.
Oh, you remember Peter Russo?
He's doing well.
He hasn't had a drink in a month.
Oh, good for him.
I like him.
Oh, good, because he could use your help.
- How?
- We're running him for Governor.
- Ambitious.
- Mmm.
We wanna create jobs in his district.
It's on the Delaware River.
I thought we might be able to put a bill together.
Something with an economic upside.
This has to do with the shipyard closing?
We need the shipbuilders' support for his campaign.
You think you might be able to draft a bill that he can sponsor?
I'm really trying to focus on international projects, Francis.
Not domestic legislation.
I understand, but I could really use your help, Claire.
Does Catherine durant still owe us?
When you make someone Secretary of State, they owe you for life.
We're having trouble getting our water filters through sudanese customs.
- I'll call from the car.
- Tomorrow's fine.
- I would have done that anyway.
- I know.
I'm ready for battle.
You wanna come watch?
- No.
You go on ahead.
- Oh, come on.
Watch me put the final nail in Spinella's coffin.
It'll be fun.
Marty.
Frank.
Congressman, would you like to respond to that?
Yes, I would.
Two billion dollars of taxpayer's money being wasted.
And congress should be ashamed of itself for that, Frank.
Oh, what?
Did congress force the teachers to go on strike?
- No, we didn't.
- Really, Frank?
When you threaten teachers' ability to negotiate as a union, when you threaten their job security, you threaten their livelihood, of course you force them to strike.
And did we also force them to start throwing bricks at people's houses?
I'm really glad you brought that up, because you know there's absolutely no proof that that incident had anything to do with this strike.
And I wanna take the opportunity to say publicly that we categorically condemn any use of violence whatsoever or intimidation.
What you're saying essentially is that you can't control your own people.
- That is not what I'm saying.
- That is what you're saying.
You're disorganized.
- Disorganized labor.
- You can keep trotting out that phrase all you like, but you know what I'd like to do, Frank?
I would like to get back to the issue here of educating our children and the fact that congress is not living up to their commitment.
Well, you know what I would like?
What?
An apology.
If not to me, then to my wife.
When that brick came through our window, it was terrifying.
She's standing right over there.
- Claire?
- We need camera two on the wife.
Now, why don't you look her in the eye and tell her that your people had nothing to do with that brick.
- Are you serious?
- Yes.
Okay.
Mrs. Underwood, Claire,
I am sincerely sorry that you had to go through that ordeal, truly.
And it actually sickens me that someone made you feel unsafe in your own home.
And I give you my word that to the best of my knowledge, none of our people had anything to do with it.
But you know what sickens me more?
That right now, your husband is using you as a prop on national television to try and win a debate.
So I think you're the one that owes your wife an apology, Frank.
And when you're done apologizing, can we please get back to the issue here of educating our children?
No.
You've got this wrong, Marty.
There is no "you" and "I" in education.
Well, I mean, yes, there's the letters
"U" and "I" are in the word "education."
But "Education" with a capital E...
You know what I'm talking about.
I don't think I do.
Yes, you do, Marty.
U and I-
- Education.
So, what, we're gonna waste the rest of this debate naming all the vowels in--
I'm happy to play the vowel game.
You wanna play the vowel game with me?
All right.
U think I O
U A apology.
But no, no, no.
U O I...
Interesting.
You left out E for "Education."
- So let--
- Defecation--
Edification.
I'm sorry.
LOL.
Uh, uh...
Uh...
You like sesame street so much?
Why don't you give the kids the money they deserve?
What I'm trying to say about education...
Well,
I guess school's still in session.
I guess you schooled me there, Marty.
Let's move on.
Please.
Humor aside, there are more important issues out there.
I had no intention of bringing you into this.
It wasn't part of a plan.
I would've told you if it was.
I know.
The idea just struck me, and I went with it.
I don't mind that you improvised.
I just wish you'd done it better.
Congressman Frank Underwood says he got, quote, "schooled"
by AFT spokesman and chief strategist, Martin Spinella, during a debate last night on this network.
In the past 24 hours, reruns of the gaffe have played non-stop on TV news programs and the internet.
A YouTube clip set to techno music has logged more than 300,000 hits and spawned dozens of other spoofs.
d No d d No d d E O I d d with a capital "E" d d education LOL d
That was as clumsy as the Lee Harvey Oswald prison transfer.
What was he thinking?
Just give me one second.
There's a deli.
Down the street.
Patti, thanks for coming.
Sit down.
You want some coffee?
No, thanks.
I'm good.
Hey, did you see bill Maher last night?
No, I didn't.
Oh, it was about the CNN thing.
I have to admit, Frank, it was kinda funny.
Well, I'll have to catch a rerun.
How you doing?
You holding up all right with the strike?
Let's talk about Pennsylvania.
I have your candidate.
Peter Russo.
First Congressional District.
We crossed him off.
I know.
It's a mistake.
He's young, he's handsome.
He's bright.
Nobody knows who he is outside of Philadelphia.
There's no donor base, no infrastructure.
You start me off with funding from the DNC and I'll raise an army around this guy.
I will personally oversee his campaign.
Is that the best we can do?
What's better than a blank slate in the right hands?
Ed, you need to go.
Congressman, do you have a moment?
Thank you, Patti.
- Have him call me.
- I will.
Ed?
Please.
- What is going on?
- I'm taking care of it.
One second, sir.
Please.
All right.
Make it fast, Meechum.
It's not easy for me to ask this, but I was wondering if you could put in a good word with my boss.
A good word?
They're going to discharge me, sir.
I messed up.
I'm fully aware.
But my job, it means everything to me, and I know a good word from you would...
Look, I have nothing against you personally, Meechum, but I can't get involved in these sort of affairs.
There's protocols and rules.
Sir, please, if you spoke to Cardiff--
There is nothing that I can do.
If anyone can convince the captain, it would be you, Congressman.
I'm sorry.
I wish you all the best, Meechum.
Doug.
What did Barney hull say?
That we'd be the first to know.
I can't believe there hasn't been a single 911 call.
There's been plenty.
It's just not the sort we're after.
We got that kid in Atlanta.
No, it's got to be here.
I can't be getting on a plane.
It looks too opportunistic.
Maybe if we open it up a little bit.
No, we cannot lower our standards.
We just have to be patient.
New rule-- now that the debate's over,
Frank Underwood has to tell us what the hell that was.
Seriously, Congressman, was that a joke?
I haven't seen something just lay there like that since, uh...
I gotta go all the way back to my prom night.
Can we just settle this strike please?
Teachers have been out of the classroom for so long, middle schoolers are starting to have sex with each other.
Enough.
I don't know why you had it on in the first place.
I love you, Francis.
I know.
We should say that more often to each other.
I need to clear my head.
...north and east of the airport.
I'm gonna need that in time for that meeting.
Peter, let's talk.
So.
I've spoken to Patricia Whittaker.
She's on board.
You'll be getting four million in start-up funding from the DNC.
I'll pick the team.
You announce in August.
But the campaign starts today.
Are you ready?
I've already put together a platform.
It's mostly broad strokes, but we can hone it.
Good.
The first thing we need to address is your sobriety.
Oh, you don't need to worry about that.
Have you been going to meetings?
You mean AA?
- Yes.
- That's not really my thing.
If you want my help, then going to meetings is my one requirement.
I know I had a problem, Frank.
I accept that.
And I've taken responsibility for that, but I don't think going to meetings is necessary.
You cannot white-knuckle your recovery, Peter.
This campaign will be the hardest thing you've ever done in your life.
I realize that.
I'm prepared for that.
You think you are.
But we can't take any chances.
The party's investing in you.
I need to make sure you're investing in yourself.
All right.
I'll do whatever I have to do.
Good.
You'll start tomorrow morning.
- Doug will take you.
- Stamper?
He's been sober 14 years.
Doug has a drinking problem?
Had.
Not anymore.
He'll be your sponsor.
In the meantime, I want you to meet with my wife, Claire.
She runs the clean water initiative.
She's expecting you, so clear your schedule and head over there now.
Frank.
Thank you.
For believing in me.
You're gonna make a great candidate, Peter.
The shipyard closing frees up 1,100 acres of federal land.
Our goal is to pass a watershed act for the Delaware River.
We develop the land in an environmentally-responsible way, creating jobs in the process.
How many jobs?
Thousands.
We're aiming for the $200-million mark.
We got a lot of work to do.
We do, but you can start with the congressman whose districts fall within the watershed.
Do you have a draft of the bill you can show me?
We haven't sponsored any environmental legislation.
We'll draft it in consultation with your staff.
Gillian will be the point person on our end.
I don't have any legislation experience.
- I'll help you.
- When do we start?
We just did.
Will you introduce him to the research team?
- I'll be there in one second.
- Sure.
Mr. President?
I want it over.
As soon as possible.
Gut the bill, Frank.
Do whatever's necessary to end this.
Mr. President, if we give in now, the public won't credit you with a victory.
Not even a hollow one.
They'll chalk it up as a colossal defeat.
Well, that's on you, Frank.
You let this situation devolve to where it is.
I've already been blamed for the largest teacher's strike in US history.
I won't be held accountable for it dragging on months and months.
Mr. President, we have to end this strike on your terms.
Not anyone else's.
How?
By debating Marty Spinella on CNN?
Sir, you have placed your faith in me thus far.
I would ask that you continue to do so.
Whatever you're doing, Frank, isn't working, so I'm stepping in.
Gut the bill.
Like Linda said.
No.
I'm sorry, Mr. President, but I will not do that.
Are you letting pride cloud your judgment, Frank?
Respectfully, sir, you're allowing fear to cloud yours.
Not an easy thing to say no to the most powerful man in the free world.
But sometimes the only way to gain your superior's respect is to defy him.
What do we have on the schedule, Linda?
Your meeting with the...
Thank you, Mr. President.
- Do you have my briefing?
- Right here.
Good.
Let's look it over.
Hi.
How'd it go with Peter?
It went well.
Is he game?
Completely.
Ugh.
Thank you.
That's a big weight off my shoulders.
You sound tired.
Tired.
Impatient.
What can I do?
Nothing.
This one's up to fate.
I don't like when we leave things to fate.
Neither do I.
Does that mean I'm gonna have the bed to myself tonight?
Probably.
Can't Doug man the fort?
Well, he could, but I'd just toss and turn.
If I'm not gonna sleep, I might as well not sleep here.
Well, I'll leave the ringer on.
Call me if you want company.
I will.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
You should go home.
I can take it from here.
Vigilance.
It's good for the soul.
10-59.
Corner of 16th and Q. 10-59.
What's that?
Disorderly conduct.
Do you believe in karma?
Absolutely not.
Well, I do.
At least tonight.
Get Captain Cardiff on the phone.
Let's do something about Meechum.
What?
Get him his job back.
He fired his weapon.
He overreacted.
Cardiff.
On the phone.
Now.
Nancy, give me Captain Cardiff, please.
We might as well do one productive thing while we wait.
It requires very little of me and will mean the world to him.
It's a very inexpensive investment.
Hello, sir.
This is Doug Stamper.
I have Francis Underwood for you.
I got him on.
Captain, I know it's late, but I'd like to talk to you about Edward Meechum.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Thank you.
- Are you hungry?
- Mm-hmm.
You have any trouble getting in?
Nah, they made me put it through the X-ray machine twice.
So I hope it didn't overcook it.
Frank, you always pay too much.
This is way too much.
For the inconvenience.
You know, 20 years you been coming to my joint.
This the first time I been to yours.
What do you think?
I could get used to it.
Well, you're welcome any time.
Thank you, Freddy.
Always, Frank.
Got a...
446 3rd Street...
That's a drive-by shooting.
Get details.
Sir, I want to thank you for talking to the captain.
He told me you called, and I can't tell you how grateful I am.
I want you to listen very closely to what I'm about to say.
From this moment on, you are a rock.
You absorb nothing, you say nothing, and nothing breaks you.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
Welcome back.
Steve?
I'll leave you be.
Where, uh-- where's Janet?
She's been here every day for the last few weeks.
I told her go home, get some rest.
Well, is everything okay?
Your text said it was important.
I don't know how to put this.
The thing is, I...
I've been thinking.
A lot.
About my life.
About the things I haven't done.
Things I haven't said.
I hate your husband.
A lot of people do.
The past eight years, I watched over him.
But it wasn't him I was watching.
And every time I saw you, every time I heard your voice, all I could think to myself was,
"Jesus, what I wouldn't give."
I can't tell you how many times I thought about that.
You know what Francis said to me when he proposed?
I remember his exact words.
He said, "Claire, if all you want is happiness, say no.
I'm not gonna give you a couple of kids and count the days until retirement.
I promise you freedom from that.
I promise you'll never be bored."
You know, he was the only man-- and there were a lot of others who proposed.
But he was the only one who understood me.
He didn't put me on some pedestal.
He knew that I didn't want to be adored or coddled.
So he took my hand and he put a ring on it.
Because he knew I'd say yes.
He's a man who knows how to take what he wants.
Is this what you wanted?
Is that the way you wanted it?
Stop.
Stop.
Please.
Please.
Stop.
Don't.
You told me your truth.
Now you know mine.
Hey, it's Peter.
I don't expect you to call me back, but I wanted to let you know I stopped drinking, and I went to my first AA meeting.
Um, I'm supposed to reach out and make amends to those I've hurt.
But I guess the real reason I called you is just to say I love you and I miss you.
I hope you're well.
This is work, not play.
Then why'd you bother coming over?
I was hoping you'd answer the door naked.
That would be play.
That would be work with a view.
Sorry to disappoint.
How many characters in a tweet?
140.
Type this, let me know where you land.
"Eight-year-old Washington DC boy killed by a stray bullet in gangland shoot-out."
61 characters left.
"Should have been in school"?
30 left.
"Spinella to blame?"
128.
Press "send."
Now give me a name, details.
Tyler Davis.
Third grader at Vernon Baker Elementary.
Shot outside his home in southeast just before noon today.
Sent.
Where are you going?
- To see the mother.
- You don't wanna...?
There's work to do.
I'll see you later tonight.
Tyler never did anything wrong.
He was a good boy.
Everybody loved him.
It's okay.
If Tyler's school had been in session, this senseless killing would have never taken place.
We need to end this strike now and get all our children back in school where they belong before we risk another death like this.
So, Mr. Spinella, I am headed to the capitol right now, and I will remain there until you are ready to meet and talk so that we can end this pointless strike.
Thank you all for coming.
Let's go back inside.
Mr. Spinella, one question...
Mr. Spinella is not to make a comment at this time.
No comment.
No comment.
Thank you.
Frank.
So?
You said you wanted to talk.
You said you wanted to work out a compromise.
I lied.
Excuse me?
I have no intention of working out a compromise.
So then why the fuck are we here, Frank?
What the hell's the matter with you?
You think this is some kind of a game?
No.
These are real people with families to feed.
Would you please stop that?
Stop what?
In five seconds, I'm out of here.
One.
Two.
Three.
- Four.
- Goodbye, Frank.
You know the difference between you and me, Marty?
What?
I'm a white-trash cracker from a white-trash town that no one would even bother to piss on.
But here's the difference--
I've made something of myself.
I have the keys to the capitol.
People respect me.
But you, you're still nothing.
You're just an uppity dago in an expensive suit turning tricks for the unions.
Nobody respects the unions anymore, Marty.
They're dying.
And no one respects you.
The most you'll ever make of yourself is blowing men like me.
Men with real power.
Yes.
I can smell the cock on your breath from here.
You think you can get under my skin?
I know I can.
Kiss my ass, Frank.
You can't afford to walk out.
Watch me.
I've got a dead, underprivileged kid in my pocket.
What do you have?
I have 2 million honorable teachers.
Fair enough.
But I got something even better.
Go ahead.
Open it.
Okay.
I'll play your game.
You're an idiot.
Stamper threw it.
You're full of shit.
Oh, no, Stamper threw the brick.
And I made sure Claire distracted my security.
Are you kidding me?
And to think you wanted me to apologize to my wife.
You would do something that low, Frank?
I arranged the brick, Marty, just like I arranged this meeting this afternoon.
Back off, Frank.
Why don't you just get down on your knees
- where you really belong?
- Back off, Frank.
Because the only thing you're gonna get from me
- is come on your--
- Fuck you!
Everything okay in there?
Ugh.
Look, I'll-
- I'll tell them you provoked me.
I'll tell them that you threw the brick yourself.
And who's going to believe you?
You just assaulted a United States congressman, which is a felony.
But I'm not gonna press charges, Marty.
Because the strike ends now.
You think it'll leave a scar?
I have a thick skin.
The next time you ask me to invite someone in for coffee, will you please make sure no guns go off?
I'll do my best.
I saw Steve again today.
How is he?
In a lot of pain.
Should I go see him?
I don't think you need to.
Zoe Barnes.
When he dies, we'll pay for his funeral.
You don't need to take it?
No.
I'm done with work today.
and we've got millions of kids stuck home from school.
Do you blame the White House or Congress?
I personally have very little sympathy for the teachers.
We're over three weeks into this strike.
It's costing the country billions of dollars, and instead of offering solutions...
There's a big difference between taking a stand and sitting on your hands.
I don't know whether to call it cowardice...
It's his agenda.
And the problem is that he stole sound, conservative ideas.
The only smart thing he's done is lift his platform from the Republican platform.
I admit it, Linda.
This got away from me.
But we can't turn back time.
We have to hold our ground.
While our approval ratings continue to nosedive?
Spinella and I worked together for years on dozens of labor-related bills.
I thought he'd be reasonable.
Well, you were wrong about that.
Well, I didn't think he'd be insane enough to go on strike, and I didn't think the strike would last this long.
So you've been wrong twice about this.
Why should I believe you're right about holding out?
We threatened collective bargaining in order to get performance standards and charter funding.
That's the deal that we made.
We took that stand.
We lay down now, we lose it all.
There'll be no reform, just an empty bill.
I understand the logic, Frank, but we're in damage control now.
But we can't close one wound by opening another.
But we're the Democrats.
We're the ones who are supposed to be defending the teachers.
But you can't have it both ways, Linda.
You can't have the reform you want and keep the teachers happy at the same time.
You knew that when we started.
Okay, then if we have to choose, we choose to keep the teachers happy.
That is a mistake, Linda.
We've already crossed the Rubicon.
I'm telling you this.
The President wants to change the bill.
We should've done it three weeks ago.
We didn't.
So you have to do it now.
Give me more time, Linda, please.
If I can break this strike and get everything we want in this bill, can we agree that's preferable to folding?
Of course.
If we can count on that...
Then count on me for just one more week.
If the strike isn't over by then, I'll change the bill.
Frank...
No.
One more week.
That's all.
This is the worst possible position to be in.
If I water down the bill, the President will still see me as a failure.
If the strike doesn't end in a week,
I've forced myself into a corner.
Only total victory will put me back in his good graces.
The alternative is exile, which would mean the last five months were for nothing.
I cannot abide falling back to square one.
Does the Congressman need me, ma'am?
No.
I just was wondering if you wanted a cup of coffee.
I just brewed a fresh pot.
I'm good, ma'am.
But thanks.
Are you sure?
My shift's done in a couple hours.
I'll be fine.
You know, come on.
Stretch your legs.
I won't take no for an answer.
What did you do before you joined the leadership detail?
I was a cop here in D.C.
Before that, I was in the Marines, ma'am.
Thank you.
Did you serve overseas?
I did, ma'am.
Bahrain, then Afghanistan.
Served most of my second tour in the Korengal Valley.
You wanna know if I killed anyone?
I think I know the answer.
I got a dinner meeting with Birch.
I'll be...
I invited him in for coffee.
Well, drink it fast.
We leave in five...
Get down!
Stay away from the windows!
Stop!
You'll have six of my best men covering you around the clock.
I guess I'm wondering why we didn't at least have one of your best men covering us now.
He'll be disciplined, sir.
He shot a gun in a residential neighborhood.
I want him fired.
There will be a full investigation, and we'll take the necessary action.
Steve never would've let this happen.
Is he better yet?
Because I would feel a lot safer if he was with us.
Unfortunately, he won't be coming back, sir.
I thought he just had a gallbladder infection.
He did, they found more.
His pancreas, stage four.
Jesus.
Oh, my God.
That's awful.
How much longer does he have?
Not long.
A few weeks.
At least that's what his wife told me.
We have to go see him.
Can you get the information where he is?
Of course.
I'll make sure you get it right away.
Thank you, Captain.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Good night.
Front door.
Yes, sir.
Your weapon.
Your badge, too.
Am I suspended, sir?
You had a suspect on foot, and you fire your gun?
Sir, I realize that...
Do you know how this reflects on me?
That one of our men could be so careless?
Not only do you abandon your post for coffee.
You could've killed a bystander.
That slug was found on somebody's front stoop.
What if it went in their house?
Your badge, Meechum.
Two reasons, which are really the same reason.
I was sick of working for other people, and I knew I could do a better job than my bosses.
They kept trying to suppress me, shutting me out.
So I said, "Fuck it.
I'll do it my way."
And then you just quit?
Not like you did.
I slaved away until I lined up the money to start Slugline.
Once Slugline gets big enough, what's the plan?
Are you gonna sell it like Arianna?
Probably.
And then who knows?
Whatever the next adventure is.
Maybe Shanghai.
So I shouldn't expect to have a job in two years?
Do you ever wanna have any job for more than two years?
What about you?
What's your big plan?
Uh, I don't know yet.
Come on.
Slugline is just a stepping stone for you.
You know what?
I should take this.
Go.
Do your thing.
Hey.
Do you have proof Spinella was behind it?
Put it in context.
Three weeks into a national teachers' strike...
At the home of Francis Underwood, who has led the charge on...
There you go.
Now post that before one of my neighbors calls a local 11:00 hack.
When do I see you next?
I'm background on this.
I'm not your source.
You can't talk now?
No.
When?
Soon, with bells on.
What about "more school books, less bricks"?
No, it's too broad.
We need a better sound bite.
Something specific, something that points the finger directly at Spinella.
He'll deny any involvement.
Well, of course he will.
So how do we get around that?
We say he can't control his troops.
There's no evidence it was a teacher.
Who else could it be?
Look, he's gonna shift blame for the strike back on Congress.
No.
We need something clear, something clean, something that sticks in your head.
"Teachers need a lesson in self-restraint."
No.
You're not hearing me.
People like teachers.
No.
We need something that makes Spinella the villain.
His lack of control, his inability...
Disorganized labor.
It's disorganized labor, plain and simple.
When you've got angry teachers throwing bricks through congressmen's windows, you've gotta blame the union leadership.
We'll be beefing up the security for the entire leadership.
And I strongly encourage Marty Spinella to keep his people in line.
This is starting to look like disorganized labor.
Do you really think Marty Spinella is to blame?
Whether Mr. Spinella is behind this or not, he might wanna tone down the rhetoric, before disorganized labor turns into organized crime.
No one can prove anything.
So that's the most cogent response.
Well, go on TV and say that.
You deplore violence in any form.
It's Congress that should take responsibility.
I don't want to degenerate to Frank's level.
We need to kill this brick thing.
It's distracting people from the issues.
She's right.
It'll eat up one cycle, and it'll disappear.
No.
This story is getting traction.
Support for the strike is dipping.
So is the President's approval ratings.
But he gets to stay in the Oval Office another three years, no matter what.
We can't afford another three weeks.
When I told the unions to strike,
I told them to prepare for the long haul.
All right?
Their accounts dry up, we keep going.
We figure it out.
I am not going to blink over something like this.
Fine.
But if we lose the public relations battle, none of that does us any good.
Frank wants us on the defensive.
I think this story is going to blow over.
If I'm wrong, we'll reevaluate.
But I wanna give it another day or two first.
Okay?
Hi, Adam.
You all right?
I saw the news.
Yes, I'm fine.
That's gotta rattle the nerves.
Brick coming through the window.
It did, some.
So are you staying in the house?
We've got extra security now, so...
Well, it made me think of you, so I figured I'd just check in.
I appreciate that.
We still haven't talked, have we?
There's no need to.
I think we should.
Here's how I see it.
You asked me to come down.
I did.
We both had ideas about what that could mean.
Probably very similar ideas.
But then you changed your mind.
So be it.
There's no reason we can't be in touch or remain friends.
Let's not fool ourselves, Adam.
So I won't call again.
Done.
I'm not saying that.
What are you saying?
I just called because I care about you.
No agenda.
If you wanna talk again, call me.
If not, I understand.
It's up to you.
You think I'm being unreasonable?
I think you're doing whatever it is you need to do, and I'm not gonna question it.
It was sweet of you to call.
Listen, you probably need to get back to work.
I know I do.
I should go.
Yeah.
Okay.
Take care.
Okay.
Frank, you got a minute?
I'll see you inside.
I wanna be governor, and I want your help.
Am I still on the short list?
You are.
I haven't had a drink in over a month.
I'm clean.
Is that because I asked, or because it's what you want?
It was about time I took responsibility for myself.
Taking responsibility is one thing, and it's admirable.
But running for governor of a major state is a whole nother ball game.
Let me tell you something, Frank.
I got elected to Congress 'cause I seized the moment that opportunity struck.
You kept me on that list.
I wanna seize that opportunity.
If you help me out, I'll give you everything I got.
Well, that's all I've been waiting to hear.
All right.
I'll tell you what.
I need to make some calls, check in with some people.
Give me a few days.
I'll get back to you.
Of course.
And, Peter...
I feel like I've met the real you for the first time just now.
Janet.
Is this a bad time?
No, not at all.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were coming.
Here.
Take my chair.
Oh, no.
I'm fine.
I'll take these.
Thank you.
Hello, Steve.
These could use some water.
I'll be right back.
Francis and I were so upset when we heard.
I'm sorry I haven't come sooner.
I didn't want too many people knowing.
Yes.
Francis wishes he could be here.
He wants you to know he's praying for you.
Couldn't make it, huh?
No, there's a big teachers' strike going on right now, and he's been stuck in his office for weeks.
I get it.
I saw the news.
The brick.
Right.
I told Francis that probably wouldn't have happened if you were there.
No.
Probably not.
I never seen him pray.
Not in eight years.
You said he was praying for me.
You've seen us in church.
Yeah, but I never went inside.
They're just gorgeous.
Mrs. Underwood, thank you so much.
Please, call me Claire.
I know you got things to do.
Of course.
If you need anything at all, call me.
You have my cell.
Anything at all.
And I'm sorry to have surprised you.
No.
It was so nice of you to come.
Thank you.
I know Steve appreciated it.
Check this out.
It's foam.
How many of these we have?
200.
But I can get more.
Get more.
Bring it on!
You need to give the teachers the respect they deserve.
We can't back away from this, Marty.
We've gotta face it head-on.
They provoked us.
They were throwing foam.
Our guys were throwing punches.
We're gonna come off the bad guys here.
Okay.
Okay.
I get it.
I get it.
But I wanna be smart about this.
I wanna do something definitive that'll put this to bed and get us back on message.
CNN.
One-on-one, you and Underwood.
8:00 tonight.
Frank is excellent in debates.
Go strong against him.
Address the brick right to his face.
End of story.
Underwood says he's in if you are.
Okay.
But I want as much prep as possible, okay?
I want to run questions.
You moderate, you play Underwood.
Wear this one.
Then come in here.
I wanna put powder on you.
Well, there's somebody at the studio can do that.
Yes, and they always cake on too much.
I'm doing it.
War paint.
How bloody do you think it'll be?
I think I oughta be able to dispatch with him easily enough.
You remember Peter Russo?
He's doing well.
He hasn't had a drink in a month.
Good for him.
I like him.
Good, because he could use your help.
How?
We're running him for governor.
Ambitious.
Mm.
We wanna create jobs in his district.
It's on the Delaware River.
I thought we might be able to put a bill together.
Something with an economic upside.
This has to do with the shipyard closing?
We need the shipbuilders' support for his campaign.
You think you might be able to draft a bill that he can sponsor?
I'm really trying to focus on international projects, Francis.
Not domestic legislation.
I understand, but I could really use your help, Claire.
Does Catherine Durant still owe us?
When you make someone Secretary of State, they owe you for life.
We're having trouble getting our water filters through Sudanese customs.
I'll call from the car.
Tomorrow's fine.
I would have done that anyway.
I know.
I'm ready for battle.
You wanna come watch?
No.
You go on ahead.
Come on.
Watch me put the final nail in Spinella's coffin.
It'll be fun.
Marty.
Frank.
Come on, people.
Take your marks.
Congressman, would you like to respond to that?
Yes, I would.
$2 billion of taxpayers' money being wasted.
And Congress should be ashamed of itself for that, Frank.
What?
Did Congress force the teachers to go on strike, Marty?
No, we didn't.
Really, Frank?
When you threaten teachers' ability to negotiate as a union, when you threaten their job security, you threaten their livelihood, of course you force them to strike.
And did we also force them to start throwing bricks at people's houses?
You know what, I'm really glad you brought that up, because you know there's absolutely no proof that that incident had anything to do with this strike.
And I wanna take the opportunity to say publicly that we categorically condemn any use of violence whatsoever, or intimidation.
What you're saying, essentially, is that you can't control your own people.
That's not what I'm saying.
That is what you're saying.
You're disorganized.
Disorganized labor.
You know what, you could keep trotting out that phrase all you like, but you know what I'd like to do, Frank?
I would like to get back to the issue here of educating our children and the fact that Congress is not living up to their commitment.
Well, you know what I would like?
What?
An apology.
If not to me, then to my wife.
When that brick came through our window, it was terrifying.
She's standing right over there.
Claire?
We need camera two on the wife.
Now, why don't you look her in the eye and tell her that your people had nothing to do with that brick.
Are you serious?
Yes.
Okay.
Mrs. Underwood, Claire,
I am sincerely sorry that you had to go through that ordeal, truly.
And it actually sickens me that someone made you feel unsafe in your own home.
And I give you my word that to the best of my knowledge, none of our people had anything to do with it.
But you know what sickens me more?
That right now, your husband is using you as a prop on national television to try and win a debate.
So I think you're the one that owes your wife an apology, Frank.
And when you're done apologizing, can we please get back to the issue here of educating our children?
No.
You've got this wrong, Marty.
There is no "you" and "I" in education.
Well, I mean, yes, there's the letters,
"U" and "I" are in the word education.
But education with a capital "E"...
You know what I'm talking about.
I don't think I do.
Yes, you do, Marty.
"U" and "I", education.
So, we're gonna waste the rest of this debate naming all the vowels in...
I'm happy to play the vowel game.
You wanna play the vowel game with me?
All right."U" think "I"
"O" "U"
"A" apology?
But no, no, no.
"U" "O" "I."
Interesting.
You left out "E" for "Education."
So let...
Defecation.
Edification.
I'm sorry.
LOL.
Uh...
You like Sesame Street so much?
Why don't you give the kids the money they deserve?
What I'm trying to say about education...
Well, I guess school's still in session.
I guess you schooled me there, Marty.
Let's move on.
Please.
Humor aside, there are more important issues out there.
I had no intention of bringing you into this.
It wasn't part of a plan.
I would've told you if it was.
I know.
The idea just struck me, and I went with it.
I don't mind that you improvised.
I just wish you'd done it better.
Congressman Frank Underwood says he got, quote, schooled by AFT spokesman and chief strategist, Martin Spinella, during a debate last night on this network.
In the past 24 hours, reruns of the gaffe have played nonstop on TV news programs and the Internet.
A YouTube clip set to techno music has logged more than 300,000 hits and spawned dozens of other spoofs.
?
No, no, no
? "E" "O" "I"
?
With a capital "E"
?
Education LOL ?
That was as clumsy as the Lee Harvey Oswald prison transfer.
What was he thinking?
Just give me one second.
There's a deli down the street.
Patti, thanks for coming.
Sit down.
You want some coffee?
No, thanks.
I'm good.
Hey, did you see Bill Maher last night?
No, I didn't.
It was about the CNN thing.
I have to admit, Frank, it was kind of funny.
Well, I'll have to catch a rerun.
How you doing?
You holding up all right with the strike?
Let's talk about Pennsylvania.
I have your candidate.
Peter Russo.
1st Congressional District.
We crossed him off.
I know.
It's a mistake.
He's young, he's handsome.
He's bright.
Nobody knows who he is outside of Philadelphia.
There's no donor base, no infrastructure.
You start me off with funding from the DNC and I'll raise an army around this guy.
I will personally oversee his campaign.
Is that the best we can do?
What's better than a blank slate in the right hands?
Ed, you need to go.
Congressman, do you have a moment?
Thank you, Patti.
Have him call me.
I will.
Ed?
Please.
What is going on?
I'm taking care of it.
One second, sir.
Please.
All right.
Make it fast, Meechum.
It's not easy for me to ask this, but I was wondering if you could put in a good word with my boss.
A good word?
They're going to discharge me, sir.
I messed up.
I'm fully aware.
But my job, it means everything to me, and I know a good word from you would...
Look, I have nothing against you personally, Meechum, but I can't get involved in these sort of affairs.
There's protocols and rules.
Sir, please, if you spoke to Cardiff...
There is nothing that I can do.
If anyone could convince the Captain, it would be you, Congressman.
I'm sorry.
I wish you all the best, Meechum.
Doug.
What did Barney Hull say?
That we'd be the first to know.
I can't believe there hasn't been a single 911 call.
There's been plenty.
It's just not the sort we're after.
We got that kid in Atlanta.
No, it's got to be here.
I can't be getting on a plane.
It looks too opportunistic.
Maybe if we open it up a little bit?
No, we cannot lower our standards.
We just have to be patient.
New rule.
Now that the debate's over,
Frank Underwood has to tell us what the hell that was.
Seriously, Congressman, was that a joke?
I haven't seen something just lay there like that since...
I gotta go all the way back to my prom night.
Can we just settle this strike please?
Teachers have been out of the classroom for so long, middle-schoolers are starting to have sex with each other.
Enough.
I don't know why you had it on in the first place.
I love you, Francis.
I know.
We should say that more often to each other.
I need to clear my head.
...north and east of the airport.
I'm gonna need that in time for that meeting.
Peter, let's talk.
So.
I've spoken to Patricia Whittaker.
She's on board.
You'll be getting $4 million in start-up funding from the DNC.
I'll pick the team.
You announce in August.
But the campaign starts today.
Are you ready?
I've already put together a platform.
It's mostly broad strokes, but we can hone it.
Good.
The first thing we need to address is your sobriety.
You don't need to worry about that.
Have you been going to meetings?
You mean AA?
Yes.
That's not really my thing.
If you want my help, then going to meetings is my one requirement.
I know I had a problem, Frank.
I accept that.
And I've taken responsibility for that, but I don't think going to meetings is necessary.
You cannot white-knuckle your recovery, Peter.
This campaign will be the hardest thing you've ever done in your life.
I realize that.
I'm prepared for that.
You think you are.
But we can't take any chances.
The party's investing in you.
I need to make sure you're investing in yourself.
All right.
I'll do whatever I have to do.
Good.
You'll start tomorrow morning.
Doug will take you.
Stamper?
He's been sober 14 years.
Doug has a drinking problem?
Had.
Not anymore.
He'll be your sponsor.
In the meantime, I want you to meet with my wife, Claire.
She runs the Clean Water Initiative.
She's expecting you, so clear your schedule and head over there now.
Frank.
Thank you.
For believing in me.
You're gonna make a great candidate, Peter.
The shipyard closing frees up 1,100 acres of federal land.
Our goal is to pass a Watershed Act for the Delaware River.
We develop the land in an environmentally responsible way, creating jobs in the process.
How many jobs?
Thousands.
We're aiming for the $200 million mark.
We got a lot of work to do.
We do, but you can start with the congressmen whose districts fall within the watershed.
Do you have a draft of the bill you can show me?
We haven't sponsored any environmental legislation.
We'll draft it in consultation with your staff.
Gillian will be the point person on our end.
I don't have any legislation experience.
I'll help you.
When do we start?
We just did.
Will you introduce him to the research team?
I'll be there in one second.
Sure.
Mr. President?
I want it over.
As soon as possible.
Gut the bill, Frank.
Do whatever's necessary to end this.
Mr. President, if we give in now, the public won't credit you with a victory.
Not even a hollow one.
They'll chalk it up as a colossal defeat.
Well, that's on you, Frank.
You let this situation devolve to where it is.
I've already been blamed for the largest teachers' strike in U.S. history.
I won't be held accountable for it dragging on months and months.
Mr. President, we have to end this strike on your terms.
Not anyone else's.
By debating Marty Spinella on CNN?
Sir, you have placed your faith in me thus far.
I would ask that you continue to do so.
Well, whatever you're doing, Frank, isn't working, so I'm stepping in.
Gut the bill.
Like Linda said.
No.
I'm sorry, Mr. President, but I will not do that.
Are you letting pride cloud your judgment, Frank?
Respectfully, sir, you're allowing fear to cloud yours.
Not an easy thing, to say no to the most powerful man in the free world.
But sometimes the only way to gain your superior's respect is to defy him.
What do we have on the schedule, Linda?
Your meeting with the Fed Oversight Committee.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Do you have my briefing?
Right here.
Good.
Let's look it over.
Hi.
How'd it go with Peter?
It went well.
Is he game?
Completely.
Thank you.
That's a big weight off my shoulders.
You sound tired.
Tired.
Impatient.
What can I do?
Nothing.
This one's up to fate.
I don't like when we leave things to fate.
Neither do I.
Does that mean I'm gonna have the bed to myself tonight?
Probably.
Can't Doug man the fort?
Well, he could, but I'd just toss and turn.
If I'm not gonna sleep, I might as well not sleep here.
Well, I'll leave the ringer on.
Call me if you want company.
I will.
Good night.
Good night.
You should go home.
I could take it from here.
Vigilance.
It's good for the soul.
10-59.
Corner of 16th and Q. 10-59.
What's that?
Disorderly conduct.
Do you believe in karma?
Absolutely not.
Well, I do.
At least tonight.
Get Captain Cardiff on the phone.
Let's do something about Meechum.
What?
Get him his job back.
He fired his weapon.
He overreacted.
Cardiff.
On the phone.
Now.
Nancy, give me Captain Cardiff, please.
We might as well do one productive thing while we wait.
It requires very little of me and will mean the world to him.
It's a very inexpensive investment.
Hello, sir.
This is Doug Stamper.
I have Francis Underwood for you.
I got him on.
Captain, I know it's late, but I'd like to talk to you about Edward Meechum.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Are you hungry?
Mm-hmm.
You have any trouble getting in?
No, they made me put it through the X-ray machine twice, so I hope it didn't overcook it.
Frank, you always pay too much.
This is way too much.
It's for the inconvenience.
You know, 20 years you been coming to my joint.
This is the first time I've been to yours.
What do you think?
I could get used to it.
Well, you're welcome any time.
Thank you, Freddy.
Always, Frank.
We got a 27 Delta two. 446 3rd Street...
That's a drive-by shooting.
Get details.
Sir, I want to thank you for talking to the Captain.
He told me you called, and I can't tell you how grateful I am.
I want you to listen very closely to what I'm about to say.
From this moment on, you are a rock.
You absorb nothing, you say nothing, and nothing breaks you.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
Welcome back.
Steve?
I'll leave you be.
Where...
Where's Janet?
She's been here every day for the last few weeks.
I told her, go home, get some rest.
Well, is everything okay?
Your text said it was important.
I don't know how to put this.
The thing is, I...
I've been thinking.
A lot.
About my life.
About the things I haven't done.
Things I haven't said.
I hate your husband.
A lot of people do.
The past eight years, I watched over him.
But it wasn't him I was watching.
And every time I saw you, every time I heard your voice, all I could think to myself was,
"Jesus, what I wouldn't give."
I can't tell you how many times I thought about that.
You know what Francis said to me when he proposed?
I remember his exact words.
He said, "Claire, if all you want is happiness,
"say no.
"I'm not gonna give you a couple of kids
"and count the days until retirement.
"I promise you freedom from that.
"I promise you'll never be bored."
You know, he was the only man, and there were a lot of others who proposed.
But he was the only one who understood me.
He didn't put me on some pedestal.
He knew that I didn't want to be adored or coddled.
So he took my hand and he put a ring on it.
Because he knew I'd say yes.
He's a man who knows how to take what he wants.
Is this what you wanted?
Is that the way you wanted it?
Stop.
Stop.
Please.
Please.
Stop.
Don't.
You told me your truth.
Now you know mine.
Hey, it's Peter.
I don't expect you to call me back, but I wanted to let you know I stopped drinking last night, and I went to my first AA meeting this morning.
I'm supposed to reach out and make amends to those I've hurt.
But I guess the real reason I called you is just to say I love you and I miss you.
I hope you're well.
This is work, not play.
Then why'd you bother coming over?
I was hoping you'd answer the door naked.
That would be play.
That would be work with a view.
Sorry to disappoint.
How many characters in a tweet?
140.
Type this, let me know where you land.
Eight-year-old Washington D.C. boy killed by a stray bullet in gangland shoot-out.
61 characters left.
He should have been in school?
30 left.
Spinella to blame.
Question mark.
128.
Press send.
Now give me a name, details.
Tyler Davis.
Third-grader at Vernon Baker Elementary.
Shot outside his home in Southeast just before noon today.
Sent.
Where are you going?
To see the mother.
You don't wanna...
There's work to do.
I'll see you later tonight.
Tyler never did anything wrong.
He was a good boy.
Everybody loved him.
It's okay.
If Tyler's school had been in session, this senseless killing would have never taken place.
We need to end this strike now and get all our children back in school where they belong, before we risk another death like this.
So, Mr. Spinella, I am headed to the Capitol right now, and I will remain there until you are ready to meet and talk so that we can end this pointless strike.
Thank you all for coming.
Let's go back inside.
Mr. Spinella, one question.
Mr. Spinella is not gonna make comments at this time.
No comment.
No comment.
Thank you.
Frank.
So?
You said you wanted to talk.
You said you wanted to work out a compromise.
I lied.
Excuse me?
I have no intention of working out a compromise.
So then why the fuck are we here, Frank?
What the hell's the matter with you?
You think this is some kind of a game?
No.
These are real people with families to feed.
Would you please stop that?
Stop what?
In five seconds, I'm out of here.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Goodbye, Frank.
You know the difference between you and me, Marty?
What?
I'm a white-trash cracker from a white-trash town that no one would even bother to piss on.
But here's the difference.
I've made something of myself.
I have the keys to the Capitol.
People respect me.
But you, you're still nothing.
You're just an uppity dago in an expensive suit turning tricks for the unions.
Nobody respects the unions anymore, Marty.
They're dying.
And no one respects you.
The most you'll ever make of yourself is blowing men like me.
Men with real power.
Yes.
I can smell the cock on your breath from here.
You think you can get under my skin?
I know I can.
Yeah.
Kiss my ass, Frank.
You can't afford to walk out.
Watch me.
I've got a dead, underprivileged kid in my pocket.
What do you have?
I have two million honorable teachers.
Fair enough.
But I got something even better.
Go ahead.
Open it.
Okay.
I'll play your game.
You're an idiot.
Stamper threw it.
You're full of shit.
Oh no, Stamper threw the brick.
And I made sure Claire distracted my security.
Are you kidding me?
And to think you wanted me to apologize to my wife.
You would do something that low, Frank?
I arranged the brick, Marty, just like I arranged this meeting this afternoon.
Back off, Frank.
Why don't you just get down on your knees where you really belong?
Back off, Frank.
Because the only thing you're gonna get from me is cum on your...
Fuck you!
Everything okay in there, sir?
Look, I'll tell them you provoked me.
I'll tell them that you threw the brick yourself.
And who's going to believe you?
You just assaulted a United States Congressman, which is a felony.
But I'm not gonna press charges, Marty.
Because the strike ends now.
You think it'll leave a scar?
I have a thick skin.
The next time you ask me to invite someone in for coffee, will you please make sure no guns go off?
I'll do my best.
I saw Steve again today.
How is he?
In a lot of pain.
Should I go see him?
I don't think you need to.
Zoe Barnes.
When he dies, we'll pay for his funeral.
You don't need to take it?
No.
I'm done with work today.
Does the Congressman need me, ma'am?
No.
I just was wondering if you wanted a cup of coffee.
I just brewed a fresh pot.
I'm good, ma'am.
But thanks.
Are you sure?
My shift's done in a couple hours.
I'll be fine.
You know, come on.
Stretch your legs.
I won't take no for an answer.
What did you do before you joined the leadership detail?
I was a cop here in D.C.
Before that, I was in the Marines, ma'am.
Thank you.
Did you serve overseas?
I did, ma'am.
Bahrain, then Afghanistan.
Served most of my second tour in the Korengal Valley.
You wanna know if I killed anyone?
I think I know the answer.
I got a dinner meeting with Birch.
I'll be...
I invited him in for coffee.
Well, drink it fast.
We leave in five...
Get down!
Stay away from the windows!
Stop!
You'll have six of my best men covering you around the clock.
I guess I'm wondering why we didn't at least have one of your best men covering us now.
He'll be disciplined, sir.
He shot a gun in a residential neighborhood.
I want him fired.
There will be a full investigation, and we'll take the necessary action.
Steve never would've let this happen.
Is he better yet?
Because I would feel a lot safer if he was with us.
Unfortunately, he won't be coming back, sir.
I thought he just had a gallbladder infection.
He did, they found more.
His pancreas, stage four.
Jesus.
Oh, my God.
That's awful.
How much longer does he have?
Not long.
A few weeks.
At least that's what his wife told me.
We have to go see him.
Can you get the information where he is?
Of course.
I'll make sure you get it right away.
Thank you, Captain.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Good night.
Front door.
Yes, sir.
Your weapon.
Your badge, too.
Am I suspended, sir?
You had a suspect on foot, and you fire your gun?
Sir, I realize that...
Do you know how this reflects on me?
That one of our men could be so careless?
Not only do you abandon your post for coffee.
You could've killed a bystander.
That slug was found on somebody's front stoop.
What if it went in their house?
Your badge, Meechum.
Two reasons, which are really the same reason.
I was sick of working for other people, and I knew I could do a better job than my bosses.
They kept trying to suppress me, shutting me out.
So I said, "Fuck it.
I'll do it my way."
And then you just quit?
Not like you did.
I slaved away until I lined up the money to start Slugline.
Once Slugline gets big enough, what's the plan?
Are you gonna sell it like Arianna?
Probably.
And then who knows?
Whatever the next adventure is.
Maybe Shanghai.
So I shouldn't expect to have a job in two years?
Do you ever wanna have any job for more than two years?
What about you?
What's your big plan?
Uh, I don't know yet.
Come on.
Slugline is just a stepping stone for you.
You know what?
I should take this.
Go.
Do your thing.
Hey.
Do you have proof Spinella was behind it?
Put it in context.
Three weeks into a national teachers' strike...
At the home of Francis Underwood, who has led the charge on...
There you go.
Now post that before one of my neighbors calls a local 11:00 hack.
When do I see you next?
I'm background on this.
I'm not your source.
You can't talk now?
No.
When?
Soon, with bells on.
What about "more school books, less bricks"?
No, it's too broad.
We need a better sound bite.
Something specific, something that points the finger directly at Spinella.
He'll deny any involvement.
Well, of course he will.
So how do we get around that?
We say he can't control his troops.
There's no evidence it was a teacher.
Who else could it be?
Look, he's gonna shift blame for the strike back on Congress.
No.
We need something clear, something clean, something that sticks in your head.
"Teachers need a lesson in self-restraint."
No.
You're not hearing me.
People like teachers.
No.
We need something that makes Spinella the villain.
His lack of control, his inability...
Disorganized labor.
It's disorganized labor, plain and simple.
When you've got angry teachers throwing bricks through congressmen's windows, you've gotta blame the union leadership.
We'll be beefing up the security for the entire leadership.
And I strongly encourage Marty Spinella to keep his people in line.
This is starting to look like disorganized labor.
Do you really think Marty Spinella is to blame?
Whether Mr. Spinella is behind this or not, he might wanna tone down the rhetoric, before disorganized labor turns into organized crime.
No one can prove anything.
So that's the most cogent response.
Well, go on TV and say that.
You deplore violence in any form.
It's Congress that should take responsibility.
I don't want to degenerate to Frank's level.
We need to kill this brick thing.
It's distracting people from the issues.
She's right.
It'll eat up one cycle, and it'll disappear.
No.
This story is getting traction.
Support for the strike is dipping.
So is the President's approval ratings.
But he gets to stay in the Oval Office another three years, no matter what.
We can't afford another three weeks.
When I told the unions to strike,
I told them to prepare for the long haul.
All right?
Their accounts dry up, we keep going.
We figure it out.
I am not going to blink over something like this.
Fine.
But if we lose the public relations battle, none of that does us any good.
Frank wants us on the defensive.
I think this story is going to blow over.
If I'm wrong, we'll reevaluate.
But I wanna give it another day or two first.
Okay?
Hi, Adam.
You all right?
I saw the news.
Yes, I'm fine.
That's gotta rattle the nerves.
Brick coming through the window.
It did, some.
So are you staying in the house?
We've got extra security now, so...
Well, it made me think of you, so I figured I'd just check in.
I appreciate that.
We still haven't talked, have we?
There's no need to.
I think we should.
Here's how I see it.
You asked me to come down.
I did.
We both had ideas about what that could mean.
Probably very similar ideas.
But then you changed your mind.
So be it.
There's no reason we can't be in touch or remain friends.
Let's not fool ourselves, Adam.
So I won't call again.
Done.
I'm not saying that.
What are you saying?
I just called because I care about you.
No agenda.
If you wanna talk again, call me.
If not, I understand.
It's up to you.
You think I'm being unreasonable?
I think you're doing whatever it is you need to do, and I'm not gonna question it.
It was sweet of you to call.
Listen, you probably need to get back to work.
I know I do.
I should go.
Yeah.
Okay.
Take care.
Okay.
Frank, you got a minute?
I'll see you inside.
I wanna be governor, and I want your help.
Am I still on the short list?
You are.
I haven't had a drink in over a month.
I'm clean.
Is that because I asked, or because it's what you want?
It was about time I took responsibility for myself.
Taking responsibility is one thing, and it's admirable.
But running for governor of a major state is a whole nother ball game.
Let me tell you something, Frank.
I got elected to Congress 'cause I seized the moment that opportunity struck.
You kept me on that list.
I wanna seize that opportunity.
If you help me out, I'll give you everything I got.
Well, that's all I've been waiting to hear.
All right.
I'll tell you what.
I need to make some calls, check in with some people.
Give me a few days.
I'll get back to you.
Of course.
And, Peter...
I feel like I've met the real you for the first time just now.
Janet.
Is this a bad time?
No.
No, not at all.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were coming.
Here.
Take my chair.
Oh, no.
I'm fine.
I'll take these.
Thank you.
Hello, Steve.
Hey.
These could use some water.
I'll be right back.
Francis and I were so upset when we heard.
I'm sorry I haven't come sooner.
I didn't want too many people knowing.
Yes.
Francis wishes he could be here.
He wants you to know he's praying for you.
Couldn't make it, huh?
No, there's a big teachers' strike going on right now, and he's been stuck in his office for weeks.
I get it.
I saw the news.
The brick.
Right.
I told Francis that probably wouldn't have happened if you were there.
No.
Probably not.
I never seen him pray.
Not in eight years.
You said he was praying for me.
You've seen us in church.
Yeah, but I never went inside.
They're just gorgeous.
Mrs. Underwood, thank you so much.
Please, call me Claire.
I know you got things to do.
Of course.
If you need anything at all, call me.
You have my cell.
Anything at all.
And I'm sorry to have surprised you.
No.
It was so nice of you to come.
Thank you.
I know Steve appreciated it.
Check this out.
It's foam.
How many of these we have?
200.
But I can get more.
Get more.
Bring it on!
You need to give the teachers the respect they deserve.
We can't back away from this, Marty.
We've gotta face it head-on.
They provoked us.
They were throwing foam.
Our guys were throwing punches.
We're gonna come off the bad guys here.
Okay.
Okay.
I get it.
I get it.
But I wanna be smart about this.
I wanna do something definitive that'll put this to bed and get us back on message.
CNN.
One-on-one, you and Underwood.
8:00 tonight.
Frank is excellent in debates.
Go strong against him.
Address the brick right to his face.
End of story.
Underwood says he's in if you are.
Okay.
But I want as much prep as possible, okay?
I want to run questions.
You moderate, you play Underwood.
Wear this one.
Then come in here.
I wanna put powder on you.
Well, there's somebody at the studio can do that.
Yes, and they always cake on too much.
I'm doing it.
War paint.
How bloody do you think it'll be?
I think I oughta be able to dispatch with him easily enough.
You remember Peter Russo?
He's doing well.
He hasn't had a drink in a month.
Good for him.
I like him.
Good, because he could use your help.
How?
We're running him for governor.
Ambitious.
Mm.
We wanna create jobs in his district.
It's on the Delaware River.
I thought we might be able to put a bill together.
Something with an economic upside.
This has to do with the shipyard closing?
We need the shipbuilders' support for his campaign.
You think you might be able to draft a bill that he can sponsor?
I'm really trying to focus on international projects, Francis.
Not domestic legislation.
I understand, but I could really use your help, Claire.
Does Catherine Durant still owe us?
When you make someone Secretary of State, they owe you for life.
We're having trouble getting our water filters through Sudanese customs.
I'll call from the car.
Tomorrow's fine.
I would have done that anyway.
I know.
I'm ready for battle.
You wanna come watch?
No.
You go on ahead.
Come on.
Watch me put the final nail in Spinella's coffin.
It'll be fun.
Marty.
Frank.
Come on, people.
Take your marks.
Congressman, would you like to respond to that?
Yes, I would.
$2 billion of taxpayers' money being wasted.
And Congress should be ashamed of itself for that, Frank.
What?
Did Congress force the teachers to go on strike, Marty?
No, we didn't.
Really, Frank?
When you threaten teachers' ability to negotiate as a union, when you threaten their job security, you threaten their livelihood, of course you force them to strike.
And did we also force them to start throwing bricks at people's houses?
You know what, I'm really glad you brought that up, because you know there's absolutely no proof that that incident had anything to do with this strike.
And I wanna take the opportunity to say publicly that we categorically condemn any use of violence whatsoever, or intimidation.
What you're saying, essentially, is that you can't control your own people.
That's not what I'm saying.
That is what you're saying.
You're disorganized.
Disorganized labor.
You know what, you could keep trotting out that phrase all you like, but you know what I'd like to do, Frank?
I would like to get back to the issue here of educating our children and the fact that Congress is not living up to their commitment.
Well, you know what I would like?
What?
An apology.
If not to me, then to my wife.
When that brick came through our window, it was terrifying.
She's standing right over there.
Claire?
We need camera two on the wife.
Now, why don't you look her in the eye and tell her that your people had nothing to do with that brick.
Are you serious?
Yes.
Okay.
Mrs. Underwood, Claire,
I am sincerely sorry that you had to go through that ordeal, truly.
And it actually sickens me that someone made you feel unsafe in your own home.
And I give you my word that to the best of my knowledge, none of our people had anything to do with it.
But you know what sickens me more?
That right now, your husband is using you as a prop on national television to try and win a debate.
So I think you're the one that owes your wife an apology, Frank.
And when you're done apologizing, can we please get back to the issue here of educating our children?
No.
You've got this wrong, Marty.
There is no "you" and "I" in education.
Well, I mean, yes, there's the letters,
"U" and "I" are in the word education.
But education with a capital "E"...
You know what I'm talking about.
I don't think I do.
Yes, you do, Marty.
"U" and "I", education.
So, we're gonna waste the rest of this debate naming all the vowels in...
I'm happy to play the vowel game.
You wanna play the vowel game with me?
All right."U" think "I"
"O" "U"
"A" apology?
But no, no, no.
"U" "O" "I."
Interesting.
You left out "E" for "Education."
So let...
Defecation.
Edification.
I'm sorry.
LOL.
Uh...
You like Sesame Street so much?
Why don't you give the kids the money they deserve?
What I'm trying to say about education...
Well, I guess school's still in session.
I guess you schooled me there, Marty.
Let's move on.
Please.
Humor aside, there are more important issues out there.
I had no intention of bringing you into this.
It wasn't part of a plan.
I would've told you if it was.
I know.
The idea just struck me, and I went with it.
I don't mind that you improvised.
I just wish you'd done it better.
Congressman Frank Underwood says he got, quote, schooled by AFT spokesman and chief strategist, Martin Spinella, during a debate last night on this network.
In the past 24 hours, reruns of the gaffe have played nonstop on TV news programs and the Internet.
A YouTube clip set to techno music has logged more than 300,000 hits and spawned dozens of other spoofs.
♪ No, no, no
♪ "E" "O" "I"
♪ With a capital "E"
♪ Education LOL ♪
That was as clumsy as the Lee Harvey Oswald prison transfer.
What was he thinking?
Just give me one second.
There's a deli down the street.
Patti, thanks for coming.
Sit down.
You want some coffee?
No, thanks.
I'm good.
Hey, did you see Bill Maher last night?
No, I didn't.
It was about the CNN thing.
I have to admit, Frank, it was kind of funny.
Well, I'll have to catch a rerun.
How you doing?
You holding up all right with the strike?
Let's talk about Pennsylvania.
I have your candidate.
Peter Russo. 1st Congressional District.
We crossed him off.
I know.
It's a mistake.
He's young, he's handsome.
He's bright.
Nobody knows who he is outside of Philadelphia.
There's no donor base, no infrastructure.
You start me off with funding from the DNC and I'll raise an army around this guy.
I will personally oversee his campaign.
Is that the best we can do?
What's better than a blank slate in the right hands?
Ed, you need to go.
Congressman, do you have a moment?
Thank you, Patti.
Have him call me.
I will.
Ed?
Please.
What is going on?
I'm taking care of it.
One second, sir.
Please.
All right.
Make it fast, Meechum.
It's not easy for me to ask this, but I was wondering if you could put in a good word with my boss.
A good word?
They're going to discharge me, sir.
I messed up.
I'm fully aware.
But my job, it means everything to me, and I know a good word from you would...
Look, I have nothing against you personally, Meechum, but I can't get involved in these sort of affairs.
There's protocols and rules.
Sir, please, if you spoke to Cardiff...
There is nothing that I can do.
If anyone could convince the Captain, it would be you, Congressman.
I'm sorry.
I wish you all the best, Meechum.
Doug.
What did Barney Hull say?
That we'd be the first to know.
I can't believe there hasn't been a single 911 call.
There's been plenty.
It's just not the sort we're after.
We got that kid in Atlanta.
No, it's got to be here.
I can't be getting on a plane.
It looks too opportunistic.
Maybe if we open it up a little bit?
No, we cannot lower our standards.
We just have to be patient.
New rule.
Now that the debate's over,
Frank Underwood has to tell us what the hell that was.
Seriously, Congressman, was that a joke?
I haven't seen something just lay there like that since...
I gotta go all the way back to my prom night.
Can we just settle this strike please?
Teachers have been out of the classroom for so long, middle-schoolers are starting to have sex with each other.
Enough.
I don't know why you had it on in the first place.
I love you, Francis.
I know.
We should say that more often to each other.
I need to clear my head.
...north and east of the airport.
I'm gonna need that in time for that meeting.
Peter, let's talk.
So.
I've spoken to Patricia Whittaker.
She's on board.
You'll be getting $4 million in start-up funding from the DNC.
I'll pick the team.
You announce in August.
But the campaign starts today.
Are you ready?
I've already put together a platform.
It's mostly broad strokes, but we can hone it.
Good.
The first thing we need to address is your sobriety.
You don't need to worry about that.
Have you been going to meetings?
You mean AA?
Yes.
That's not really my thing.
If you want my help, then going to meetings is my one requirement.
I know I had a problem, Frank.
I accept that.
And I've taken responsibility for that, but I don't think going to meetings is necessary.
You cannot white-knuckle your recovery, Peter.
This campaign will be the hardest thing you've ever done in your life.
I realize that.
I'm prepared for that.
You think you are.
But we can't take any chances.
The party's investing in you.
I need to make sure you're investing in yourself.
All right.
I'll do whatever I have to do.
Good.
You'll start tomorrow morning.
Doug will take you.
Stamper?
He's been sober 14 years.
Doug has a drinking problem?
Had.
Not anymore.
He'll be your sponsor.
In the meantime, I want you to meet with my wife, Claire.
She runs the Clean Water Initiative.
She's expecting you, so clear your schedule and head over there now.
Frank.
Thank you.
For believing in me.
You're gonna make a great candidate, Peter.
The shipyard closing frees up 1,100 acres of federal land.
Our goal is to pass a Watershed Act for the Delaware River.
We develop the land in an environmentally responsible way, creating jobs in the process.
How many jobs?
Thousands.
We're aiming for the $200 million mark.
We got a lot of work to do.
We do, but you can start with the congressmen whose districts fall within the watershed.
Do you have a draft of the bill you can show me?
We haven't sponsored any environmental legislation.
We'll draft it in consultation with your staff.
Gillian will be the point person on our end.
I don't have any legislation experience.
I'll help you.
When do we start?
We just did.
Will you introduce him to the research team?
I'll be there in one second.
Sure.
Mr. President?
I want it over.
As soon as possible.
Gut the bill, Frank.
Do whatever's necessary to end this.
Mr. President, if we give in now, the public won't credit you with a victory.
Not even a hollow one.
They'll chalk it up as a colossal defeat.
Well, that's on you, Frank.
You let this situation devolve to where it is.
I've already been blamed for the largest teachers' strike in U.S. history.
I won't be held accountable for it dragging on months and months.
Mr. President, we have to end this strike on your terms.
Not anyone else's.
How?
By debating Marty Spinella on CNN?
Sir, you have placed your faith in me thus far.
I would ask that you continue to do so.
Well, whatever you're doing, Frank, isn't working, so I'm stepping in.
Gut the bill.
Like Linda said.
No.
I'm sorry, Mr. President, but I will not do that.
Are you letting pride cloud your judgment, Frank?
Respectfully, sir, you're allowing fear to cloud yours.
Not an easy thing, to say no to the most powerful man in the free world.
But sometimes the only way to gain your superior's respect is to defy him.
What do we have on the schedule, Linda?
Your meeting with the Fed Oversight Committee.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Do you have my briefing?
Right here.
Good.
Let's look it over.
Hi.
How'd it go with Peter?
It went well.
Is he game?
Completely.
Thank you.
That's a big weight off my shoulders.
You sound tired.
Tired.
Impatient.
What can I do?
Nothing.
This one's up to fate.
I don't like when we leave things to fate.
Neither do I.
Does that mean I'm gonna have the bed to myself tonight?
Probably.
Can't Doug man the fort?
Well, he could, but I'd just toss and turn.
If I'm not gonna sleep, I might as well not sleep here.
Well, I'll leave the ringer on.
Call me if you want company.
I will.
Good night.
Good night.
You should go home.
I could take it from here.
Vigilance.
It's good for the soul.
10-59.
Corner of 16th and Q. 10-59.
What's that?
Disorderly conduct.
Do you believe in karma?
Absolutely not.
Well, I do.
At least tonight.
Get Captain Cardiff on the phone.
Let's do something about Meechum.
What?
Get him his job back.
He fired his weapon.
He overreacted.
Cardiff.
On the phone.
Now.
Nancy, give me Captain Cardiff, please.
We might as well do one productive thing while we wait.
It requires very little of me and will mean the world to him.
It's a very inexpensive investment.
Hello, sir.
This is Doug Stamper.
I have Francis Underwood for you.
I got him on.
Captain, I know it's late, but I'd like to talk to you about Edward Meechum.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Are you hungry?
Mm-hmm.
You have any trouble getting in?
No, they made me put it through the X-ray machine twice, so I hope it didn't overcook it.
Frank, you always pay too much.
This is way too much.
It's for the inconvenience.
You know, 20 years you been coming to my joint.
This is the first time I've been to yours.
What do you think?
I could get used to it.
Well, you're welcome any time.
Thank you, Freddy.
Always, Frank.
We got a 27 Delta two. 446 3rd Street...
That's a drive-by shooting.
Get details.
Sir, I want to thank you for talking to the Captain.
He told me you called, and I can't tell you how grateful I am.
I want you to listen very closely to what I'm about to say.
From this moment on, you are a rock.
You absorb nothing, you say nothing, and nothing breaks you.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
Welcome back.
Steve?
I'll leave you be.
Where...
Where's Janet?
She's been here every day for the last few weeks.
I told her, go home, get some rest.
Well, is everything okay?
Your text said it was important.
I don't know how to put this.
The thing is, I...
I've been thinking.
A lot.
About my life.
About the things I haven't done.
Things I haven't said.
I hate your husband.
A lot of people do.
The past eight years, I watched over him.
But it wasn't him I was watching.
And every time I saw you, every time I heard your voice, all I could think to myself was,
"Jesus, what I wouldn't give."
I can't tell you how many times I thought about that.
You know what Francis said to me when he proposed?
I remember his exact words.
He said, "Claire, if all you want is happiness,
"say no.
"I'm not gonna give you a couple of kids
"and count the days until retirement.
"I promise you freedom from that.
"I promise you'll never be bored."
You know, he was the only man, and there were a lot of others who proposed.
But he was the only one who understood me.
He didn't put me on some pedestal.
He knew that I didn't want to be adored or coddled.
So he took my hand and he put a ring on it.
Because he knew I'd say yes.
He's a man who knows how to take what he wants.
Is this what you wanted?
Is that the way you wanted it?
Stop.
Stop.
Please.
Please.
Stop.
Don't.
You told me your truth.
Now you know mine.
Hey, it's Peter.
I don't expect you to call me back, but I wanted to let you know I stopped drinking last night, and I went to my first AA meeting this morning.
I'm supposed to reach out and make amends to those I've hurt.
But I guess the real reason I called you is just to say I love you and I miss you.
I hope you're well.
This is work, not play.
Then why'd you bother coming over?
I was hoping you'd answer the door naked.
That would be play.
That would be work with a view.
Sorry to disappoint.
How many characters in a tweet?
140.
Type this, let me know where you land.
Eight-year-old Washington D.C. boy killed by a stray bullet in gangland shoot-out.
61 characters left.
He should have been in school?
30 left.
Spinella to blame.
Question mark.
128.
Press send.
Now give me a name, details.
Tyler Davis.
Third-grader at Vernon Baker Elementary.
Shot outside his home in Southeast just before noon today.
Sent.
Where are you going?
To see the mother.
You don't wanna...
There's work to do.
I'll see you later tonight.
Tyler never did anything wrong.
He was a good boy.
Everybody loved him.
It's okay.
If Tyler's school had been in session, this senseless killing would have never taken place.
We need to end this strike now and get all our children back in school where they belong, before we risk another death like this.
So, Mr. Spinella, I am headed to the Capitol right now, and I will remain there until you are ready to meet and talk so that we can end this pointless strike.
Thank you all for coming.
Let's go back inside.
Mr. Spinella, one question.
Mr. Spinella is not gonna make comments at this time.
No comment.
No comment.
Thank you.
Frank.
So?
You said you wanted to talk.
You said you wanted to work out a compromise.
I lied.
Excuse me?
I have no intention of working out a compromise.
So then why the fuck are we here, Frank?
What the hell's the matter with you?
You think this is some kind of a game?
No.
These are real people with families to feed.
Would you please stop that?
Stop what?
In five seconds, I'm out of here.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Goodbye, Frank.
You know the difference between you and me, Marty?
What?
I'm a white-trash cracker from a white-trash town that no one would even bother to piss on.
But here's the difference.
I've made something of myself.
I have the keys to the Capitol.
People respect me.
But you, you're still nothing.
You're just an uppity dago in an expensive suit turning tricks for the unions.
Nobody respects the unions anymore, Marty.
They're dying.
And no one respects you.
The most you'll ever make of yourself is blowing men like me.
Men with real power.
Yes.
I can smell the cock on your breath from here.
You think you can get under my skin?
I know I can.
Yeah.
Kiss my ass, Frank.
You can't afford to walk out.
Watch me.
I've got a dead, underprivileged kid in my pocket.
What do you have?
I have two million honorable teachers.
Fair enough.
But I got something even better.
Go ahead.
Open it.
Okay.
I'll play your game.
You're an idiot.
Stamper threw it.
You're full of shit.
Oh no, Stamper threw the brick.
And I made sure Claire distracted my security.
Are you kidding me?
And to think you wanted me to apologize to my wife.
You would do something that low, Frank?
I arranged the brick, Marty, just like I arranged this meeting this afternoon.
Back off, Frank.
Why don't you just get down on your knees where you really belong?
Back off, Frank.
Because the only thing you're gonna get from me is cum on your...
Fuck you!
Everything okay in there, sir?
Look, I'll tell them you provoked me.
I'll tell them that you threw the brick yourself.
And who's going to believe you?
You just assaulted a United States Congressman, which is a felony.
But I'm not gonna press charges, Marty.
Because the strike ends now.
You think it'll leave a scar?
I have a thick skin.
The next time you ask me to invite someone in for coffee, will you please make sure no guns go off?
I'll do my best.
I saw Steve again today.
How is he?
In a lot of pain.
Should I go see him?
I don't think you need to.
Zoe Barnes.
When he dies, we'll pay for his funeral.
You don't need to take it?
No.
I'm done with work today.
SO, GIL, YOU NEED TO PREPARE A ZINGER FOR THE DEBATE.
- WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
YOU KNOW WHAT A ZINGER IS, RIGHT?
BRANDY AND CREME DE MENTHE.
I'M NOT A RUBE, ANDY.
NOT A...
NOT A STINGER, A ZINGER.
IT'S A COMEBACK LINE.
YOU KNOW, LIKE, "I SERVED WITH JACK KENNEDY,
"I KNEW JACK KENNEDY,
"JACK KENNEDY FUCKED A WIFE OF MINE...
BUT YOU, SENATOR..."
"ARE NO JACK KENNEDY."
YOU GAVE ME SIX CARDS.
OH, COME ON, GIL JOHN, YOU GOTTA THINK PREEMPTIVELY.
FOR INSTANCE, WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IF DIGGER WERE TO CALL YOU OUT FOR BEING, LIKE,
A HOTHEAD OR A LOOSE CANNON?
TELL HIM TO SUCK MY CANNON-SIZED...
OH, OH, OH, NO, NO,
SEE, YOU'RE PLAYING RIGHT INTO HIS POINT, RIGHT?
YOU GOTTA TAKE THE HIT, ACCEPT IT,
AND TURN IT AROUND AND USE IT AGAINST HIM,
LIKE JUJITSU.
- RIGHT?
SO FOR INSTANCE, YOU COULD SAY, "WELL, I MAY BE A LOOSE CANNON,
BUT AT LEAST I DON'T SHOOT BLANKS."
GOOD ONE, ROBERT.
THE MAN HAS SIX CHILDREN.
IT'S A POLITICAL METAPHOR, NOT SEXUAL.
AND YOU'LL BE THERE TO EXPLAIN IT TO EVERYONE?
SHOULDN'T GIL JOHN BE USING, LIKE, BASKETBALL METAPHORS?
LIKE "HOT HANDS" OR "GETTING GOOD LOOKS"
- OR "TAKING IT TO THE HOLE."
ENOUGH WITH THE KENNEDYS.
THAT'S ENOUGH OF THIS ASS-CLOWNERY.
I GOTTA GET TO BED, OR DIGGER WILL CLEAN MY CLOCK TOMORROW.
IF YOU THINK OF ANY MORE STINKERS, WRITE 'EM DOWN.
- ZONKERS.
- ZINGER.
- WHATEVER.
- HE'S GONNA BE FINE.
NO, HE'S FUCKED.
SENATOR BIGGS, DID YOU SUPPORT
ADDING ANTI-ABORTION RESTRICTIONS
TO THE NORTH CAROLINA MOTORCYCLE SAFETY BILL?
I DID.
THERE IS NO REASON YOU CAN'T SUPPORT TWO CONSTITUENCIES SIMULTANEOUSLY.
IF YOU CAN FIT BOTH THE UNBORN AND BIKERS UNDER THE SAME BILL,
THEN WHY WOULDN'T YOU?
SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE UNBORN SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO WEAR HELMETS?
- HUH?
- ROBERT!
WHAT?
I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP IT LIGHT.
HE'S TENSE.
WELL, I WANT HIM TENSE.
THIS IS A VERY BIG DEAL.
THERE'S ONLY ONE DEBATE.
- MADDIE...
- IF GIL BLOWS IT,
THIS TIME NEXT YEAR HE'LL BE SELLING REVERSE MORTGAGES.
MADDIE, CAN'T YOU SEE THE MAN'S BRAIN'S ABOUT TO EXPLODE?
HE'S NOT USED TO ALL THIS.
YOU BOTH KNOW I'M SITTING RIGHT HERE, RIGHT?
- SENATOR BIGGS...
- QUICK QUESTION, SENATOR.
MAY WE ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS?
A MOMENT, SIR?
WHAT?
TURNS OUT THERE'S BEEN SOME SORT OF MISCOMMUNICATION.
UM, UH...
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY A DEBATE.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
HOW COULD IT NOT BE A DEBATE?
IT'S A TOWN HALL.
- A TOWN HALL?
YOU MEAN WHERE A BUNCH OF YAHOOS CAN ASK
ANY RANDOM, DUMBASS QUESTIONS THEY WANT?
OH, SENATOR, WELL, IT'S NOT THAT BAD.
THE, UM, YAHOOS ARE HAND-PICKED,
AND THE DUMBASS QUESTIONS ARE SCREENED.
WELL, THERE'S YOUR QUALITY CONTROL RIGHT THERE.
YOU STILL GOT THIS, BIG GUY.
NOW, A TOWN HALL IS NOT A DEBATE, IT'S A PERFORMANCE.
IT'S ONE HALF SEDUCTION, ONE HALF MISDIRECTION,
- AND ONE HALF CONFRONTATION.
- THAT'S THREE HALVES.
YOU CAN'T HAVE THREE HALVES OF A WHOLE.
THIS FROM A MAN WHO'S ALWAYS PRIDED HIMSELF ON GIVING 110%.
IT WAS A CUSHION.
YOU PUT OUT 100% ON THE COURT,
IT LEAVES YOU 10% TO TAKE A SHOWER.
ALL RIGHT, NOW, LISTEN UP, GIL, THIS IS IMPORTANT.
THE TOWN HALL IS ALL ABOUT SITUATIONAL AWARENESS.
IT'S KNOWING WHERE YOU ARE AND WHERE YOUR OPPONENT IS
AT ALL TIMES.
SO WHEN IT'S YOUR TURN,
I WANT YOU TO GO DOWN INTO THE PAINT,
YOU MAKE CONTACT WITH THE CROWD,
THEN YOU GO BACK OUT, AND YOU SET A PICK.
THAT'S NEUTRAL SPACE.
NOW, WHEN IT'S DIGGER'S TURN,
HOLD YOUR GROUND,
FORCING HIM TO EITHER BREAK LEFT OR BREAK RIGHT.
AND WHEN HE MAKES HIS MOVE, YOU SUBTLY SHIFT,
GIVING YOURSELF A 50/50 CHANCE OF MAKING CONTACT.
AND WITH ANY LUCK, HE GOES DOWN, AND IF HE DOES, GIL,
SHOW CONCERN, THEN GENTLY HELP HIM UP.
- PLAY IT CLASSY.
- PLAY IT CLASSY.
AND REMEMBER, CAMERAS ARE ALWAYS ON, SO HOLD THAT SMILE.
NEVER LOOK AT YOUR WATCH, AND NEVER SCRATCH YOUR BALLS.
- PLAY IT CLASSY.
- PLAY IT CLASSY.
NOW, YOU CAN DO THIS, GIL.
NOW, YOU NEED A LITTLE ME TIME?
A LITTLE TIME TO GET IN THE ZONE?
I APPRECIATE THAT, ROBERT, THANK YOU.
SO ARE YOU MORMON, JAMES?
NO.
WELL, YES, BUT NOT REALLY.
MORMONS AREN'T USUALLY THAT AMBIVALENT.
I KNOW, I STRUGGLE WITH IT,
WHICH IS WHY I DON'T CALL MYSELF MORMON.
I THINK IF YOU CALL YOURSELF MORMON, YOU SHOULD BE ALL-IN.
OH, I AGREE.
I'M SORRY THAT YOU'RE NOT ALL-IN, JAMES.
AND I WISH YOU WERE.
I-I WISH I WERE ALL-IN TOO.
MAYBE I COULD BE.
OH, I'D LIKE THAT.
I'LL PRAY FOR YOU, OKAY?
I'LL PRAY FOR YOUR RETURN.
THAT'D BE...
WHOA, UH, HERE'S YOUR DAD.
SENATOR, IT'S LOLA, YOUR DAUGHTER.
SO IT IS.
HOW'D YOUR EXAMS GO, HONEY?
- GREAT.
-OH, GREAT.
I MEAN, YOU TELL.
UM, "A" IN EVERYTHING BUT ISAIAH STUDIES.
WHAT'D WE GET IN ISAIAH STUDIES?
B-PLUS.
THE PROFESSOR HATES ME.
I THINK HE'S A SOCIALIST.
THEN HE MUST BE HAVING THE TIME OF HIS LIFE
AT BRIGHAM YOUNG.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SARCASTIC, DADDY.
WHY DOES EVERYONE IN WASHINGTON USE IRONY SO MUCH?
I DON'T KNOW, HONEY.
- YOU CAN GO NOW.
- YES, SIR.
BUT LEAVE MY DAUGHTER.
OH, SORRY.
THAT WAS DUMB.
HOLD ON, SIR.
OH, NEVER MIND.
TOO MISERABLE TO TALK ANYWAY.
I'M REALLY SORRY, SIR.
WHEN I GET BACK TO THE OFFICE, I REALLY SHOULD FIND OUT
WHY WE HIRED THAT KID.
- WELL, HE'S YOUR GODSON, DEAR.
- OH.
RIGHT.
WHAT WOULD I DO WITHOUT YOU?
OH, YOU'D BE FINE, LITTLE GIANT.
GOD WOULD SHOW YOU THE WAY.
I DON'T KNOW.
HE SENT ME TO AFGHANISTAN.
AND SENATOR ANDY GUZMAN ARRIVED IN WILMINGTON TODAY
TO STUMP FOR SENATE COLLEAGUE LEMAR FARKUS.
SO I URGE ALL THE GOOD-LOOKING PEOPLE OF DELAWARE...
NO, NO, I NEED MORE THAN JUST THE GOOD-LOOKING ONES.
AS WELL AS THE...
PLEASANT-LOOKING PEOPLE OF DELAWARE?
YES, THOSE ARE MY PEOPLE.
STILL LEAVES OUT UGLY PEOPLE.
THEY'RE NOT ALL DEMOCRATS.
THERE'S A TIME TO BRING UGLY PEOPLE INTO THE TENT, KATHERINE.
AFTER DARK, SAY.
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THE EVENT BROUGHT IN 400K.
THAT'S TWICE AS MUCH AS LEMAR HAS EVER RAISED.
GREAT.
HE'LL REMEMBER.
QUICK QUESTION.
YEAH?
WHO'S THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
SOME FLACK, I GUESS.
I'LL BE IN THE HIDEAWAY.
FUCK ME.
WELL, OFF TO A GREAT START.
COULD'VE USED A HEADS-UP ON THAT.
OH, SORRY, MA'AM.
YOU JUST NEVER KNOW WHEN PEOPLE
ARE GOING TO START PRAYING AROUND HERE.
- SNACK, MA'AM?
- HELLO AND WELCOME.
I'M CHANNEL FIVE'S OWN DAN "THE TAN" CIPRIANIA-MALONEY.
NOW, SINCE I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE
OF REPORTING ON BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES
THROUGHOUT THEIR ILLUSTRATIVE SPORTS CAREERS,
STATION THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE FUN IF I MONITORED THIS TOWN HALL.
ALL RIGHT, SO LET'S GET IT GOING.
LET'S GET IT GOING.
HERE WE GO, WHO'S GOT A QUESTION?
FOR ANY OF THE CANDIDATES, EITHER ONE.
UH, HERE WE GO.
MA'AM, YES.
YES, I HAVE A QUESTION FOR COACH MANCUSI.
LOSING FOUR STARTERS LIKE YOU HAVE,
HOW DO YOU KEEP DUKE ON A WINNING TRACK?
SUCH A GOOD QUESTION, MA'AM.
AS YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T RESIGNED YET BECAUSE I'M NOT A QUITTER.
AND I WON'T LEAVE A TEAM MID-SEASON.
BUT IF I CAN KEEP MY BLUE DEVILS FOCUSED,
MAKE SURE THEY LEAVE NOTHING ON THE COURT,
THEN NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS IN THE POSTSEASON,
I CAN GO TO WASHINGTON WITH MY HEAD HELD HIGH.
UH, SENATOR BIGGS.
WHAT?
SIR, HOW WOULD YOU KEEP DUKE ON A WINNING TRACK?
WELL...
I'D CHANGE COACHES.
OKAY, A LITTLE STUMBLE.
GOOD LINE, COULD'VE WORKED.
AUDIENCE IS A LITTLE COLD.
NEXT...
NEXT QUESTION.
ANYONE?
SENATOR BIGGS,
DO YOU THINK ED...
EDUCATION RE...
RE...
REFORM?
NO, IT'S RE...
RA...
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T MAKE OUT MY WIFE'S HANDWRITING.
BEEN THERE, DUDE.
NOT ME, MY WIFE PATRICIA AND I
HAVE NO PROBLEMS AT ALL COMMUNICATING, VERY CLOSE.
- THAT'S NICE.
THAT'S SWEET.
UNFORCED ERROR.
"BEEN THERE, DUDE"?
CONGRESSMAN,
I'M SICK AND TIRED OF OUR NINNY GOVERNMENT
TELLING ME HOW TO SPEND MY OWN FOOD STAMPS.
- CAN YOU FIX THAT?
- DON'T TREAD ON ME.
GREAT QUESTION.
SENATOR.
FIX WHAT, SIR?
WHAT IS IT YOU CAN'T BUY?
FIREARMS.
I WORKED HARD FOR THOSE FOOD STAMPS.
AND I GOT A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO THE PURSUIT OF PLEASURE.
GUNS PLEASURE ME.
WHY CAN'T YOU BUY 'EM ON CREDIT LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE?
I'M SORRY, SENATOR, BUT I'LL JUMP IN HERE...
- SORRY, COACH, BUT YOU CAN'T.
- WELL, I'D LIKE TO.
'CAUSE WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME.
CHECK YOUR WATCH.
- NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO!
- OH.
STEP AWAY FOR A FEW.
PAY SOME BILLS,
GIVE THE GUYS A BATHROOM BREAK,
AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ROUND TWO.
I'M DAN "THE TAN." YOU STAY TUNED.
I THINK JAMES IS TAKEN WITH OUR LOLA.
CLEARLY.
YOU KNOW, BACK IN THE DAY, THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM.
SHE'D BE 3,000 MILES AWAY.
BUT, GOD, WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING ONLINE?
COULD BE SOMETHING PREMATURE OR INAPPROPRIATE.
- WE'D NEVER KNOW ABOUT IT.
- WELL, I TRUST OUR DAUGHTER.
TRUST, BUT VERIFY.
THAT'S WHAT REAGAN ALWAYS DID.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, HON?
TWO OF HIS KIDS BECAME DEMOCRATS.
SENATOR.
- MRS. LAFFER.
- OH, WHAT IS IT, SHELBY?
TIME FOR ME TO SAY GOOD-BYE.
I'M HEADED BACK TO RENO.
WHAT?
YOU'VE BEEN PULLED OFF THE STORY?
OH, NO, SIR.
I'M JUST PIVOTING TO YOUR BACKGROUND.
GONNA INTERVIEW SOME OF YOUR CHILDHOOD FRIENDS.
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY CHILDHOOD FRIENDS.
OH, DON'T WORRY, SIR.
I'M NOT GONNA BE ASKING ANYTHING EMBARRASSING.
SERIOUSLY, I DIDN'T HAVE ANY CHILDHOOD FRIENDS.
EXCEPT JESUS.
RIGHT, HON?
OKAY, JESUS.
BUT JESUS WAS FRIENDS WITH EVERYBODY.
IT'S NOT LIKE WE SHOT MARBLES.
I'LL DIG SOMETHING UP, SIR.
IT'S NO PROBLEM.
SHELBY, THAT'S THE VERY DEFINITION OF A PROBLEM.
TRUST ME, SIR.
YOUR STORY WRITES ITSELF.
SIR.
MA'AM.
I'LL SEE YA.
DO YOU TRUST THE STORY TO WRITE ITSELF?
WELL, DEPENDS ON WHETHER YOU'RE HIDING ANYTHING, DEAR.
ADRIANA DE PORTAGO.
SHE'S LIKE A SERIOUS PLAYER IN SOUTH FLORIDA, RIGHT?
I DID NOT KNOW THAT GOING IN,
BUT I'VE SINCE BEEN SCHOOLED ON THAT POINT.
AND SHE'S RIDICULOUSLY HOT, RIGHT?
LIKE, AT AN ELITE LEVEL?
YEAH, THAT'S HER.
- OH, SHIT.
YOU COME INTO MY HOUSE,
AND YOU SHOW ME THIS KIND OF DISRESPECT?
BEGINNER'S LUCK.
I WISH I CARED MORE.
AH, FUCK YOU.
COME ON.
- SHOULD I COME BACK?
- HELL, NO.
NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE, WE CAN GET SOMETHING DONE.
- SHIT'S TOO EASY.
- YEAH, WHEN NO ONE'S DEFENDING.
THAT'S YOUR WHOLE GAME, IS TO DISTRACT.
I'M SURE THERE'S A SIMILE FOR THIS MEETING IN THERE SOMEWHERE.
DON'T CARE FOR SIMILES.
NONE OF THIS "LIKE" BULLSHIT.
I'M A METAPHOR MAN.
IF I TELL YOU I'M GONNA RIP SOMEBODY'S FACE OFF,
I WANT YOU TO VISUALIZE IT.
YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO WATCH THE BIGGS DEBATE?
IT'S ALREADY STARTED.
CHANNEL 61.
HEY, THANKS.
HOPE YOU'LL JOIN US.
WE SHOULD TALK.
SORRY.
I REALLY DO HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO.
HMM, LIKE WHAT?
LIKE MAYBE GIVING A GUY A RECORD,
OF WHICH HE HAS NONE?
SERIOUSLY, KATHERINE, NOT A SINGLE BILL WITH HIS NAME ON IT.
ISN'T THAT WHAT A CHIEF OF STAFF DOES?
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE CREATING A NARRATIVE?
I'M GOING NOW.
SO I'M RIGHT.
YOU STILL GOT NOTHING.
ALL THE BETTER THAT I'M HERE TO HELP.
YOU BROUGHT A BILL?
YOU ARROGANT SON OF A BITCH.
GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY LANE.
WHOOPS, TOO LATE.
HEY, IT'S DAN "THE TAN."
WELCOME BACK TO THE SECOND HALF OF OUR TOWN HALL DEBATE.
AND KICKING IT OFF IS A STUDENT RIGHT HERE FROM ST.
JAMES HIGH.
HI, COACH MANCUSI.
MY NAME IS MICHAEL HICKENLOOPER.
LAST YEAR, THE STATE LEGISLATURE PASSED A BILL THAT SAYS
WE 17-YEAR-OLDS CAN NO LONGER PREREGISTER TO VOTE.
DO YOU THINK THAT'S RIGHT?
SON, I LIKE YOUNG PEOPLE.
I SPENT YEARS RECRUITING THEM.
I RESPECT THEIR SKILLS.
MA'AM?
I-I...
I THINK WE HAVE A BARN DOOR ISSUE.
- AND HE'S ON THE MOVE.
- MY GOD, WHERE IS HE GOING?
BUT AS A PARENT, I WANT MY KIDS TO VOTE RESPONSIBLY.
JUST AS I WOULD WANT THEM TO BINGE RESPONSIBLY
OR HOOK UP RESPONSIBLY.
YOU SEE, SON, HISTORY SHOWS US
THAT YOUNGER VOTERS JUST AREN'T READY.
IS IT OVER?
THEY'RE TOO LIKELY TO VOTE IMPULSIVELY.
TO MAKE BAD CHOICES.
THAT'S WHY THE NORTH CAROLINA LEGISLATURE
WISELY CREATED A COOLING-OFF PERIOD.
TO GIVE YOUNG PEOPLE EXTRA TIME TO MATURE.
THAT'S JUST COMMON SENSE.
YOU TRACKING ME, SON?
YES, SIR.
THANK YOU, COACH.
GREAT ANSWER, COACH.
ALL RIGHT, WHO'S GOT MY NEXT QUESTION?
YES, MA'AM.
LOVELY LADY.
HI, MY NAME IS CINDY TULL...
WHOA, WHOA, WHAT THE HEY, BUDDY?
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY TURN?
I'M SORRY, SENATOR.
DID YOU WANT TO WEIGH IN ON THAT QUESTION?
BECAUSE, WELL, I'M THINKING COACH MANCUSI
PRETTY MUCH NAILED THAT ONE.
WELL, THAT'S NOT HOW DEBATES WORK, YOU PINHEAD.
'SCUSE ME?
HELLO?
- I BELIEVE I HAVE THE FLOOR.
- NO, YOU DON'T.
I STILL HAVE TWO MINUTES LEFT TO REBUT.
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN A SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN
WOULD NEVER INTERRUPT A LADY.
I REMEMBER IT WELL, MS. TULL.
THAT'S HOW I WAS RAISED.
YES, SIR.
ALL RIGHT, COME ON, WHO'S GOT A TOUGH ONE FOR THE CANDIDATES?
HERE WE GO.
YOU, SIR.
COACH DIGGER, HOW IMPORTANT WOULD YOU SAY
DISCIPLINE AND SELF-CONTROL ARE IN THE GAME OF POLITICS?
I THINK THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT, SIR.
NOW, I KNOW MY OPPONENT AND I
DON'T SEE EYE-TO-EYE ON THIS ISSUE.
AND I RESPECT THAT.
AND FRANKLY,
I DON'T CARE HOW MANY ANGER MANAGEMENT CLASSES
SENATOR BIGGS MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE SKIPPED THROUGH THE YEARS,
BUT THE FACT IS HE IS STILL VERY MUCH A LOOSE CANNON.
I THINK NORTH CAROLINIANS DESERVE BETTER.
WELL, COACH, I MAY BE A LOOSE CANNON,
BUT AT LEAST I DON'T FIRE BLANKS.
MY...
SENATOR, AS EVERYONE KNOWS,
MY WIFE AND I, LIKE MANY OTHER COUPLES,
HAVE STRUGGLED WITH INFERTILITY.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M ANY LESS OF A FATHER
TO OUR SIX ADOPTED CHILDREN.
AND WE ARE OUTTA TIME!
OKAY, I WANT TO THANK COACH YOU'RE-THE-MAN-CUSI.
WHO THE FUCK GAVE HIM THAT LINE?
- ALWAYS AN HONOR, SIR.
- OH!
FOR ALL OF US HERE ON CHANNEL FIVE,
I'M DAN "THE TAN" CIPRIANIA-MALONEY,
SAYING, SEE YA, NORTH CAROLINA!
YOU READ ABOUT PEOPLE SETTING THEMSELVES ON FIRE,
BUT YOU NEVER REALLY EXPECT TO SEE IT IN YOUR OWN LIFETIME.
COME ON!
COME ON, GIVE ME SOME.
GOTTA GET SOME AT THE TOP.
- THERE'S YOUR MONEY SHOT.
- GO, DIGGER.
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.
WAY TO GO, COACH.
- ALL RIGHT, COACH.
- ALL RIGHT.
DILLY.
GRAY.
YOU WATCH THE MANCUSI-BIGGS TOWN HALL?
I KNOW, I KNOW, HEY,
I TEACH A COURSE AT THE NEW SCHOOL IN CAMPAIGN TRAIN WRECKS,
AND THIS IS THE WORST I'VE EVER SEEN.
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK THE DAMAGE IS?
REALLY?
ALL RIGHT, THANKS.
TALK SOON.
DILLY DESANTIS.
ANALYTICS GUY I WORK WITH.
HE PREDICTS BIGGS WILL BE DOWN 9.75%
IN TOMORROW'S TRACKING POLL.
AND YOU HEARD THAT NUMBER IN REAL TIME.
OH, MEETING MUST BE OVER.
MIND IF I STAY AND PICK KATHERINE'S BIG BRAIN?
WHY ARE YOU ASKING HIM?
BECAUSE, KATHERINE, I'VE NOTICED
THAT EVEN THOUGH ANDY'S HAPPY TO WASTE HIS OWN TIME,
HE NEVER WASTES YOURS.
HAVE AT EACH OTHER.
THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL, LOUISE.
YOU'VE REALLY TAKEN YOUR CRAFT UP A LEVEL.
YOU THINK?
I WAS SO DISTRACTED BY YOUR PROCEDURES.
NO, NO, THEY'RE GREAT.
YOU COULD SELL THESE.
OH !
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE?
WOW.
HARD TO SAY.
BUT YOU KNOW, I'M PARTIAL TO AN AUTUMNAL PALETTE.
HEY, HURT LOCKER !
HOW'S IT GOING?
YOU MAKE ALL THOSE?
AMAZING.
ISN'T THE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY HERE THE BEST?
- I MADE 'EM, ROSE.
- WELL, SUCH A CREATIVE FAMILY.
LISTEN, I'VE GOT GREAT NEWS.
MY OFFICE FINALLY LINKED UP WITH THE STAIR LIFT PEOPLE,
AND THEY GOT IT ALL INSTALLED TODAY.
YOU, MY FRIEND, ARE GOOD TO GO.
REALLY?
THEY SAID THREE WEEKS!
- ROSE HAS JUICE.
- TELL THAT TO MY CABLE GUY.
DON'T GET LOUIS STARTED ON THAT SUBJECT.
YEAH, ONE OF MY HOT BUTTONS, FOR SURE.
ANYWAY, NOW THAT YOU'RE GOING HOME,
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A SMALL FAITH GATHERING IN THE HOUSE
TO THANK THE ALMIGHTY FOR THE BLESSING OF YOUR RETURN?
I THINK THAT'S A TERRIFIC IDEA.
DON'T YOU, LOUIS?
I DON'T KNOW, ROSE.
I'M NO HERO.
NOT SAYING YOU ARE, HONEY.
I JUST THINK A LITTLE PRAYER CIRCLE MIGHT BE IN ORDER.
ECUMENICAL, OF COURSE.
CAN'T JUST BE MORMONS.
WELL, THERE WON'T BE SHOUTING, WILL THERE, ROSE?
I HEAR YOU SHOUT IN CHICAGO.
NO, LOUISE.
NO CALL AND RESPONSE.
JUST A FEW PRAYERS.
WE DO THIS SORT OF THING ALL THE TIME NOW.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
I'LL BE HAPPY TO ORGANIZE IT.
YOU TWO HAVE YOUR HANDS FULL
WITH PHYSICAL THERAPY AND WHATNOT.
I'LL HAVE MY STAFF PUT THIS TOGETHER FOR NEXT SATURDAY.
NO, SUNDAY.
WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO FOLD IN THE JEWS.
JUST DON'T INVITE ANYONE
WITHOUT COORDINATING IT WITH MY OFFICE, THOUGH, OKAY?
THIS IS GOING TO BE STRESSFUL ENOUGH
PULLING TOGETHER A LIST OF NAMES
WHO ARE NOT GONNA BE AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS.
I'VE DONE A MILLION OF THESE, SO I KNOW ALL THE PITFALLS.
LATER!
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
I KNOW.
YIKES.
YEAH.
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT FOLDING IN JEWS?
OH, YEAH.
HEY.
HI, BEAUTIFUL LADY IN MY BEDROOM.
HEY, HANDSOME LAWMAKER IN A SILLY, LITTLE CHAIR.
YEAH, HERO GUY'S COMING HOME.
WE'RE GONNA TRICK OUT THE HOUSE.
WHAT YOU DOING?
THE SUITE AT THE RITZ IS READY,
SO BENNY IS HELPING ME MOVE IN THIS AFTERNOON.
- OH, BENNY?
- ANDY.
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A BUSINESS AND A LIFE,
AND IF I WASN'T SO CRAZY ABOUT MY HANDSOME LAWMAKER,
I WOULD BE CONDUCTING BOTH IN MIAMI INSTEAD OF COMMUTING.
SO GIVE ME A BREAK.
AND YOU KNOW, IT WOULDN'T HURT IF YOU WENT BACK
TO FLORIDA SOMETIME, YOU KNOW, INSTEAD OF, SAY, DELAWARE?
HEY, I THOUGHT YOU'D BE PLEASED.
WE'RE LAYING GROUNDWORK FOR THE BIG PUSH AHEAD.
SPEAKING OF BIG PUSH...
OH, YEAH, 'CAUSE THERE'S NOTHING
THAT TURNS ME ON MORE THAN A DOUBLE ENTENDRE.
OH, YOU WANT A SINGLE ENTENDRE?
HUH?
YOU WANT TO BE SINGLE ENTENDRE'D?
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
YES, PLEASE.
- I'M SORRY, MAN.
- NOT YOUR FAULT.
- KINDA IS.
I WAS ON THE ROPES BEFORE THE COUP DE GRAS.
GOT NO ONE BUT MYSELF TO BLAME.
I LET DIGGER GET INTO MY HEAD.
BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING, ROBERT?
IF YOU ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THAT DILL WEED,
WHICH I DID, SINCE I HAD A LOT OF FREE TIME OUT THERE,
THE GUY'S GOT NOTHING.
SERIOUSLY, HE'S A FUCKING FEATHER, AN AMATEUR.
- I CAN TAKE HIM.
- I BELIEVE YOU, GIL JOHN.
BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP,
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'VE GOT A LOT ON YOUR MIND.
WHAT WITH THIS ETHICS THING DOGGING YOU
AND POSSIBLE EXPULSION.
I APPRECIATE YOU TRYING TO HAVE MY BACK.
DON'T MENTION IT.
YES, SIR.
IF I APPLY MYSELF, I CAN WIN THIS PUPPY.
HEY, ANDY.
- LIKE THAT?
- MM-HMM.
- REALLY?
LIKE THAT?
- MM-HMM.
HEY, ROBERT.
I FORGOT MY YOGA MAT UPSTAIRS.
(c)CREATED AND SYNCH BY KIBERLINE
PUNDIT 1:
We're almost a month into the strike, and we've got millions of kids stuck home from school.
PUNDIT 2:
Do you blame the White House or Congress?
CALLER 1:
I personally have very little sympathy for the teachers-
PUNDIT 3:
We're over three weeks into this strike.
It's costing the country billions of dollars, and instead of offering solutions...
PUNDIT 4:
There's a big difference between taking a stand and sitting on your hands.
CALLER 2:
I don't know whether to call it cowardice...
PUNDIT 5:
It's his agenda.
And the problem is that he stole sound, conservative ideas.
The only smart thing he's done is lift his platform from the Republican platform.
I admit it, Linda.
This got away from me.
But we can't turn back time.
We have to hold our ground.
While our approval ratings continue to nosedive?
Spinella and I worked together for years on dozens of labor-related bills.
I thought he'd be reasonable.
Well, you were wrong about that.
Well, I didn't think he'd be insane enough to go on strike, and I didn't think the strike would last this long.
So you've been wrong twice about this.
Why should I believe you're right about holding out?
We threatened collective bargaining in order to get performance standards and charter funding.
That's the deal that we made.
We took that stand.
We lay down now, we lose it all.
There'll be no reform, just an empty bill.
I understand the logic Frank, but we're in damage control now.
But we can't close one wound by opening another.
But we're the Democrats.
We're the ones who are supposed to be defending the teachers.
But you can't have it both ways, Linda.
You can't have the reform you want and keep the teachers happy at the same time.
You knew that when we started.
Okay, then if we have to choose, we choose to keep the teachers happy.
That is a mistake, Linda.
We've already crossed the Rubicon.
I'm telling you this.
The President wants to change the bill.
We should've done it three weeks ago.
We didn't.
So you have to do it now.
Give me more time, Linda, please.
If I can break this strike and get everything we want in this bill, can we agree that's preferable to folding?
Of course.
If we can count on that...
Then count on me for just one more week.
If the strike isn't over by then, I'll change the bill.
Frank...
No.
One more week.
That's all.
This is the worst possible position to be in.
If I water down the bill, the President will still see me as a failure.
If the strike doesn't end in a week,
I've forced myself into a corner.
Only total victory will put me back in his good graces.
The alternative is exile, which would mean the last five months were for nothing.
I cannot abide falling back to square one.
Does the Congressman need me, ma'am?
No.
I just was wondering if you wanted a cup of coffee.
I just brewed a fresh pot.
I'm good, ma'am.
But thanks.
Are you sure?
My shift's done in a couple hours.
I'll be fine.
You know, come on.
Stretch your legs.
I won't take no for an answer.
What did you do before you joined the leadership detail?
I was a cop here in D.C.
Before that, I was in the Marines, ma'am.
Thank you.
Did you serve overseas?
I did, ma'am.
Bahrain, then Afghanistan.
Served most of my second tour in the Korengal Valley.
You wanna know if I killed anyone?
I think I know the answer.
I got a dinner meeting with Birch.
I'll be...
I invited him in for coffee.
Well, drink it fast.
We leave in five... (WINDOW SMASHING)
Get down!
Stay away from the windows!
Stop!
(PHONE RINGING)
You'll have six of my best men covering you around the clock.
I guess I'm wondering why we didn't at least have one of your best men covering us now.
He'll be disciplined, sir.
FRANCIS:
He shot a gun in a residential neighborhood.
I want him fired.
CARDIFF:
There will be a full investigation, and we'll take the necessary action.
Steve never would've let this happen.
Is he better yet?
Because I would feel a lot safer if he was with us.
Unfortunately, he won't be coming back, sir.
I thought he just had a gallbladder infection.
He did, they found more.
His pancreas, stage four.
- Jesus.
- Oh, my God.
That's awful.
FRANCIS:
How much longer does he have?
Not long.
A few weeks.
At least that's what his wife told me.
We have to go see him.
Can you get the information where he is?
Of course.
I'll make sure you get it right away.
- Thank you, Captain.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Good night.
- Front door.
- Yes, sir.
Your weapon.
Your badge, too.
Am I suspended, sir?
You had a suspect on foot, and you fire your gun?
Sir, I realize that...
Do you know how this reflects on me?
That one of our men could be so careless?
Not only do you abandon your post for coffee.
You could've killed a bystander.
That slug was found on somebody's front stoop.
What if it went in their house?
Your badge, Meechum.
Two reasons, which are really the same reason.
I was sick of working for other people, and I knew I could do a better job than my bosses.
They kept trying to suppress me, shutting me out.
So I said, "Fuck it.
I'll do it my way."
And then you just quit?
Not like you did.
(CHUCKLING)
I slaved away until I lined up the money to start Slugline.
Once Slugline gets big enough, what's the plan?
Are you gonna sell it like Arianna?
Probably.
And then who knows?
Whatever the next adventure is.
Maybe Shanghai.
So I shouldn't expect to have a job in two years?
Do you ever wanna have any job for more than two years?
What about you?
What's your big plan?
Uh, I don't know yet.
Come on.
Slugline is just a stepping stone for you.
(PHONE BUZZING)
You know what?
I should take this.
Go.
Do your thing.
Hey.
Do you have proof Spinella was behind it?
Put it in context.
Three weeks into a national teachers' strike...
At the home of Francis Underwood, who has led the charge on...
There you go.
Now post that before one of my neighbors calls a local 11:00 hack.
- When do I see you next?
- I'm background on this.
I'm not your source.
You can't talk now?
- No.
- When?
Soon, with bells on.
What about "more school books, less bricks"?
No, it's too broad.
We need a better sound bite.
Something specific, something that points the finger directly at Spinella.
- He'll deny any involvement.
- Well, of course he will.
So how do we get around that?
We say he can't control his troops.
There's no evidence it was a teacher.
Who else could it be?
Look, he's gonna shift blame for the strike back on Congress.
No.
We need something clear, something clean, something that sticks in your head.
"Teachers need a lesson in self-restraint."
No.
You're not hearing me.
People like teachers.
No.
We need something that makes Spinella the villain.
His lack of control, his inability...
Disorganized labor.
It's disorganized labor, plain and simple.
When you've got angry teachers throwing bricks through congressmen's windows, you've gotta blame the union leadership.
We'll be beefing up the security for the entire leadership.
And I strongly encourage Marty Spinella to keep his people in line.
This is starting to look like disorganized labor.
MALE REPORTER:
Do you really think Marty Spinella is to blame?
Whether Mr. Spinella is behind this or not, he might wanna tone down the rhetoric, before disorganized labor turns into organized crime.
No one can prove anything.
So that's the most cogent response.
Well, go on TV and say that.
You deplore violence in any form.
It's Congress that should take responsibility.
I don't want to degenerate to Frank's level.
We need to kill this brick thing.
It's distracting people from the issues.
MEDIA CONSULTANT:
She's right.
It'll eat up one cycle, and it'll disappear.
No.
This story is getting traction.
Support for the strike is dipping.
So is the President's approval ratings.
But he gets to stay in the Oval Office another three years, no matter what.
We can't afford another three weeks.
When I told the unions to strike,
I told them to prepare for the long haul.
All right?
Their accounts dry up, we keep going.
We figure it out.
I am not going to blink over something like this.
Fine.
But if we lose the public relations battle, none of that does us any good.
Frank wants us on the defensive.
I think this story is going to blow over.
If I'm wrong, we'll reevaluate.
But I wanna give it another day or two first.
Okay?
(PHONE BUZZING)
Hi, Adam.
You all right?
I saw the news.
Yes, I'm fine.
That's gotta rattle the nerves.
Brick coming through the window.
It did, some.
So are you staying in the house?
We've got extra security now, so...
Well, it made me think of you, so I figured I'd just check in.
I appreciate that.
We still haven't talked, have we?
- (SIGHING) There's no need to.
- I think we should.
Here's how I see it.
You asked me to come down.
I did.
We both had ideas about what that could mean.
Probably very similar ideas.
But then you changed your mind.
So be it.
There's no reason we can't be in touch or remain friends.
(SIGHING)
Let's not fool ourselves, Adam.
So I won't call again.
- Done.
- I'm not saying that.
What are you saying?
I just called because I care about you.
No agenda.
If you wanna talk again, call me.
If not, I understand It's up to you-
You think I'm being unreasonable?
I think you're doing whatever it is you need to do, and I'm not gonna question it.
It was sweet of you to call.
Listen, you probably need to get back to work.
I know I do.
I should go.
Yeah.
Okay.
- Take care.
- Okay.
Frank, you got a minute?
I'll see you inside.
I wanna be governor, and I want your help.
Am I still on the short list?
You are.
I haven't had a drink in over a month.
I'm clean.
Is that because I asked, or because it's what you want?
It was about time I took responsibility for myself.
Taking responsibility is one thing, and it's admirable.
But running for governor of a major state is a whole nother ball game.
Let me tell you something, Frank.
I got elected to Congress 'cause I seized the moment that opportunity struck.
You kept me on that list.
I wanna seize that opportunity.
If you help me out, I'll give you everything I got.
Well, that's all I've been waiting to hear.
All right.
I'll tell you what.
I need to make some calls, check in with some people.
Give me a few days.
I'll get back to you.
- Of course.
- And, Peter...
I feel like I've met the real you for the first time just now.
Janet
- Is this a bad time?
- No.
No, not at all.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were coming.
Here.
Take my chair.
Oh, no.
I'm fine.
I'll take these.
Thank you.
Hello, Steve.
Hey.
These could use some water.
I'll be right back.
Francis and I were so upset when we heard.
I'm sorry I haven't come sooner.
I didn't want too many people knowing.
Yes.
Francis wishes he could be here.
He wants you to know he's praying for you.
Couldn't make it, huh?
No, there's a big teachers' strike going on right now, and he's been stuck in his office for weeks.
I get it.
I saw the news.
The brick.
Right.
I told Francis that probably wouldn't have happened if you were there.
(LAUGHING) No.
Probably not.
I never seen him pray.
Not in eight years.
You said he was praying for me.
You've seen us in church.
Yeah, but I never went inside.
They're just gorgeous.
Mrs. Underwood, thank you so much.
Please, call me Claire.
I know you got things to do.
Of course.
If you need anything at all, call me.
You have my cell.
Anything at all.
And I'm sorry to have surprised you.
No.
It was so nice of you to come.
Thank you.
I know Steve appreciated it.
Check this out.
It's foam.
How many of these we have?
200.
But I can get more.
Get more.
(CROWD SHOUTING INDISTINGUISHABLY)
Bring it on!
You need to give the teachers the respect they deserve.
(CROWD BOOING)
(INAUDIBLE)
PRESS SECRETARY:
We can't back away from this, Marty.
We've gotta face it head-on.
They provoked us.
They were throwing foam.
Our guys were throwing punches.
We're gonna come off the bad guys here.
Okay.
Okay.
I get it.
I get it.
But I wanna be smart about this.
I wanna do something definitive that'll put this to bed and get us back on message.
CNN.
One-on-one, you and Underwood.
MEDIA CONSULTANT:
8:00 tonight.
Frank is excellent in debates.
Go strong against him.
Address the brick right to his face.
End of story.
Underwood says he's in if you are.
Okay.
But I want as much prep as possible, okay?
I want to run questions.
You moderate, you play Underwood.
Wear this one.
Then come in here.
I wanna put powder on you.
Well, there's somebody at the studio can do that.
Yes, and they always cake on too much.
I'm doing it.
(SIGHING)
War paint.
How bloody do you think it'll be?
I think I oughta be able to dispatch with him easily enough.
You remember Peter Russo?
He's doing well.
He hasn't had a drink in a month.
Good for him.
I like him.
Good, because he could use your help.
H ow?
We're running him for governor.
Ambitious.
Mm.
We wanna create jobs in his district.
It's on the Delaware River.
I thought we might be able to put a bill together.
Something with an economic upside.
This has to do with the shipyard closing?
We need the shipbuilders' support for his campaign.
You think you might be able to draft a bill that he can sponsor?
I'm really trying to focus on international projects, Francis.
Not domestic legislation.
I understand, but I could really use your help, Claire.
Does Catherine Durant still owe us?
When you make someone Secretary of State, they owe you for life.
We're having trouble getting our water filters through Sudanese customs.
I'll call from the car.
Tomorrow's fine.
I would have done that anyway.
I know.
I'm ready for battle.
You wanna come watch?
No.
You go on ahead.
Come on.
Watch me put the final nail in Spinella's coffin.
It'll be fun.
Marty.
Frank.
MAN:
Come on, people.
Take your marks.
REPORTER:
Congressman, would you like to respond to that?
Yes, I would.
$2 billion of taxpayers' money being wasted.
And Congress should be ashamed of itself for that, Frank.
What?
Did Congress force the teachers to go on strike, Marty?
- No, we didn't.
- Really, Frank?
When you threaten teachers' ability to negotiate as a union, when you threaten their job security, you threaten their livelihood, of course you force them to strike.
And did we also force them to start throwing bricks at people's houses?
You know what, I'm really glad you brought that up, because you know there's absolutely no proof that that incident had anything to do with this strike.
And I wanna take the opportunity to say publicly that we categorically condemn any use of violence whatsoever, or intimidation.
What you're saying, essentially, is that you can't control your own people.
- That's not what I'm saying.
- That is what you're saying.
You're disorganized.
Disorganized labor.
You know what, you could keep trotting out that phrase all you like, but you know what I'd like to do, Frank?
I would like to get back to the issue here of educating our children and the fact that Congress is not living up to their commitment.
Well, you know what I would like?
What?
An apology.
If not to me, then to my wife.
When that brick came through our window, it was terrifying.
She's standing right over there.
- Claire?
MAN 2:
We need camera two on the wife.
Now, why don't you look her in the eye and tell her that your people had nothing to do with that brick.
- Are you serious?
- Yes.
Okay.
Mrs. Underwood, Claire,
I am sincerely sorry that you had to go through that ordeal, truly.
And it actually sickens me that someone made you feel unsafe in your own home.
And I give you my word that to the best of my knowledge, none of our people had anything to do with it.
But you know what sickens me more?
That right now, your husband is using you as a prop on national television to try and win a debate.
So I think you're the one that owes your wife an apology, Frank.
And when you're done apologizing, can we please get back to the issue here of educating our children?
No.
You've got this wrong, Marty.
There is no "you" and "I" in education.
Well, I mean, yes, there's the letters,
"U" and "I" are in the word education.
But education with a capital "E
You know what I'm talking about.
I don't think I do.
Yes, you do, Marty.
"U" and "I", education.
So, we're gonna waste the rest of this debate naming all the vowels in...
I'm happy to play the vowel game.
You wanna play the vowel game with me?
All right. "U" think "I"
"O" "U"
"A" apology?
But no, no, no.
"U" "O" "I."
Interesting.
You left out "E" for "Education."
- So let...
- Defecation.
Edification.
I'm sorry.
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)
FRANCIS:
LOL.
Uh... (LAUGHING)
(STAMMERING)
SPINELLA:
You like Sesame Street so much?
Why don't you give the kids the money they deserve?
What I'm trying to say about education...
(LAUGHING) Well, I guess school's still in session.
I guess you schooled me there, Marty.
- Let's move on.
- Please.
Humor aside, there are more important issues out there.
I had no intention of bringing you into this.
It wasn't part of a plan.
I would've told you if it was.
I know.
The idea just struck me and I went with it.
I don't mind that you improvised.
I just wish you'd done it better.
Congressman Frank Underwood says he got, quote, schooled by AFT spokesman and chief strategist, Martin Spinella, during a debate last night on this network.
In the past 24 hours, reruns of the gaffe have played nonstop on TV news programs and the Internet.
A YouTube clip set to techno music has logged more than 300,000 hits and spawned dozens of other spoofs.
♪ No, no, no
♪ "E" "O" "I"
♪ With a capital "E"
♪ Education LOL ♪
That was as clumsy as the Lee Harvey Oswald prison transfer.
What was he thinking?
Just give me one second.
There's a deli down the street.
Patti, thanks for coming.
Sit down.
You want some coffee?
No, thanks.
I'm good.
Hey, did you see Bill Maher last night?
No, I didn't.
It was about the CNN thing.
I have to admit, Frank, it was kind of funny.
Well, I'll have to catch a rerun.
How you doing?
You holding up all right with the strike?
Let's talk about Pennsylvania.
I have your candidate.
Peter Russo.
1st Congressional District.
We crossed him off.
I know.
It's a mistake.
He's young, he's handsome.
He's bright.
Nobody knows who he is outside of Philadelphia.
There's no donor base, no infrastructure.
You start me off with funding from the DNC and I'll raise an army around this guy.
I will personally oversee his campaign.
Is that the best we can do?
What's better than a blank slate in the right hands?
Ed, you need to go.
Congressman, do you have a moment?
Thank you, Patti.
Have him call me.
I will
Ed?
Please.
- What is going on?
- I'm taking care of it.
One second, sir.
Please.
All right.
Make it fast, Meechum.
It's not easy for me to ask this, but I was wondering if you could put in a good word with my boss.
A good word?
They're going to discharge me, sir.
I messed up.
I'm fully aware.
But my job, it means everything to me, and I know a good word from you would...
Look, I have nothing against you personally, Meechum, but I can't get involved in these sort of affairs.
There's protocols and rules.
Sir, please, if you spoke to Cardiff...
There is nothing that I can do.
If anyone could convince the Captain, it would be you, Congressman.
I'm sorry.
I wish you all the best, Meechum.
Doug.
What did Barney Hull say?
That we'd be the first to know.
I can't believe there hasn't been a single 911 call.
There's been plenty.
It's just not the sort we're after.
We got that kid in Atlanta.
No, it's got to be here.
I can't be getting on a plane.
It looks too opportunistic.
Maybe if we open it up a little bit?
No, we cannot lower our standards.
We just have to be patient.
New rule.
Now that the debate's over,
Frank Underwood has to tell us what the hell that was.
Seriously, Congressman, was that a joke?
I haven't seen something just lay there like that since...
I gotta go all the way back to my prom night.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
Can we just settle this strike please?
Teachers have been out of the classroom for so long, middle-schoolers are starting to have sex with each other.
Enough.
I don't know why you had it on in the first place.
I love you, Francis.
I know.
We should say that more often to each other.
I need to clear my head.
...north and east of the airport.
I'm gonna need that in time for that meeting.
Peter, let's talk.
So.
I've spoken to Patricia Whittaker.
She's on board.
You'll be getting $4 million in start-up funding from the DNC.
I'll pick the team.
You announce in August.
But the campaign starts today.
Are you ready?
I've already put together a platform.
It's mostly broad strokes, but we can hone it.
Good.
The first thing we need to address is your sobriety.
You don't need to worry about that.
Have you been going to meetings?
You mean AA?
Yes.
That's not really my thing.
If you want my help, then going to meetings is my one requirement.
I know I had a problem, Frank.
I accept that.
And I've taken responsibility for that, but I don't think going to meetings is necessary.
You cannot white-knuckle your recovery, Peter.
This campaign will be the hardest thing you've ever done in your life.
I realize that.
I'm prepared for that.
You think you are.
But we can't take any chances.
The party's investing in you.
I need to make sure you're investing in yourself.
All right.
I'll do whatever I have to do.
Good.
You'll start tomorrow morning.
Doug will take you.
Stamper?
He's been sober 14 years.
Doug has a drinking problem?
Had.
Not anymore.
He'll be your sponsor.
In the meantime, I want you to meet with my wife, Claire.
She runs the Clean Water Initiative.
She's expecting you, so clear your schedule and head over there now.
Frank.
Thank you.
For believing in me.
You're gonna make a great candidate, Peter.
CLAIRE:
The shipyard closing frees up 1,100 acres of federal land.
Our goal is to pass a Watershed Act for the Delaware River.
We develop the land in an environmentally responsible way, creating jobs in the process.
- How many jobs?
- Thousands.
We're aiming for the $200 million mark.
We got a lot of work to do.
We do, but you can start with the congressmen whose districts fall within the watershed.
Do you have a draft of the bill you can show me?
We haven't sponsored any environmental legislation.
We'll draft it in consultation with your staff.
Gillian will be the point person on our end.
I don't have any legislation experience.
- I'll help you.
- When do we start?
We just did.
Will you introduce him to the research team?
I'll be there in one second.
Sure.
FRANCIS:
Mr. President?
I want it over.
As soon as possible.
Gut the bill, Frank.
Do whatever's necessary to end this.
Mr. President, if we give in now, the public won't credit you with a victory.
Not even a hollow one.
They'll chalk it up as a colossal defeat.
Well, that's on you, Frank.
You let this situation devolve to where it is.
I've already been blamed for the largest teachers' strike in U.S. history.
I won't be held accountable for it dragging on months and months.
Mr. President, we have to end this strike on your terms.
- Not anyone else's.
- How?
By debating Marty Spinella on CNN?
Sir, you have placed your faith in me thus far.
I would ask that you continue to do so.
Well, whatever you're doing, Frank, isn't working, so I'm stepping in.
Gut the bill.
Like Linda said.
No.
I'm sorry, Mr. President, but I will not do that.
Are you letting pride cloud your judgment, Frank?
Respectfully, sir, you're allowing fear to cloud yours.
Not an easy thing, to say no to the most powerful man in the free world.
But sometimes the only way to gain your superior's respect is to defy him.
What do we have on the schedule, Linda?
Your meeting with the Fed Oversight Committee.
Thank you, Mr. President.
- Do you have my briefing?
- Right here.
Good.
Let's look it over.
Hi.
How'd it go with Peter?
CLAIRE:
ll' went Well.
Is he game?
Completely.
(SIGHING) Thank you.
That's a big weight off my shoulders.
You sound tired.
Tired.
Impatient.
What can I do?
Nothing.
This one's up to fate.
I don't like when we leave things to fate.
Neither do I.
Does that mean I'm gonna have the bed to myself tonight?
Probably.
Can't Doug man the fort?
Well, he could, but I'd just toss and turn.
If I'm not gonna sleep, I might as well not sleep here.
Well, I'll leave the ringer on.
Call me if you want company.
I will.
Good night.
Good night.
You should go home.
I could take it from here.
Vigilance.
It's good for the soul.
DISPATCHER: 10-59.
Corner of 16th and Q. 10-59.
What's that?
Disorderly conduct.
Do you believe in karma?
Absolutely not.
Well, I do.
At least tonight.
Get Captain Cardiff on the phone.
Let's do something about Meechum.
- What?
- Get him his job back.
He fired his weapon.
He overreacted.
Cardiff.
On the phone.
Now.
Nancy, give me Captain Cardiff, please.
We might as well do one productive thing while we wait.
It requires very little of me and will mean the world to him.
It's a very inexpensive investment.
Hello, sir.
This is Doug Stamper.
I have Francis Underwood for you.
I got him on.
Captain, I know it's late, but I'd like to talk to you about Edward Meechum.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Are you hungry?
- Mm-hmm.
- (WHISTLES) - (FREDDY LAUGHING)
You have any trouble getting in?
No, they made me put it through the X-ray machine twice, so I hope it didn't overcook it.
Frank, you always pay too much.
This is way too much.
It's for the inconvenience.
You know, 20 years you been coming to my joint.
This is the first time I've been to yours.
What do you think?
I could get used to it.
Well, you're welcome any time.
Thank you, Freddy.
Always, Frank.
DISPATCHER:
We got a 27 Delta two. 4463rd Street...
That's a drive-by shooting.
Get details.
Sir, I want to thank you for talking to the Captain.
He told me you called, and I can't tell you how grateful I am.
I want you to listen very closely to what I'm about to say.
From this moment on, you are a rock.
You absorb nothing, you say nothing, and nothing breaks you.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
Welcome back.
Steve?
I'll leave you be.
Where...
Where's Janet?
She's been here every day for the last few weeks.
I told her, go home, get some rest.
Well, is everything okay?
Your text said it was important.
I don't know how to put this.
The thing is, I...
I've been thinking.
A lot.
About my life.
About the things I haven't done.
Things I haven't said.
I hate your husband.
A lot of people do.
The past eight years, I watched over him.
But it wasn't him I was watching.
And every time I saw you, every time I heard your voice, all I could think to myself was,
"Jesus, what I wouldn't give."
I can't tell you how many times I thought about that.
You know what Francis said to me when he proposed?
I remember his exact words.
He said, "Claire, if all you want is happiness,
"say no.
"I'm not gonna give you a couple of kids
"and count the days until retirement.
"I promise you freedom from that.
"I promise you'll never be bored."
You know, he was the only man, and there were a lot of others who proposed.
But he was the only one who understood me.
He didn't put me on some pedestal.
He knew that I didn't want to be adored or coddled.
So he took my hand and he put a ring on it.
Because he knew I'd say yes.
He's a man who knows how to take what he wants.
Is this what you wanted?
Is that the way you wanted it?
Stop.
Stop.
Please.
Please.
Stop.
Don't.
You told me your truth.
Now you know mine.
(PHONE RINGING)
(PHONE STOPS RINGING)
Hey, it's Peter.
I don't expect you to call me back, but I wanted to let you know I stopped drinking last night, and I went to my first AA meeting this morning.
I'm supposed to reach out and make amends to those I've hurt.
But I guess the real reason I called you is just to say I love you and I miss you
I hope you're well.
This is work, not play.
Then why'd you bother coming over?
I was hoping you'd answer the door naked.
That would be play.
That would be work with a view.
(SCOFFING) Sorry to disappoint.
How many characters in a tweet?
140.
Type this, let me know where you land.
Eight-year-old Washington D.C. boy killed by a stray bullet in gangland shoot-out.
61 characters left.
He should have been in school?
30 left.
Spinella to blame.
Question mark.
- 128.
- Press send.
Now give me a name, details.
Tyler Davis.
Third-grader at Vernon Baker Elementary.
Shot outside his home in Southeast just before noon today.
Sent.
Where are you going?
- To see the mother.
- You don't wanna...
There's work to do.
I'll see you later tonight.
Tyler never did anything wrong.
He was a good boy.
Everybody loved him.
It's okay.
If Tyler's school had been in session, this senseless killing would have never taken place.
We need to end this strike now and get all our children back in school where they belong, before we risk another death like this.
So, Mr. Spinella,I am headed to the Capitol right now, and I will remain there until you are ready to meet and talk so that we can end this pointless strike.
Thank you all for coming.
Let's go back inside.
REPORTER:
Mr. Spinella, one question.
PRESS SECRETARY:
Mr. Spinella is not gonna make comments at this time.
No comment.
No comment.
Thank you.
Frank.
So?
You said you wanted to talk.
You said you wanted to work out a compromise.
I lied.
Excuse me?
I have no intention of working out a compromise.
So then why the fuck are we here, Frank?
(TAPPING RING ON TABLE)
What the hell's the matter with you?
You think this is some kind of a game?
No.
These are real people with families to feed.
Would you please stop that?
Stop what?
In five seconds, I'm out of here.
One.
Two.
Three.
- Four
- Goodbye, Frank.
You know the difference between you and me, Marty?
What?
I'm a white-trash cracker from a white-trash town that no one would even bother to piss on.
But here's the difference.
I've made something of myself.
I have the keys to the Capitol.
People respect me.
But you, you're still nothing.
You're just an uppity dago in an expensive suit turning tricks for the unions.
Nobody respects the unions anymore, Marty.
They're dying.
And no one respects you.
The most you'll ever make of yourself is blowing men like me.
Men with real power.
Yes.
I can smell the cock on your breath from here.
You think you can get under my skin?
- I know I can.
- Yeah.
Kiss my ass, Frank.
- You can't afford to walk out.
- Watch me.
I've got a dead, underprivileged kid in my pocket.
What do you have?
I have two million honorable teachers.
Fair enough.
But I got something even better.
Go ahead.
Open it.
Okay.
I'll play your game.
You're an idiot.
Stamper threw it.
You're full of shit.
Oh no, Stamper threw the brick.
And I made sure Claire distracted my security.
Are you kidding me?
And to think you wanted me to apologize to my wife.
You would do something that low, Frank?
I arranged the brick, Marty, just like I arranged this meeting this afternoon.
Back off, Frank.
Why don't you just get down on your knees where you really belong?
Back off, Frank.
Because the only thing you're gonna get from me is cum on your...
Fuck you!
NANCY:
Everything okay in there, sir?
Look, I'll tell them you provoked me.
I'll tell them that you threw the brick yourself.
And who's going to believe you?
You just assaulted a United States Congressman, which is a felony.
But I'm not gonna press charges, Marty.
Because the strike ends now.
You think it'll leave a scar?
I have a thick skin.
The next time you ask me to invite someone in for coffee, will you please make sure no guns go off?
I'll do my best.
I saw Steve again today.
How is he?
In a lot of pain.
Should I go see him?
I don't think you need to.
(PHONE RINGS)
Zoe Barnes.
When he dies, we'll pay for his funeral.
(RINGING CONTINUES)
You don't need to take it?
No.
I'm done with work today.
We're almost a month into the strike, and we've got millions of kids stuck home from school.
Do you blame the White House or Congress?
I personally have very little sympathy for the teachers.
We're over three weeks into this strike.
It's costing the country billions of dollars, and instead of offering solutions--
There's a big difference between taking a stand and sitting on your hands.
I don't know whether to call it cowardice...
It's his agenda, and the problem is that he stole sound, conservative ideas.
The only smart thing he's done is lift his platform from the republican platform.
I admit it, Linda.
This got away from me.
But we can't turn back time.
We have to hold our ground.
While our approval ratings continue to nosedive?
Spinella and I worked together for years on dozens of labor-related bills.
- I thought he'd be reasonable.
- You were wrong about that.
Well, I didn't think he'd be insane enough to go on strike, and I didn't think the strike would last this long.
So you've been wrong twice about this.
Why should I believe you're right about holding out?
We threatened collective bargaining in order to get performance standards and charter funding.
That's the deal that we made.
We took that stand.
We lay down now, we lose it all.
There'll be no reform, just an empty bill.
I understand the logic, Frank, but we're in damage control now.
We can't close one wound by opening another.
But we're the democrats.
We're the ones who are supposed to be defending the teachers.
But you can't have it both ways, Linda.
You can't have the reform you want and keep the teachers happy at the same time.
You knew that when we started.
Okay, then if we have to choose, we choose to keep the teachers happy.
That is a mistake, Linda.
We've already crossed the rubicon.
I'm telling you this-- the president wants to change the bill.
We should've done it three weeks ago.
We didn't.
So you have to do it now.
Give me more time, Linda, please.
If I can break this strike and get everything we want in this bill, can we agree that's preferable to folding?
Of course.
If we can count on that--
Then count on me for just one more week.
If the strike isn't over by then, I'll change the bill.
- Frank--
- No.
One more week.
That's all.
This is the worst possible position to be in.
If I water down the bill, the president will still me as a failure.
If the strike doesn't end in a week, I forced myself into a corner.
Only total victory will put me back in his good graces.
The alternative is exile, which would mean the last five months were for nothing.
I cannot abide falling back to square one.
You need me, ma'am?
No.
I just was wondering if you wanted a cup of coffee.
I just brewed a fresh pot.
- I'm good, ma'am.
But thanks.
- Are you sure?
My shift's done in a couple hours.
I'll be fine.
No.
Come on.
Stretch your legs.
I won't take no for an answer.
What did you do before you joined the leadership detail?
I was a cop here in DC.
Before that, I was in the Marines, ma'am.
- Thank you.
- Did you serve overseas?
I did, ma'am.
Bahrain, then Afghanistan.
Served most of my second tour in the Korangal Valley.
You wanna know if I killed anyone?
I think I know the answer.
- I got a dinner meeting with birch.
- I invited him in for coffee.
Well, drink it fast.
We leave in five...
Get down!
Stay away from the windows!
Stop!
You'll have six of my best men covering you around the clock.
I guess I'm wondering why we didn't at least have one of your best men covering us now.
He'll be disciplined, sir.
He shot a gun in a residential neighborhood.
- I want him fired.
- There will be a full investigation, and we'll take the necessary action.
Steve never would've let this happen.
Is he better yet?
Because I would feel a lot safer if he was with us.
Unfortunately, he won't be coming back, sir.
I thought he just had a gallbladder infection.
He did, but they found more.
His pancreas, stage four.
- Jesus.
- Oh, my God.
That's awful.
How much longer does he have?
Not long.
A few weeks.
At least that's what his wife told me.
We have to go see him.
Can you get the information where he is?
Of course.
I'll make sure you get it right away.
- Thank you, Captain.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Good night.
- Front door.
- Yes, sir.
Your weapon.
Your badge too.
Am I suspended, sir?
You had a suspect on foot, and you fire your gun?
- Sir, I realize that--
- Do you know how this reflects on me?
That one of our men could be so careless?
Not only do you abandon your post for coffee...
You could've killed a bystander.
That slug was found in somebody's front stoop.
What if it went in their house?
Your badge, Meechum.
Two reasons, which are really the same reason.
I was sick of working for other people, and I knew I could do a better job than my bosses.
They kept trying to suppress me, shutting me out.
So I said, "fuck it.
I'll do it my way."
- Then you just quit?
- Not like you did.
I slaved away until I lined up the money to start Slugline.
Once Slugline gets big enough, what's the plan?
Are you gonna sell it like Arianna?
Probably.
And then who knows?
Whatever the next adventure is.
Maybe Shanghai.
So I shouldn't expect to have a job in two years?
Do you ever wanna have any job for more than two years?
What about you?
What's your big plan?
Uh, I don't know yet.
Come on.
Slugline is just a stepping stone for you.
- You know what?
I should take this.
- Go.
Do your thing.
Hey.
You have proof Spinella was behind it?
Put it in context.
Three weeks into a national teachers' strike--
At the home of Francis Underwood, who has led the charge on--
There you go.
Now post that before one of my neighbors calls a local 11:00 hack.
- When do I see you next?
- I'm background on this.
I'm not your source.
You can't talk now?
- No.
- When?
Soon, with bells on.
What about "more school books, less bricks"?
Nah, it's too broad.
We need a better sound bite.
Something specific, something that points the finger directly at Spinella.
- He'll deny any involvement.
- Of course he will.
- So how do we get around that?
- We say he can't control his troops.
- There's no evidence it was a teacher.
- Who else could it be?
He's gonna shift blame for the strike back on congress.
No.
We need something clear, something clean, something that sticks in your head.
"Teachers need a lesson in self-restraint."
No.
You're not hearing me.
People like teachers.
No.
We need something that makes Spinella the villain.
- His lack of control, his inability--
- Disorganized labor.
It's disorganized labor, plain and simple.
When you've got angry teachers throwing bricks through congressmen's windows, you've gotta blame the union leadership.
We'll be beefing up the security for the entire leadership.
And I strongly encourage Marty Spinella to keep his people in line.
This is starting to look like disorganized labor.
Do you really think Marty Spinella is to blame?
Whether Mr. Spinella is behind this or not, he might wanna tone down the rhetoric before disorganized labor turns into organized crime.
No one can prove anything.
So that's the most cogent response.
Well, go on TV and say that.
You deplore violence in any form.
It's congress that should take responsibility.
I don't want to degenerate to Frank's level.
We need to kill this brick thing.
It's distracting people from the issues.
She's right.
It'll eat up one cycle, and it'll disappear.
No.
This story is getting traction.
Support for the strike is dipping.
So is the president's approval ratings.
But he gets to say in the oval office another three years, no matter what.
We can't afford another three weeks.
When I told the unions to strike,
I told them to prepare for the long haul.
All right?
Their accounts dry up, we keep going.
We figure it out.
I am not going to blink over something like this.
Fine.
But if we lose the public relations battle, none of that does us any good.
Frank wants us on the defensive.
I think this story is going to blow over.
If I'm wrong, we'll reevaluate.
But I wanna give it another day or two first.
Okay?
Hi, Adam.
You all right?
I saw the news.
Yes, I'm fine.
That's gotta rattle the nerves--
A brick coming through the window.
It did, some.
So are you staying in the house?
We've got extra security now, so...
Well, um, it made me think of you, so I figured I'd just check in.
I appreciate that.
We still haven't talked, have we?
- There's no need to.
- I think we should.
Here's how I see it.
You asked me to come down.
I did.
We both had ideas about what that could mean.
Probably very similar ideas.
But then you changed your mind.
So be it.
There's no reason we can't be in touch or remain friends.
Let's not fool ourselves, Adam.
So I won't call again.
- Done.
- I'm not saying that.
What are you saying?
I just called because I care about you.
No agenda.
If you wanna talk again, call me.
If not, I understand.
It's up to you.
You think I'm being unreasonable?
I think you're doing whatever it is you need to do, and I'm not gonna question it.
It was sweet of you to call.
Listen, you probably need to get back to work.
I know I do.
I should go.
Yeah.
Okay.
- Take care.
- Okay.
- Frank, you got a minute?
- I'll see you inside.
I wanna be governor, and I want your help.
- Am I still on the short list?
- You are.
I haven't had a drink in over a month.
I'm clean.
Is that because I asked, or because it's what you want?
It was about time I took responsibility for myself.
Taking responsibility is one thing, and it's admirable.
But running for governor of a major state is a whole other ball game.
Let me tell you something, Frank.
I got elected to congress 'cause I seized the moment that opportunity struck.
You kept me on that list.
I wanna seize that opportunity.
If you help me out, I'll give you everything I got.
Well, that's all I've been waiting to hear.
All right.
I'll tell you what.
I need to make some calls, check in with some people.
Give me a few days.
I'll get back to you.
- Of course.
- And, Peter...
I feel like I've met the real you for the first time just now.
Janet.
- Is this a bad time?
- No.
No, not at all.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were coming.
Here.
Take my chair.
- Oh, no.
I'm fine.
- I'll take these.
Thank you.
- Hello, Steve.
- Hey.
These could use some water.
I'll be right back.
Francis and I were so upset when we heard.
I'm sorry I haven't come sooner.
I didn't want too many people knowing.
Yes.
Francis wishes he could be here.
He wants you to know he's praying for you.
- Couldn't make it, huh?
- No, there's a big teachers' strike going on right now, and he's been stuck in his office for weeks.
I get it.
I saw on the news.
- The brick.
- Right.
I told Francis that probably wouldn't have happened if you were there.
No.
Probably not.
I never seen him pray.
Not in eight years.
You said he was praying for me.
You've seen us in church.
Yeah, but...
I never went inside.
They're just gorgeous.
Mrs. Underwood, thank you so much.
Please, call me Claire.
- I know you got things to do.
- Of course.
If you need anything at all, call me.
You have my cell.
Anything at all.
And I'm sorry to have surprised you.
No.
It was so nice of you to come.
Thank you.
I know Steve appreciated it.
Check this out.
It's foam.
- How many of these we have?
- 200.
But I can get more.
Get more.
Bring it on!
You need to give the teachers the respect they deserve.
We can't back away from this, Marty.
- We've gotta face it head-on.
- They provoked us.
They were throwing foam.
Our guys were throwing punches.
We're gonna come off the bad guys here.
Okay.
Okay.
I get it.
I get it.
But I wanna be smart about this.
I wanna do something definitive that'll put this to bed
- and get us back on message.
- CNN, one on one, you and Underwood.
8:00 tonight.
Frank is excellent in debates.
Go strong against him.
Address the brick right to his face.
- End of story.
- Underwood says he's in if you are.
Okay.
But I want as much prep as possible, okay?
I want to run questions.
You moderate, you play Underwood.
Wear this one.
Then come in here.
I wanna put powder on you.
Well, somebody at the studio can do that.
Yes, and they always cake on too much.
I'm doing it.
War paint.
How bloody do you think it'll be?
Oh, I think I oughta be able to dispatch with him easily enough.
Oh, you remember Peter Russo?
He's doing well.
He hasn't had a drink in a month.
Oh, good for him.
I like him.
Oh, good, because he could use your help.
- How?
- We're running him for Governor.
- Ambitious.
- Mmm.
We wanna create jobs in his district.
It's on the Delaware River.
I thought we might be able to put a bill together.
Something with an economic upside.
This has to do with the shipyard closing?
We need the shipbuilders' support for his campaign.
You think you might be able to draft a bill that he can sponsor?
I'm really trying to focus on international projects, Francis.
Not domestic legislation.
I understand, but I could really use your help, Claire.
Does Catherine durant still owe us?
When you make someone Secretary of State, they owe you for life.
We're having trouble getting our water filters through sudanese customs.
- I'll call from the car.
- Tomorrow's fine.
- I would have done that anyway.
- I know.
I'm ready for battle.
You wanna come watch?
- No.
You go on ahead.
- Oh, come on.
Watch me put the final nail in Spinella's coffin.
It'll be fun.
Marty.
Frank.
Come on, people.
Take your marks.
Congressman, would you like to respond to that?
Yes, I would.
Two billion dollars of taxpayer's money being wasted.
And congress should be ashamed of itself for that, Frank.
Oh, what?
Did congress force the teachers to go on strike?
- No, we didn't.
- Really, Frank?
When you threaten teachers' ability to negotiate as a union, when you threaten their job security, you threaten their livelihood, of course you force them to strike.
And did we also force them to start throwing bricks at people's houses?
I'm really glad you brought that up, because you know there's absolutely no proof that that incident had anything to do with this strike.
And I wanna take the opportunity to say publicly that we categorically condemn any use of violence whatsoever or intimidation.
What you're saying essentially is that you can't control your own people.
- That is not what I'm saying.
- That is what you're saying.
You're disorganized.
- Disorganized labor.
- You can keep trotting out that phrase all you like, but you know what I'd like to do, Frank?
I would like to get back to the issue here of educating our children and the fact that congress is not living up to their commitment.
Well, you know what I would like?
What?
An apology.
If not to me, then to my wife.
When that brick came through our window, it was terrifying.
She's standing right over there.
- Claire?
- We need camera two on the wife.
Now, why don't you look her in the eye and tell her that your people had nothing to do with that brick.
- Are you serious?
- Yes.
Okay.
Mrs. Underwood, Claire,
I am sincerely sorry that you had to go through that ordeal, truly.
And it actually sickens me that someone made you feel unsafe in your own home.
And I give you my word that to the best of my knowledge, none of our people had anything to do with it.
But you know what sickens me more?
That right now, your husband is using you as a prop on national television to try and win a debate.
So I think you're the one that owes your wife an apology, Frank.
And when you're done apologizing, can we please get back to the issue here of educating our children?
No.
You've got this wrong, Marty.
There is no "you" and "I" in education.
Well, I mean, yes, there's the letters
"U" and "I" are in the word "education."
But "Education" with a capital E...
You know what I'm talking about.
I don't think I do.
Yes, you do, Marty.
U and I-
- Education.
So, what, we're gonna waste the rest of this debate naming all the vowels in--
I'm happy to play the vowel game.
You wanna play the vowel game with me?
All right.
U think I O
U A apology.
But no, no, no.
U O I...
Interesting.
You left out E for "Education."
- So let--
- Defecation--
Edification.
I'm sorry.
LOL.
Uh, uh...
Uh...
You like sesame street so much?
Why don't you give the kids the money they deserve?
What I'm trying to say about education...
Well,
I guess school's still in session.
I guess you schooled me there, Marty.
Let's move on.
Please.
Humor aside, there are more important issues out there.
I had no intention of bringing you into this.
It wasn't part of a plan.
I would've told you if it was.
I know.
The idea just struck me, and I went with it.
I don't mind that you improvised.
I just wish you'd done it better.
Congressman Frank Underwood says he got, quote, "schooled"
by AFT spokesman and chief strategist, Martin Spinella, during a debate last night on this network.
In the past 24 hours, reruns of the gaffe have played non-stop on TV news programs and the internet.
A YouTube clip set to techno music has logged more than 300,000 hits and spawned dozens of other spoofs.
♪ No ♪
♪ No ♪
♪ E O I ♪
♪ with a capital "E" ♪
♪ education LOL ♪
That was as clumsy as the Lee Harvey Oswald prison transfer.
What was he thinking?
Just give me one second.
There's a deli.
Down the street.
Patti, thanks for coming.
Sit down.
You want some coffee?
No, thanks.
I'm good.
Hey, did you see bill Maher last night?
No, I didn't.
Oh, it was about the CNN thing.
I have to admit, Frank, it was kinda funny.
Well, I'll have to catch a rerun.
How you doing?
You holding up all right with the strike?
Let's talk about Pennsylvania.
I have your candidate.
Peter Russo.
First Congressional District.
We crossed him off.
I know.
It's a mistake.
He's young, he's handsome.
He's bright.
Nobody knows who he is outside of Philadelphia.
There's no donor base, no infrastructure.
You start me off with funding from the DNC and I'll raise an army around this guy.
I will personally oversee his campaign.
Is that the best we can do?
What's better than a blank slate in the right hands?
Ed, you need to go.
Congressman, do you have a moment?
Thank you, Patti.
- Have him call me.
- I will.
Ed?
Please.
- What is going on?
- I'm taking care of it.
One second, sir.
Please.
All right.
Make it fast, Meechum.
It's not easy for me to ask this, but I was wondering if you could put in a good word with my boss.
A good word?
They're going to discharge me, sir.
I messed up.
I'm fully aware.
But my job, it means everything to me, and I know a good word from you would...
Look, I have nothing against you personally, Meechum, but I can't get involved in these sort of affairs.
There's protocols and rules.
Sir, please, if you spoke to Cardiff--
There is nothing that I can do.
If anyone can convince the captain, it would be you, Congressman.
I'm sorry.
I wish you all the best, Meechum.
Doug.
What did Barney hull say?
That we'd be the first to know.
I can't believe there hasn't been a single 911 call.
There's been plenty.
It's just not the sort we're after.
We got that kid in Atlanta.
No, it's got to be here.
I can't be getting on a plane.
It looks too opportunistic.
Maybe if we open it up a little bit.
No, we cannot lower our standards.
We just have to be patient.
New rule-- now that the debate's over,
Frank Underwood has to tell us what the hell that was.
Seriously, Congressman, was that a joke?
I haven't seen something just lay there like that since, uh...
I gotta go all the way back to my prom night.
Can we just settle this strike please?
Teachers have been out of the classroom for so long, middle schoolers are starting to have sex with each other.
Enough.
I don't know why you had it on in the first place.
I love you, Francis.
I know.
We should say that more often to each other.
I need to clear my head.
...north and east of the airport.
I'm gonna need that in time for that meeting.
Peter, let's talk.
So.
I've spoken to Patricia Whittaker.
She's on board.
You'll be getting four million in start-up funding from the DNC.
I'll pick the team.
You announce in August.
But the campaign starts today.
Are you ready?
I've already put together a platform.
It's mostly broad strokes, but we can hone it.
Good.
The first thing we need to address is your sobriety.
Oh, you don't need to worry about that.
Have you been going to meetings?
You mean AA?
- Yes.
- That's not really my thing.
If you want my help, then going to meetings is my one requirement.
I know I had a problem, Frank.
I accept that.
And I've taken responsibility for that, but I don't think going to meetings is necessary.
You cannot white-knuckle your recovery, Peter.
This campaign will be the hardest thing you've ever done in your life.
I realize that.
I'm prepared for that.
You think you are.
But we can't take any chances.
The party's investing in you.
I need to make sure you're investing in yourself.
All right.
I'll do whatever I have to do.
Good.
You'll start tomorrow morning.
- Doug will take you.
- Stamper?
He's been sober 14 years.
Doug has a drinking problem?
Had.
Not anymore.
He'll be your sponsor.
In the meantime, I want you to meet with my wife, Claire.
She runs the clean water initiative.
She's expecting you, so clear your schedule and head over there now.
Frank.
Thank you.
For believing in me.
You're gonna make a great candidate, Peter.
The shipyard closing frees up 1,100 acres of federal land.
Our goal is to pass a watershed act for the Delaware River.
We develop the land in an environmentally-responsible way, creating jobs in the process.
How many jobs?
Thousands.
We're aiming for the $200-million mark.
We got a lot of work to do.
We do, but you can start with the congressman whose districts fall within the watershed.
Do you have a draft of the bill you can show me?
We haven't sponsored any environmental legislation.
We'll draft it in consultation with your staff.
Gillian will be the point person on our end.
I don't have any legislation experience.
- I'll help you.
- When do we start?
We just did.
Will you introduce him to the research team?
- I'll be there in one second.
- Sure.
Mr. President?
I want it over.
As soon as possible.
Gut the bill, Frank.
Do whatever's necessary to end this.
Mr. President, if we give in now, the public won't credit you with a victory.
Not even a hollow one.
They'll chalk it up as a colossal defeat.
Well, that's on you, Frank.
You let this situation devolve to where it is.
I've already been blamed for the largest teacher's strike in US history.
I won't be held accountable for it dragging on months and months.
Mr. President, we have to end this strike on your terms.
Not anyone else's.
How?
By debating Marty Spinella on CNN?
Sir, you have placed your faith in me thus far.
I would ask that you continue to do so.
Whatever you're doing, Frank, isn't working, so I'm stepping in.
Gut the bill.
Like Linda said.
No.
I'm sorry, Mr. President, but I will not do that.
Are you letting pride cloud your judgment, Frank?
Respectfully, sir, you're allowing fear to cloud yours.
Not an easy thing to say no to the most powerful man in the free world.
But sometimes the only way to gain your superior's respect is to defy him.
What do we have on the schedule, Linda?
Your meeting with the...
Thank you, Mr. President.
- Do you have my briefing?
- Right here.
Good.
Let's look it over.
Hi.
How'd it go with Peter?
It went well.
Is he game?
Completely.
Ugh.
Thank you.
That's a big weight off my shoulders.
You sound tired.
Tired.
Impatient.
What can I do?
Nothing.
This one's up to fate.
I don't like when we leave things to fate.
Neither do I.
Does that mean I'm gonna have the bed to myself tonight?
Probably.
Can't Doug man the fort?
Well, he could, but I'd just toss and turn.
If I'm not gonna sleep, I might as well not sleep here.
Well, I'll leave the ringer on.
Call me if you want company.
I will.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
You should go home.
I can take it from here.
Vigilance.
It's good for the soul.
10-59.
Corner of 16th and Q. 10-59.
What's that?
Disorderly conduct.
Do you believe in karma?
Absolutely not.
Well, I do.
At least tonight.
Get Captain Cardiff on the phone.
Let's do something about Meechum.
What?
Get him his job back.
He fired his weapon.
He overreacted.
Cardiff.
On the phone.
Now.
Nancy, give me Captain Cardiff, please.
We might as well do one productive thing while we wait.
It requires very little of me and will mean the world to him.
It's a very inexpensive investment.
Hello, sir.
This is Doug Stamper.
I have Francis Underwood for you.
I got him on.
Captain, I know it's late, but I'd like to talk to you about Edward Meechum.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Thank you.
- Are you hungry?
- Mm-hmm.
You have any trouble getting in?
Nah, they made me put it through the X-ray machine twice.
So I hope it didn't overcook it.
Frank, you always pay too much.
This is way too much.
For the inconvenience.
You know, 20 years you been coming to my joint.
This the first time I been to yours.
What do you think?
I could get used to it.
Well, you're welcome any time.
Thank you, Freddy.
Always, Frank.
Got a...
446 3rd Street...
That's a drive-by shooting.
Get details.
Sir, I want to thank you for talking to the captain.
He told me you called, and I can't tell you how grateful I am.
I want you to listen very closely to what I'm about to say.
From this moment on, you are a rock.
You absorb nothing, you say nothing, and nothing breaks you.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
Welcome back.
Steve?
I'll leave you be.
Where, uh-- where's Janet?
She's been here every day for the last few weeks.
I told her go home, get some rest.
Well, is everything okay?
Your text said it was important.
I don't know how to put this.
The thing is, I...
I've been thinking.
A lot.
About my life.
About the things I haven't done.
Things I haven't said.
I hate your husband.
A lot of people do.
The past eight years, I watched over him.
But it wasn't him I was watching.
And every time I saw you, every time I heard your voice, all I could think to myself was,
"Jesus, what I wouldn't give."
I can't tell you how many times I thought about that.
You know what Francis said to me when he proposed?
I remember his exact words.
He said, "Claire, if all you want is happiness, say no.
I'm not gonna give you a couple of kids and count the days until retirement.
I promise you freedom from that.
I promise you'll never be bored."
You know, he was the only man-- and there were a lot of others who proposed.
But he was the only one who understood me.
He didn't put me on some pedestal.
He knew that I didn't want to be adored or coddled.
So he took my hand and he put a ring on it.
Because he knew I'd say yes.
He's a man who knows how to take what he wants.
Is this what you wanted?
Is that the way you wanted it?
Stop.
Stop.
Please.
Please.
Stop.
Don't.
You told me your truth.
Now you know mine.
Hey, it's Peter.
I don't expect you to call me back, but I wanted to let you know I stopped drinking, and I went to my first AA meeting.
Um, I'm supposed to reach out and make amends to those I've hurt.
But I guess the real reason I called you is just to say I love you and I miss you.
I hope you're well.
This is work, not play.
Then why'd you bother coming over?
I was hoping you'd answer the door naked.
That would be play.
That would be work with a view.
Sorry to disappoint.
How many characters in a tweet?
140.
Type this, let me know where you land.
"Eight-year-old Washington DC boy killed by a stray bullet in gangland shoot-out."
61 characters left.
"Should have been in school"?
30 left.
"Spinella to blame?"
128.
Press "send."
Now give me a name, details.
Tyler Davis.
Third grader at Vernon Baker Elementary.
Shot outside his home in southeast just before noon today.
Sent.
Where are you going?
- To see the mother.
- You don't wanna...?
There's work to do.
I'll see you later tonight.
Tyler never did anything wrong.
He was a good boy.
Everybody loved him.
It's okay.
If Tyler's school had been in session, this senseless killing would have never taken place.
We need to end this strike now and get all our children back in school where they belong before we risk another death like this.
So, Mr. Spinella, I am headed to the capitol right now, and I will remain there until you are ready to meet and talk so that we can end this pointless strike.
Thank you all for coming.
Let's go back inside.
Mr. Spinella, one question...
Mr. Spinella is not to make a comment at this time.
No comment.
No comment.
Thank you.
Frank.
So?
You said you wanted to talk.
You said you wanted to work out a compromise.
I lied.
Excuse me?
I have no intention of working out a compromise.
So then why the fuck are we here, Frank?
What the hell's the matter with you?
You think this is some kind of a game?
No.
These are real people with families to feed.
Would you please stop that?
Stop what?
In five seconds, I'm out of here.
One.
Two.
Three.
- Four.
- Goodbye, Frank.
You know the difference between you and me, Marty?
What?
I'm a white-trash cracker from a white-trash town that no one would even bother to piss on.
But here's the difference--
I've made something of myself.
I have the keys to the capitol.
People respect me.
But you, you're still nothing.
You're just an uppity dago in an expensive suit turning tricks for the unions.
Nobody respects the unions anymore, Marty.
They're dying.
And no one respects you.
The most you'll ever make of yourself is blowing men like me.
Men with real power.
Yes.
I can smell the cock on your breath from here.
You think you can get under my skin?
I know I can.
Kiss my ass, Frank.
You can't afford to walk out.
Watch me.
I've got a dead, underprivileged kid in my pocket.
What do you have?
I have 2 million honorable teachers.
Fair enough.
But I got something even better.
Go ahead.
Open it.
Okay.
I'll play your game.
You're an idiot.
Stamper threw it.
You're full of shit.
Oh, no, Stamper threw the brick.
And I made sure Claire distracted my security.
Are you kidding me?
And to think you wanted me to apologize to my wife.
You would do something that low, Frank?
I arranged the brick, Marty, just like I arranged this meeting this afternoon.
Back off, Frank.
Why don't you just get down on your knees
- where you really belong?
- Back off, Frank.
Because the only thing you're gonna get from me
- is come on your--
- Fuck you!
Everything okay in there?
Ugh.
Look, I'll-
- I'll tell them you provoked me.
I'll tell them that you threw the brick yourself.
And who's going to believe you?
You just assaulted a United States congressman, which is a felony.
But I'm not gonna press charges, Marty.
Because the strike ends now.
You think it'll leave a scar?
I have a thick skin.
The next time you ask me to invite someone in for coffee, will you please make sure no guns go off?
I'll do my best.
I saw Steve again today.
How is he?
In a lot of pain.
Should I go see him?
I don't think you need to.
Zoe Barnes.
When he dies, we'll pay for his funeral.
You don't need to take it?
No.
I'm done with work today.

We're almost a month into the strike, and we've got millions of kids stuck home from school.
Do you blame the White House or Congress?
I personally have very little sympathy for the teachers.
We're over three weeks into this strike.
It's costing the country billions of dollars, and instead of offering solutions-
There's a big difference between taking a stand and sitting on your hands.
I don't know whether to call it cowardice...
It's his agenda, and the problem is that he stole sound, conservative ideas.
The only smart thing he's done is lift his platform from the republican platform.
I admit it, Linda.
This got away from me.
But we can't turn back time.
We have to hold our ground.
While our approval ratings continue to nosedive?
Spinella and I worked together for years on dozens of labor-related bills.
- I thought he'd be reasonable.
- You were wrong about that.
Well, I didn't think he'd be insane enough to go on strike, and I didn't think the strike would last this long.
So you've been wrong twice about this.
Why should I believe you're right about holding out?
We threatened collective bargaining in order to get performance standards and charter funding.
That's the deal that we made.
We took that stand.
We lay down now, we lose it all.
There'll be no reform, just an empty bill.
I understand the logic, Frank, but we're in damage control now.
We can't close one wound by opening another.
But we're the democrats.
We're the ones who are supposed to be defending the teachers.
But you can't have it both ways, Linda.
You can't have the reform you want and keep the teachers happy at the same time.
You knew that when we started.
Okay, then if we have to choose, we choose to keep the teachers happy.
That is a mistake, Linda.
We've already crossed the rubicon.
I'm telling you this- the president wants to change the bill.
We should've done it three weeks ago.
We didn't.
So you have to do it now.
Give me more time, Linda, please.
If I can break this strike and get everything we want in this bill, can we agree that's preferable to folding?
Of course.
If we can count on that-
Then count on me for just one more week.
If the strike isn't over by then, I'll change the bill.
- Frank-
- No.
One more week.
That's all.
This is the worst possible position to be in.
If I water down the bill, the president will still see me as a failure.
If the strike doesn't end in a week, I forced myself into a corner.
Only total victory will put me back in his good graces.
The alternative is exile, which would mean the last five months were for nothing.
I cannot abide falling back to square one.
You need me, ma'am?
No.
I just was wondering if you wanted a cup of coffee.
I just brewed a fresh pot.
- I'm good, ma'am.
But thanks.
- Are you sure?
My shift's done in a couple hours.
I'll be fine.
No.
Come on.
Stretch your legs.
I won't take no for an answer.
What did you do before you joined the leadership detail?
I was a cop here in DC.
Before that, I was in the Marines, ma'am.
- Thank you.
- Did you serve overseas?
I did, ma'am.
Bahrain, then Afghanistan.
Served most of my second tour in the Korangal Valley.
You wanna know if I killed anyone?
I think I know the answer.
- I got a dinner meeting with birch.
- I invited him in for coffee.
Well, drink it fast.
We leave in five...
Get down!
Stay away from the windows!
Stop!
You'll have six of my best men covering you around the clock.
I guess I'm wondering why we didn't at least have one of your best men covering us now.
He'll be disciplined, sir.
He shot a gun in a residential neighborhood.
- I want him fired.
- There will be a full investigation, and we'll take the necessary action.
Steve never would've let this happen.
Is he better yet?
Because I would feel a lot safer if he was with us.
Unfortunately, he won't be coming back, sir.
I thought he just had a gallbladder infection.
He did, but they found more.
His pancreas, stage four.
- Jesus.
- Oh, my God.
That's awful.
How much longer does he have?
Not long.
A few weeks.
At least that's what his wife told me.
We have to go see him.
Can you get the information where he is?
Of course.
I'll make sure you get it right away.
- Thank you, Captain.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Good night.
- Front door.
- Yes, sir.
Your weapon.
Your badge too.
Am I suspended, sir?
You had a suspect on foot, and you fire your gun?
- Sir, I realize that-
- Do you know how this reflects on me?
That one of our men could be so careless?
Not only do you abandon your post for coffee...
You could've killed a bystander.
That slug was found in somebody's front stoop.
What if it went in their house?
Your badge, Meechum.
Two reasons, which are really the same reason.
I was sick of working for other people, and I knew I could do a better job than my bosses.
They kept trying to suppress me, shutting me out.
So I said, "fuck it.
I'll do it my way."
- Then you just quit?
- Not like you did.
I slaved away until I lined up the money to start Slugline.
Once Slugline gets big enough, what's the plan?
Are you gonna sell it like Arianna?
Probably.
And then who knows?
Whatever the next adventure is.
Maybe Shanghai.
So I shouldn't expect to have a job in two years?
Do you ever wanna have any job for more than two years?
What about you?
What's your big plan?
Uh, I don't know yet.
Come on.
Slugline is just a stepping stone for you.
- You know what?
I should take this.
- Go.
Do your thing.
Hey.
You have proof Spinella was behind it?
Put it in context.
Three weeks into a national teachers' strike-
At the home of Francis Underwood, who has led the charge on-
There you go.
Now post that before one of my neighbors calls a local 11:00 hack.
- When do I see you next?
- I'm background on this.
I'm not your source.
You can't talk now?
- No.
- When?
Soon, with bells on.
What about "more school books, less bricks"?
Nah, it's too broad.
We need a better sound bite.
Something specific, something that points the finger directly at Spinella.
- He'll deny any involvement.
- Of course he will.
- So how do we get around that?
- We say he can't control his troops.
- There's no evidence it was a teacher.
- Who else could it be?
He's gonna shift blame for the strike back on congress.
No.
We need something clear, something clean, something that sticks in your head.
"Teachers need a lesson in self-restraint."
No.
You're not hearing me.
People like teachers.
No.
We need something that makes Spinella the villain.
- His lack of control, his inability-
- Disorganized labor.
It's disorganized labor, plain and simple.
When you've got angry teachers throwing bricks through congressmen's windows, you've gotta blame the union leadership.
We'll be beefing up the security for the entire leadership.
And I strongly encourage Marty Spinella to keep his people in line.
This is starting to look like disorganized labor.
Do you really think Marty Spinella is to blame?
Whether Mr. Spinella is behind this or not, he might wanna tone down the rhetoric before disorganized labor turns into organized crime.
No one can prove anything.
So that's the most cogent response.
Well, go on TV and say that.
You deplore violence in any form.
It's congress that should take responsibility.
I don't want to degenerate to Frank's level.
We need to kill this brick thing.
It's distracting people from the issues.
She's right.
It'll eat up one cycle, and it'll disappear.
No.
This story is getting traction.
Support for the strike is dipping.
So is the president's approval ratings.
But he gets to say in the oval office another three years, no matter what.
We can't afford another three weeks.
When I told the unions to strike,
I told them to prepare for the long haul.
All right?
Their accounts dry up, we keep going.
We figure it out.
I am not going to blink over something like this.
Fine.
But if we lose the public relations battle, none of that does us any good.
Frank wants us on the defensive.
I think this story is going to blow over.
If I'm wrong, we'll reevaluate.
But I wanna give it another day or two first.
Okay?
Hi, Adam.
You all right?
I saw the news.
Yes, I'm fine.
That's gotta rattle the nerves-
A brick coming through the window.
It did, some.
So are you staying in the house?
We've got extra security now, so...
Well, um, it made me think of you, so I figured I'd just check in.
I appreciate that.
We still haven't talked, have we?
- There's no need to.
- I think we should.
Here's how I see it.
You asked me to come down.
I did.
We both had ideas about what that could mean.
Probably very similar ideas.
But then you changed your mind.
So be it.
There's no reason we can't be in touch or remain friends.
Let's not fool ourselves, Adam.
So I won't call again.
- Done.
- I'm not saying that.
What are you saying?
I just called because I care about you.
No agenda.
If you wanna talk again, call me.
If not, I understand.
It's up to you.
You think I'm being unreasonable?
I think you're doing whatever it is you need to do, and I'm not gonna question it.
It was sweet of you to call.
Listen, you probably need to get back to work.
I know I do.
I should go.
Yeah.
Okay.
- Take care.
- Okay.
- Frank, you got a minute?
- I'll see you inside.
I wanna be governor, and I want your help.
- Am I still on the short list?
- You are.
I haven't had a drink in over a month.
I'm clean.
Is that because I asked, or because it's what you want?
It was about time I took responsibility for myself.
Taking responsibility is one thing, and it's admirable.
But running for governor of a major state is a whole other ball game.
Let me tell you something, Frank.
I got elected to congress 'cause I seized the moment that opportunity struck.
You kept me on that list.
I wanna seize that opportunity.
If you help me out, I'll give you everything I got.
Well, that's all I've been waiting to hear.
All right.
I'll tell you what.
I need to make some calls, check in with some people.
Give me a few days.
I'll get back to you.
- Of course.
- And, Peter...
I feel like I've met the real you for the first time just now.
Janet.
- Is this a bad time?
- No.
No, not at all.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were coming.
Here.
Take my chair.
- Oh, no.
I'm fine.
- I'll take these.
Thank you.
- Hello, Steve.
- Hey.
These could use some water.
I'll be right back.
Francis and I were so upset when we heard.
I'm sorry I haven't come sooner.
I didn't want too many people knowing.
Yes.
Francis wishes he could be here.
He wants you to know he's praying for you.
- Couldn't make it, huh?
- No, there's a big teachers' strike going on right now, and he's been stuck in his office for weeks.
I get it.
I saw on the news.
- The brick.
- Right.
I told Francis that probably wouldn't have happened if you were there.
No.
Probably not.
I never seen him pray.
Not in eight years.
You said he was praying for me.
You've seen us in church.
Yeah, but...
I never went inside.
They're just gorgeous.
Mrs. Underwood, thank you so much.
Please, call me Claire.
- I know you got things to do.
- Of course.
If you need anything at all, call me.
You have my cell.
Anything at all.
And I'm sorry to have surprised you.
No.
It was so nice of you to come.
Thank you.
I know Steve appreciated it.
Check this out.
It's foam.
- How many of these we have?
- 200.
But I can get more.
Get more.
Bring it on!
You need to give the teachers the respect they deserve.
We can't back away from this, Marty.
- We've gotta face it head-on.
- They provoked us.
They were throwing foam.
Our guys were throwing punches.
We're gonna come off the bad guys here.
Okay.
Okay.
I get it.
I get it.
But I wanna be smart about this.
I wanna do something definitive that'll put this to bed
- and get us back on message.
- CNN, one on one, you and Underwood.
8:00 tonight.
Frank is excellent in debates.
Go strong against him.
Address the brick right to his face.
- End of story.
- Underwood says he's in if you are.
Okay.
But I want as much prep as possible, okay?
I want to run questions.
You moderate, you play Underwood.
Wear this one.
Then come in here.
I wanna put powder on you.
Well, somebody at the studio can do that.
Yes, and they always cake on too much.
I'm doing it.
War paint.
How bloody do you think it'll be?
Oh, I think I oughta be able to dispatch with him easily enough.
Oh, you remember Peter Russo?
He's doing well.
He hasn't had a drink in a month.
Oh, good for him.
I like him.
Oh, good, because he could use your help.
- How?
- We're running him for Governor.
- Ambitious.
- Mmm.
We wanna create jobs in his district.
It's on the Delaware River.
I thought we might be able to put a bill together.
Something with an economic upside.
This has to do with the shipyard closing?
We need the shipbuilders' support for his campaign.
You think you might be able to draft a bill that he can sponsor?
I'm really trying to focus on international projects, Francis.
Not domestic legislation.
I understand, but I could really use your help, Claire.
Does Catherine durant still owe us?
When you make someone Secretary of State, they owe you for life.
We're having trouble getting our water filters through sudanese customs.
- I'll call from the car.
- Tomorrow's fine.
- I would have done that anyway.
- I know.
I'm ready for battle.
You wanna come watch?
- No.
You go on ahead.
- Oh, come on.
Watch me put the final nail in Spinella's coffin.
It'll be fun.
Marty.
Frank.
Come on, people.
Take your marks.
Congressman, would you like to respond to that?
Yes, I would.
Two billion dollars of taxpayer's money being wasted.
And congress should be ashamed of itself for that, Frank.
Oh, what?
Did congress force the teachers to go on strike?
- No, we didn't.
- Really, Frank?
When you threaten teachers' ability to negotiate as a union, when you threaten their job security, you threaten their livelihood, of course you force them to strike.
And did we also force them to start throwing bricks at people's houses?
I'm really glad you brought that up, because you know there's absolutely no proof that that incident had anything to do with this strike.
And I wanna take the opportunity to say publicly that we categorically condemn any use of violence whatsoever or intimidation.
What you're saying essentially is that you can't control your own people.
- That is not what I'm saying.
- That is what you're saying.
You're disorganized.
- Disorganized labor.
- You can keep trotting out that phrase all you like, but you know what I'd like to do, Frank?
I would like to get back to the issue here of educating our children and the fact that congress is not living up to their commitment.
Well, you know what I would like?
What?
An apology.
If not to me, then to my wife.
When that brick came through our window, it was terrifying.
She's standing right over there.
- Claire?
- We need camera two on the wife.
Now, why don't you look her in the eye and tell her that your people had nothing to do with that brick.
- Are you serious?
- Yes.
Okay.
Mrs. Underwood, Claire,
I am sincerely sorry that you had to go through that ordeal, truly.
And it actually sickens me that someone made you feel unsafe in your own home.
And I give you my word that to the best of my knowledge, none of our people had anything to do with it.
But you know what sickens me more?
That right now, your husband is using you as a prop on national television to try and win a debate.
So I think you're the one that owes your wife an apology, Frank.
And when you're done apologizing, can we please get back to the issue here of educating our children?
No.
You've got this wrong, Marty.
There is no "you" and "I" in education.
Well, I mean, yes, there's the letters
"U" and "I" are in the word "education."
But "Education" with a capital E...
You know what I'm talking about.
I don't think I do.
Yes, you do, Marty.
U and I
- Education.
So, what, we're gonna waste the rest of this debate naming all the vowels in-
I'm happy to play the vowel game.
You wanna play the vowel game with me?
All right.
U think I O
U A apology.
But no, no, no.
U O I...
Interesting.
You left out E for "Education."
- So let-
- Defecation-
Edification.
I'm sorry.
LOL.
Uh, uh...
Uh...
You like sesame street so much?
Why don't you give the kids the money they deserve?
What I'm trying to say about education...
Well,
I guess school's still in session.
I guess you schooled me there, Marty.
Let's move on.
Please.
Humor aside, there are more important issues out there.
I had no intention of bringing you into this.
It wasn't part of a plan.
I would've told you if it was.
I know.
The idea just struck me, and I went with it.
I don't mind that you improvised.
I just wish you'd done it better.
Congressman Frank Underwood says he got, quote, "schooled"
by AFT spokesman and chief strategist, Martin Spinella, during a debate last night on this network.
In the past 24 hours, reruns of the gaffe have played non-stop on TV news programs and the internet.
A YouTube clip set to techno music has logged more than 300,000 hits and spawned dozens of other spoofs.

That was as clumsy as the Lee Harvey Oswald prison transfer.
What was he thinking?
Just give me one second.
There's a deli.
Down the street.
Patti, thanks for coming.
Sit down.
You want some coffee?
No, thanks.
I'm good.
Hey, did you see bill Maher last night?
No, I didn't.
Oh, it was about the CNN thing.
I have to admit, Frank, it was kinda funny.
Well, I'll have to catch a rerun.
How you doing?
You holding up all right with the strike?
Let's talk about Pennsylvania.
I have your candidate.
Peter Russo.
First Congressional District.
We crossed him off.
I know.
It's a mistake.
He's young, he's handsome.
He's bright.
Nobody knows who he is outside of Philadelphia.
There's no donor base, no infrastructure.
You start me off with funding from the DNC and I'll raise an army around this guy.
I will personally oversee his campaign.
Is that the best we can do?
What's better than a blank slate in the right hands?
Ed, you need to go.
Congressman, do you have a moment?
Thank you, Patti.
- Have him call me.
- I will.
Ed?
Please.
- What is going on?
- I'm taking care of it.
One second, sir.
Please.
All right.
Make it fast, Meechum.
It's not easy for me to ask this, but I was wondering if you could put in a good word with my boss.
A good word?
They're going to discharge me, sir.
I messed up.
I'm fully aware.
But my job, it means everything to me, and I know a good word from you would...
Look, I have nothing against you personally, Meechum, but I can't get involved in these sort of affairs.
There's protocols and rules.
Sir, please, if you spoke to Cardiff-
There is nothing that I can do.
If anyone can convince the captain, it would be you, Congressman.
I'm sorry.
I wish you all the best, Meechum.
Doug.
What did Barney hull say?
That we'd be the first to know.
I can't believe there hasn't been a single 911 call.
There's been plenty.
It's just not the sort we're after.
We got that kid in Atlanta.
No, it's got to be here.
I can't be getting on a plane.
It looks too opportunistic.
Maybe if we open it up a little bit.
No, we cannot lower our standards.
We just have to be patient.
New rule- now that the debate's over,
Frank Underwood has to tell us what the hell that was.
Seriously, Congressman, was that a joke?
I haven't seen something just lay there like that since, uh...
I gotta go all the way back to my prom night.
Can we just settle this strike please?
Teachers have been out of the classroom for so long, middle schoolers are starting to have sex with each other.
Enough.
I don't know why you had it on in the first place.
I love you, Francis.
I know.
We should say that more often to each other.
I need to clear my head.
...north and east of the airport.
I'm gonna need that in time for that meeting.
Peter, let's talk.
So.
I've spoken to Patricia Whittaker.
She's on board.
You'll be getting four million in start-up funding from the DNC.
I'll pick the team.
You announce in August.
But the campaign starts today.
Are you ready?
I've already put together a platform.
It's mostly broad strokes, but we can hone it.
Good.
The first thing we need to address is your sobriety.
Oh, you don't need to worry about that.
Have you been going to meetings?
You mean AA?
- Yes.
- That's not really my thing.
If you want my help, then going to meetings is my one requirement.
I know I had a problem, Frank.
I accept that.
And I've taken responsibility for that, but I don't think going to meetings is necessary.
You cannot white-knuckle your recovery, Peter.
This campaign will be the hardest thing you've ever done in your life.
I realize that.
I'm prepared for that.
You think you are.
But we can't take any chances.
The party's investing in you.
I need to make sure you're investing in yourself.
All right.
I'll do whatever I have to do.
Good.
You'll start tomorrow morning.
- Doug will take you.
- Stamper?
He's been sober 14 years.
Doug has a drinking problem?
Had.
Not anymore.
He'll be your sponsor.
In the meantime, I want you to meet with my wife, Claire.
She runs the clean water initiative.
She's expecting you, so clear your schedule and head over there now.
Frank.
Thank you.
For believing in me.
You're gonna make a great candidate, Peter.
The shipyard closing frees up 1,100 acres of federal land.
Our goal is to pass a watershed act for the Delaware River.
We develop the land in an environmentally-responsible way, creating jobs in the process.
How many jobs?
Thousands.
We're aiming for the $200-million mark.
We got a lot of work to do.
We do, but you can start with the congressman whose districts fall within the watershed.
Do you have a draft of the bill you can show me?
We haven't sponsored any environmental legislation.
We'll draft it in consultation with your staff.
Gillian will be the point person on our end.
I don't have any legislation experience.
- I'll help you.
- When do we start?
We just did.
Will you introduce him to the research team?
- I'll be there in one second.
- Sure.
Mr. President?
I want it over.
As soon as possible.
Gut the bill, Frank.
Do whatever's necessary to end this.
Mr. President, if we give in now, the public won't credit you with a victory.
Not even a hollow one.
They'll chalk it up as a colossal defeat.
Well, that's on you, Frank.
You let this situation devolve to where it is.
I've already been blamed for the largest teacher's strike in US history.
I won't be held accountable for it dragging on months and months.
Mr. President, we have to end this strike on your terms.
Not anyone else's.
How?
By debating Marty Spinella on CNN?
Sir, you have placed your faith in me thus far.
I would ask that you continue to do so.
Whatever you're doing, Frank, isn't working, so I'm stepping in.
Gut the bill.
Like Linda said.
No.
I'm sorry, Mr. President, but I will not do that.
Are you letting pride cloud your judgment, Frank?
Respectfully, sir, you're allowing fear to cloud yours.
Not an easy thing to say no to the most powerful man in the free world.
But sometimes the only way to gain your superior's respect is to defy him.
What do we have on the schedule, Linda?
Your meeting with the...
Thank you, Mr. President.
- Do you have my briefing?
- Right here.
Good.
Let's look it over.
Hi.
How'd it go with Peter?
It went well.
Is he game?
Completely.
Ugh.
Thank you.
That's a big weight off my shoulders.
You sound tired.
Tired.
Impatient.
What can I do?
Nothing.
This one's up to fate.
I don't like when we leave things to fate.
Neither do I.
Does that mean I'm gonna have the bed to myself tonight?
Probably.
Can't Doug man the fort?
Well, he could, but I'd just toss and turn.
If I'm not gonna sleep, I might as well not sleep here.
Well, I'll leave the ringer on.
Call me if you want company.
I will.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
You should go home.
I can take it from here.
Vigilance.
It's good for the soul.
10-59.
Corner of 16th and Q. 10-59.
What's that?
Disorderly conduct.
Do you believe in karma?
Absolutely not.
Well, I do.
At least tonight.
Get Captain Cardiff on the phone.
Let's do something about Meechum.
What?
Get him his job back.
He fired his weapon.
He overreacted.
Cardiff.
On the phone.
Now.
Nancy, give me Captain Cardiff, please.
We might as well do one productive thing while we wait.
It requires very little of me and will mean the world to him.
It's a very inexpensive investment.
Hello, sir.
This is Doug Stamper.
I have Francis Underwood for you.
I got him on.
Captain, I know it's late, but I'd like to talk to you about Edward Meechum.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Thank you.
- Are you hungry?
- Mm-hmm.
You have any trouble getting in?
Nah, they made me put it through the X-ray machine twice.
So I hope it didn't overcook it.
Frank, you always pay too much.
This is way too much.
For the inconvenience.
You know, 20 years you been coming to my joint.
This the first time I been to yours.
What do you think?
I could get used to it.
Well, you're welcome any time.
Thank you, Freddy.
Always, Frank.
Got a...
446 3rd Street...
That's a drive-by shooting.
Get details.
Sir, I want to thank you for talking to the captain.
He told me you called, and I can't tell you how grateful I am.
I want you to listen very closely to what I'm about to say.
From this moment on, you are a rock.
You absorb nothing, you say nothing, and nothing breaks you.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
Welcome back.
Steve?
I'll leave you be.
Where, uh- where's Janet?
She's been here every day for the last few weeks.
I told her go home, get some rest.
Well, is everything okay?
Your text said it was important.
I don't know how to put this.
The thing is, I...
I've been thinking.
A lot.
About my life.
About the things I haven't done.
Things I haven't said.
I hate your husband.
A lot of people do.
The past eight years, I watched over him.
But it wasn't him I was watching.
And every time I saw you, every time I heard your voice, all I could think to myself was,
"Jesus, what I wouldn't give."
I can't tell you how many times I thought about that.
You know what Francis said to me when he proposed?
I remember his exact words.
He said, "Claire, if all you want is happiness, say no.
I'm not gonna give you a couple of kids and count the days until retirement.
I promise you freedom from that.
I promise you'll never be bored."
You know, he was the only man- and there were a lot of others who proposed.
But he was the only one who understood me.
He didn't put me on some pedestal.
He knew that I didn't want to be adored or coddled.
So he took my hand and he put a ring on it.
Because he knew I'd say yes.
He's a man who knows how to take what he wants.
Is this what you wanted?
Is that the way you wanted it?
Stop.
Stop.
Please.
Please.
Stop.
Don't.
You told me your truth.
Now you know mine.
Hey, it's Peter.
I don't expect you to call me back, but I wanted to let you know I stopped drinking, and I went to my first AA meeting.
Um, I'm supposed to reach out and make amends to those I've hurt.
But I guess the real reason I called you is just to say I love you and I miss you.
I hope you're well.
This is work, not play.
Then why'd you bother coming over?
I was hoping you'd answer the door naked.
That would be play.
That would be work with a view.
Sorry to disappoint.
How many characters in a tweet?

Press "send."
Now give me a name, details.
Tyler Davis.
Third grader at Vernon Baker Elementary.
Shot outside his home in southeast just before noon today.
Sent.
Where are you going?
- To see the mother.
- You don't wanna...?
There's work to do.
I'll see you later tonight.
Tyler never did anything wrong.
He was a good boy.
Everybody loved him.
It's okay.
If Tyler's school had been in session, this senseless killing would have never taken place.
We need to end this strike now and get all our children back in school where they belong before we risk another death like this.
So, Mr. Spinella, I am headed to the capitol right now, and I will remain there until you are ready to meet and talk so that we can end this pointless strike.
Thank you all for coming.
Let's go back inside.
Mr. Spinella, one question...
Mr. Spinella is not to make a comment at this time.
No comment.
No comment.
Thank you.
Frank.
So?
You said you wanted to talk.
You said you wanted to work out a compromise.
I lied.
Excuse me?
I have no intention of working out a compromise.
So then why the fuck are we here, Frank?
What the hell's the matter with you?
You think this is some kind of a game?
No.
These are real people with families to feed.
Would you please stop that?
Stop what?
In five seconds, I'm out of here.
One.
Two.
Three.
- Four.
- Goodbye, Frank.
You know the difference between you and me, Marty?
What?
I'm a white-trash cracker from a white-trash town that no one would even bother to piss on.
But here's the difference-
I've made something of myself.
I have the keys to the capitol.
People respect me.
But you, you're still nothing.
You're just an uppity dago in an expensive suit turning tricks for the unions.
Nobody respects the unions anymore, Marty.
They're dying.
And no one respects you.
The most you'll ever make of yourself is blowing men like me.
Men with real power.
Yes.
I can smell the cock on your breath from here.
You think you can get under my skin?
I know I can.
Kiss my ass, Frank.
You can't afford to walk out.
Watch me.
I've got a dead, underprivileged kid in my pocket.
What do you have?
I have 2 million honorable teachers.
Fair enough.
But I got something even better.
Go ahead.
Open it.
Okay.
I'll play your game.
You're an idiot.
Stamper threw it.
You're full of shit.
Oh, no, Stamper threw the brick.
And I made sure Claire distracted my security.
Are you kidding me?
And to think you wanted me to apologize to my wife.
You would do something that low, Frank?
I arranged the brick, Marty, just like I arranged this meeting this afternoon.
Back off, Frank.
Why don't you just get down on your knees
- where you really belong?
- Back off, Frank.
Because the only thing you're gonna get from me
- is come on your-
- Fuck you!
Everything okay in there?
Ugh.
Look, I'll
- I'll tell them you provoked me.
I'll tell them that you threw the brick yourself.
And who's going to believe you?
You just assaulted a United States congressman, which is a felony.
But I'm not gonna press charges, Marty.
Because the strike ends now.
You think it'll leave a scar?
I have a thick skin.
The next time you ask me to invite someone in for coffee, will you please make sure no guns go off?
I'll do my best.
I saw Steve again today.
How is he?
In a lot of pain.
Should I go see him?
I don't think you need to.
Zoe Barnes.
When he dies, we'll pay for his funeral.
You don't need to take it?
No.
I'm done with work today.
Sync JustJohnDoe
We're almost a month into the strike, and we've got millions of kids stuck home from school.
Do you blame the White House or Congress?
I personally have very little sympathy for the teachers.
We're over three weeks into this strike.
It's costing the country billions of dollars, and instead of offering solutions...
There's a big difference between taking a stand and sitting on your hands.
I don't know whether to call it cowardice...
It's his agenda.
And the problem is that he stole sound, conservative ideas.
The only smart thing he's done is lift his platform from the Republican platform.
I admit it, Linda.
This got away from me.
But we can't turn back time.
We have to hold our ground.
While our approval ratings continue to nosedive?
Spinella and I worked together for years on dozens of labor-related bills.
I thought he'd be reasonable.
Well, you were wrong about that.
Well, I didn't think he'd be insane enough to go on strike, and I didn't think the strike would last this long.
So you've been wrong twice about this.
Why should I believe you're right about holding out?
We threatened collective bargaining in order to get performance standards and charter funding.
That's the deal that we made.
We took that stand.
We lay down now, we lose it all.
There'll be no reform, just an empty bill.
I understand the logic, Frank, but we're in damage control now.
But we can't close one wound by opening another.
But we're the Democrats.
We're the ones who are supposed to be defending the teachers.
But you can't have it both ways, Linda.
You can't have the reform you want and keep the teachers happy at the same time.
You knew that when we started.
Okay, then if we have to choose, we choose to keep the teachers happy.
That is a mistake, Linda.
We've already crossed the Rubicon.
I'm telling you this.
The President wants to change the bill.
We should've done it three weeks ago.
We didn't.
So you have to do it now.
Give me more time, Linda, please.
If I can break this strike and get everything we want in this bill, can we agree that's preferable to folding?
Of course.
If we can count on that...
Then count on me for just one more week.
If the strike isn't over by then, I'll change the bill.
Frank...
No.
One more week.
That's all.
This is the worst possible position to be in.
If I water down the bill, the President will still see me as a failure.
If the strike doesn't end in a week,
I've forced myself into a corner.
Only total victory will put me back in his good graces.
The alternative is exile, which would mean the last five months were for nothing.
I cannot abide falling back to square one.
Does the Congressman need me, ma'am?
No.
I just was wondering if you wanted a cup of coffee.
I just brewed a fresh pot.
I'm good, ma'am.
But thanks.
Are you sure?
My shift's done in a couple hours.
I'll be fine.
You know, come on.
Stretch your legs.
I won't take no for an answer.
What did you do before you joined the leadership detail?
I was a cop here in D.C.
Before that, I was in the Marines, ma'am.
Thank you.
Did you serve overseas?
I did, ma'am.
Bahrain, then Afghanistan.
Served most of my second tour in the Korengal Valley.
You wanna know if I killed anyone?
I think I know the answer.
I got a dinner meeting with Birch.
I'll be...
I invited him in for coffee.
Well, drink it fast.
We leave in five...
Get down!
Stay away from the windows!
Stop!
You'll have six of my best men covering you around the clock.
I guess I'm wondering why we didn't at least have one of your best men covering us now.
He'll be disciplined, sir.
He shot a gun in a residential neighborhood.
I want him fired.
There will be a full investigation, and we'll take the necessary action.
Steve never would've let this happen.
Is he better yet?
Because I would feel a lot safer if he was with us.
Unfortunately, he won't be coming back, sir.
I thought he just had a gallbladder infection.
He did, they found more.
His pancreas, stage four.
Jesus.
Oh, my God.
That's awful.
How much longer does he have?
Not long.
A few weeks.
At least that's what his wife told me.
We have to go see him.
Can you get the information where he is?
Of course.
I'll make sure you get it right away.
Thank you, Captain.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Good night.
Front door.
Yes, sir.
Your weapon.
Your badge, too.
Am I suspended, sir?
You had a suspect on foot, and you fire your gun?
Sir, I realize that...
Do you know how this reflects on me?
That one of our men could be so careless?
Not only do you abandon your post for coffee.
You could've killed a bystander.
That slug was found on somebody's front stoop.
What if it went in their house?
Your badge, Meechum.
Two reasons, which are really the same reason.
I was sick of working for other people, and I knew I could do a better job than my bosses.
They kept trying to suppress me, shutting me out.
So I said, "Fuck it.
I'll do it my way."
And then you just quit?
Not like you did.
I slaved away until I lined up the money to start Slugline.
Once Slugline gets big enough, what's the plan?
Are you gonna sell it like Arianna?
Probably.
And then who knows?
Whatever the next adventure is.
Maybe Shanghai.
So I shouldn't expect to have a job in two years?
Do you ever wanna have any job for more than two years?
What about you?
What's your big plan?
Uh, I don't know yet.
Come on.
Slugline is just a stepping stone for you.
You know what?
I should take this.
Go.
Do your thing.
Hey.
Do you have proof Spinella was behind it?
Put it in context.
Three weeks into a national teachers' strike...
At the home of Francis Underwood, who has led the charge on...
There you go.
Now post that before one of my neighbors calls a local 11:00 hack.
When do I see you next?
I'm background on this.
I'm not your source.
You can't talk now?
No.
When?
Soon, with bells on.
What about "more school books, less bricks"?
No, it's too broad.
We need a better sound bite.
Something specific, something that points the finger directly at Spinella.
He'll deny any involvement.
Well, of course he will.
So how do we get around that?
We say he can't control his troops.
There's no evidence it was a teacher.
Who else could it be?
Look, he's gonna shift blame for the strike back on Congress.
No.
We need something clear, something clean, something that sticks in your head.
"Teachers need a lesson in self-restraint."
No.
You're not hearing me.
People like teachers.
No.
We need something that makes Spinella the villain.
His lack of control, his inability...
Disorganized labor.
It's disorganized labor, plain and simple.
When you've got angry teachers throwing bricks through congressmen's windows, you've gotta blame the union leadership.
We'll be beefing up the security for the entire leadership.
And I strongly encourage Marty Spinella to keep his people in line.
This is starting to look like disorganized labor.
Do you really think Marty Spinella is to blame?
Whether Mr. Spinella is behind this or not, he might wanna tone down the rhetoric, before disorganized labor turns into organized crime.
No one can prove anything.
So that's the most cogent response.
Well, go on TV and say that.
You deplore violence in any form.
It's Congress that should take responsibility.
I don't want to degenerate to Frank's level.
We need to kill this brick thing.
It's distracting people from the issues.
She's right.
It'll eat up one cycle, and it'll disappear.
No.
This story is getting traction.
Support for the strike is dipping.
So is the President's approval ratings.
But he gets to stay in the Oval Office another three years, no matter what.
We can't afford another three weeks.
When I told the unions to strike,
I told them to prepare for the long haul.
All right?
Their accounts dry up, we keep going.
We figure it out.
I am not going to blink over something like this.
Fine.
But if we lose the public relations battle, none of that does us any good.
Frank wants us on the defensive.
I think this story is going to blow over.
If I'm wrong, we'll reevaluate.
But I wanna give it another day or two first.
Okay?
Hi, Adam.
You all right?
I saw the news.
Yes, I'm fine.
That's gotta rattle the nerves.
Brick coming through the window.
It did, some.
So are you staying in the house?
We've got extra security now, so...
Well, it made me think of you, so I figured I'd just check in.
I appreciate that.
We still haven't talked, have we?
There's no need to.
I think we should.
Here's how I see it.
You asked me to come down.
I did.
We both had ideas about what that could mean.
Probably very similar ideas.
But then you changed your mind.
So be it.
There's no reason we can't be in touch or remain friends.
Let's not fool ourselves, Adam.
So I won't call again.
Done.
I'm not saying that.
What are you saying?
I just called because I care about you.
No agenda.
If you wanna talk again, call me.
If not, I understand.
It's up to you.
You think I'm being unreasonable?
I think you're doing whatever it is you need to do, and I'm not gonna question it.
It was sweet of you to call.
Listen, you probably need to get back to work.
I know I do.
I should go.
Yeah.
Okay.
Take care.
Okay.
Frank, you got a minute?
I'll see you inside.
I wanna be governor, and I want your help.
Am I still on the short list?
You are.
I haven't had a drink in over a month.
I'm clean.
Is that because I asked, or because it's what you want?
It was about time I took responsibility for myself.
Taking responsibility is one thing, and it's admirable.
But running for governor of a major state is a whole nother ball game.
Let me tell you something, Frank.
I got elected to Congress 'cause I seized the moment that opportunity struck.
You kept me on that list.
I wanna seize that opportunity.
If you help me out, I'll give you everything I got.
Well, that's all I've been waiting to hear.
All right.
I'll tell you what.
I need to make some calls, check in with some people.
Give me a few days.
I'll get back to you.
Of course.
And, Peter...
I feel like I've met the real you for the first time just now.
Janet.
Is this a bad time?
No.
No, not at all.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were coming.
Here.
Take my chair.
Oh, no.
I'm fine.
I'll take these.
Thank you.
Hello, Steve.
Hey.
These could use some water.
I'll be right back.
Francis and I were so upset when we heard.
I'm sorry I haven't come sooner.
I didn't want too many people knowing.
Yes.
Francis wishes he could be here.
He wants you to know he's praying for you.
Couldn't make it, huh?
No, there's a big teachers' strike going on right now, and he's been stuck in his office for weeks.
I get it.
I saw the news.
The brick.
Right.
I told Francis that probably wouldn't have happened if you were there.
No.
Probably not.
I never seen him pray.
Not in eight years.
You said he was praying for me.
You've seen us in church.
Yeah, but I never went inside.
They're just gorgeous.
Mrs. Underwood, thank you so much.
Please, call me Claire.
I know you got things to do.
Of course.
If you need anything at all, call me.
You have my cell.
Anything at all.
And I'm sorry to have surprised you.
No.
It was so nice of you to come.
Thank you.
I know Steve appreciated it.
Check this out.
It's foam.
How many of these we have?
200.
But I can get more.
Get more.
Bring it on!
You need to give the teachers the respect they deserve.
We can't back away from this, Marty.
We've gotta face it head-on.
They provoked us.
They were throwing foam.
Our guys were throwing punches.
We're gonna come off the bad guys here.
Okay.
Okay.
I get it.
I get it.
But I wanna be smart about this.
I wanna do something definitive that'll put this to bed and get us back on message.
CNN.
One-on-one, you and Underwood.
8:00 tonight.
Frank is excellent in debates.
Go strong against him.
Address the brick right to his face.
End of story.
Underwood says he's in if you are.
Okay.
But I want as much prep as possible, okay?
I want to run questions.
You moderate, you play Underwood.
Wear this one.
Then come in here.
I wanna put powder on you.
Well, there's somebody at the studio can do that.
Yes, and they always cake on too much.
I'm doing it.
War paint.
How bloody do you think it'll be?
I think I oughta be able to dispatch with him easily enough.
You remember Peter Russo?
He's doing well.
He hasn't had a drink in a month.
Good for him.
I like him.
Good, because he could use your help.
How?
We're running him for governor.
Ambitious.
Mm.
We wanna create jobs in his district.
It's on the Delaware River.
I thought we might be able to put a bill together.
Something with an economic upside.
This has to do with the shipyard closing?
We need the shipbuilders' support for his campaign.
You think you might be able to draft a bill that he can sponsor?
I'm really trying to focus on international projects, Francis.
Not domestic legislation.
I understand, but I could really use your help, Claire.
Does Catherine Durant still owe us?
When you make someone Secretary of State, they owe you for life.
We're having trouble getting our water filters through Sudanese customs.
I'll call from the car.
Tomorrow's fine.
I would have done that anyway.
I know.
I'm ready for battle.
You wanna come watch?
No.
You go on ahead.
Come on.
Watch me put the final nail in Spinella's coffin.
It'll be fun.
Marty.
Frank.
Come on, people.
Take your marks.
Congressman, would you like to respond to that?
Yes, I would.
$2 billion of taxpayers' money being wasted.
And Congress should be ashamed of itself for that, Frank.
What?
Did Congress force the teachers to go on strike, Marty?
No, we didn't.
Really, Frank?
When you threaten teachers' ability to negotiate as a union, when you threaten their job security, you threaten their livelihood, of course you force them to strike.
And did we also force them to start throwing bricks at people's houses?
You know what, I'm really glad you brought that up, because you know there's absolutely no proof that that incident had anything to do with this strike.
And I wanna take the opportunity to say publicly that we categorically condemn any use of violence whatsoever, or intimidation.
What you're saying, essentially, is that you can't control your own people.
That's not what I'm saying.
That is what you're saying.
You're disorganized.
Disorganized labor.
You know what, you could keep trotting out that phrase all you like, but you know what I'd like to do, Frank?
I would like to get back to the issue here of educating our children and the fact that Congress is not living up to their commitment.
Well, you know what I would like?
What?
An apology.
If not to me, then to my wife.
When that brick came through our window, it was terrifying.
She's standing right over there.
Claire?
We need camera two on the wife.
Now, why don't you look her in the eye and tell her that your people had nothing to do with that brick.
Are you serious?
Yes.
Okay.
Mrs. Underwood, Claire,
I am sincerely sorry that you had to go through that ordeal, truly.
And it actually sickens me that someone made you feel unsafe in your own home.
And I give you my word that to the best of my knowledge, none of our people had anything to do with it.
But you know what sickens me more?
That right now, your husband is using you as a prop on national television to try and win a debate.
So I think you're the one that owes your wife an apology, Frank.
And when you're done apologizing, can we please get back to the issue here of educating our children?
No.
You've got this wrong, Marty.
There is no "you" and "I" in education.
Well, I mean, yes, there's the letters,
"U" and "I" are in the word education.
But education with a capital "E"...
You know what I'm talking about.
I don't think I do.
Yes, you do, Marty.
"U" and "I", education.
So, we're gonna waste the rest of this debate naming all the vowels in...
I'm happy to play the vowel game.
You wanna play the vowel game with me?
All right."U" think "I"
"O" "U"
"A" apology?
But no, no, no.
"U" "O" "I."
Interesting.
You left out "E" for "Education."
So let...
Defecation.
Edification.
I'm sorry.
LOL.
Uh...
You like Sesame Street so much?
Why don't you give the kids the money they deserve?
What I'm trying to say about education...
Well, I guess school's still in session.
I guess you schooled me there, Marty.
Let's move on.
Please.
Humor aside, there are more important issues out there.
I had no intention of bringing you into this.
It wasn't part of a plan.
I would've told you if it was.
I know.
The idea just struck me, and I went with it.
I don't mind that you improvised.
I just wish you'd done it better.
Congressman Frank Underwood says he got, quote, schooled by AFT spokesman and chief strategist, Martin Spinella, during a debate last night on this network.
In the past 24 hours, reruns of the gaffe have played nonstop on TV news programs and the Internet.
A YouTube clip set to techno music has logged more than 300,000 hits and spawned dozens of other spoofs.
♪ No, no, no
♪ "E" "O" "I"
♪ With a capital "E"
♪ Education LOL ♪
That was as clumsy as the Lee Harvey Oswald prison transfer.
What was he thinking?
Just give me one second.
There's a deli down the street.
Patti, thanks for coming.
Sit down.
You want some coffee?
No, thanks.
I'm good.
Hey, did you see Bill Maher last night?
No, I didn't.
It was about the CNN thing.
I have to admit, Frank, it was kind of funny.
Well, I'll have to catch a rerun.
How you doing?
You holding up all right with the strike?
Let's talk about Pennsylvania.
I have your candidate.
Peter Russo.
1st Congressional District.
We crossed him off.
I know.
It's a mistake.
He's young, he's handsome.
He's bright.
Nobody knows who he is outside of Philadelphia.
There's no donor base, no infrastructure.
You start me off with funding from the DNC and I'll raise an army around this guy.
I will personally oversee his campaign.
Is that the best we can do?
What's better than a blank slate in the right hands?
Ed, you need to go.
Congressman, do you have a moment?
Thank you, Patti.
Have him call me.
I will.
Ed?
Please.
What is going on?
I'm taking care of it.
One second, sir.
Please.
All right.
Make it fast, Meechum.
It's not easy for me to ask this, but I was wondering if you could put in a good word with my boss.
A good word?
They're going to discharge me, sir.
I messed up.
I'm fully aware.
But my job, it means everything to me, and I know a good word from you would...
Look, I have nothing against you personally, Meechum, but I can't get involved in these sort of affairs.
There's protocols and rules.
Sir, please, if you spoke to Cardiff...
There is nothing that I can do.
If anyone could convince the Captain, it would be you, Congressman.
I'm sorry.
I wish you all the best, Meechum.
Doug.
What did Barney Hull say?
That we'd be the first to know.
I can't believe there hasn't been a single 911 call.
There's been plenty.
It's just not the sort we're after.
We got that kid in Atlanta.
No, it's got to be here.
I can't be getting on a plane.
It looks too opportunistic.
Maybe if we open it up a little bit?
No, we cannot lower our standards.
We just have to be patient.
New rule.
Now that the debate's over,
Frank Underwood has to tell us what the hell that was.
Seriously, Congressman, was that a joke?
I haven't seen something just lay there like that since...
I gotta go all the way back to my prom night.
Can we just settle this strike please?
Teachers have been out of the classroom for so long, middle-schoolers are starting to have sex with each other.
Enough.
I don't know why you had it on in the first place.
I love you, Francis.
I know.
We should say that more often to each other.
I need to clear my head.
...north and east of the airport.
I'm gonna need that in time for that meeting.
Peter, let's talk.
So.
I've spoken to Patricia Whittaker.
She's on board.
You'll be getting $4 million in start-up funding from the DNC.
I'll pick the team.
You announce in August.
But the campaign starts today.
Are you ready?
I've already put together a platform.
It's mostly broad strokes, but we can hone it.
Good.
The first thing we need to address is your sobriety.
You don't need to worry about that.
Have you been going to meetings?
You mean AA?
Yes.
That's not really my thing.
If you want my help, then going to meetings is my one requirement.
I know I had a problem, Frank.
I accept that.
And I've taken responsibility for that, but I don't think going to meetings is necessary.
You cannot white-knuckle your recovery, Peter.
This campaign will be the hardest thing you've ever done in your life.
I realize that.
I'm prepared for that.
You think you are.
But we can't take any chances.
The party's investing in you.
I need to make sure you're investing in yourself.
All right.
I'll do whatever I have to do.
Good.
You'll start tomorrow morning.
Doug will take you.
Stamper?
He's been sober 14 years.
Doug has a drinking problem?
Had.
Not anymore.
He'll be your sponsor.
In the meantime, I want you to meet with my wife, Claire.
She runs the Clean Water Initiative.
She's expecting you, so clear your schedule and head over there now.
Frank.
Thank you.
For believing in me.
You're gonna make a great candidate, Peter.
The shipyard closing frees up 1,100 acres of federal land.
Our goal is to pass a Watershed Act for the Delaware River.
We develop the land in an environmentally responsible way, creating jobs in the process.
How many jobs?
Thousands.
We're aiming for the $200 million mark.
We got a lot of work to do.
We do, but you can start with the congressmen whose districts fall within the watershed.
Do you have a draft of the bill you can show me?
We haven't sponsored any environmental legislation.
We'll draft it in consultation with your staff.
Gillian will be the point person on our end.
I don't have any legislation experience.
I'll help you.
When do we start?
We just did.
Will you introduce him to the research team?
I'll be there in one second.
Sure.
Mr. President?
I want it over.
As soon as possible.
Gut the bill, Frank.
Do whatever's necessary to end this.
Mr. President, if we give in now, the public won't credit you with a victory.
Not even a hollow one.
They'll chalk it up as a colossal defeat.
Well, that's on you, Frank.
You let this situation devolve to where it is.
I've already been blamed for the largest teachers' strike in U.S. history.
I won't be held accountable for it dragging on months and months.
Mr. President, we have to end this strike on your terms.
Not anyone else's.
How?
By debating Marty Spinella on CNN?
Sir, you have placed your faith in me thus far.
I would ask that you continue to do so.
Well, whatever you're doing, Frank, isn't working, so I'm stepping in.
Gut the bill.
Like Linda said.
No.
I'm sorry, Mr. President, but I will not do that.
Are you letting pride cloud your judgment, Frank?
Respectfully, sir, you're allowing fear to cloud yours.
Not an easy thing, to say no to the most powerful man in the free world.
But sometimes the only way to gain your superior's respect is to defy him.
What do we have on the schedule, Linda?
Your meeting with the Fed Oversight Committee.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Do you have my briefing?
Right here.
Good.
Let's look it over.
Hi.
How'd it go with Peter?
It went well.
Is he game?
Completely.
Thank you.
That's a big weight off my shoulders.
You sound tired.
Tired.
Impatient.
What can I do?
Nothing.
This one's up to fate.
I don't like when we leave things to fate.
Neither do I.
Does that mean I'm gonna have the bed to myself tonight?
Probably.
Can't Doug man the fort?
Well, he could, but I'd just toss and turn.
If I'm not gonna sleep, I might as well not sleep here.
Well, I'll leave the ringer on.
Call me if you want company.
I will.
Good night.
Good night.
You should go home.
I could take it from here.
Vigilance.
It's good for the soul.
10-59.
Corner of 16th and Q. 10-59.
What's that?
Disorderly conduct.
Do you believe in karma?
Absolutely not.
Well, I do.
At least tonight.
Get Captain Cardiff on the phone.
Let's do something about Meechum.
What?
Get him his job back.
He fired his weapon.
He overreacted.
Cardiff.
On the phone.
Now.
Nancy, give me Captain Cardiff, please.
We might as well do one productive thing while we wait.
It requires very little of me and will mean the world to him.
It's a very inexpensive investment.
Hello, sir.
This is Doug Stamper.
I have Francis Underwood for you.
I got him on.
Captain, I know it's late, but I'd like to talk to you about Edward Meechum.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Are you hungry?
Mm-hmm.
You have any trouble getting in?
No, they made me put it through the X-ray machine twice, so I hope it didn't overcook it.
Frank, you always pay too much.
This is way too much.
It's for the inconvenience.
You know, 20 years you been coming to my joint.
This is the first time I've been to yours.
What do you think?
I could get used to it.
Well, you're welcome any time.
Thank you, Freddy.
Always, Frank.
We got a 27 Delta two. 446 3rd Street...
That's a drive-by shooting.
Get details.
Sir, I want to thank you for talking to the Captain.
He told me you called, and I can't tell you how grateful I am.
I want you to listen very closely to what I'm about to say.
From this moment on, you are a rock.
You absorb nothing, you say nothing, and nothing breaks you.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
Welcome back.
Steve?
I'll leave you be.
Where...
Where's Janet?
She's been here every day for the last few weeks.
I told her, go home, get some rest.
Well, is everything okay?
Your text said it was important.
I don't know how to put this.
The thing is, I...
I've been thinking.
A lot.
About my life.
About the things I haven't done.
Things I haven't said.
I hate your husband.
A lot of people do.
The past eight years, I watched over him.
But it wasn't him I was watching.
And every time I saw you, every time I heard your voice, all I could think to myself was,
"Jesus, what I wouldn't give."
I can't tell you how many times I thought about that.
You know what Francis said to me when he proposed?
I remember his exact words.
He said, "Claire, if all you want is happiness,
"say no.
"I'm not gonna give you a couple of kids
"and count the days until retirement.
"I promise you freedom from that.
"I promise you'll never be bored."
You know, he was the only man, and there were a lot of others who proposed.
But he was the only one who understood me.
He didn't put me on some pedestal.
He knew that I didn't want to be adored or coddled.
So he took my hand and he put a ring on it.
Because he knew I'd say yes.
He's a man who knows how to take what he wants.
Is this what you wanted?
Is that the way you wanted it?
Stop.
Stop.
Please.
Please.
Stop.
Don't.
You told me your truth.
Now you know mine.
Hey, it's Peter.
I don't expect you to call me back, but I wanted to let you know I stopped drinking last night, and I went to my first AA meeting this morning.
I'm supposed to reach out and make amends to those I've hurt.
But I guess the real reason I called you is just to say I love you and I miss you.
I hope you're well.
This is work, not play.
Then why'd you bother coming over?
I was hoping you'd answer the door naked.
That would be play.
That would be work with a view.
Sorry to disappoint.
How many characters in a tweet?
140.
Type this, let me know where you land.
Eight-year-old Washington D.C. boy killed by a stray bullet in gangland shoot-out.
61 characters left.
He should have been in school?
30 left.
Spinella to blame.
Question mark.
128.
Press send.
Now give me a name, details.
Tyler Davis.
Third-grader at Vernon Baker Elementary.
Shot outside his home in Southeast just before noon today.
Sent.
Where are you going?
To see the mother.
You don't wanna...
There's work to do.
I'll see you later tonight.
Tyler never did anything wrong.
He was a good boy.
Everybody loved him.
It's okay.
If Tyler's school had been in session, this senseless killing would have never taken place.
We need to end this strike now and get all our children back in school where they belong, before we risk another death like this.
So, Mr. Spinella, I am headed to the Capitol right now, and I will remain there until you are ready to meet and talk so that we can end this pointless strike.
Thank you all for coming.
Let's go back inside.
Mr. Spinella, one question.
Mr. Spinella is not gonna make comments at this time.
No comment.
No comment.
Thank you.
Frank.
So?
You said you wanted to talk.
You said you wanted to work out a compromise.
I lied.
Excuse me?
I have no intention of working out a compromise.
So then why the fuck are we here, Frank?
What the hell's the matter with you?
You think this is some kind of a game?
No.
These are real people with families to feed.
Would you please stop that?
Stop what?
In five seconds, I'm out of here.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Goodbye, Frank.
You know the difference between you and me, Marty?
What?
I'm a white-trash cracker from a white-trash town that no one would even bother to piss on.
But here's the difference.
I've made something of myself.
I have the keys to the Capitol.
People respect me.
But you, you're still nothing.
You're just an uppity dago in an expensive suit turning tricks for the unions.
Nobody respects the unions anymore, Marty.
They're dying.
And no one respects you.
The most you'll ever make of yourself is blowing men like me.
Men with real power.
Yes.
I can smell the cock on your breath from here.
You think you can get under my skin?
I know I can.
Yeah.
Kiss my ass, Frank.
You can't afford to walk out.
Watch me.
I've got a dead, underprivileged kid in my pocket.
What do you have?
I have two million honorable teachers.
Fair enough.
But I got something even better.
Go ahead.
Open it.
Okay.
I'll play your game.
You're an idiot.
Stamper threw it.
You're full of shit.
Oh no, Stamper threw the brick.
And I made sure Claire distracted my security.
Are you kidding me?
And to think you wanted me to apologize to my wife.
You would do something that low, Frank?
I arranged the brick, Marty, just like I arranged this meeting this afternoon.
Back off, Frank.
Why don't you just get down on your knees where you really belong?
Back off, Frank.
Because the only thing you're gonna get from me is cum on your...
Fuck you!
Everything okay in there, sir?
Look, I'll tell them you provoked me.
I'll tell them that you threw the brick yourself.
And who's going to believe you?
You just assaulted a United States Congressman, which is a felony.
But I'm not gonna press charges, Marty.
Because the strike ends now.
You think it'll leave a scar?
I have a thick skin.
The next time you ask me to invite someone in for coffee, will you please make sure no guns go off?
I'll do my best.
I saw Steve again today.
How is he?
In a lot of pain.
Should I go see him?
I don't think you need to.
Zoe Barnes.
When he dies, we'll pay for his funeral.
You don't need to take it?
No.
I'm done with work today.
Goa was the homeland of Konkanis, who belonged to...
Brahmin community and businessmen by profession ln 15th century their foundation was shaken when... when the Portuguese took over Goa
Devanagiri was forbidden and Roman script imposed
And with forced religious conversions the Portuguese turned the peaceful lives of Konkanis into hell
Konkanis soon left their hometown and started moving out to settle down in other states
Most of them migrated to the Deccan
To areas like Mangalapuram and Malabar
The Kozhikode King refused them shelter, but Keshava Rama Varma, King of Kochi welcomed them
With their own efforts they rose in fields of trade, commerce and medicine
With a stamp of their own personality they occupied high posts and received recognition
Out of the 5 major sections amongst Konkanis the 1st was the Gowda Saraswada Brahmin
To which belonged the Kamaths who have their roots entwined with Malayalam, and is the subject of this narration
A silk saree for my wife She likes rich red color
An off-white silk veshti and shirt for my older son
Knee length knickers and a shirt for my younger son
Looks like you got your bonus money Kamath?
!
My boss gave me enough After all it's Deepavali festival
Today is Deepavali
Brother, he will buy us crackers and sparklers, won't he?
Don't expect too much
Hey!
Thief!
Thief!
We could save his life only because he was brought here on time
- We are very grateful
- Your gratitude must be expressed to him
What is your name?
Gopi, I saw Muthu snatch your dad's bag and run lf you buy me 'Puttu' and beef curry I will show you who he is
We are Kamath's sons Gives us back our dad's bag
Get lost!
What will you do if I don't?
Bash me up?
Kamaths were not born to beat, is what our dad taught us
But if you insist on being beaten up...
Hey Gopi!
2 cups of strong tea 2 'puttus' and beef curry for our Gopi
Come ls Kamath in?
Look, your credit at my provision shop has crossed limits I need a payment immediately I will pay you Please give me some time
Even if I gave you time how will you earn?
Without your legs whatjob can you go for?
I want my money immediately
We will return your money in a week's time
You?
!
We are starting a business
Wonderful!
The little Kamaths' dosa(pancake) tastes great
Very smart boys What is the name of your shop?
Kamath and Kamath Proprietors Kamath and Kamath
Biriyani Street Est 1587 Biriyani Paradise
5 biriyani parcels are ready
- Sir...bill - l did not ask forthe bill
The bill is the only item given here without asking
Do you know who I am?
No, may be someone out there might know, but accept the bill first
He is the Counsilor of this ward Sebastian Kuzhiveli
Shortly will become Municipal Chairman
He's a new recruit, excuse him
What a fantastic biriyani Sahib, the biriyani here is unbeatable
Tell me, is the mutton used in this belong to meat of buffalo or ox?
To the elephant!
Kuzhiveli, the secret of our biriyani is the tender meat of goat less than 6 months old
Along with it the Lords mercy too
Each time biriyani is cooked there are butterflies in my stomach I just close my eyes and call out Almighty my Lord'!
A small error and my business is finished forever isn't it?
Look at that hotel What a flourishing place it was!
A bit of carelessness Served old food, resulted in poisoning
Municipality ordered it to be shut down and applied seal on it, isn't it?
Yes indeed!
Don't forget the past, dear Sahib Do you remember my efforts to get it sealed?
I have bought you a brand new Maruthi car in return, don't forget that
Where is your car?
Its parked almost a kilometer away You don't have parking facility here, right?
Now-a-days parking facility is a must
That Thirumeni's place will accommodate 30 vehicles lt's really a pity you are unable to buy so far
That Thirumeni refuses to part with it I have asked a hundred times But he doesn't budge
He will come around one day I had a specific motive when I lent him Rs 10 lakhs for his daughter's wedding I consider it as an amount paid in advance forthis property
Thirumeni's younger daughter's wedding is also fixed
How can he bear the expenses without selling this property?
Why don't you go try to clinch a deal for me?
In place of your Maruthi, I'll see that a Benz stands
Benz car!
- Namasthey!
- What brings you here, Kuzhiveli?
Well, there's a wedding in your house As counsilor, I thought I'll just enquire
Why?
Has the government arranged to give financial assistance for weddings?
If you only make up your mind is it so difficult to raise funds?
What I am trying to say is...
Don't bother, I understand what you are getting at its true that circumstances forced me to shut down my hotel
But I will not give it up to followers of another religion to cook his meat I will not have fish and meat anywhere in the vicinity of my place
The temple pond you have your daily dip Doesn't it have fish in it?
Yes of course
You can use water from ponds and rivers with live fish and use milk from cows which is a part of theirflesh and blood
But that does not affect your sense of sanctity and cleanliness, right?
- Hey Nair?
- Yes sir?
.
- Throw this dirty fellow out
- Not necessary, I will go
But remember, don't cross swords with Sulaiman Sahib
He has helped you with Rs 10 lakhs for your elder daughter's wedding
You did not think touching his money was sacrilege then
He has not asked you to return that money because he intends to own your property one day
I am going now
But I will see you if your daughter gets married even if I am not invited!
Did you hear his underlying threat, Nair?
My daughter's marriage won't take place it seems
The whole town knows I don't have money
Lord!
What more should I hear!
Frankly, what does it matter who buys the place?
Isn't it enough if you get a good price?
Have you also forgotten the idol of baby Ganapathy there?
I have performed puja to that idol ever since I can remember
Just a clean-up and a lamp lit HE will bless me whole heartedly
What will an alien religion do with Lord Ganapathy?
Dad, come here
What is it my dear?
Dad, Devan sir's e-mail has come
- ls it?
- What?
Mail, now-a-days this is what takes the place of letter writing
Haven't I told you about a Kamath who was her senior in college?
Oh!
Kamath
What was his reply my dear?
I had written in detail about our situation
He said he'll come and meet us directly
Lord Vighneshwara!
You have saved us
Today, in whole of Kerala, they own big hotels
This Kamath and his brother Kamath
Proprietors Kamath and Kamath lf they take over our hotel we are saved
Who are you?
What do you want?
Sulaiman Sahib sent us here
He has asked you to sign this agreement
What is it?
Appears to be in English
Give it to me father Let me read it
This is a lease agreement for our hotel and land lt shows an advance received for Rs 10 lakhs lt is true that I owe Sahib Rs 10 lakhs
But I don't understand this agreement ls it right to accept money and not sign an agreement?
If you don't sign we may have to use force
Well, I'd like to see you do that!
- Then come here!
- No!
Don't!
Lord Venkatpathy!
What are 'we' seeing here?
A thrashing session!
?
All that is of no use We can always talk things over
Who are you?
We?
I am 'we' Don't you understand?
Didn't 'we' just arrive by car now?
'We' means, son of Krishnarajakudi Kamath Devaraja Kamath
Now you?
, Tell me what is the issue?
- We are Sulaiman Sahib's men - ls that the issue?
No!
Don't botherto explain I have understood the situation lt's a problem of Rs 10 lakhs right?
'We' will pay you that money
Murthy?
Fold that umbrella, Murthy!
Useless!
How long since you borrowed this money?
About a year and half
Let them calculate rate of interest for 2 years
That makes it Rs 1209999.85
Murthy we round it up to 1210000 You get 15 paisa more
We spend so much on trivialities Let them go eat it
Murthy!
Don't shake, the table is wobbling Without shaking!
You can go give this to Sahib
We came to get the agreement signed You better do what we ask, Thirumeni
Thirumeni will not do it
- You don't interfere
- Of course I will I will interfere even more
Beat and drive him away The stinker!
Not stinker, its Kamath DevarajaKamath
Don't beat me
We Kamaths are fond of peace
Have no history of wars and follow non violence
But if all of you insist on a thrashing...
Murthy?
!
If I just press this, your heads will break and you will die
You will die but I won't go to jail I have money and power
You can decide whether you want your life or the agreement
We want our lives Only our lives!
With the cash
Murthy please take their names address and photo lf we ever have a problem never call them!
-All are cowards!
- Run for it!
Thirumeni, were you scared?
This does not have bullets
All the bullets are with my brother Kamath
He refuses to give them to me
But he has only the bullets No gun
The gun is with me right?
Only a bullet will allow the gun to fire, right?
In short we never fire guns!
Karthiyayini, give him some buttermilk to drink I want nothing I just want to see that place the property
My dear go with him
BlRlYANl STREET
Once we open our shop within 3 months, this name will go lt will become Kamath Kamath Street
That's the usual blessing
Sree Krishna Vilasam East facing...very auspicious
Lord Ganapathy is the God installed, right?
is that guy who is peeping out of that counter, the Sahib?
Yes
Nice fair and an enemy like a beautiful pudding
Come sir, don't you want to see inside of the shop?
Sure let's go
Why are you staring like this?
- Your wedding has really been fixed right?
- Yes, but why?
I feel quite sad
You were once like a broomstick
Now grown big, you look like a lovely witch lf l had known this I would have declared my love for you and blocked you for myself
Now it's of no use
-Anyways I like you very much
- What?
Not you!
It has gone out of my hands
This property, good that you thought of us when you decided to sell it
We'll take over this place happily
That Kamath has given you the works
How can his dosa and sambhar compete with our biriyani?
It can't happen
What are you saying Sahib?
This is their 33rd hotel
Wherever they start one, there is a queue like in beverages shops I myself fell for it once I stood in the queue and found it was Kamaths hotel
Kuzhiveli, I can't tolerate another hotel in front of ours
Kamaths must not open their hotel
Tell me a way to sabotage it like you did for Thirumeni's hotel
The municipal secretary is not the same Now it's a lady, Mahalakshmi
- You may have to shell out some money
-Allah!
Does that lady accept bribe?
She will not, but I will lt will be difficult to subdue her
She's a man-hater
People say she's frustrated because she's spinster even now
Municipal office
Secretary
The guy who is sitting there is Kamath, a womanizer
Don't talk, if you do, even a secretary like you, will fall for him
The municipal secretary has come
He will try to persuade you But don't give in
Greetings, I am Kamath
Devaraja Kamath, partner of Kamath Kamath Hotels
Should we stand on our heads for that?
- You can stand
- Sure I will
Madam, its 3 days since I have been climbing up...climbing down like this to meet you
But it appears you were on leave
When I heard Secretary was a woman I thought she'd be in her early 50s
But so young!
Excuse me?
Which college are you studying in, is what any one will ask
-Are you married?
- What if I am?
- What does your husband do?
- What should he do?
Children?
Children without getting married?
Madam he is insulting you
Oh Lord Venkatpathy Aren't you married?
I too am not Same pinch
He's mad!
You go inside madam
- Hey wait!
- What is your problem?
What about the license for our hotel?
Have you taken prior appointment?
No!
- Then you will have to wait
- But I was waiting all of morning
- Was I not right?
-About what?
That he's a womanizer?
He has an older brother, Rajaraja Kamath
Rumors say he kicked his wife to her death
So never issue them the license
Do we issue licenses based on conduct certificate?
4-5 years back the Health dept and Food corp shut down and sealed the old hotel Sree Krishna Vilas
Now they have changed the name to Kamath Kamath and applied for license
The case is still pending Madam, don't get into trouble
He is trying to get a license without your knowledge from the Council
Can you take a step without the council's approval?
You can't
So you have to bring it to their notice
Let me look at that file
- Madam, it will soon be lunch break
- Who asked you to come in here?
Don't spit into my eyes I don't have time to spare Monday is the hotel inauguration lnauguration without a license lsn't that why an application was given?
Yourfile needs thorough scrutiny You can go and return next week
Please don't say that We can't change the inaugural day
Who asked you to fix the day without your license permitted?
My older brother Rajaraja Kamath Madam, you would not know him
He looks like our mega star Mammootty
And just like him he is very short-tempered lf he loves he is a Royal gem lf you cross him he's the king of thugs
The rest of it I am not willing to say I have no orders to issue the license
You may please leave now
So you will not issue us the license eh?
No!
Just a minute, okay?
- Hey!
Don't shoot
- This is a phone
Annu(brother) they are not issuing the license
This is not Malayalam lt is Urdu
He says shall he try hooking you Don't mind all that
- Okay Annu(brother)
- Like a karate class!
That was my brother
He said ask that arrogant secretary to go climb the wall!
He said just one snap of his fingers and the municipal chairman will come to the hotel premises and issue the license
Do you know who are talking to?
- l told brother about you also
-And what did he say?
He asked me not to deal with you, lt was an order
- He said to keep you aside
- Why?
So that he'll have the pleasure of thrashing you all by himself
Thrashing me!
So the day has been fixed for Monday And the 1st invite is for you madam
You have to come, participate and bless us
We are specially not inviting you at all
- Don't come
- No, I wont!
Did you see him madam?
His arrogance I want to see how he will inaugurate this hotel without a license
Kamaths are inaugurating it challenging municipality orders
But Municipal secretary is very stubborn
Although a woman, she appears to be fiery The police will stop this event
Did you see that board?
One Kamath is green and the other is red
The red one is dangerous
They must be having something up their sleeve
On the day of inauguration if the older Kamath does not arrive we can be sure it won't take place I will see to it he does not step into this Palakkad district
Kamath will be punched and broken into bits and admitted in hospital by my smart boys, Sahib
Let him come This Rajaraja Kamath!
- ls Rajaraja Kamath inside the vehicle
- What if he is?
-Ask him to come out!
- Why must he, I wonder?
.!
To give him some of our affection
Oh is it?
It's been ages since the body had some exercise I'll call him right away
Boss!
Okay, so who are all of you?
I have no clue
Lord!
What's this an array of knives?
You have come to thrash us, right?
Yes
So we have enemies in Palakkad
You have come to beat us but we generally don't beat up thugs
For that we feed meat of goat ox, fowl, tiger etc and maintain a buffalo
Do you want to know who he is?
- Who?

For accepting our invite my brother and I extend a hearty welcome to the Municipal Secretary, Chairman and all policemen Inspector!
You can't open a hotel without a Municipal license

No my dear policemen You can accuse us of breaking law only if we cook and sell food
We have not done that So under which section are we charged?
Tell me policemen Hey!
Ask him to explain
Don't teach policemen law and sections
This hotel which was under municipal seal was reopened so, Thirumeni has to be arrested first

That is our municipal secretary's house Arrogant woman!
Let her suffer
Suppose something happens?

Who are you?
Don't run!
Hey thief!

You supply liquor on a dry day, right?
Constable!

Oh Lord Venkatpathy!
We have not served this lt was brought from outside
No sir, we bought this here And paid double the price for it!
How dare you lie, you drunkards!
Come with us!
Sir, this is cheating!
You need not snarl here Convince the court you were not
Sir we got all this from here
Oh so you have a wholesale business going on, eh?
What is all this?
Policemen!
We have not sold liquor here
We are arresting the junior Kamath for illegal sale of liquor, now go
Sir, don't push!
What's the charge against this chap?
Attacked the municipal secretary's house Accomplice is thief Pathrose
This is great!
Tomorrow the papers can carry this juicy news
Let the Kamath pair be locked up here
Rajashekhar, pick one out of the 'evidences' and place it inside lf l have to deal with the Kamaths I have to have drink a couple of pegs
Hey you!
If either of my boss is touched I'll kill you and your entire family
To me earth is home and sky the roof Whether I am outside or in central jail lt was around 10 at night my house was attacked
Thief Pathrose has given a statement in support
The fact that illegal sale of liquor occurred in my ward makes me feel ashamed
As president of Hotels association What do you have to say?
This is a matter of shame for all of us
Our Association has decided that the other Kamath hotels too have to be shut down, right?
What is the charge against the Kamaths?
Sir, this is the charge sheet
- Kamath?
- Greetings
Send them to my room
Our greetings
What's all this guys?
I can't stand by you in such cases
Sir, please don't say that
We Kamaths are Gowda Saraswath Brahmins
We neither utter lies nor sell liquor
This is a trap
We don't go peeing over walls Someone laid a trap and we fell in it
That may be true But evidences are against you
The thief Pathrose is very adamant in his statement
He is a cunning thief
You just have to roll your eyes and he'll come out with the truth
Just give him the works sir He'll tell the truth
Go!
-Aren't you a true Christian?
- No, I am thief Pathrose lf you don't tell me the truth you'll go to hell
Tell me honestly, who threw the stone at the secretary's house?
- This Kamath, sir
- Did you hear that?
Oh God Venkatpathy!
Aren't you a Dy SP?
is this how you interrogate robbers?
They will never own up like this There are other means for this lt's better you tell the truth
Otherwise your brain will scatter
Don't wait, just do it Look at him and his bald head!
If I shoot, you'll have to walk about without a head
Hey stop it I'll lose my job
Stop it!
Don't beat me I'll tell you everything
This fellow is more scared of punches than a gun shot
- l'll flog you death
- No!
I'll tell you the whole truth
Sir, give me your phone
Oh you are going to shoot, eh?
Let me spruce up myself
Who sent you here?
Just blurt it out like a parrot, it will be great
- Sulaiman sahib paid money and he..
- What is all this?
- You asked me to say it like a parrot
- Oh Lord Venkatpathi
- Who threw the stone?
- Okay I'll tell everything
To help Sulaiman Sahib Councilor Kuzhiveli sir paid me I was asked to hang around and wait till the police came
And when the police get me to say Kamaths name I waited near the secretary's house for 3-4 days to get the attention of Kamath sir, I swear
- He is a sensible thief
- Continue i say!
I will fight forjustice against this atrocity in a house where only women lived
Sorry, madam The case has taken a new angle
This is thief Pathrose stating the truth lt was I who threw the stone I did it
For Sulaiman sir Councillor Kuzhiveli sir paid me
He asked me to wait there and tell Kamaths name when questioned
Now do you realize who threw the stone?
Honorable Councillor and Sulaiman sir Please come forward
We have something to show you
Gopi!
Bring it here
These are scenes of CCTV cameras of our hotel that record events 24 hours
Show it to them lsn't this proof?
.
This is from the camera outside There are cameras inside also
Gopi!
Wait
Don't, they will be taken care of by the policemen I have reserved some for you also
Secretary madam, I have something to tell you I have no enmity towards you lf l did, I'd have clapped happily when he threw the stone lt was my mother who asked me to help you
When the police took us away There were tears in her eyes
You are answerable to those tears Not to me, but to God
You can go madam
Sulaiman sahib, what harm did we do to you?
We have only dosa, idly and sambhar in our menu
But you Muslims you have a variety of food
Biriyani, ghee rice, Pathiri, mutton curry and so many more
No other community can claim them
People of other communities crowd into Islam hotels that are run honestly
They do come willingly and you know it very well
Let people who eat biriyani for 10 days eat dosa for one day, just for a change
Sahib, your Thalassery biriyani will not match our dosa, isn't it?
Moreover, Thirumeni refused to sell that property to you not out of enmity but the presence of the idol of Lord Ganapathy
He believes other religions will not give it due respect, so he preferred selling it to us lsn't that correct?
He's a simple man lf you had asked us space to park vehicles for your customers we would have given it
But did you ask?
No
Even after harassing us we are still ready to offer our place for your customers to park their vehicles
Let people then decide whether they want to eat biriyani or dosa
Your ancestors once gave us refuge in this land
We only have one request Don't hate us l forgot to mention this We'll be gone from here for 2 days
Forthe inauguration of our new hotel at Coimbatore
Please see our hotel does not run into troubles ln the name of Almighty don't talk like this I realize my mistake

You must have eaten at home before you started yourjourney, right?
No lf you don't mind, let's stop and eat at some hotel lf you do mind, you can stay hungry I shall go and appease my hunger
So you don't mind, eh?
Okay!

- Now?
- Now she's not
Why did you part?
The Lord did not give me enough patience and endurance
We had to break up so we parted That's all
What are you staring for?
You are talking about the divorce so casually
That's a long story lt was with great difficulty we became prosperous
We lived a very simple life
We were very happy and loved each other very much
Radhika, that is my wife's name Her parents are in London
She was educated there and that's why she could not get along with our way of life
My mother loved her a lot
My dear, we don't wear such clothes in ourfamily I will decide what I wear Nobody need interfere
- My dear!
- Get lost you old hag!
Nuisance
No one told me anything Because they didn't want to upset me
One day we were returning after a business trip from Kozhikode
Dad suffered a chest pain
Sumanthi!
What happened to you?
My dear, the boys' father is suffering from chest pain
We have to take him to the hospital right now
Please take the car out
Can't you see I have applied 'mehendi'?
Call a taxi from outside
That will take a long time, dear Just wash your hands and come
That will take a long time, dear Just wash your hands and come
Don't harass me Go away
By the time a taxi came and took him to hospital, everything was over
You were responsible for our father's death I am not a servant in your house or a driver
And I'm not nurse maid to your parents lt would have been very convenient if that old hag had died too
I gave her a good slap And she broke the sacred wedding chain I have not felt any regret or loss after that
- Sorry
- For what?
It's high time they reached
May be they have decided to halt over at a hotel
Hey!
My boss will not even look at a girl
-Anyway I will not sleep here alone
- What else can you do?
Oh look!
They have reached
- Okay goodnight
- Goodnight
Why do you prepare so many dishes?
A few ldlys sambhar and a chutney isn't that more than enough?
Who prepared this?
Definitely not you, mother
Mother will never make such tasteless food
This tea is totally unpalatable, no taste at all
Maybe Gopi has made all this Gopi?
!
I only know to eat not to cook
But I'll tell you for sure, this food has come from the enemy's camp
Enemy's camp?
What are you saying?
Have you gone nuts?
I'll eat at our hotel
Don't say anything more Food was made by girls next door
Who?
Mahalakshmi?
Don't eat it if you didn't like it
- Who says I didn't like it
- But you said so just now I often say such things to tease mother I try to make mother laugh now and then
Yes true!
Boss told me ajoke and I laughed for 2 weeks and 1 more week remains
Ass-monkey!
Go out
Mom has never allowed me into the kitchen
So I am a little backward in cooking
But not backward in talking!
No one can beat you brothers in that
Ass-monkey!
Are you still here?
Vagabond!
Tell me when you are free I'll teach you to cook, it will be great fun
Okay, treat it as ajoke
Both of you sit and talk I must leave, okay?
She wants to talk to you
What is the matter?
She is asking for some help
What help do you want, tell me
Can you come with me to Coimbatore?
-As a bodyguard, eh?
- Not at all
My sister has a problem and we need a man to solve it
We don't have many relatives who would be able to help
Don't come if it's a problem for you
I'll come
The house is good ls it your own place?
No, it's for rent Come in
She's my mother, Maheshwari
Greetings, mother!
-And she is...

You did not introduce me I am Rajaraja Kamath
- You look very familiar
- You will!
I am very famous People have a very good opinion about me

When your sister comes don't tell her I prepared all these
Tell her you made them You can take the credit
- Look, Rekha has come - l will stand away
It's very tasty, right?
To tell you the truth lt was I who made all of it
Do you recognize me?
I am Rajaraja Kamath
She will not recognize you like that
He is the person your sister said was SP Kamath
Who is SP Kamath?
Don't you know?
People call you SP Kamath
Self Praising Kamath
Oh!
If no one talks about me I will do it myself, what's wrong in that?
Even if you call me SP Kamath, I have no issues
Now eat it my dear girl
Take a dosa, a little chutney and make it into little balls and then eat them lt will be delicious!
Now let us come to the matter What is your sister's problem?
She is worried for some time She is being shadowed
But nobody is seen visibly following her ln the bus, bus stop someone is behind her all the time
That guy who waylaid you on the highway
Was it forthis sister he created that issue?
- Yes!
- Then have no doubts lt's them for sure
Have you given a police complaint?
We did, but they appear to have influence over the police
Who are they?
How are they related to you?
If you find it difficult to tell me, then don't tell
Hey!
Stop there Stop!
Gopi lf l get my hands on you
- Gopi, what is it?
- Who is it?
Some guy was hiding near the gate
When I asked he replied in Hindi and ran away
He looks a little fishy
Both of them are very scared
There is no need to be scared We can easily handle this
We have a place to stay in this city
But is it right to leave them alone here?
It's not at all right
- lf you don't mind, you can use that room
- Boss you can sleep there
- Gopi can sleep in my room
- Sure
- What about you?
- l will sleep with mother
Then I'll sleep in the car
- Shall we go?
- First we'll plan our action
When does this fellow usually follow your sister?
Wasn't it at the bus stop yesterday?
On a bike wearing a helmet
Let her go as usual to the bus stop
We will follow about 30 ft behind, very quietly
Okay sister!
You go walking as usual

You hit my brother I've not used even a broomstick on him Today I hit him
Brother you have to forgive me I committed a mistake I did not come to kill I just came to declare my love

Girls have to be brought up with restraint and sense of honor
They should have self respect lf they make eyes and entice boys they will come after you What's wrong in that?
Hey!
Better talk with respect, okay?
I know the kind of person you are I mean you don't know who I am Teaching me manners eh?
- Brother!
Stop talking like this
- You stay out of this
The great municipal secretary lf you governed your home like you did the municipality, will she have become like this?
You!
If your sister is important to you My brother is for me
Whatever the mistake he commits I will forgive him
- Brother!
- You be quiet!
Didn't you know it was my brother who was going after this rat tail sister of yours?
You hid that fact and made me hit him You tried to separate us l kicked him You demoness lf ever I see you or yourfamily anywhere near my house again...!
You Kamath!
I trusted you!
But you used your brother as a bait to get even with me, right?
Forthis you will suffer
Yes!
We will see who is going to suffer
Let us see
- Come guys
- Come my girl
Boss, give me also a massage I'll give you a good kick that will kill you
Do you see this?
These are marks of injury
You and your punches I will have to massage him for a month at least only these marks will go, poor thing!
All this body pain is not a problem I am feeling bad that you were insulted I shouldn't have hit you I feel so bad kicking you lt was not deliberate done brother lsn't it for the sake of that Municipal secretary?
What are you saying?
Have you gone mad?
What language are you speaking?
- You didn't understand, right?
- No!
Well, from childhood, this is my condition Sheer gibberish when I hear both of you talk
Get lost, you ass monkey This is between us brothers
Don't poke your nose into this Don't kill yourself inviting my kick okay?
But I too got a taste of his blows, right?
Eats only vegetables, but his blows painful like being hit by a hammer l still don't believe you were the killer stalking that girl I am not a killer, brother lt is true I followed her But doesn't a girl recognize whether a guy follows her to kill or to love?
This is the first time I am going after a girl, I swear
There are so many girls in this world I am surprised why you love only this one?
There are so many wonderful buildings all overthe world
Yet, tell me, why is only the Taj Mahal a world wonder?
- Tell me I say - l don't understand it myself
Gopi!
There are so many kinds of meat
Yet you like the taste of only beef, why?
Hey!
Now I understand
- But does the buffalo know it?
- Definitely not
So many girls come to our hotel
But why did I notice (throw up) only her?
.
Throw up!
Sure if she had you'd have been in trouble by now!
You will die with my kick now
Why did I note only her especially?
- Why?
- You tell me
- You tell us - l will tell you
Thank you, sister
- Mom
- Thanks
God bless you!
So beautiful I just wondered for a minute lf l was that child I would get a kiss, hmm?
What is all this?
Give it to me
My first kiss I am not going to give up
You are malayali, right?
Help!
Did you see what happened here?
What is he saying?
Did you see those thugs?
Husband and wife both are dumb, eh?
Go, go!
Escaped pretending to be dumb just like I did, eh?
Thank me for giving you this idea Don't go away like this, without saying it I will also come On the way we can...
May I come in?
I have come to clear some doubts, regarding love tax I was living, minding my business when a girl made me fall and gave me a kiss
Should I pay a service tax for this?
If I feel I want more such kisses Will that tax carry interest?
A lot of love has accumulated in the heart lt grew and grew into a spreading bower ofjasmine
How much of a love growth tax has to be paid forthis?
I like you very much
Shall I go to your house and propose marriage ?
How much protection tax has to be paid?
Excuse me?
May I help you?
No!
No!
No!
Only this girl can help me
She is not answering any of my questions I will answer your questions Give me your file I will give this file only to her She can answer me
She will not talk my dearfellow I will make her talk
Attender!
Please throw this guy out
No one has to push me out I know how to go
- Does this carry interest?
- Hey you!
Like this, in spite of many efforts she never bothered I realized my looks and style were old fashioned I changed over and became a smart young man I thought I'll try once more and that's when you saw me
Why do we need a woman between us?
You for me and I for you isn't that enough?
We are brothers Shouldn't our lineage continue?
Deva, we are enough for each other
Shouldn't we have children?
You don't have a wife forthat lf l also don't try, who will perform the last rites when we die?
I am there for you
How will you be there?
Won't someone kill you by then, you tramp?
No one else will I myself will kill him now
With his comic comments between my serious sentiments
Brother, I want her lf you love her so much, I will beg forgiveness at that secretary's feet
Beg at herfeet?
No definitely not!
Your self respect is more important to me I can't bear to see my brother bow his head to any one
From this moment onwards I have no feelings for that girl I have decided to forget everything
There is no need to uphold my honor by giving you pain
Don't!
Brother
Your happiness is most important I will go and beg forgiveness
- Don't!
Brother - l will
- Don't - l will
Stop it!
What's the issue now?
You want to continue lineage and the wealth remain in the family, right?
I am indebted to you for all you have done for me
Now I want to show my gratitude So I will marry this girl
You tramp, vagabond I will kill you!
What is all this Gopi'etta?
We came with a marriage proposal I knew you would come I will get dressed and come
Goodness!
is she nuts?
Hey you!
What is all this?
These are fruits
- l don't understand
- Which fruit do you...
But why are you here?
We have come with a proposal
We?
My boss has come with a marriage proposal
For whom?
Me?
I have come to ask your sister's hand in marriage for my brother
This is not our Kamath tradition This is Coimbatore style, how is it?
We are not interested Take all this and get out!
But...
Didn't you understand?
My dear!
Mother don't be upset
Yesterday secretary madam and I had a small tiff
We have come in truce with these sweets
Please listen to what I have to say
My brother likes your daughter Rekha very, very much
Why don't you agree to the proposal?
I said we are not interested, didn't I?
It's not for you to say that Rekha has to say it I don't have time to waste talking to you I have to reach Palakkad and she has to reach office
- Rekha, go!
- Please listen to me
My brother is not a bad guy like you think
Handsome from a good family, and very good behavior
No drinks, cigarette, snuff, drugs or chew betel leaves
He will be the greatest good fortune, a treasure for you
Remember, he's my brother How could he be bad?
!
You brothers are amazing You speak only good about yourselves
But others too must be convinced We don't want your loafer brother
- Should I interfere, boss?
- No!
We Kamaths respect women very much
Otherwise I would have chopped up the tongue that called my brother a loafer and put it in sambhar
Are you threatening me?
No wonder your wife divorced you
Stop it!
You are frustrated and jealous Because you did not marry on time
- Talk with respect
- Why should I respect you?
I challenge you, if he truly loves her my brother will marry herfor sure
Otherwise I will make him Just you wait lt will never happen
Never say never, within a month 30 days, it will happen, I will make it happen!
I take leave now!
Municipality madam!
Adios, madam!
Brother, what foolishness have you done?
How can I possibly marry a girl from the enemy's camp in 30 days?
When they talked ill about you I lost complete control of myself
Don't think of losing out in this My honor is in your hands now
My hands?
What can I do?
You have to show your love I have been doing only that ever since I met her, isn't it?
You cannot go after her like a chain snatcher on a bike
That's true
When a guy goes after a girl, she must be able to see his love slowly unfolding
How do you do that, boss?
You don't have to know that Stand away
- Here's your tea
- Go roast it and eat it
- Here drink your tea
- Go boil it and eat it
- Hey!
- Continue brother
Why do people who visit our hotel, come again and again?
Because we take care and give them food like each one prefers
That's how you have to do it Serve according to taste, that's love
He's a great one in such things with women!
How do you know that?
Don't poke your nose in matters not your concern, keep it elsewhere
How do we serve love according to taste?
- You have to sing a song
- Great!
Me?
Sing a song?
Love and singing have a great connection
- Sing a song
- But I don't know to sing I will teach you
Just say what you want to say and that will be a song
Gopi?
Get a harmonium, a little guitar a violin and a few tablas
Do you wish to make aviyal (a dish)?
No, you ass-monkey To woo her
- How is it?
- lt's very cold here
You are an ass without aesthetic sense, go inside!
Brother, but this is in Konkani She understands only Malayalam
Forthat you can sing the same thing in Malayalam
Just go ahead sing and impress lt will be wonderful!
If I go after her and sing like this she will sulk
- Then sing 'don't sulk if I follow you'
- How?
I will sing it and show you
Don't be angry my girl if i come after you
Let my giancet not anger you my girl
Don't be angry my girl if i come after you Let my giancet not anger you my girl
Oh beautiful one, your tmiie to tweet, awakent in me detiret plenty

Are you willing, i am dying to hear you tay yes
Don't be angry my girl if i come after you Let my giancet not anger you my girl
Boss!
It's a pity you didn't return that slap
Haven't you heard?
It's a sin to lay hands on a 'nari' (woman)
Mother, sister, wife and lover are 'naris'
All women are 'naris' (nari also means shameless) I didn't know that all women are shameless!
I'm not referring to that 'nari' you shameless fellow!
Then what?
'Nari' which means women is what I meant
We have got so many slaps in life Considerthis as one of them
Did it hurt?
Mmm..but there was a solace in that pain also
A pain full of sweetness
What!
I have been slapped too Why have I never felt such sweet pain?
There is indeed such a pain We are talking about human beings
You go ahead
Brother, the guilt of this slap will start haunting her now
Slowly it will turn to love
Now there's no time to go slowly Our deadline ends today
Why don't we ask for an extension?
15 days more
Even if you get 15 months more this is not going to happen
You are very backward in matters of women I am unable to forget
- There is a way out
- What is that?
- lf l say it will you jump at me?
- No!
Just say it
- Promise?
- l swear!
I'll go abduct and bring her here
- Gopi!
- No!
Oh mother!
That she-devil is coming here!
Oh God!
Why is she here?
- Come in
- Come, sit
Whose bright idea was it to make her fall head over heels in love by singing songs?
My brother's
Music, direction, lyrics and everything else
- The song was good
- Thanks!
But the idea failed!
Why don't we use Ananda Bhairavi lt will be really good I am not ready for anything hereafter
Shall I get you some tea?
- Are you all slightly mad?
- Then I'll get you coffee
Don't you see madam is hot?
Give her something cool
- l'll get some ice from the fridge
- You can keep it on your head
You tell, Madam
What happened to your challenge of a wedding in 30 days?
I drew that challenge when I saw his deep desire to marry your sister
We lost and you have won We give up
Can't you compromise and give her to us?
Please don't say no He loves her so much
- For whom?
- For him
Can we not forget obstinacy and enmity and allow this wedding to happen?
He will look after her like a treasure lf wealth is not enough I will give mine also
She will never ever have reason for remorse
Rekha is not the girl you think she is
What?
!
Not a girl?
Brother!
I don't know how to explain this
May be Konkani will help They understand that better
- Do you know Konkani?
- Gopi!
- You don't know anything about her
- Whatever we know is sufficient
Do you know her caste?
Even if she is lower, she's a Hindu right?
That's enough
She's not a Hindu
She's a Christian
I have only a brother to call my own
Before you know about her You should know about my brother
I'll be right there I'll tell them sir
Sir, what are you doing here?
The person I was talking about is on TV
Come Have you started selling frogs?
Where?
Switch on the TV
Sister, ask Lakshmi to come here
My dear look at the TV Don't complain you didn't see the boy
- Hey!
Shift to Manorama Channel
- Why didn't you say this earlier?
The guy I mentioned will appear now
He is a judge for this program He's a lecturer
The one with the blue shirt Oh he's gone lt will come again
He was all the while watching that girl who was dancing
- How is the boy, is he okay?
- l didn't see him
- Suresh sir didn't you see him
- Sure very good

Nanu, find an auspicious date I am sure this alliance is as good as fixed I undertake all responsibility!
It was with regard to an income tax raid
Suresh first went to Malikapura House
We are from the income tax department We have to search this house
Malikapuram house does not have unaccounted wealth you've been misinformed ln any case we were misled Let's know the truth and leave

So I am not considering caste or religion
She has neither a mom nor dad You should look after her very well lf her brothers come to know of this They are evil and won't spare your life
Don't worry about that grand ma

Where is Suresh?
He's not here Who are you?
Suresh is in love with our sister Ask him to forget it lf our family faces a bad name because of him
None of you will see him alive
Are you threatening us?
Police and courts do exist here
This one is quite smart, Tomy'cha
When you give the complaint include this also in it
Come
What is your business here?
Because of my love for your sister Sunny'chan and Tommy'chan went to my house and misbehaved with my sister
Have you come to enquire about that?
Of course!
Shouldn't I?
I can consider this is a drama of love by her brothers towards a sister who is worth in millions, controlling and not even getting her married
But how can I excuse you for slapping my sister?
I can't and if I don't return it, I'm not eligible to call myself her brother
Da!
I am taking her away with me As per law she is my wife
Here is the copy of the certificate of our registered marriage
When you have time go through it I don't want your wealth or assets But I want her
Grandma, please bless us
Stop!
Did you think you can put up a show at Malikapuram house and walk out alive with our sister?
They are here for my protection And my friends also have come
Sunnycha, if she wants let her go Don't stop them
Go my dear Go live happily
Come in my dear
You don't worry sis, we'll conduct your marriage with great pomp and splendor
Get lost!
Oh God!
My son!
Brother...!
My son!
The murderer nor the weapon couldn't be traced by the police or crime branch
She repeatedly gave evidence against her own family in courts and police stations
But power of money and lack of evidence allowed the culprits escape from law
Her brothers tried to take her back home But she did not oblige
She insisted that her place was at her husband's home
And requested us not to forsake her
Even when she got her husband's job as his widow and came to Coimbatore we didn't allow her to come alone So we accompanied her here
Here also they began threatening her Remember that issue on the high way?
That is one of her brothers trying to get her back
God has given her only misfortunes and unhappiness
Please forget her, at least hereafter
According to my calculation Suresh came with Rekha to his house at 5 pm
By 10 at night they were in the bridal chamber
The murderer got in at 10:05
Suresh murdered at 10:10 PM
What do we deduct from this?
One thing is for sure taking the time they went in and the time he was murdered
What is that?
- Nothing happened
- What?
There has been no physical relationship between them
Get lost!
You ass!
I thought let that not be a hindrance to this marriage
Deva, what do you say?
My feelings have intensified lt hasn't lessened even a bit
Can I get a chance to speak to Rekha?
Please forgive me I'm here once again on his request
Don't think we are harassing you
Come in
After listening to everything He wants to interview her I told him no But he doesn't listen
When his face falls, my heart breaks lf it's no trouble, just one minute
She is in that room
Rekha...
To love a man more than life itself and to spend rest of life mourning his death I don't understand ls that what life is all about?
They say God calls back early, those HE loves dearly
Just console yourself with that I came behind you without knowing anything
After knowing everything, I'm asking you
Can we not have a life together?
The love in our hearts will be only for one person in life, I know lt's the same for me also
I will love you more than Suresh
Just give me an answer today
And still if you don't like me Just say so, I will go away I will live the rest of my life like you are doing now
Why are you not saying anything?
Tell me something
- She will not answer you
- Don't be stubborn
Deva, she hasn't spoken since birth
- You mean she is dumb?
- Yes
Suresh knew it and still loved her I thought you knew this
She won't speak to you
Come, I want to speak to you
That girl has suffered a lot We didn't know it
Now what shall we do?
- Brother, I want to marry only her
- She can't speak
Whatever her shortcomings I am prepared to put up with it I love her that much!
If you love her so much lt's fine with me also
Brother!
In a way it's better she can't speak
At least you won't land up in a situation like mine
But she has not agreed so far lf she doesn't agree, I won't ever marry
Did you see his love for you?
This is true love
Love should be given in return for love lf you refuse this love Even the Gods won't tolerate
Suresh's mom and sister wants you to live a good life
They want to see you happy
When they see your unhappiness lt pains them more than Suresh's death
Otherwise, let them say it's not true
My dear, you must accept this
One minute!
Agreed you can't speak But you can write, isn't it?
Just take paper and pen and write That you like me
Just write it lt will be really great lf you find it difficult to write Then show it in symbols
Like this I...
love...you I love you You...you
She smiled Brother she smiled
Hey!
Put me down Put me down I am telling you This marriage will happen
See he's feeling shy lt's fixed The wedding is fixed
Greetings!

Greetings!
Sorry, we could not participate in your party
Do you think he will have a wedding at all?
Before that the groom will die, won't he?
He disappeared to Mumbai after Suresh's death
Now he's appeared again to finish you off
Vikram!
Come on fast
My dear brothers younger and older, greetings
You didn't expect us here, right?
We always do the unexpected
From the minute we came to your house
We have been expecting an attack from you isn't it brother?
.
Yes, allowing me to travel alone tonight and giving you a chance to confront me to get you here is brothers brilliant idea
We assumed this guy who has been elusive to Kerala crime branch and Kerala police will come again
Vikram Chetri his address, his mother's name, dads name ...house number were all given to us by Kerala police
Gopi, people here have not seen us in action
Should we not show our prowess, Deva?
- Who will begin, you or I?
- We'll do it together
- Shall we flatten them or pulp them
- We'll extract their 'beans'
- Then we'll do it together
- Sure we will, it will be wonderful
- Sure we will
- Gopi, you can go take rest
Vikram Chetri, don't listen to their blabber Just beat them down
- Now give it to them
- Okay, brother
Boss, my body is aching standing idle I am yearning to give a few punches
Please give me also a chance One kick and two blows, okay?
Isn't the wedding today?
We don't see anyone
The wedding is to be held at Malikapuram house and entire police force is invited was what Kamath said
Wedding decorations seems to be missing
Isn't it here the wedding is to be, Kamath?
Sure in another 10 minutes
We didn't invite you forthe wedding alone But to get you a promotion too
Gopi!
Let them come out Let all villains come out
These are the culprits who caused Kerala police hang their heads in shame
- We are handing them over to you
- Okay, okay
But don't mention we handed them over Promotion is assured
- Take them
- That's all
Get going
There comes the elusive culprit Vikram Chetri

Ragnar:
Previously on "Vikings":
This is an ambitious man.
And he resents the fact that he owes me loyalty and obedience as his chieftain.
Man:
Attack!
Earl Haraldson:
You accept that you're a criminal?
Worthy only of defeat.
After him!
Worthy only of death.
(Gasps)
(Splash)
Bjorn:
Where is father?
Is he dead?
He's dead!
I've come to warn you.
My husband, he hates you.
Get away.
Torstein:
Earl Haraldson has played a trick on Rollo and imprisoned him, trying to find where you where.
Then he tortured him.
He tortured my brother?
It's a trap for you, Ragnar.
I want you to ask for a meeting with the Earl, challenge him to a personal combat...
With me.

Svein:
What is it?
(Floki giggles)
Housecarl 1:
My lord, this man says he has a message for you from Ragnar Lothbrok.
Let him go!
What's the message?
Ragnar Lothbrok challenges you to meet him in single combat.
Ragnar Lothbrok has a very high opinion of himself.
Well, he is a descendant of Odin.
(Everyone laughs)
(Laughter stops)
Ragnar said that if you refuse his challenge, then shame would follow you the rest of your life.
There would be greater shame in accepting a challenge from a criminal.
That would suggest that I take him seriously;
That I see him as an equal.
The challenge is declined.
When Ragnar Lothbrok appears in Kattegat, he will be put in chains.
The seer:
Stones and bones.
He searches for your death.
Does he desire to be Earl?
If he kills you, would it not be so?
Tell Ragnar Lothbrok I accept his challenge.
Take him away.
(Water rushes)
(Lagertha and Ragnar moan in pleasure)
(Fire crackles)
- Ragnar...
- What?
Let's go away.
Let's leave here.
This is not the only place for us.
Ragnar:
He is old.
What are you frightened of?
You can't fight.
You're still too weak.
Perhaps that makes us equal.
Never fight unless you know the odds are in your favor.
That is our way.
Ragnar:
Who sets the odds?
Our fates are already decided.
(Breathing heavily)
Lagertha:
You don't believe that and neither do I.
Ragnar:
You are wrong:
I do believe it.
(Howling in the distance)
Siggy: (Quietly) Come to bed.
You need to rest, to sleep.
Earl Haraldson:
Yes, I will.
There's always time to sleep.
I was thinking about our boys, what they would look like now.
Don't...
Don't think about them.
Think about tomorrow.
When I must kill a man for whom I have the utmost respect.
Siggy:
Respect?
You respect Ragnar Lothbrok?
Why not?
He is what I used to be... restless, ambitious.
And he was right about the Western lands.
But I always knew that in my heart.
Siggy:
Then why didn't you tell him?
Because the moment that I reached out to Ragnar Lothbrok, was the moment that all my friends, all my supporters would have deserted me and joined him.
It was impossible to do it.
But it's true, our fates have brought us together.
And maybe he's opened the Western lands for me.
That is my hope, after I kill him.
The seer promised you would kill him?
Yes.
Good.
(Earl Bjarni shouts out in pleasure)
Earl Bjarni:
I'm sure that's our first child.
(Panting)
Now get up and fetch me some pickled herrings.
I'm starving.
I don't like the smell of them in the bed.
Your clothes are smelly enough as it is.
Why can't you just wash like everyone else?
I thought a wife wasn't supposed to nag her husband until they'd had time to grow tired of each other?
If you don't get up and fetch me some herrings
I will beat you.
Perhaps that will make you show a little life when we have sex, in any case!
Thyri:
Very well.
I'll go.
Earl Bjarni:
I can't wait till tomorrow.
Personal combat is always thrilling.
Who is this Ragnar Lothbrok?
I've heard many people talk about him.
Thyri I don't talk about him.
He's my father's enemy.

I cannot feel your presence... (Sighs)

And you, Torstein, and you, Arne, you are my friends.
What is your name?
Old man:
Tostig, lord Ragnar.
Do you swear allegiance and fealty to me and to my family from this day forth?
That won't be so long then!
(Crowd laughs)
Tostig:
By my sacred rings I swear.
But I also have a favor to ask, lord.
What is this favor?
That the next time you go raiding, you take me with you.
(Crowd laughs)
(Silence)
I do not wish to insult you, but the truth is you... tostig:
That I am too old?
(Chuckles)
Yes, I am old.
But I have been a warrior all my life.
Many years I sailed with lord Haraldson and fought battles against the Eastlanders, and I watched all the companions of my youth die.
And though I fought with them in the shield-wall, never once was I touched by a blade.
All the friends and companions of my youth are dead and feasting and drinking with the Aesir in the halls of the gods!
While I...
I am forsaken.
Bereft.
Which is why, I beg you, lord, gift me the chance to die with honor in battle, and join my friends in Valhalla.
Ragnar: (Grunts in pain)
This summer, we shall have more ships to go west, for that is our future.
When we return to England...
Let's take him with us!
All in favor?
All:
Aye.
There is no need for you to swear.
You have already paid a heavy price for your loyalty to me.
Nevertheless, I will swear, brother.
I swear to be true to you, your wife and your family...
As long as your good fortune holds.

Ah yes, my lord Wigea, of course you know all about them.
You accused them of having supernatural powers, which is why a small force of them defeated you.

God will raise me up again.

To destroy the gods.
Odin will ride out of the gates of Valhalla
To do battle for a last time against the wolf.
Thor will kill the serpent,
But die from its venom.
Surt will spread fire across the earth.
At last, fenrir will swallow the sun.
Nooooooooo!
So where did these northmen come ashore?
They didn't.
What do you mean, they didn't?
They came in three ships,
And those ships are now sailing up the tyne.
They have ships that can cross oceans
But also sail up rivers?
What manner of men are these?
If they are sailing up the tyne,
Then, sire, we shall soon find out.
Ah yes, my Lord wigea,
Of course you know all about them.
You accused them of having supernatural powers,
Which is why a small force of them defeated you.
I merely said they fought like demons,
Like men possessed, with no fear of death.
Unlike you, my Lord?
I fear death as much as the next man,
But I have no fear that afterwards
God will raise me up again.
Oh, well said.
Come, all of you!
I have something new to show you.
Let the serpents bite these devils.
Let them also bite those too weak
And afraid to fight to the death
For their king and master.
My Lord!
No!
No!
You look terrified, my Lord wigea.
Have you lost your faith?
Are you not certain anymore
That god will raise you up from the grave?
Have mercy
Personally, I hope he does not.
I hope he leaves you there to rot.
Nooooooo!
Ungh!
No!
Christ!
God!
Nooooo!
Now let us prepare to defend ourselves
Against these heathens and barbarians.
Previously on "Vikings":
This is an ambitious man.
And he resents the fact that he owes me
Loyalty and obedience as his chieftain.
You accept that you're a criminal?
Worthy only of defeat.
After him!
Worthy only of death.
Where is father?
Is he dead?
I've come to warn you.
My husband, he hates you.
Earl Haraldson has played a trick on rollo
Trying to find where you were.
Then he tortured him.
He tortured my brother?
It's a trap for you, Ragnar.
I want you to ask for a meeting with the Earl,
Challenge him to a personal combat...
With me.

What is it?
My Lord, this man says he has a message for you
From Ragnar Lothbrok.
Let him go!
What's the message?
Ragnar Lothbrok challenges you to meet him in single combat.
Ragnar Lothbrok has a very high opinion of himself.
Well, he is a descendant of Odin.
Ragnar said that if you refuse his challenge,
Then shame would follow you the rest of your life.
There would be greater shame
In accepting a challenge from a criminal.
That would suggest that I take him seriously;
That I see him as an equal.
The challenge is declined.
When Ragnar Lothbrok appears in Kattegat,
He will be put in chains.
Stones and bones.
He searches for your death.
Does he desire to be Earl?
If he kills you, would it not be so?
Tell Ragnar Lothbrok I accept his challenge.
Take him away.
Ragnar...
What?
Let's go away.
Let's leave here.
This is not the only place for us.
He is old.
What are you frightened of?
You can't fight.
You're still too weak.
Perhaps that makes us equal.
Never fight unless you know the odds are in your favor.
That is our way.
Who sets the odds?
Our fates are already decided.
You don't believe that and neither do I.
You are wrong
I do believe it.
come to bed.
You need to rest, to sleep.
Yes, I will.
There's always time to sleep.
I was thinking about our boys,
What they would look like now.
Don't...
Don't think about them.
Think about tomorrow.
When I must kill a man
For whom I have the utmost respect.
Respect?
You respect Ragnar Lothbrok?
Why not?
He is what I used to be -
Restless, ambitious.
And he was right about the western lands.
But I always knew that in my heart.
Then why didn't you tell him?
Because the moment that I reached out
Was the moment that all my friends,
All my supporters would have deserted me
And joined him.
It was impossible to do it.
Our fates have brought us together.
And maybe he's opened the western lands for me.
That is my hope, after I kill him.
The seer promised you would kill him?
Yes.
Good.
I'm sure that's our first child.
Now get up and fetch me some pickled herrings.
I'm starving.
I don't like the smell of them in the bed.
Your clothes are smelly enough as it is.
Why can't you just wash like everyone else?
I thought a wife wasn't supposed to nag her husband
Until they'd had time to grow tired of each other?
If you don't get up and fetch me some herrings
I will beat you.
Perhaps that will make you show a little life
When we have sex, in any case!
Very well.
I'll go.
I can't wait till tomorrow.
Personal combat is always thrilling.
Who is this Ragnar Lothbrok?
I've heard many people talk about him.
Thyri I don't talk about him.
He's my father's enemy.
Lord,
High one, hear me.
Listen to me.
Give me your favor this day.
Grant me your blessing as you have done in the past,
And I will make a sacrifice of my enemy,
If his death pleases you.
Give me a sign...
I cannot feel your presence...
Husband...?
Our sons hair.
Believe at least in them,
And in yourself.
Don't look so worried.

This is a personal combat.

Lord Ragnar,
I have come to swear to you my allegiance
And fealty to you and your family
From this day.
Leif, you are my friend.
And you, Torstein,
And you, Arne,
You are my friends.
What is your name?
Old Tostig, Lord Ragnar.
Do you swear allegiance and fealty
To me and to my family
From this day forth?
That won't be so long then!
By my sacred rings I swear.
But I also have a favor to ask, Lord.
What is this favor?
That the next time you go raiding,
You take me with you.
I do not wish to insult you, but the truth is you-
That I am too old?
Yes, I am old.
But I have been a warrior all my life.
Many years I sailed with Lord Haraldson
And fought battles against the eastlanders,
And I watched all the companions of my youth die.
And though I fought with them in the shield-wall,
Never once was I touched by a blade.
All the friends and companions of my youth are dead
And feasting and drinking with the aesir
In the halls of the gods!
While I...
I am forsaken
Bereft.
Which is why, I beg you, Lord,
Gift me the chance to die with honor in battle,
And join my friends in Valhalla.
This summer, we shall have more ships to go west,
For that is our future.
When we return to England...
Let's take him with us!
All in favor?
Aye.
There is no need for you to swear.
You have already paid a heavy price
For your loyalty to me.
Nevertheless, I will swear, brother.
I swear to be true to you,
Your wife and your family...
As long as your good fortune holds.
How will we ever be equal now, my brother?
Why have you agreed to grant Earl Haraldson
Such a big funeral.
Was he not your enemy?
He was also a great man and a warrior.
He earned his renown in this life,
And now, in death, he deserves such a funeral.
I want to show you something.

I ask permission to light the pyre.
I have something important to tell you, husband.
I am with child again.
I know you're a boy!
The seer told me.
O by all the gods, my son,
You have made me a happy man.
Have you come to kill us?
Why would I do that?
Because Ragnar told you to.
It is often the way that the new Earl
Deals with the family of the old.
Ragnar won't kill you.
How can you be sure?
My brother doesn't hold grudges.
He's strange that way.
Well...
Even if we don't die,
They will still shun us like a bad smell.
And they'll make it so we have to leave here,
Even though they know no one else will take us in.
They won't.
Not if I vouch for you.
No one will force you to go anywhere.
They wouldn't dare.
What do you want in return?
You were once married to an Earl.
Would you not like to be married to another one?
Who?
What do you mean who?
Me!
The pigs are fattening nicely.
Just like your mother.
It's cold,
Even in here.
I can't wait for the spring,
Or the raids.
I want to go to England.
No.
What?
I said no.
But why?
Because I said so.
Don't be too impatient to put yourself in danger.
But you cannot alter my fate!
You sound like your uncle,
When he doesn't know what to say.
Come on.
Ragnar, I have heard many of your stories,
But tell me...
What is Ragnarok?
I have heard mention of it several times,
But so far no one has explained
The meaning to me.
Let's show this ignorant christian
What Ragnarok is.
Get the leaves.
The twilight of the gods will happen like this
There will be three years of terrible winters...
And summers of black sunlight.
People will lose all hope
And surrender to greed,
Incest and civil war.
Midgardsormen, the world serpent,
Will come lunging from the ocean,
Dragging the tides in and flooding the world.
The wolf, giant fenrir,
Will break his invisible chains...
The skies will open
And surt the fire-giant
Will come flaming across the bridge
To destroy the gods.
Odin will ride out of the gates of Valhalla
To do battle for a last time against the wolf.
Thor will kill the serpent,
But die from its venom.
Surt will spread fire across the earth.

I don't talk about him.
He's my father's enemy.
Ooh...
Lord,
High One, hear me.
Listen to me.
Give me your favor this day.
Grant me your blessing as you have done in the past, and I will make a sacrifice of my enemy if his death pleases you.
Give me a sign.
I cannot feel your presence.
Husband.
Our sons' hair.
Believe at least in them and in yourself.
Don't look so worried.
This is a personal combat.
The combatants can choose any weapon and shield they desire.
Each man has two shields.
If both are broken, there can be no further replacement.
Fight, Ragnar!
Father, you can do it!
You can do it, Earl!
Finish him!
He is weak!
Lord Odin is here, waiting to see which one of us he will take to his great hall.
So I shall dine after all at the high table of the Aesir.
No!
No!
No!
Tonight I shall be drinking with our boys.
Kill him.
Kill him!
Hail, Earl Ragnar.
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
- Take it!
- Take it!
Take it!
Lord Ragnar,
I have come to swear to you my allegiance and fealty to you and your family from this day.
Leif, you are my friend.
And you, Torstein, and you, Arne, you are my friends.
What is your name?
Tostig, Lord Ragnar.
Do you swear allegiance and fealty to me and to my family from this day forth?
That won't be so long then.
By my sacred rings, I swear.
But I also have a favor to ask, Lord.
What is this favor?
That the next time you go raiding, you take me with you.
I do not wish to insult you, but the truth is you...
That I am too old?
Yes, I am old.
But I have been a warrior all my life.
Many years I sailed with Lord Haraldson and fought battles against the Eastlanders, and I watched all the companions of my youth die.
And though I fought with them in the shield-wall, never once was I touched by a blade.
All the friends and companions of my youth are dead and feasting and drinking with the Aesir in the halls of the gods!
While I,
I am forsaken, bereft.
Which is why I beg you, Lord, gift me the chance to die with honor in battle and join my friends in Valhalla.
This summer, we shall have more ships to go west, for that is our future.
When we return to England, let's take him with us.
All in favor?
Aye.
There is no need for you to swear.
You have already paid a heavy price for your loyalty to me.
Nevertheless, I will swear, brother.
I swear to be true to you, your wife and your family as long as your good fortune holds.
How will we ever be equal now, my brother?
Why have you agreed to grant Earl Haraldson such a big funeral?
Was he not your enemy?
He was also a great man and warrior.
He earned his renown in this life, and now, in death, he deserves such a funeral.
I want to show you something.
♪ I dreamt a dream last night
♪ Of silk as fine fur
♪ Now an Earl is felled by spears
♪ It is horrible now to look around... ♪
Who is she?
She's one of the Earl's slaves.
When he died, all of his slave women were asked, "Who wants to die with him?"
This one agreed.
She wants to die?
These other servants are preparing her.
♪ As the valkyries sing their song ♪
Put the body on the bench.
Let's make our offerings.
You need a drink, priest.
Drink.
Drink!
There's that slave girl, the one who has chosen to die.
What are they doing?
She is having sex with the men who live in there.
Each one of them says to her,
"Tell your master I did this out of love for him."
Because she will soon be reunited with her master in death, and she will be able to speak to him.
Silence!
Bjorn, who is that woman?
We call her the Angel of Death.
I can see my master.
He is in Valhalla.
He calls me.
Let me join him then.
I cannot stay.
What's the matter with you, priest?
I don't want to watch.
It's only death.
You will stay, or my father will hear of it.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Hail!
Hail, Ragnar Lothbrok!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Ragnar Lothbrok!
Move!
I ask permission to light the pyre.
I have something important to tell you, husband.
I am with child again.
I know you're a boy.
The Seer told me.
By all the gods, my son,
you have made me a happy man.
Have you come to kill us?
Why would I do that?
Because Ragnar told you to.
It is often the way that the new Earl deals with the family of the old.
Ragnar won't kill you.
How can you be sure?
My brother doesn't hold grudges.
He's strange that way.
Well, even if we don't die, they will still shun us like a bad smell.
And they'll make it so we have to leave here, even though they know no one else will take us in.
They won't.
Not if I vouch for you.
No one will force you to go anywhere.
They wouldn't dare.
What do you want in return?
You were once married to an Earl.
Would you not like to be married to another one?
Who?
What do you mean who?
Me.
The pigs are fattening nicely.
Just like your mother.
It's cold even in here.
I can't wait for the spring or the raids.
I want to go to England.
No.
What?
I said no.
But why?
Because I said so.
Don't be too impatient to put yourself in danger.
But you cannot alter my fate!
You sound like your uncle when he doesn't know what to say.
Come on.
Ragnar, I have heard many of your stories, but tell me, what is Ragnarök?
I have heard mention of it several times, but so far no one has explained the meaning to me.
Let's show this ignorant Christian what Ragnarök is.
Get the leaves.
The twilight of the gods will happen like this.
There will be three years of terrible winters and summers of black sunlight.
People will lose all hope and surrender to greed, incest and civil war.
Midgardsormen, the world's serpent, will come lunging from the ocean, dragging the tides in and flooding the world.
The wolf, giant Fenrir, will break his invisible chains.
The skies will open, and Surt, the fire-giant, will come flaming across the bridge to destroy the gods.
Odin will ride out of the gates of Valhalla to do battle for a last time against the wolf.
Thor will kill the serpent but die from its venom.
Surt will spread fire across the earth.
At last, Fenrir will swallow the sun.
No!
So where did these Northmen come ashore?
They didn't.
What do you mean, they didn't?
They came in three ships, and those ships are now sailing up the Tyne.
They have ships that can cross oceans but also sail up rivers?
What manner of men are these?
If they are sailing up the Tyne, then, sire, we shall soon find out.
Ah, yes, My Lord Wigea, of course you know all about them.
You accused them of having supernatural powers, which is why a small force of them defeated you.
I merely said they fought like demons, like men possessed, with no fear of death.
Unlike you, My Lord?
I fear death as much as the next man, but I have no fear that afterwards God will raise me up again.
Well said.
Come, all of you!
I have something new to show you.
Let the serpents bite these devils.
Let them also bite those too weak and afraid to fight to the death for their king and master.
My Lord!
No!
No!
You look terrified, My Lord Wigea.
Have you lost your faith?
Are you not certain anymore that God will raise you up from the grave?
Have mercy!
Personally, I hope he does not.
I hope he leaves you there to rot.
No!
Lord...
God!
Now, let us prepare to defend ourselves against these heathens and barbarians.
Previously on "Vikings":
This is an ambitious man.
And he resents the fact that he owes me
Loyalty and obedience as his chieftain.
You accept that you're a criminal?
Worthy only of defeat.
After him!
Worthy only of death.
Where is father?
Is he dead?
I've come to warn you.
My husband, he hates you.
Earl Haraldson has played a trick on rollo
Trying to find where you were.
Then he tortured him.
He tortured my brother?
It's a trap for you, Ragnar.
I want you to ask for a meeting with the Earl,
Challenge him to a personal combat...
With me.
* * more, give me more * * give me more
* if I had a heart I could love you * * if I had a voice I would sing *
* after the night when I wake up *
* I'll see what tomorrow brings *
* I...
I...
I... * if I had a voice I would sing *
*
What is it?
My Lord, this man says he has a message for you
From Ragnar Lothbrok.
Let him go!
What's the message?
Ragnar Lothbrok challenges you to meet him in single combat.
Ragnar Lothbrok has a very high opinion of himself.
Well, he is a descendant of Odin.
Ragnar said that if you refuse his challenge,
Then shame would follow you the rest of your life.
There would be greater shame
In accepting a challenge from a criminal.
That would suggest that I take him seriously;
That I see him as an equal.
The challenge is declined.
When Ragnar Lothbrok appears in Kattegat,
He will be put in chains.
Stones and bones.
He searches for your death.
Does he desire to be Earl?
If he kills you, would it not be so?
Tell Ragnar Lothbrok I accept his challenge.
Take him away.
Ragnar...
What?
Let's go away.
Let's leave here.
This is not the only place for us.
He is old.
What are you frightened of?
You can't fight.
You're still too weak.
Perhaps that makes us equal.
Never fight unless you know the odds are in your favor.
That is our way.
Who sets the odds?
Our fates are already decided.
You don't believe that and neither do I.
You are wrong
I do believe it.
come to bed.
You need to rest, to sleep.
Yes, I will.
There's always time to sleep.
I was thinking about our boys,
What they would look like now.
Don't...
Don't think about them.
Think about tomorrow.
When I must kill a man
For whom I have the utmost respect.
Respect?
You respect Ragnar Lothbrok?
Why not?
He is what I used to be -
Restless, ambitious.
And he was right about the western lands.
But I always knew that in my heart.
Then why didn't you tell him?
Because the moment that I reached out
Was the moment that all my friends,
All my supporters would have deserted me
And joined him.
It was impossible to do it.
Our fates have brought us together.
And maybe he's opened the western lands for me.
That is my hope, after I kill him.
The seer promised you would kill him?
Yes.
Good.
I'm sure that's our first child.
Now get up and fetch me some pickled herrings.
I'm starving.
I don't like the smell of them in the bed.
Your clothes are smelly enough as it is.
Why can't you just wash like everyone else?
I thought a wife wasn't supposed to nag her husband
Until they'd had time to grow tired of each other?
If you don't get up and fetch me some herrings
I will beat you.
Perhaps that will make you show a little life
When we have sex, in any case!
Very well.
I'll go.
I can't wait till tomorrow.
Personal combat is always thrilling.
Who is this Ragnar Lothbrok?
I've heard many people talk about him.
Thyri I don't talk about him.
He's my father's enemy.
Lord,
High one, hear me.
Listen to me.
Give me your favor this day.
Grant me your blessing as you have done in the past,
And I will make a sacrifice of my enemy,
If his death pleases you.
Give me a sign...
I cannot feel your presence...
Husband...?
Our sons hair.
Believe at least in them,
And in yourself.
Don't look so worried.

Lord Ragnar,
I have come to swear to you my allegiance
And fealty to you and your family
From this day.
Leif, you are my friend.
And you, Torstein,
And you, Arne,
You are my friends.
What is your name?
Old Tostig, Lord Ragnar.
Do you swear allegiance and fealty
To me and to my family

Aye.
There is no need for you to swear.
You have already paid a heavy price
For your loyalty to me.
Nevertheless, I will swear, brother.
I swear to be true to you,
Your wife and your family...
As long as your good fortune holds.
How will we ever be equal now, my brother?
Why have you agreed to grant Earl Haraldson
Such a big funeral.
Was he not your enemy?
He was also a great man and a warrior.
He earned his renown in this life,
And now, in death, he deserves such a funeral.
I want to show you something.

You will stay, or my father will hear of it.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Hail, Ragnar Lothbrok!
Hail, Ragnar!
Ragnar!
Hail, Ragnar!
Hail, Ragnar Lothbrok!
Move!
I ask permission to light the pyre.
I have something important to tell you, husband.
I am with child again.
I know you're a boy!

O by all the gods, my son,
You have made me a happy man.

Oh, well said.

Let the serpents bite these devils.
Let them also bite those too weak
And afraid to fight to the death
For their king and master.
My Lord!
No!
No!
You look terrified, my Lord wigea.
Have you lost your faith?
Are you not certain anymore
That god will raise you up from the grave?
Have mercy
Personally, I hope he does not.
I hope he leaves you there to rot.

And I watched all the companions of my youth die.
And though I fought with them in the shield-wall,
Never once was I touched by a blade.
All the friends and companions of my youth are dead
And feasting and drinking with the aesir
In the halls of the gods!
While I...
I am forsaken
Bereft.
Which is why, I beg you, lord,
Gift me the chance to die with honor in battle,
And join my friends in valhalla.
Ragnar:
(grunts in pain)
This summer, we shall have more ships to go west,
For that is our future.
When we return to England...
Let's take him with us!
All in favor?
All:
Aye.
There is no need for you to swear.
You have already paid a heavy price
For your loyalty to me.
Nevertheless, I will swear, brother.
I swear to be true to you,
Your wife and your family...
As long as your good fortune holds.

How will we ever be equal now, my brother?

Why have you agreed to grant earl haraldson
Such a big funeral.
Was he not your enemy?
He was also a great man and a warrior.
He earned his renown in this life,
And now, in death, he deserves such a funeral.
I want to show you something.

The twilight of the gods will happen like this:
There will be three years of terrible winters... (winds howl)
And summers of black sunlight.
(wings flutter)
People will lose all hope
And surrender to greed,
Incest and civil war.
Midgardsormen, the world serpent,
Will come lunging from the ocean,
Dragging the tides in and flooding the world.
(water rushes)
The wolf, giant fenrir,
Will break his invisible chains...
The skies will open
And surt the fire-giant
Will come flaming across the bridge
To destroy the gods.
Odin will ride out of the gates of valhalla
To do battle for a last time against the wolf.
Thor will kill the serpent,
But die from its venom.
(wolf snarls)
Surt will spread fire across the earth.
(flames crackle)
At last, fenrir will swallow the sun.
Nooooooooo!
(birds chirp)
(water churns)
(water churns as they row)
King aelle:
So where did these northmen come ashore?
Messenger:
They didn't.
What do you mean, they didn't?
Messenger:
They came in three ships,
And those ships are now sailing up the tyne.
They have ships that can cross oceans
But also sail up rivers?
What manner of men are these?
If they are sailing up the tyne,
Then, sire, we shall soon find out.
Ah yes, my lord wigea,
Of course you know all about them.
You accused them of having supernatural powers,
Which is why a small force of them defeated you.
Lord wigea:
I merely said they fought like demons,
Like men possessed, with no fear of death.
Unlike you, my lord?
I fear death as much as the next man,
But I have no fear that afterwards
God will raise me up again.
Oh, well said.
(claps)
Come, all of you!
I have something new to show you.
(chains clank, flaps creak)
Let the serpents bite these devils.
Let them also bite those too weak
And afraid to fight to the death
For their king and master.
My lord!
No!
No!
You look terrified, my lord wigea.
Have you lost your faith?
Are you not certain anymore
That god will raise you up from the grave?
Lord wigea:
Have mercy!
Personally, I hope he does not.
I hope he leaves you there to rot.
Nooooooo!
Ungh!
(hissing)
No!
Christ!
God!
Nooooo!
(yells out in pain as a snake bites him)
Now let us prepare to defend ourselves
Against these heathens and barbarians.
What is this?
My Lord, this man says he has a message for you from Ragnar Lothbrok.
Let him go.
What's the message?
Ragnar Lothbrok challenges you to meet him in single combat.
Ragnar Lothbrok has a very high opinion of himself.
Well, he is a descendant of Odin.
Ragnar said that if you refuse his challenge, then shame would follow you the rest of your life.
There would be greater shame in accepting a challenge from a criminal.
That would suggest that I take him seriously, that I see him as an equal.
The challenge is declined.
When Ragnar Lothbrok appears in Kattegat, he will be put in chains.
Stones and bones.
He searches for your death.
Does he desire to be Earl?
If he kills you, would it not be so?
Tell Ragnar Lothbrok I accept his challenge.
Take him away.
- Ragnar.
- What?
Let's go away.
Let's leave here.
This is not the only place for us.
He is old.
What are you frightened of?
You can't fight.
You're still too weak.
Perhaps that makes us equal.
Never fight unless you know the odds are in your favor.
That is our way.
Who sets the odds?
Our fates are already decided.
You don't believe that, and neither do I.
You are wrong.
I do believe it.
Come to bed.
You need to rest, to sleep.
Yes, I will.
There's always time to sleep.
I was thinking about our boys, what they would look like now.
Don't.
Don't think about them.
Think about tomorrow.
When I must kill a man for whom I have the utmost respect.
Respect?
You respect Ragnar Lothbrok?
Why not?
He is what I used to be, restless, ambitious.
And he was right about the western lands.
But I always knew that in my heart.
Then why didn't you tell him?
Because the moment that I reached out to Ragnar Lothbrok was the moment that all my friends, all my supporters would have deserted me and joined him.
It was impossible to do it.
But it's true our fates have brought us together.
And maybe he's opened the western lands for me.
That is my hope after I kill him.
The Seer promised you would kill him?
Yes.
Good.
I'm sure that's our first child.
Now get up and fetch me some pickled herrings.
I'm starving.
I don't like the smell of them in the bed.
Your clothes are smelly enough as it is.
Why can't you just wash like everyone else?
I thought a wife wasn't supposed to nag her husband until they'd had time to grow tired of each other?
If you don't get up and fetch me some herrings,
I will beat you.
Perhaps that will make you show a little life when we have sex in any case.
Very well.
I'll go.
I can't wait till tomorrow.
Personal combat is always thrilling.
Who is this Ragnar Lothbrok?
I've heard many people talk about him.
I don't talk about him.
He's my father's enemy.
Lord,
High One, hear me.
Listen to me.
Give me your favor this day.
Grant me your blessing as you have done in the past, and I will make a sacrifice of my enemy if his death pleases you.
Give me a sign.
I cannot feel your presence.
Husband.
Our sons' hair.
Believe at least in them and in yourself.
Don't look so worried.
This is a personal combat.
The combatants can choose any weapon and shield they desire.
Each man has two shields.
If both are broken, there can be no further replacement.
Fight, Ragnar!
Father, you can do it!
You can do it, Earl!
Finish him!
He is weak!
Lord Odin is here, waiting to see which one of us he will take to his great hall.
So I shall dine after all at the high table of the Aesir.
No!
No!
No!
Tonight I shall be drinking with our boys.
Kill him.
Kill him!
Hail, Earl Ragnar.

Lord Ragnar,
I have come to swear to you my allegiance and fealty to you and your family from this day.
Leif, you are my friend.
And you, Torstein, and you, Arne, you are my friends.
What is your name?
Tostig, Lord Ragnar.
Do you swear allegiance and fealty to me and to my family from this day forth?
That won't be so long then.
By my sacred rings, I swear.
But I also have a favor to ask, Lord.
What is this favor?
That the next time you go raiding, you take me with you.
I do not wish to insult you, but the truth is you...
That I am too old?
Yes, I am old.
But I have been a warrior all my life.
Many years I sailed with Lord Haraldson and fought battles against the Eastlanders, and I watched all the companions of my youth die.

I swear to be true to you, your wife and your family as long as your good fortune holds.
How will we ever be equal now, my brother?

He was also a great man and warrior.
He earned his renown in this life, and now, in death, he deserves such a funeral.

I am with child again.

you have made me a happy man.

Now, let us prepare to defend ourselves against these heathens and barbarians.
LOTHBROK:
Previously on Vikings...
This is an ambitious man.
And he resents the fact that he owes me loyalty and obedience, as his chieftain.
(YELLING)
- Do you accept that you are a criminal?
- (GRUNTING)

- Worthy only of death?

BJORN:
Where is father?
Is he dead?
He's dead!
I've come to warn you.
My husband, he hates you.
Get away.
TORSTEIN:
Earl Haraldson had played a trick on Rollo, and imprisoned him, trying to find where you were.
Then he tortured him.
He tortured my brother?
It's a trap for you, Ragnar.
I want you to ask for a meeting with the Earl.
Challenge him to a personal combat.
With me.

This is not the only place for us.

What are you frightened of?
You can't fight.

Perhaps that makes us equal.
Never fight unless you know the odds are in your favor.
That is our way.
Who sets the odds?
Our fates are already decided.
You don't believe that, and neither do I.
You are wrong.
I do believe it.

Come to bed.
You need to rest, to sleep.
Yes, I will.
There's always time to sleep.

Don't.

Why have you agreed to grant Earl Haraldson such a big funeral?
Was he not your enemy?
He was also a great man and warrior.
He earned his renown in this life, and now, in death, he deserves such a funeral.
I want to show you something.
(SINGING) I dreamt a dream last night
Of silk as fine fur
Now an Earl is felled by spears
It is horrible now to look around

She's one of the Earl's slaves.
When he died, all of his slave women were asked, "Who wants to die with him?"
This one agreed.
She wants to die?

I know you're a boy.
The Seer told me.
By all the gods, my son, you have made me a happy man.
(BOTH GASP)
Have you come to kill us?
Why would I do that?
Because Ragnar told you to.
It is often the way that the new Earl deals with the family of the old.
Ragnar won't kill you.
How can you be sure?
My brother doesn't hold grudges.
He's strange that way.
Well, even if we don't die, they will still shun us like a bad smell.
And they'll make it so we have to leave here, even though they know no one else will take us in.
They won't.
Not if I vouch for you.
No one will force you to go anywhere.
They wouldn't dare.
What do you want in return?
You were once married to an Earl.
Would you not like to be married to another one?
Who?
What do you mean who?
Me.
(CHATTERING)
The pigs are fattening nicely.
Just like your mother.
It's cold even in here.
I can't wait for the spring or the raids.
I want to go to England.
No.
- What?
- I said no.
- But why?
- Because I said so.
Don't be too impatient to put yourself in danger.
But you cannot alter my fate!
You sound like your uncle when he doesn't know what to say.
Come on.
ATHELSTAN:
Ragnar, I have heard many of your stories, but tell me, what is Ragnarok?
I have heard mention of it several times, but so far no one has explained the meaning to me.
Let's show this ignorant Christian what Ragnarok is.
Get the leaves.
The twilight of the gods will happen like this.
There will be three years of terrible winters and summers of black sunlight.
People will lose all hope and surrender to greed, incest and civil war.
(GROWLING)
Midgardsormen, the world's serpent, will come lunging from the ocean, dragging the tides in and flooding the world.
The wolf, giant Fenrir, will break his invisible chains.
The skies will open, and Surt, the fire-giant, will come flaming across the bridge to destroy the gods.
Odin will ride out of the gates of Valhalla to do battle for a last time against the wolf.
Thor will kill the serpent but die from its venom.
Surt will spread fire across the earth.
At last, Fenrir will swallow the sun.
No!
So where did these Northmen come ashore?
- They didn't.
- What do you mean, they didn't?
They came in three ships, and those ships are now sailing up the Tyne.
They have ships that can cross oceans but also sail up rivers?
What manner of men are these?
If they are sailing up the Tyne, then, sire, we shall soon find out.
Yes, My Lord Wigea, of course you know all about them.
You accused them of having supernatural powers, which is why a small force of them defeated you.
I merely said they fought like demons, like men possessed, with no fear of death.
Unlike you, My Lord?
I fear death as much as the next man, but I have no fear that afterwards God will raise me up again.
Well said.
Come, all of you!
I have something new to show you.
AELLE:
Let the serpents bite these devils.
Let them also bite those too weak and afraid to fight to the death for their king and master.
My Lord!
No!
No!
You look terrified, My Lord Wigea.
Have you lost your faith?
Are you not certain anymore that God will raise you up from the grave?
Have mercy!
Personally, I hope he does not.
I hope he leaves you there to rot.
No!
(GRUNTS)
Lord...
God!
(GROANS)
Now, let us prepare to defend ourselves against these heathens and barbarians.
Previously on "Vikings":
This is an ambitious man.
And he resents the fact that he owes me loyalty and obedience as his chieftain.
Attack!
You accept that you're a criminal?
Worthy only of defeat.
After him!
Worthy only of death.
Where is father?
Is he dead?
He's dead!
I've come to warn you.
My husband, he hates you.
Get away.
Earl Haraldson has played a trick on Rollo and imprisoned him, trying to find where you where.
Then he tortured him.
He tortured my brother?
It's a trap for you, Ragnar.
I want you to ask for a meeting with the Earl, challenge him to a personal combat...
With me.
♪ more, give me more ♪
♪ give me more
♪ if I had a heart I could love you ♪
♪ if I had a voice I would sing ♪
♪ after the night when I wake up ♪
♪ I'll see what tomorrow brings ♪
♪ I...
I...
I...
♪ If I had a voice I would sing ♪
What is it?
My lord, this man says he has a message for you from Ragnar Lothbrok.
Let him go!
What's the message?
Ragnar Lothbrok challenges you to meet him in single combat.
Ragnar Lothbrok has a very high opinion of himself.
Well, he is a descendant of Odin.
Ragnar said that if you refuse his challenge, then shame would follow you the rest of your life.
There would be greater shame in accepting a challenge from a criminal.
That would suggest that I take him seriously;
That I see him as an equal.
The challenge is declined.
When Ragnar Lothbrok appears in Kattegat, he will be put in chains.
Stones and bones.
He searches for your death.
Does he desire to be Earl?
If he kills you, would it not be so?
Tell Ragnar Lothbrok I accept his challenge.
Take him away.
- Ragnar...
- What?
Let's go away.
Let's leave here.
This is not the only place for us.
He is old.
What are you frightened of?
You can't fight.
You're still too weak.
Perhaps that makes us equal.
Never fight unless you know the odds are in your favor.
That is our way.
Who sets the odds?
Our fates are already decided.
You don't believe that and neither do I.
I do believe it.
Come to bed.
You need to rest, to sleep.
Yes, I will.
There's always time to sleep.
I was thinking about our boys, what they would look like now.
Don't...
Don't think about them.
Think about tomorrow.
When I must kill a man for whom I have the utmost respect.
Respect?
You respect Ragnar Lothbrok?
Why not?
He is what I used to be... restless, ambitious.
And he was right about the Western lands.
But I always knew that in my heart.
Then why didn't you tell him?
Because the moment that I reached out to Ragnar Lothbrok, was the moment that all my friends, all my supporters would have deserted me and joined him.
It was impossible to do it.
But it's true, our fates have brought us together.
And maybe he's opened the Western lands for me.
That is my hope, after I kill him.
The seer promised you would kill him?
Yes.
Good.
I'm sure that's our first child.
Now get up and fetch me some pickled herrings.
I'm starving.
I don't like the smell of them in the bed.
Your clothes are smelly enough as it is.
Why can't you just wash like everyone else?
I thought a wife wasn't supposed to nag her husband until they'd had time to grow tired of each other?
If you don't get up and fetch me some herrings
I will beat you.
Perhaps that will make you show a little life when we have sex, in any case!
Very well.
I'll go.
I can't wait till tomorrow.
Personal combat is always thrilling.
Who is this Ragnar Lothbrok?
I've heard many people talk about him.
Thyri I don't talk about him.
He's my father's enemy.
Lord, high one, hear me.
Listen to me.
Give me your favor this day.
Grant me your blessing as you have done in the past, and I will make a sacrifice of my enemy, if his death pleases you.
Give me a sign...
I cannot feel your presence...
Husband...?
Our sons hair.
Believe at least in them, and in yourself.
Don't look so worried.
This is a personal combat.
The combatants can choose any weapon and shield they desire.
Each man has two shields.
If both are broken, there can be no further replacement.
Father, you can do it!
You can do it, Earl!
Finish him!
Agghhh!
Agghhh!
Ungh!
Agh!
Agh!
Agh!
Lord odin is here, waiting to see which one of us he will take to his great hall.
So I shall...
I shall dine, after all, at the high table with the Aesir.
No!
No!
No!
Tonight I shall be drinking with our boys.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Aghhhh!

Lord Ragnar,
I have come to swear to you my allegiance and fealty to you and your family from this day.
Leif, you are my friend.
And you, Torstein, and you, Arne, you are my friends.
What is your name?
Tostig, lord Ragnar.
Do you swear allegiance and fealty to me and to my family from this day forth?
That won't be so long then!
By my sacred rings I swear.
But I also have a favor to ask, lord.
What is this favor?
That the next time you go raiding, you take me with you.
I do not wish to insult you, but the truth is you...
That I am too old?
Yes, I am old.
But I have been a warrior all my life.
Many years I sailed with lord Haraldson and fought battles against the Eastlanders, and I watched all the companions of my youth die.
And though I fought with them in the shield-wall, never once was I touched by a blade.
All the friends and companions of my youth are dead and feasting and drinking with the Aesir in the halls of the gods!
While I...
I am forsaken.
Bereft.
Which is why, I beg you, lord, gift me the chance to die with honor in battle, and join my friends in Valhalla.
This summer, we shall have more ships to go west, for that is our future.
When we return to England...
Let's take him with us!
All in favor?
Aye.
There is no need for you to swear.
You have already paid a heavy price for your loyalty to me.
Nevertheless, I will swear, brother.
I swear to be true to you, your wife and your family...
As long as your good fortune holds.
How will we ever be equal now, my brother?
Why have you agreed to grant Earl Haraldson such a big funeral.
Was he not your enemy?
He was also a great man and a warrior.
He earned his renown in this life, and now, in death, he deserves such a funeral.
I want to show you something.

Who is she?
She's one of the Earl's slaves.

"Who wants to die with him?"
This one agreed.
She wants to die?
These other servants are preparing her.
♪ As the valkyries sing their song ♪
Put the body on the bench.
Let's make our offerings.
You need a drink, priest.
Drink.

There's that slave girl... the one who has chosen to die.
What are they doing?
She is having sex with the men that live in there.
Each one of them says to her:
"Tell your master I did this out of love for him."
Because she will soon be reunited with her master in death, and she will be able to speak to him.
Silence!
Bjorn, who is that woman?
We call her the angel of death.
I can see my master!
He is in Valhalla.
He calls me.
Let me join him then.
I cannot stay.
What's the matter with you, priest?
I don't want to watch.
It's only death!
You will stay, or my father will hear of it.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Hail, Ragnar Lothbrok!

Tell Ragnar Lothbrok I accept his challenge.
Take him away.
- Ragnar.
- What?
Let's go away.
Let's leave here.
This is not the only place for us.
He is old.
What are you frightened of?
You can't fight.
You're still too weak.
Perhaps that makes us equal.
Never fight unless you know the odds are in your favor.
That is our way.
Who sets the odds?
Our fates are already decided.
You don't believe that, and neither do I.
You are wrong.
I do believe it.
Come to bed.
You need to rest, to sleep.
Yes, I will.
There's always time to sleep.
I was thinking about our boys, what they would look like now.
Don't.
Don't think about them.
Think about tomorrow.
When I must kill a man for whom I have the utmost respect.
Respect?
You respect Ragnar Lothbrok?
Why not?
He is what I used to be, restless, ambitious.
And he was right about the western lands.
But I always knew that in my heart.
Then why didn't you tell him?
Because the moment that I reached out to Ragnar Lothbrok is the moment that all my friends, all my supporters would have deserted me and joined him.
It was impossible to do it.
But it's true our fates have brought us together.
And maybe he's opened the western lands for me.
That is my hope after I kill him.
The Seer promised you would kill him?
Yes.
Good.
I'm sure that's our first child.
Now get up and fetch me some pickled herrings.
I'm starving.
I don't like the smell of them in the bed.
Your clothes are smelly enough as it is.
Why can't you just wash like everyone else?
I thought a wife wasn't supposed to nag her husband until they'd had time to grow tired of each other?
If you don't get up and fetch me some herrings,
I will beat you.
Perhaps that will make you show a little life when we have sex in any case.
Very well.
I'll go.
I can't wait till tomorrow.
Personal combat is always thrilling.
Who is this Ragnar Lothbrok?
I've heard many people talk about him.
I don't talk about him.
He's my father's enemy.
Ooh...
Lord, High One, hear me.
Listen to me.
Give me your favor this day.
Grant me your blessing as you have done in the past, and I will make a sacrifice of my enemy if his death pleases you.
Give me a sign.
I cannot feel your presence.
Husband.
Our sons' hair.
Believe at least in them and in yourself.
Don't look so worried.
This is a personal combat.
The combatants can choose any weapon and shield they desire.
Each man has two shields.
If both are broken, there can be no further replacement.
Fight, Ragnar!
Father, you can do it!
You can do it, Earl!
Finish him!
He is weak!
Lord Odin is here, waiting to see which one of us he will take to his great hall.
So I shall dine after all at the high table of the Aesir.
No!
No!
No!
Tonight I shall be drinking with our boys.
Kill him.
Kill him!
Hail, Earl Ragnar.
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
- Take it!
- Take it!
Take it!
Lord Ragnar,
I have come to swear to you my allegiance and fealty to you and your family from this day.
Leif, you are my friend.
And you, Torstein, and you, Arne, you are my friends.
What is your name?
Tostig, Lord Ragnar.
Do you swear allegiance and fealty to me and to my family from this day forth?
That won't be so long then.
By my sacred rings, I swear.
But I also have a favor to ask, Lord.
What is this favor?
That the next time you go raiding, you take me with you.
I do not wish to insult you, but the truth is you...
That I am too old?
Yes, I am old.
But I have been a warrior all my life.
Many years I sailed with Lord Haraldson and fought battles against the Eastlanders, and I watched all the companions of my youth die.
And though I fought with them in the shield-wall, never once was I touched by a blade.
All the friends and companions of my youth are dead and feasting and drinking with the Aesir in the halls of the gods!
While I, I am forsaken, bereft.
Which is why I beg you, Lord, gift me the chance to die with honor in battle and join my friends in Valhalla.
This summer, we shall have more ships to go west, for that is our future.
When we return to England, let's take him with us.
All in favor?
Aye.
There is no need for you to swear.
You have already paid a heavy price for your loyalty to me.
Nevertheless, I will swear, brother.
I swear to be true to you, your wife and your family as long as your good fortune holds.
How will we ever be equal now, my brother?
Why have you agreed to grant Earl Haraldson such a big funeral?
Was he not your enemy?
He was also a great man and warrior.
He earned his renown in this life, and now, in death, he deserves such a funeral.
I want to show you something.
I dreamt a dream last night
Of silk as fine fur
Now an Earl is felled by spears
It is horrible now to look around
Who is she?
She's one of the Earl's slaves.
When he died, all of his slave women were asked, "Who wants to die with him?"
This one agreed.
She wants to die?
These other servants are preparing her.
As the valkyries sing their song
Put the body on the bench.
Let's make our offerings.
You need a drink, priest.
Drink.
Drink!
There's that slave girl, the one who has chosen to die.
What are they doing?
She is having sex with the men who live in there.
Each one of them says to her,
"Tell your master I did this out of love for him."
Because she will soon be reunited with her master in death, and she will be able to speak to him.
Silence!
Bjorn, who is that woman?
We call her the Angel of Death.
I can see my master.
He is in Valhalla.
He calls me.
Let me join him then.
I cannot stay.
What's the matter with you, priest?
I don't want to watch.
It's only death.
You will stay, or my father will hear of it.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Hail!
Hail, Ragnar Lothbrok!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Ragnar Lothbrok!
Move!
I ask permission to light the pyre.
I have something important to tell you, husband.
I am with child again.
I know you're a boy.
The Seer told me.
By all the gods, my son, you have made me a happy man.
Have you come to kill us?
Why would I do that?
Because Ragnar told you to.
It is often the way that the new Earl deals with the family of the old.
Ragnar won't kill you.
How can you be sure?
My brother doesn't hold grudges.
He's strange that way.
Well, even if we don't die, they will still shun us like a bad smell.
And they'll make it so we have to leave here, even though they know no one else will take us in.
They won't.
Not if I vouch for you.
No one will force you to go anywhere.
They wouldn't dare.
What do you want in return?
You were once married to an Earl.
Would you not like to be married to another one?
Who?
What do you mean who?
Me.
The pigs are fattening nicely.
Just like your mother.
It's cold even in here.
I can't wait for the spring or the raids.
I want to go to England.
No.
- What?
- I said no.
- But why?
- Because I said so.
Don't be too impatient to put yourself in danger.
But you cannot alter my fate!
You sound like your uncle when he doesn't know what to say.
Come on.
Ragnar, I have heard many of your stories, but tell me, what is Ragnarok?
I have heard mention of it several times, but so far no one has explained the meaning to me.
Let's show this ignorant Christian what Ragnarok is.
Get the leaves.
The twilight of the gods will happen like this.
There will be three years of terrible winters and summers of black sunlight.
People will lose all hope and surrender to greed, incest and civil war.
Midgardsormen, the world's serpent, will come lunging from the ocean, dragging the tides in and flooding the world.
The wolf, giant Fenrir, will break his invisible chains.
The skies will open, and Surt, the fire-giant, will come flaming across the bridge to destroy the gods.
Odin will ride out of the gates of Valhalla to do battle for a last time against the wolf.
Thor will kill the serpent but die from its venom.
Surt will spread fire across the earth.
At last, Fenrir will swallow the sun.
No!
So where did these Northmen come ashore?
- They didn't.
- What do you mean, they didn't?
They came in three ships, and those ships are now sailing up the Tyne.
They have ships that can cross oceans but also sail up rivers?
What manner of men are these?
If they are sailing up the Tyne, then, sire, we shall soon find out.
Yes, My Lord Wigea, of course you know all about them.
You accused them of having supernatural powers, which is why a small force of them defeated you.
I merely said they fought like demons, like men possessed, with no fear of death.
Unlike you, My Lord?
I fear death as much as the next man, but I have no fear that afterwards God will raise me up again.
Well said.
Come, all of you!
I have something new to show you.
Let the serpents bite these devils.
Let them also bite those too weak and afraid to fight to the death for their king and master.
My Lord!
No!
No!
You look terrified, My Lord Wigea.
Have you lost your faith?
Are you not certain anymore that God will raise you up from the grave?
Have mercy!
Personally, I hope he does not.
I hope he leaves you there to rot.
No!
Lord...
God!
Now, let us prepare to defend ourselves against these heathens and barbarians.
Previously on "Vikings":
This is an ambitious man.
And he resents the fact that he owes me
Loyalty and obedience as his chieftain.
You accept that you're a criminal?
Worthy only of defeat.
After him!
Worthy only of death.
Where is father?
Is he dead?
I've come to warn you.
My husband, he hates you.
Earl Haraldson has played a trick on Rollo
Trying to find where you where.
Then he tortured him.
He tortured my brother?
It's a trap for you, Ragnar.
I want you to ask for a meeting with the earl,
Challenge him to a personal combat...
With me.
What is it?
My lord, this man says he has a message for you
From Ragnar Lothbrok.
Let him go!
What's the message?
Ragnar Lothbrok challenges you to meet him in single combat.
Ragnar Lothbrok has a very high opinion of himself.
Well, he is a descendant of Odin.
Ragnar said that if you refuse his challenge,
Then shame would follow you the rest of your life.
There would be greater shame
In accepting a challenge from a criminal.
That would suggest that I take him seriously;
That I see him as an equal.
The challenge is declined.
When Ragnar Lothbrok appears in Kattegat,
He will be put in chains.
Stones and bones.
He searches for your death.
Does he desire to be earl?
If he kills you, would it not be so?
Tell Ragnar Lothbrok I accept his challenge.
Take him away.
Ragnar...
What?
Let's go away.
Let's leave here.
This is not the only place for us.
He is old.
What are you frightened of?
You can't fight.
You're still too weak.
Perhaps that makes us equal.
Never fight unless you know the odds are in your favor.
That is our way.
Who sets the odds?
Our fates are already decided.
You don't believe that and neither do I.
You are wrong:
I do believe it.
Come to bed.
You need to rest, to sleep.
Yes, I will.
There's always time to sleep.
I was thinking about our boys,
What they would look like now.
Don't...
Don't think about them.
Think about tomorrow.
When I must kill a man
For whom I have the utmost respect.
Respect?
You respect Ragnar Lothbrok?
Why not?
He is what I used to be -
Restless, ambitious.
And he was right about the western lands.
But I always knew that in my heart.
Then why didn't you tell him?
Because the moment that I reached out
Was the moment that all my friends,
All my supporters would have deserted me
And joined him.
It was impossible to do it.
Our fates have brought us together.
And maybe he's opened the western lands for me.
That is my hope, after I kill him.
The seer promised you would kill him?
Yes.
Good.
I'm sure that's our first child.
Now get up and fetch me some pickled herrings.
I'm starving.
I don't like the smell of them in the bed.

When we have sex, in any case!
Very well.
I'll go.
I can't wait till tomorrow.
Personal combat is always thrilling.
Who is this Ragnar Lothbrok?
I've heard many people talk about him.
Thyri I don't talk about him.
He's my father's enemy.
Lord, High one, hear me.
Listen to me.
Give me your favor this day.
Grant me your blessing as you have done in the past,
And I will make a sacrifice of my enemy,
If his death pleases you.
Give me a sign...
I cannot feel your presence...
Husband...?
Our sons hair.
Believe at least in them, And in yourself.
Don't look so worried.
This is a personal combat.
The combatants can choose any weapon
And shield they desire.
Each man has two shields.
If both are broken,
There can be no further replacement.
Father, you can do it!
You can do it, earl!
Finish him!
Agghhh!
Agghhh!
Ungh!
Agh!
Agh!
Agh!
Lord Odin is here,
Waiting to see which one of us
He will take to his great hall.
So I shall...
I shall dine, after all,
At the high table with the Aesir.
No!
No!
No!
Tonight I shall be drinking with our boys.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Aghhhh!
Hail, earl Ragnar.
Hail, earl Ragnar!
Hail, earl Ragnar!
Hail, earl Ragnar!
Hail, earl Ragnar!
Hail, earl Ragnar!
Hail, earl Ragnar!
Hail, earl Ragnar.
Hail, earl Ragnar!
Hail, earl Ragnar!
Hail, earl Ragnar!
Take it!
Take it!
Take it!
Take it!
Lord Ragnar,
I have come to swear to you my allegiance
And fealty to you and your family
From this day.
Leif, you are my friend.
And you, Torstein, And you, Arne,
You are my friends.
What is your name?
Tostig, lord Ragnar.
Do you swear allegiance and fealty
To me and to my family From this day forth?
That won't be so long then!
By my sacred rings I swear.
But I also have a favor to ask, lord.
What is this favor?
That the next time you go raiding,
You take me with you.
I do not wish to insult you, but the truth is you-
That I am too old?
Yes, I am old.
But I have been a warrior all my life.
Many years I sailed with lord Haraldson
And fought battles against the eastlanders,
And I watched all the companions of my youth die.
And though I fought with them in the shield-wall,
Never once was I touched by a blade.
All the friends and companions of my youth are dead
And feasting and drinking with the Aesir
In the halls of the gods!
While I...
I am forsaken
Bereft.
Which is why, I beg you, lord,
Gift me the chance to die with honor in battle,
And join my friends in Valhalla.
This summer, we shall have more ships to go west,
For that is our future.
When we return to England...
Let's take him with us!
All in favor?
Aye.
There is no need for you to swear.
You have already paid a heavy price
For your loyalty to me.
Nevertheless, I will swear, brother.
I swear to be true to you,
Your wife and your family...
As long as your good fortune holds.
How will we ever be equal now, my brother?
Why have you agreed to grant earl Haraldson
Such a big funeral.
Was he not your enemy?
He was also a great man and a warrior.
He earned his renown in this life,
And now, in death, he deserves such a funeral.
I want to show you something.
Who is she?
She's one of the earl's slaves.
When he died,
All of his slave women were asked:
"who wants to die with him?"
This one agreed.
She wants to die?
These other servants are preparing her.
Put the body on the bench.
Let's make our offerings.
You need a drink, priest.
Drink.
Drink!
There's that slave girl -
The one who has chosen to die.
What are they doing?
She is having sex with the men that live in there.
Each one of them says to her:
"tell your master I did this out of love for him."
Because she will soon be reunited
With her master in death,
And she will be able to speak to him.
Silence!
Bjorn, who is that woman?
We call her the angel of death.
I can see my master!
He is in Valhalla.
He calls me.
Let me join him then.
I cannot stay.
What's the matter with you, priest?
I don't want to watch.
It's only death!
You will stay, or my father will hear of it.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Hail, Ragnar Lothbrok!
Hail, Ragnar!
Ragnar!
Hail, Ragnar!
Hail, Ragnar Lothbrok!
Move!
I ask permission to light the pyre.
I have something important to tell you, husband.
I am with child again.
I know you're a boy!
The seer told me.
Oh by all the gods, my son,
You have made me a happy man.

Nooooooooo!
So where did these northmen come ashore?

Let the serpents bite these devils.
Let them also bite those too weak
And afraid to fight to the death
For their king and master.
My lord!
No!
No!
You look terrified, my lord Wigea.
Have you lost your faith?
Are you not certain anymore
That god will raise you up from the grave?
Have mercy!
Personally, I hope he does not.
I hope he leaves you there to rot.
Nooooooo!
Ungh!
No!
Christ!
God!
Nooooo!
Now let us prepare to defend ourselves
Against these heathens and barbarians.
Ragnar:

Loyalty and obedience as his chieftain.
Earl Haraldson:

(low hum of chatter in the hall)
Svein:
What is it?
(Floki giggles)
Housecarl 1:
My lord, this man says he has a message for you
From Ragnar Lothbrok.
Let him go!
What's the message?
Ragnar Lothbrok challenges you to meet him in single combat.
Ragnar Lothbrok has a very high opinion of himself.
Well, he is a descendant of Odin.
(everyone laughs)

Ragnar said that if you refuse his challenge,
Then shame would follow you the rest of your life.

Stones and bones.
He searches for your death.
Does he desire to be earl?
If he kills you, would it not be so?
Tell Ragnar Lothbrok I accept his challenge.
Take him away.
(water rushes)
(Lagertha and Ragnar moan in pleasure)
(fire crackles)
Ragnar...
What?
Let's go away.
Let's leave here.
This is not the only place for us.
Ragnar:
He is old.
What are you frightened of?
You can't fight.
You're still too weak.
Perhaps that makes us equal.
Never fight unless you know the odds are in your favor.
That is our way.
Ragnar:
Who sets the odds?
Our fates are already decided.
(breathing heavily)
Lagertha:
You don't believe that and neither do I.
Ragnar:
You are wrong:
I do believe it.
(howling in the distance)
Siggy: (quietly) come to bed.
You need to rest, to sleep.
Earl Haraldson:
Yes, I will.
There's always time to sleep.
I was thinking about our boys,
What they would look like now.
Don't...
Don't think about them.
Think about tomorrow.
When I must kill a man
For whom I have the utmost respect.
Siggy:
Respect?
You respect Ragnar Lothbrok?
Why not?
He is what I used to be -
Restless, ambitious.
And he was right about the western lands.

I'm starving.
I don't like the smell of them in the bed.

Thyri:
Very well.
I'll go.
Earl Bjarni:
I can't wait till tomorrow.
Personal combat is always thrilling.
Who is this Ragnar Lothbrok?
I've heard many people talk about him.
Thyri I don't talk about him.
He's my father's enemy.
(groans)
(groans in pain)
(exhales heavily)
(groans in pain)
(winds gust)
(quietly) lord, High one, hear me.
Listen to me.
Give me your favor this day.
Grant me your blessing as you have done in the past,
And I will make a sacrifice of my enemy,
If his death pleases you.
Give me a sign...
I cannot feel your presence... (sighs)
Husband...?
(fire crackles)
Our sons hair.
Believe at least in them, And in yourself.
(water laps)
(footsteps scuff)
Ragnar:
Don't look so worried.
(struggling grunts)
(a loud murmur)
Svein:
This is a personal combat.
The combatants can choose any weapon
And shield they desire.
Each man has two shields.
If both are broken,
There can be no further replacement.
Crowd:
(shocked gasps and murmurs)
(crowd chuckles)
(raining down blows)
(swords clank)
(supportive yelling and shouting)
(swords clank, grunts of effort)
(supportive yelling and shouting)
(fighting grunts)
(shields shatter)
Father, you can do it!
Woman:
You can do it, earl!
Finish him!
(supportive yelling and shouting)
(weapons clank)
(cheering)
(trading blows)
(grunting with effort)
Agghhh!
Agghhh!
(grunting with effort)
(massive blow) Ungh!
(supportive yelling and shouting)
Agh!
Agh!
Agh!
(axe slices, crowd gasps)
(crowd falls silent)
(landing thud)
(groans)
(tired exhales)
(wings flutter)
(tired exhales)
(groans in pain)
Lord Odin is here,
Waiting to see which one of us
He will take to his great hall.
So I shall...
I shall dine, after all,
At the high table with the Aesir.
(labored breathing)
(slices a vein)
Siggy:
(shouts) no!
No!
No!
(labored breathing)
Earl Haraldson:
Tonight I shall be drinking with our boys.
(exhales his final breaths)
Kill him!
Kill him!
(axe slices)
(gurgled breaths)
(knife slices, pained groans)
Aghhhh!
(waves lap at the shore)
Hail, earl Ragnar.
(shouts) hail, earl Ragnar!
Crowd:
Hail, earl Ragnar!
Hail, earl Ragnar!
Hail, earl Ragnar!
Hail, earl Ragnar!
Hail, earl Ragnar!
Hail, earl Ragnar.
Hail, earl Ragnar!
Hail, earl Ragnar!
Hail, earl Ragnar!
(low hum of chatter)
(everyone quiets down)
(pained grunt)
Man:
Take it!
Crowd:
Take it!
Take it!
(encouraging shouting)
Take it!
(cheering and applause)
(laughter)
Leif:
Lord Ragnar,
I have come to swear to you my allegiance
And fealty to you and your family
From this day.
Ragnar:
Leif, you are my friend.
And you, Torstein, And you, Arne,
You are my friends.
What is your name?
Old man:
Tostig, lord Ragnar.
Do you swear allegiance and fealty
To me and to my family From this day forth?
That won't be so long then!
(crowd laughs)
Tostig:
By my sacred rings I swear.
But I also have a favor to ask, lord.
What is this favor?
That the next time you go raiding,
You take me with you.
(crowd laughs)
(silence)
I do not wish to insult you, but the truth is you-
Tostig:
That I am too old?
(chuckles)
Yes, I am old.
But I have been a warrior all my life.
Many years I sailed with lord Haraldson
And fought battles against the eastlanders,
And I watched all the companions of my youth die.
And though I fought with them in the shield-wall,
Never once was I touched by a blade.
All the friends and companions of my youth are dead
And feasting and drinking with the Aesir
In the halls of the gods!
While I...
I am forsaken
Bereft.
Which is why, I beg you, lord,
Gift me the chance to die with honor in battle,
And join my friends in Valhalla.
Ragnar:
(grunts in pain)
This summer, we shall have more ships to go west,
For that is our future.
When we return to England...
Let's take him with us!
All in favor?
All:
Aye.
There is no need for you to swear.
You have already paid a heavy price
For your loyalty to me.
Nevertheless, I will swear, brother.
I swear to be true to you,
Your wife and your family...
As long as your good fortune holds.
Crowd:
(laughs)
How will we ever be equal now, my brother?
(excited chatter)
(horn bellows)
(geese honk)
(rain patters)
(horn bellows)
Why have you agreed to grant earl Haraldson
Such a big funeral.
Was he not your enemy?
He was also a great man and a warrior.
He earned his renown in this life,
And now, in death, he deserves such a funeral.
I want to show you something.
(low hum of chatter)
(she continues to sing)
Who is she?
She's one of the earl's slaves.
When he died,
All of his slave women were asked:
"who wants to die with him?"
This one agreed.
(giggling drunkenly)
She wants to die?
Ragnar:
These other servants are preparing her.
(festive cheering, laughter)
(cheering)
Old woman:
Put the body on the bench.
(boat creaks)
Siggy:
Let's make our offerings.
(fighting grunts)
(spectators cheer)
(laughter)
You need a drink, priest.
Drink.
Drink!
(laughter and chatter)
Athelstan:
There's that slave girl -
The one who has chosen to die.
What are they doing?
She is having sex with the men that live in there.
Each one of them says to her:
"tell your master I did this out of love for him."
Because she will soon be reunited
With her master in death,
And she will be able to speak to him.
(laughs)
(cheering)
(thunderous drumming)
(crowd cheers)
Old woman:
Silence!
Athelstan:
Bjorn, who is that woman?
We call her the angel of death.
(necklace clinks)
Young slave woman:
I can see my master!
He is in Valhalla.
He calls me.
Let me join him then.
(crowd erupts into a cheer)
I cannot stay.
What's the matter with you, priest?
I don't want to watch.
Bjorn:
It's only death!
You will stay, or my father will hear of it.
(unsheathes a blade)
(gurgling sound)
(crowd shouts and cheers)
Yeah!
Yeah!
(water laps)
(boat creaks)
(rhythmic drumming)
(horn bellows)
Torstein:
Hail, Ragnar Lothbrok!
(crowd cheers for Ragnar)
Hail, Ragnar!
Tostig:
Ragnar!
(crowd cheers)
Hail, Ragnar!
(laughing)
Man:
Hail, Ragnar Lothbrok!
(festive chatter and laughter)
Siggy:
Move!
I ask permission to light the pyre.
(flames whoosh)
(flames crackle)
(footsteps scuff)
(log clunks)
(flames crackle)
(Floki giggles excitedly)
(flames roar)
(boat creaks)
(flames roar)
I have something important to tell you, husband.
I am with child again.
(breath hitches)
I know you're a boy!
The seer told me.
Oh by all the gods, my son,
You have made me a happy man.
(emotional exhale)
(flames roar)
(jewels clink)
(scared, hurried breaths)
(startled gasps)
Siggy:
Have you come to kill us?
Rollo:
Why would I do that?
Siggy:
Because Ragnar told you to.
It is often the way that the new earl
Deals with the family of the old.
Rollo:
Ragnar won't kill you.
How can you be sure?
Rollo:
My brother doesn't hold grudges.
He's strange that way.
(relieved sigh) well...
Even if we don't die,
They will still shun us like a bad smell.
And they'll make it so we have to leave here,
Even though they know no one else will take us in.
They won't.
Not if I vouch for you.
No one will force you to go anywhere.
They wouldn't dare.
What do you want in return?
You were once married to an earl.
Would you not like to be married to another one?
Who?
What do you mean who?
Me!
(wind gusts)
(bird cries)
(logs clunk)
(hum of chatter)
(geese honk)
(flames crackle)
(pigs oink)
The pigs are fattening nicely.
Just like your mother.
(shivers) it's cold, Even in here.
(sighs)
I can't wait for the spring, Or the raids.
I want to go to England.
No.
What?
I said no.
But why?
Because I said so.
Don't be too impatient to put yourself in danger.
But you cannot alter my fate!
(chuckles)
You sound like your uncle,
When he doesn't know what to say.
Come on.
(murmuring quietly)
Athelstan:
Ragnar, I have heard many of your stories,
But tell me...
What is Ragnarok?
(silence)
I have heard mention of it several times,
But so far no one has explained
The meaning to me.
Let's show this ignorant christian
What Ragnarok is.
Get the leaves.
(flames crackle)
(leaves crackle in the flame)
(ominous howling)
(wings flutter)
Ancient seer:
The twilight of the gods will happen like this:
There will be three years of terrible winters... (winds howl)
And summers of black sunlight.
(wings flutter)
People will lose all hope
And surrender to greed,
Incest and civil war.
Midgardsormen, the world serpent,
Will come lunging from the ocean,
Dragging the tides in and flooding the world.
(water rushes)
The wolf, giant Fenrir,
Will break his invisible chains...
The skies will open And Surt the fire-giant
Will come flaming across the bridge
To destroy the gods.
Odin will ride out of the gates of Valhalla
To do battle for a last time against the wolf.
Thor will kill the serpent,
But die from its venom.
(wolf snarls)
Surt will spread fire across the earth.
(flames crackle)
At last, Fenrir will swallow the sun.
Nooooooooo!
(birds chirp)
(water churns)
(water churns as they row)
King Aelle:
So where did these northmen come ashore?
Messenger:
They didn't.
What do you mean, they didn't?
Messenger:
They came in three ships,
And those ships are now sailing up the Tyne.
They have ships that can cross oceans
But also sail up rivers?
What manner of men are these?
If they are sailing up the Tyne,
Then, sire, we shall soon find out.
Ah yes, my lord Wigea,
Of course you know all about them.
You accused them of having supernatural powers,
Which is why a small force of them defeated you.
Lord Wigea:
I merely said they fought like demons,
Like men possessed, with no fear of death.
Unlike you, my lord?
I fear death as much as the next man,
But I have no fear that afterwards
God will raise me up again.
Oh, well said.
(claps)
Come, all of you!
I have something new to show you.
(chains clank, flaps creak)
Let the serpents bite these devils.
Let them also bite those too weak
And afraid to fight to the death
For their king and master.
My lord!
No!
No!
You look terrified, my lord Wigea.
Have you lost your faith?
Are you not certain anymore
That god will raise you up from the grave?
Lord Wigea:
Have mercy!
Personally, I hope he does not.
I hope he leaves you there to rot.
Nooooooo!
Ungh!
(hissing)
No!
Christ!
God!
Nooooo!
(yells out in pain as a snake bites him)
Now let us prepare to defend ourselves
Against these heathens and barbarians.
Previously on Vikings...
This is an ambitious man.
And he resents the fact that he owes me loyalty and obedience, as his chieftain.
Do you accept that you are a criminal?
- Worthy only of defeat?
- After him!
Worthy only of death?
Where is father?
Is he dead?
He's dead!
I've come to warn you.
My husband, he hates you.
Get away.
Earl Haraldson had played a trick on Rollo, and imprisoned him, trying to find where you were.
Then he tortured him.
He tortured my brother?
It's a trap for you, Ragnar.
I want you to ask for a meeting with the Earl.
Challenge him to a personal combat.
With me.
What is this?
My Lord, this man says he has a message for you from Ragnar Lothbrok.
Let him go.
What's the message?
Ragnar Lothbrok challenges you to meet him in single combat.
Ragnar Lothbrok has a very high opinion of himself.
Well, he is a descendant of Odin.
Ragnar said that if you refuse his challenge, then shame would follow you the rest of your life.
There would be greater shame in accepting a challenge from a criminal.
That would suggest that I take him seriously, that I see him as an equal.
The challenge is declined.
When Ragnar Lothbrok appears in Kattegat, he will be put in chains.
Stones and bones.
He searches for your death.
Does he desire to be Earl?
If he kills you, would it not be so?
Tell Ragnar Lothbrok I accept his challenge.
Take him away.
- Ragnar.
- What?
Let's go away.
Let's leave here.
This is not the only place for us.
He is old.
What are you frightened of?
You can't fight.
You're still too weak.
Perhaps that makes us equal.
Never fight unless you know the odds are in your favor.
That is our way.
Who sets the odds?
Our fates are already decided.
You don't believe that, and neither do I.
You are wrong.
I do believe it.
Come to bed.
You need to rest, to sleep.
Yes, I will.
There's always time to sleep.
I was thinking about our boys, what they would look like now.
Don't.
Don't think about them.
Think about tomorrow.
When I must kill a man for whom I have the utmost respect.
Respect?
You respect Ragnar Lothbrok?
Why not?
He is what I used to be, restless, ambitious.
And he was right about the western lands.
But I always knew that in my heart.
Then why didn't you tell him?
Because the moment that I reached out to Ragnar Lothbrok is the moment that all my friends, all my supporters would have deserted me and joined him.
It was impossible to do it.
But it's true our fates have brought us together.
And maybe he's opened the western lands for me.
That is my hope after I kill him.
The Seer promised you would kill him?
Yes.
Good.
I'm sure that's our first child.
Now get up and fetch me some pickled herrings.
I'm starving.
I don't like the smell of them in the bed.
Your clothes are smelly enough as it is.
Why can't you just wash like everyone else?
I thought a wife wasn't supposed to nag her husband until they'd had time to grow tired of each other?
If you don't get up and fetch me some herrings,
I will beat you.
Perhaps that will make you show a little life when we have sex in any case.
Very well.
I'll go.
I can't wait till tomorrow.
Personal combat is always thrilling.
Who is this Ragnar Lothbrok?
I've heard many people talk about him.
I don't talk about him.
He's my father's enemy.
Lord, High One, hear me.
Listen to me.
Give me your favor this day.
Grant me your blessing as you have done in the past, and I will make a sacrifice of my enemy if his death pleases you.
Give me a sign.
I cannot feel your presence.
Husband.
Our sons' hair.
Believe at least in them and in yourself.
Don't look so worried.
This is a personal combat.
The combatants can choose any weapon and shield they desire.
Each man has two shields.
If both are broken, there can be no further replacement.
Fight, Ragnar!
Father, you can do it!
You can do it, Earl!
Finish him!
He is weak!
Lord Odin is here, waiting to see which one of us he will take to his great hall.
So I shall dine after all at the high table of the Aesir.
No!
No!
No!
Tonight I shall be drinking with our boys.
Kill him.
Kill him!
Hail, Earl Ragnar.
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
- Take it!
- Take it!
Take it!
Lord Ragnar,
I have come to swear to you my allegiance and fealty to you and your family from this day.
Leif, you are my friend.
And you, Torstein, and you, Arne, you are my friends.
What is your name?
Tostig, Lord Ragnar.
Do you swear allegiance and fealty to me and to my family from this day forth?
That won't be so long then.
By my sacred rings, I swear.
But I also have a favor to ask, Lord.
What is this favor?
That the next time you go raiding, you take me with you.
I do not wish to insult you, but the truth is you...
That I am too old?
Yes, I am old.
But I have been a warrior all my life.
Many years I sailed with Lord Haraldson and fought battles against the Eastlanders, and I watched all the companions of my youth die.
And though I fought with them in the shield-wall, never once was I touched by a blade.

Which is why I beg you, Lord, gift me the chance to die with honor in battle and join my friends in Valhalla.
This summer, we shall have more ships to go west, for that is our future.
When we return to England, let's take him with us.
All in favor?
Aye.
There is no need for you to swear.
You have already paid a heavy price for your loyalty to me.
Nevertheless, I will swear, brother.
I swear to be true to you, your wife and your family as long as your good fortune holds.
How will we ever be equal now, my brother?
Why have you agreed to grant Earl Haraldson such a big funeral?
Was he not your enemy?
He was also a great man and warrior.
He earned his renown in this life, and now, in death, he deserves such a funeral.
I want to show you something.
I dreamt a dream last night
Of silk as fine fur
Now an Earl is felled by spears
It is horrible now to look around
Who is she?
She's one of the Earl's slaves.
When he died, all of his slave women were asked, "Who wants to die with him?"
This one agreed.
She wants to die?
These other servants are preparing her.
As the valkyries sing their song
Put the body on the bench.
Let's make our offerings.
You need a drink, priest.
Drink.
Drink!
There's that slave girl, the one who has chosen to die.
What are they doing?
She is having sex with the men who live in there.
Each one of them says to her,
"Tell your master I did this out of love for him."
Because she will soon be reunited with her master in death, and she will be able to speak to him.
Silence!
Bjorn, who is that woman?
We call her the Angel of Death.
I can see my master.
He is in Valhalla.
He calls me.
Let me join him then.
I cannot stay.
What's the matter with you, priest?
I don't want to watch.
It's only death.
You will stay, or my father will hear of it.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Hail!
Hail, Ragnar Lothbrok!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Ragnar!
Hail, Earl Ragnar!
Hail, Ragnar Lothbrok!
Move!
I ask permission to light the pyre.
I have something important to tell you, husband.
I am with child again.
I know you're a boy.
The Seer told me.
By all the gods, my son, you have made me a happy man.
Have you come to kill us?
Why would I do that?
Because Ragnar told you to.
It is often the way that the new Earl deals with the family of the old.
Ragnar won't kill you.
How can you be sure?
My brother doesn't hold grudges.
He's strange that way.
Well, even if we don't die, they will still shun us like a bad smell.
And they'll make it so we have to leave here, even though they know no one else will take us in.

They wouldn't dare.
What do you want in return?
You were once married to an Earl.
Would you not like to be married to another one?
Who?

Me.
The pigs are fattening nicely.
Just like your mother.
It's cold even in here.
I can't wait for the spring or the raids.
I want to go to England.
No.
- What?
- I said no.
- But why?
- Because I said so.
Don't be too impatient to put yourself in danger.
But you cannot alter my fate!
You sound like your uncle when he doesn't know what to say.
Come on.
Ragnar, I have heard many of your stories, but tell me, what is Ragnarök?
I have heard mention of it several times, but so far no one has explained the meaning to me.
Let's show this ignorant Christian what Ragnarök is.
Get the leaves.
The twilight of the gods will happen like this.
There will be three years of terrible winters and summers of black sunlight.
People will lose all hope and surrender to greed, incest and civil war.
Midgardsormen, the world's serpent, will come lunging from the ocean, dragging the tides in and flooding the world.
The wolf, giant Fenrir, will break his invisible chains.
The skies will open, and Surt, the fire-giant, will come flaming across the bridge to destroy the gods.
Odin will ride out of the gates of Valhalla to do battle for a last time against the wolf.
Thor will kill the serpent but die from its venom.
Surt will spread fire across the earth.
At last, Fenrir will swallow the sun.
No!
So where did these Northmen come ashore?

I fear death as much as the next man, but I have no fear that afterwards God will raise me up again.
Well said.
Come, all of you!
I have something new to show you.
Let the serpents bite these devils.
Let them also bite those too weak and afraid to fight to the death for their king and master.
My Lord!
No!
No!
You look terrified, My Lord Wigea.
Have you lost your faith?
Are you not certain anymore that God will raise you up from the grave?
Have mercy!
Personally, I hope he does not.
I hope he leaves you there to rot.
No!
Lord...
God!
Now, let us prepare to defend ourselves against these heathens and barbarians.
Here it is.
Guys, hurry up.
Here it is.
The red-stair mansion.
Do you guys dare to come with us?
No, I don't.
Look around you.
It's spooky.
What are you scared of?
I've been here before.
There's nothing.
What about you?
What say you?
I won't go in there.
Are you going in, Oil?
I don't think so.
You are damn chickenshit.
I'd better take some evidence.
What are you doing, Bew?
I'm making a special clip.
So you won't, right?
But I will.
Nick, wait for me.
Hurry up.
You'll definitely see it.
Come.
Hey, wait for me!
Hurry up.
This is for real?
Yeah, this is a serious business.
This house is creepy.
Is this how it really feel?
- Wait, Nick!
- What?
Tell me if you find anything.
Sure, I will.
Why don't you keep it down?
It's damn spooky in here.
There it is.
The red stairs.
They're really red.
Wanna know the background of this place?
This place has a history.
Ready?
You really wanna hear it?
No!
The house owner had a fight... and fell down...
Thud!
His brain oozed out.
His brain oozed out?
Terrifying.
- Shit!
You scared me.
- Get that flashlight out of your face.
Shall we?
Come on.
Nothing to be scared of.
I'd kick its head off.
That's not all.
That's not all?
Each year people would come and hang themselves here.
Hang themselves?
Keep going.
Be careful.
You might be too late.
What the hell are you doing?
Shit...
Shall we go inside?
I think we should go back now.
We're buddies.
Let's check them out.
I think the second floor is spookier.
Shit!
Stop!
I've found it.
Ghost?
My ass!
I think that is the room someone hang himself.
Follow me.
Watch your steps.
Fell down and your brain would ooze out.
Let's go home.
There's nothing.
It's just your imagination.
It's not my imagination.
I know you heard it too.
You don't wanna get haunted.
Come on, follow me.
Turn on the light.
Which way should we go?
I think it's this way.
I heard the noise from this way.
Hurry up, James.
You're always slow.
Nick, why are you bringing me here?
Heard this man hanged himself here.
It's damn cruel.
Stop whining, James
It's Bew, not me.
You.
James, are you preening on me?
No.
Do you think this is his mattress?
How could I know?
Hey, Bew.
What?
Do it.
- Why is it not James?
- Shit!
- It's your turn.
- You gotta do it.
Shit!
Do it!
Why are you shaking?
Shit!
I'm trying to remove the blanket.
I think I've found it.
What did you find?
Ghost.
Ghost!
Yeah.
Why are you telling me so?
You told me to nudge you if I saw something.
You don't have to tell me everything.
Where is it anyway?
- Over there.
James.
What?
Turn around.
Why don't you see it yourself?
I'm too busy.
I'm poking.
It gotta be you.
I'm busy too.
I'm making a prayer.
Why are you messing around?
Do it together.
One...
Two...
Three.
Just us.
- What's happened?
- Ghost!
- That way.
That way.
- This way.
This way.
What are you so scared of?
She's cute.
You morons.
You morons.
Son of a bitch, Nick.
Why did you do this?
What are you so scared of?
She's cute.
Dex!
Dex!
Son of a bitch!
James, it's school break.
What say you?
About what?
The thing that we've talked about.
Why did you stop?
You forgot?
Or scared?
What do you mean scare?
Let's go.
I thought you're a chicken.
You were the first one ran off that night.
I ran out to get a grip so I could go back and save you guys.
Benz, I have something to show you.
- What is it?
- The other night.
I was there.
I took them out.
But they just waited outside.
- What?
- I have a proof to show you.
Here.
Look at their faces.
As pale as boiled chicken.
Teacher, hello.
Weren't you scared?
Me?
Not at all.
Not so scared?
You screamed so loud, Bew.
That was James.
Really.
What about tonight?
Wait for that two.
Nick has planned it all.
Here they come.
Guys,
- are you ready for tonight?
- Yeah, we are.
- Me too.
- What about you?
Don't mess with my fringe.
Yeah, I'm ready.
Listen to me...
OK.
OK.
Do as I plan.
The thing is...
All cleared.
Let's go.
Hurry up.
All clear.
Go.
Where are you going?
Home.
Won't you go with us tonight?
No.
I'm scared.
I'm scared too.
What are you scared of?
See you, bye.
Where are you going?
Home.
We have an appointment.
Won't you go with us?
No.
I'm scared.
I'm scared too.
What are you scared of?
Good bye.
I'm off.
Come on.
Come with us.
No, I won't.
I haven't told my mom.
Give me your mom's number.
I 'll call her myself.
My mom speaks only English.
James, give his mom a call.
Damn, you throw shit on me.
Come.
- No.
- Come.
- No.
- Hurry up.
Do you know why we can't get in this building?
Cause the door's locked?
Dumbass!
Someone's found dead here.
An M.6 student.
A girl?
Our school is an all-boys' school, you jerk.
Stressed from failing admission
He stood up at that corner.
It must be the second floor.
I said it was the roof top.
He jumped off the roof.
His head knocked the floor.
The skull was dented to the other side.
And became a handicapped?
- He's dead, stupid.
- Dead!
- Yeah.
- You said dead?
- Yeah.
But I 'll bring you in to see it for yourself.
Any of you ghosts who think you're a hot shot.
"Oh-so-scary" type of ghost.
I...
And my friend... and friends of friend.
Will go in and let you haunt us.
What the hell are you doing?
This is Oh-so-scary.
Scary?
Your dad's ass!
- Are you having a go on my dad?
- Yeah.
I'll tell my mom.
Not that I care.
- Ghost?
- What ghost?
Come on.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
You're bossy.
Is it so scary?
What are you mumbling about?
Hurry up, guys.
Follow me.
Hurry up.
We're here.
Guys, here's the entrance.
Nick, are we really get inside?
Why not?
Are you chicken out?
No.
Have you *#@% yet?
What?
- Have you *#@% yet?
- Huh?
Have you *#@% yet?
What permission?
There it is.
That sign...
"No entry without permission."
Come here, you dumb.
A permission for your dad?
- Nick, are you having a go on my dad's friend?
- Friend's dad.
Your dad too, Bryan.
I'll tell my mom.
No need.
She might know everything by now.
Let's go.
Bryan, where are you going?
What wrong with you?
What are you doing, Bryan?
I'm paying homage to Buddha.
That's not a buddha image.
It's a joss house.
Pana Ti Pata...
Bryan, what are you doing?
I'm praying.
It isn't a prayer.
It's the five precepts.
Pana Ti Pata...
Won't you do the homage too?
Nick...
What's the matter?
Do you remember the joss house you kicked it that day?
Huh?
Want me to trash down the joss house?
Grandpa and Grandma are following us!
Where are they?
Where have they gone?
Where are they?
They're in the alley.
There's nothing there.
They're there!
Are you really going in there, Nick?
Why would I be here then?
Ghosts!
Prepare to haunt us!
Nick!
What?
Hurry up.
This place might hold certain energy.
Nick, no need to make it scarier.
I'm scared to death now.
Bew, say it. "Come out.
I wanna see you."
Speak it out.
- Why it gotta be me?
- It gotta be you.
There are 4-5 of us here.
It gotta be you.
Hurry up.
- I wanna see you.
- Say it out loud.
I wanna see you.
Louder.
I wanna see you.
Come out!
Such a mouthpiece.
Tonight, we all might be in touch with a spirit.
Knock it off, Nick.
Stop it, James.
What's the matter with you?
I saw... upstairs.
I saw.
Where's it?
Did you guys see anything?
No.
Why did you scream then?
We just echoed him.
- Get up, guys.
Get up.
- I really saw it.
Get up, guys.
Come on.
James, if you saw anything, don't tell us.
- I really saw it.
- Off you go.
Hurry up.
You clumsy ruin things.
I will lead you upstairs.
You ghost upstairs!
My friends and I are going up.
Nick!
Do I have to?
Walk upstairs or let me drag you by the ear!
Alright, I'm going.
We're coming up there!
Hurry up.
Who pulled me?
Who?
What's wrong with you?
- Walk up, James.
- I am walking...
What is that?
There's nothing.
You're scared and see things.
It isn't my own imagination.
You said there's nothing, Nick.
You're just out of your head.
Come on.
James, help me here.
Guys, come in.
No, I'm scared.
Do you really wanna see me?
Wait up!
James!
What are you doing there?
My legs feel numb.
Open!
Close it!
I said open!
Close it down!
I said open!
Hurry up.
Help!
Wait up!
Wait up!
My shoe!
Get off me!
Get off me!
Get off me!
Get off me!
Get off me!
Nick!
Wait for me!
Hurry up.
What are you doing there?
Come down.
Hurry up.
I'm scared.
- Where's James?
- Forget him!
Help!
Help me!
Saman, did you hear kids yelling something?
Yes, I did.
Why haven't they gone home yet?
I'll go have a look then.
Good.
I'll come with you.
Alright.
After you.
- Where's James?
- I don't know.
Where's everybody?
I don't know.
They ran off.
Oh, yeah?
Help!
Help!
Help!
Left!
There's nothing.
On my right.
Come on.
Get out of here.
It's locked.
I can't open this damn thing.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Help me.
Hurry up.
Hurry.
- Go this way
- This way.
- Go this way!
He's following us.
Hurry up.
This is so scary.
- James.
- What?
You're genius.
Where did you learn the trick?
Of course, I'm a genius.
Acting is my middle name.
Bew wasn't bad either.
His scream is so oh-ho.
I can't let James beat me.
But I saw his face, so pale.
You screamed your lung out.
What about that ghost?
By the way, James...
Where did you get that crack-headed ghost from?
He looked so real.
Did you see his brain oozing out slowly?
It gradually dripped to this side.
So damn real.
But I didn't hire him.
Nick!
Double tricks, right?
I didn't hire him.
I didn't hire him.
James...
Nick...
And I...
None of us hire him!
Who the hell he is?
You mean that's a real ghost?
Super real!
Who would sneak and shit in an abandon building?
Bew, take a look.
- Me again?
- Yeah.
I can't do it.
Come on.
Here I go.
- Here I actually gonna do it.
- Do it!
There's nothing.
You're right.
Nothing's here.
Oh, you two love me so much, right?
Typical, Bew.
I said there's nothing.
- See?
It's an empty room.
- What are you scared of?
I did hear it.
You heard it too, James.
Nick, you too.
Why did you scream if you didn't hear it.
Hey...
Or... it's the one who jumped off the roof?
Bew?
Now you're quiet.
Let me go...
Let me go...
Let me go.
Let me go.
Let's get out of here.
Let me go...
Are you leaving your friend?
No, I'm not.
I just need to get a grip.
I 'll count on three and we'll run together.
One...
Two...
Three!
Nick!
Ghost!
Huh?
!
Where should we run to?
What do we do now?
Brother, there's a ghost here.
Oil!
Oil!
Oil, what happened?
Is he possessed?
Oil.
Help me hold him.
Oil.
I'll do it.
- Nick, hold it for me.
- Yeah.
Help me.
Oil.
Oil.
Bastard.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Get out!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Bastard.
Huh?
Bastard.
- What did he say?
- What kind of ghost calling me bastard.
What?
Huh?
Huh?
- What did he say?
- He said he's got epilepsy.
Find something to stuff his mouth.
I 'll do it.
Brother?
Is it a good idea?
James.
- Why are you blissed?
- I'm hurt.
Ghost!
Take your fringe back.
Dex, help me style my hair.
Dex.
Dex, help me style my fringe.
Oil, get off me!
Get off me!
Moron!
You made me bleed.
- Where should we go?
- Let's go this way.
Where's Oil?
- We should help Oil first.
- You don't wait for me.
- Go down and help him first.
- You're right.
Oil.
Wait.
Let's go help him.
No, I'm not going.
- Let's go
- Hurry up.
- I think the noise came from this way.
- Yes,
I think it's from upstairs.
I think you should check upstairs.
I'll go downstairs to see what happened.
Alright.
Be careful.
Thank you.
Oil.
Where's Oil?
Oil.
- Where's Oil?
- Oil.
Oil.
Where's Oill?
What?
Why don't we go downstairs?
Yeah.
Let's find him.
Oil.
I think we should go upstairs.
Shit, it's locked.
It's locked.
- What do we do now?
- Where should we go?
My battery's dead.
Nick, I shouldn't have come with you.
Damn brother!
Nick, he condemned you.
I heard it.
He called me "damn brother".
Not just damn!
I think everything is alright now.
What are you scared of?
Look, James didn't feel anything.
Why are you pushing yourself against me?
I need some warmth.
Bryan.
- Dex!
- Help me!
Dex!
Dex!
What happened?
What happened?
Dex!
Get me down.
Dex!
- Nick, pull him.
- I'm pulling him.
- Bryan, help me.
- I'm pulling him.
Can't you see?
Bryan, help me out.
I'm pulling him.
Can't you see?
Get me down.
Help me.
Brother...
Did you see what I saw?
Yes.
Anything at the back?
I'm not sure.
I'll count on three, turn around to see it together, okay?
One.
Two.
Three!
- Did you see anything?
- Why don't you just turn around?
I'm scared.
What are you scared of?
Bew!
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Hurry up, Nick.
Hurry up.
You step on my face!
Now my eyes, damn you!
Hurry up.
Let's go.
Help me first!
Go!
Wait for me!
Bew.
James.
Wait up!
Bew!
Bew!
Help me here.
Why are you pulling me?
Why are you pulling me?
You want to see me, don't you?
So you're the one who committed suicide here?
That's right.
Why did you kill yourself?
I didn't pass the university admission.
There's no need to kill yourself.
I was disappointed.
What was your first choice for university?
Siriraj Medical School.
- And the second choice?
- Chulalongkorn Medical School.
What was your third choice?
Chiang Mai Medical School.
- What's your fourth choice?
- Thammasat Medical School.
What was your high-school GPA?
1.2
You buff!
If I were you, I'd kill myself since I saw my GPA.
What's your GPA?
Me?
0.58
No difference.
You should come with us.
Prepare yourself to be with me.
We're trapped.
- Climb up.
- You said you don't want to go up.
- It's dead end.
- Then go down.
Hurry up.
Run.
Is he still following us?
Wait for me.
Bew!
James!
Help me!
Nick!
Bew!
James!
Help me!
Help me.

Ghost...
I'm too scared.
Nick!
Nick!
Nick!
Nick!
Bew, why did you stop?
Screw you.
I'm scared.
Won't you go rescue Nick?
I won't go in there.
Will you?
Nick!
Nick!
Nick!
Nick!
It's so dark.
I see nothing.
Bew.
James.
Help me.
Nick!
Hurry up.
Come out.
Hurry.
Hurry up.
Come out.
Crawl over here.
- Come here.
- We can't get to you.
Hurry up.
Come on.
You're getting close.
Hurry.
Keep going!
Nick, hurry up.
Bew, I'm scared.
We're doomed.
Bew, what do we do now?
Bew.
Bew.
Bew.
Nick.
Nick.
James!
James!
- OK.

James!
Stop!
What's the matter with you?
I'm hurt.
Alright.
Alright.
Nick.
Where's he now?
Bew.
That's enough.
Hurry up.
Dex!
Dex!
Hurry up.
Where should we go?
- Where should we go?
- This way.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
What are you shouting about?
Good evening, teacher.
Don't you know you can't enter this building?
- We do.
- You do?
And still up here?
Wanna get beat up?
- There's a ghost downstairs, Miss.
- That's right.
What ghost?
- I'm off now.
- Nick!
It's haunted downstairs.
Miss, can we stay with you for tonight?
Please.
Please.
If you wanna stay here, follow me.
Hurry.
Go on.
- Follow me.
- Follow her, Bryan.
- Hey, James.
Who is this teacher?
- How could I know?
Watch your steps.
Go on.
Go on.
Why you gotta push me?
- Go faster.
- Bryan
You guys wait in here.
In this room?
That's right.
Go inside, quick!
- Yes, ma'am.
- Go on.
Hurry up.
Go on.
It's so dark in here.
Miss!
Miss!
Miss!
- Miss!
- What do we do now?
- Miss!
- What do we do now?
Open it.
Why she locks us up in this room?
It's freaking dark here.
Damn you, Bew.
Do you wanna stay outside?
Wanna meet that cracked head ghost?
Guys, let find something to light.
My battery is dying.
Bew.
James.
Go check over there.
Find some candles.
- James, lead the way.
- No, it gotta be you.
- Me again?
- It's you.
Hurry up.
Light the way.
Oops.
Shit!
Bew, be careful.
What the hell do you want me to find in the dark?
Why are you standing still?
Go find something.
It's so dark.
I can't see anything.
What the heck will I find?
Dex, that's a switch.
Check it out.
Alright.
It's broken.
Search for another one.
Shit.
I'm so lucky.
I've got new shoes.
Got it!
What?
What did you get?
Nick, what was it?
There's a candle there.
Get it down.
Bew, hurry up.
Go get it.
Step on my hands.
Quick.
Moron!
We have chairs here.
Damn, I'm so scared I lost my mind.
Hurry.
Shit.
How can we light the candle now?
Bew, take a look up there for some matches.
I've found it.
James, hold it for me.
Alright.
Hurry up.
Miss Pannee might be here to open the door.
Hurry up.
Miss Pannee!
Miss!
Miss!
Miss...
Bew...
Shit.
Go over there.
Go over there.
I told you to go over there.
Damn you, Bew.
Go!
Stop!
I told you to stop.
Stop right there.
Don't follow me.
I'm off.
Wait up.
Look at the look of that cracked head.
James, why are you holding it?
Give me the candle.
Bew.
- Where's the matchbox?
- It's here.
How come it's with the ghost?
I don't know.
Bew, go get it.
Don't moan.
Go get it.
Can we have the matchbox?
I'm asking you nicely.
Come and get it yourself.
James, he told you to get it from him.
He said to you, bastard.
You two, go get it.
Son of a bitch!
I'm not going.
You then.
No, Bryan.
I'm scared.
Go on.
Bew.
Go get it.
No.
Go.
- Me?
- Yeah.
Me?
Yeah, go on.
Give me the matchbox.
Shit!
I asked for the matchbox, not your hand.
Please give me the matches.
Please...
Drop...
It's dropped.
Pick it up then.
Promise me that you won't haunt me.
I promise.
Wait.
But it's just temporary.
Alright, it's fine with me.
Time's up.
Where are you, Oil?
Oil.
Oil, where are you?
It's me.
Oil.
Oil.
He's disoriented.
Help me hold him up.
Are you alright?
How come you lay down here?
Oil?
Lift his head up high.
Oil, are you alright?
- Oil.
- Help me.
- Are you alright?
- Help me.
Nick, why are you making noise?
Go to sleep.
I'm not sleepy.
What about you?
How could I?
This damn ghost is staring at me.
He's trying to spook me.
Nick.
What?
Where're Oil and those guys?
They've gone for a while.
Yeah.
I think they've gone home by now.
There're some pillows.
Guys, get some sleep.
She will let us out in the morning.
Take it.
Take it.
If your friend has this symptom again, you can't joke about it.
Put a spoon or hard stick in his mouth.
Or he might bite his own tongue off.
Yes, ma'am.
Apart from you guys, is there anyone around?
Teacher Wanpen.
Please come this way.
We need to discuss.
Alright.
Wait a second.
Remember,
Don't go out anywhere until we're back.
Stay in this room.
Got it?
Yes, ma'am.
Let's go.
Tep, what day is today?
What's the matter, Oil?
Go find a calendar.
Benz, go get it.
What's the matter?
Are you alright?
Feeling better?
Here you are.
A calendar as you want.
What's the matter, Oil?
Day 10 with waning moon.
Remember the story I told you in the dorm the other night?
See that building next to ours?
- Poraminwittayakom Building.
- Nick!
Don't tell me you're telling...
A... a ghost story!
That's right!
Shit!
Son, no need to be scared of ghost.
I'm with you.
James, if you're too scared you can take your son out of here.
Alright.
Fine!
Won't you guys stop me at all?
I'm not going.
- This building...
- Nick, are you gonna tell a ghost story?
For real?
It's so scary at night.
Damn you, Tep!
What the hell are you so scared of?
Ever watch Ghost Talk, the part of ghost hunting?
Name any freaking haunted house, we three have been there.
Do you want to listen to the story?
This building was built in 1957.
It's 50 years ago.
The building is a new building built on an old one.
Do you know why it's haunted?
There was a Grade12 student.
Very good student who failed the entrance exam.
He decided to take his own life.
But it isn't like what I've heard.
They said... before the old building was smashed down, there's a case of teachers killing.
Some the 8th or 15th day of the waning moon,
People have seen the ghost teachers.
They'd wander around the building.
People are so scared of the ghosts.
Spooky, huh?
This school break,
I will take you guys there.
We'll see whose story is real.
So your story's real.
That's right.
Tep, I think we should go now.
But she told us to wait here.
What the hell are we waiting for?
We should go and tell Nick and others.
Let's go.
Bew.
Bryan.
Where are you guys?
I'm here.
Who let you in?
Leave this place!
Now!
And don't come back again.
Take your friends with you too.
Go away!
Strike back on the ghost?
You won't leave us alone?
Take this.
Let me do it.
Ghost?
Get him.
Beat the ghost.
Wait.
Stop.
Stop!
I have to pick up the phone.
- Hello?
- Hello, Nick.
- Ghost picking up the phone?
This isn't Nick.
- Can I speak with Nick please?
- He spoke in northern dialect.
Who's Nick?
It's me.
It's for you.
Hello?
Hello, Nick.
Where are you?
Why aren't you home yet?
Jenny?
Hello?
Jenny.
Hello?
Hello?
The battery's dead.
Hey, ghost.
How did you get my phone?
I'm a ghost.
I can take your things whenever I want.
Wanna get a flashlight?
I have a lighter too.
Knock it off.
- Guys, beat him up
- Wait!
I can get your mom to play with you here too.
What are you so scared of?
Wanna mess with me?
Beat him up!
I told you ghost doesn't exist.
It's just your imagination.
I told you there's no ghost.
Don't be such a chicken.
Give me that flashlight.
Let me look at your face.
I knew that you're not a real ghost.
I just pretended.
James.
- What?
- Let me kick him again.
Bastard.
Damn, you made me run.
James.
Watch him.
- Me?
- Yeah.
I ran up from the first floor.
Now I gotta watch him?
Why are you following me?
I wanna take a leak.
Hold it.
Nick, the book just opened by itself.
The book just opened by itself?
Moron!
- It's just wind blowing.
- But I did see it too.
It really opened by itself, brother.
Now you two are going insane just like him.
Wind blowing?
I don't feel a thing.
I really saw it, James.
It's not your cue, you ghost.
A ghost?
Really, Bew?
There's nothing such ghost.
If it's show up, I'll pee on it.
If it isn't out, I 'll curse the ghost not to be reborn.
If it's a child ghost, I 'll kick its ass.
If it's a male ghost
I 'll pee on its face.
If it's a female ghost, I 'll make it my wife.
But it must be pretty enough.
Nick!
Is it her?
Nick!
Is it her?
Teacher Pannee Rattanawiset.
Born: 2 August 1925.
Dead: 13 July 1962.
I bet she's dead.
Definitely.
Hold it.
"The fight among Poramin School's teachers brought the death of teachers in the classroom M. 6/5.
Do you know what room is this?
When we arrived, I saw the sign said M. 6/4, bro.
What a relief.
James.
Point the light at the picture again.
Me?
Who's outside?
- Who's there?
- They're here.
The teacher's coming.
How can she be here?
Let's get out of here.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
Do you think it's her?
I think it's her.
What do we do now?
What is it?
I'm scared.
There's a buddha image.
Someone needs to take it.
Who then?
- Must be someone.
- Who gonna retrieve it?
- I won't.
Alright, I will.
James, light the way for me.
Alright.
You guys get hiding and keep your voice down.
Alright.
Hurry up.
James, hold the flashlight steady.
Okay, get it.
Nick.
Climb up.
She'll be here any minute.
I know.
- Nick!
- Nick!
M. 6/5
She's back now!
Who want to see me?
Come here!
Bryan!
Let me go.
Stop it, Pannee.
When will you stop making bad karma?
Leave me alone!
Bryan!
- Are you the brash one?
- No, not me.
Is it you?
No.
No, I'm not.
Miss, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.
Nick, bro.
What about the Buddha image?
Forget it.
Just get outta here.
What are you praying?
I don't hear you.
Pray louder.
Louder!
Namo Tassa Pakawatou.
I still don't hear you.
I'm scared, teacher.
Stop!
Are you running away from me?
Nick, what should we do?
All of you have to stay with me.
All of you have to stay with me.
James.
James.
James.
What's with you?
Bew.
Bew.
What is this place?
How did we come here?
I don't have a clue.
Bryan!
Bryan!
- Dex.
Dex
- Tep, wake up.
Oil.
Oil.
Wake up.
What is this place?
Why are you still standing?
Follow me.
Nick.
Where's Benz?
How could I know?
I think we should check inside.
Perhaps he's in there.
Watch out, Nick.
Wait for me.
Give me the flashlight.
Poraminwittaya School!
It's our school.
Nick, do you remember the story I told you?
Some teachers killed one another here.
And we've met the teachers.
- So they are...
- What are we?
Teachers.
Now you know what is this place.
I 'll help you get out of here.
I won't let you go anywhere.
Now that you dare to challenge me.
Pannee, please stop.
I won't.
These kids should deal with a teacher like me.
Benz!
Benz!
Benz!
Kids, stand back.
Go.
Bew, hurry.
Will you excuse me?
Bew!
Bew!
Come on!
Can't you get me through?
- James.
- Hurry up.
Help me.
Nick!
Which way?
This way or another?
Go that way!
Bew!
James, how did you get here?
I have no idea.
My pants were torn.
Help me think, you cracked head ghost.
My name isn't cracked head ghost.
I don't care what the hell is your name.
Help me think.
What do you want me from me?
Do something.
She's coming at us.
What do we do now?
You never pay respect to your teacher, right?
It isn't like that, Teacher.
We're so scared of you.
Don't deny it.
You insult me.
That's why you have a nerve to come here.
We aren't showing disrespect to you.
- Shut up!
Don't argue with me!
- I didn't.
- That's what I call arguing.
Don't ever think that I'll let you get away easily!
- Teacher, don't hurt us.
- How dare you argue with me!
Pannee.
You guys, get out of here.
Enough, Pannee.
They're just like your students.
They aren't my students.
These kids don't respect you because you always like this.
That's right, Pannee.
You don't control your anger.
That's why nobody loves you.
That include you, right Saman?
Yes.
You all can go to hell together!
The ghosts are coming close.
What are you playing?
Hurry up.
No blood here.
The blood is dried out.
I'm out of blood.
Is that your toe?
It's blood soaked.
I didn't think about it.
Suck it.
Suck it.
It doesn't look real.
Suck it again.
Suck it.
Spray it out.
Look real yet?
That do the job.
Go out and fight!
Go!
Are they scared of you?
You must be afraid of me.
You must be afraid of me.
Yes!
They're stupid.
Benz!
Benz!
Is he dead?
Benz!
He doesn't move, James.
I think he's dead.
Benz!
Let's go, bro.
I think we don't need to worry about him.
No need to worry about him?
Where are you going?
I'm going back home.
Let's get Nick and those guys here.
Damn you.
Get off my leg.
I'm not dead yet.
- Help me.
- He's alive.
Benz.
- Help him up.
- Benz.
Hurry up, you guys.
There are some people here.
It wasn't like this last night.
Are they gonna be alright?
There they are.
Keep moving.
Why the hell are you standing here?
- Where have you been?
- No time to ask.
Let's get outta here.
"Curator".
It pronounces "pan ta rak".
Jot it down.
Next word...
- Let's get into hiding.
- "Sabotage"
It pronounces "vi nas sa gum"
Jot it down.
You all, leave us here.
I have something to talk with Miss Wanpen.
Get out!
How come Miss Wanpen's here?
She was helping us a moment ago.
You're right.
Be quiet.
What's the matter, Pannee?
Are you having an affair with Saman?
No, I'm not.
Pannee!
It isn't Wanpen's fault.
It's all my fault.
So you two admit that you had an affair.
You always like this.
That's why nobody loves you.
That include you, right Saman?
Yes.
So you two love each other so much?
You can go to hell together.
Pannee!
- Pannee!
- Let me go!
Saman!
Pannee!
How did they kill each other for this love shit?
That mean those teachers are ghosts?
Are they dead?
Teacher Pannee.
What do we do now?
Guys, follow me.
I know where the exit is.
James.
Look at you.
Teacher Pannee slapped me.
Never mind.
Follow me.
Do you think you can run away from me?
Hey, guys.
The exit is over there.
Where's it?
Which way?
Hurry.
Hurry up.
Please don't hurt us.
Is it you who show no respect to your teachers?
Teacher.
No, not me.
Please don't hurt my friend.
You can take me instead.
How dare you!
Bew.
James.
Please, have me instead.
Students that show no respect deserve to die!
Nick.
That's enough.
These kids have nothing to do with you.
Why don't you listen to us?
Why should I listen to you, bitch?
You made me suffer like this!
No matter what,
I'll drag these kids to hell with me!
You knew what happened to you... wasn't like what you thought.
You misunderstood us all along.
Think about what happened on that day.
Be careful, Miss Pannee.
We almost there.
You... take her inside.
Wait for me here.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, guys.
Miss Pannee will be alright now.
Yes, sir.
Go.
Let's go, Mr. Sombat.
Mr. Sombat's already dead.
Mr. Saman, remember when we took Miss Pannee to her room?
Yes, I do.
When we were leaving,
I saw Mr. Sombat returning to the room.
It all happened because of your wrath.
You knew the truth that...
Saman didn't rape and make you pregnant.
It's Sombat who committed that thing to you.
And you already killed him by yourself, didn't you?
All you think of is revenge.
Thought that everyone mean harm to you...
These kids have nothing to do with this, Pannee.
Rand.
What's wrong with him?
Tin!
That's not true!
It's not like what you said!
Pajera Jariya Honti.
Anu Tara Nusa Sakarn.
We humbly pay homage.
To our former teachers who have given us wisdom.
We'd like to show gratitude to all teachers, who have educated us intellectually and morally at present.
Any of you ghosts who think you're a hot shot.
My friends and I are coming up.
There's nothing such ghost.
If it's a male ghost, I 'll pee on its face.
If it's a female ghost, I 'll make it my wife.
Pannee, you're a good teacher.
The students admitted that they're wrong.
We need to teach them and guide them what's right.
The students accepted their mistake and are ready to apologize to us.
We need to forgive them.
Because they call us 'teacher'.
Isn't it true, Pannee?
Pannee...
Let them go.
I'm begging you, Pannee.
Let them go.
I'm sorry, teacher.
We're sorry, teacher.
Get out of here!
She allowed us to go.
Get out!
Thank you, teacher.
Mark.
Why are you still standing?
Hurry up.
It might be too late.
Off you go.
I can't go with you guys now.
Because I am where I belong.
What are you talking about?
This place belongs to someone else.
Hurry up, moron.
You should go now.
Mark was right.
Mark has been here for so long.
That's right.
I've been here for so long.
Remember... the first time you walked into the building?
Guys, hurry up.
I tried to drive you guys out of the building.
You don't leave.
You aren't afraid of me at all.
Now... that you're here.
I tried to help you get out of this building.
Guys, follow me.
I know where the exit is.
Do you remember?
So you are... you are... are... a ghost!
Correct.
You guys.
I need you to do me a favor.
Go back to the room 6/5 and bring our pictures out.
And burn them.
Yes, sir.
You should go now.
The dawn is breaking.
Go that way.
Thank you, Mark.
We're off now.
Go.
We're leaving now, teachers.
Let's go.
Good luck.
- Come on.
- Wait for me.
We did what we promised to you.
May you three rest in peace.
Please forgive us for what we did wrong.
Somehow I miss Mark.
Why you miss him?
Are you calling him out?
He's a ghost.
Even he's a ghost, he's got more spirit than you, Bew.
I wonder if he's gone reborn.
Not yet.
Not yet?
My ass.
I didn't say anything.
Keep arguing.
I'm going.
James.
- Why are you tapping me?
- Your friend's here.
- What friend?
- Look.
Mark!
Tell you, James.
IMYSM.
L-Miss-You-So-Much.
You know chat words too?
Yeah.
IMYSM your ass!
Oh, Why did you call me out then?
I just saying!
Let go of me!
Bew.
Don't be afraid, Bryan.
Aren't you two scared of me?
Yes.
Keep hugging... and you might get humming at each other.
Why are you standing there?
Go!
Let's get out of here, Bryan.
Drawings no one can see.
Plans written in code.
Clues to Leonardo da Vinci's hidden obsession- the quest to ﬂy.
It will take hundreds of years to decode the secrets of ﬂight- secrets revealed by big history.
We think of history as a timeline... a series of events stretching a few thousand years into the past.
It's time to think bigger.
Instead of a line, imagine a web of infinite connections... interacting over billions of years... linked together to create everything we've ever known- our universe, our planet... and us.
When we consider our most epic moments though the lens of science... we unleash a revolutionary new idea- the movement of atoms steered the movements of men... civilizations, galaxies.
History as we know it is about to get big.
One of the greatest minds in history... tries to crack an impossible code.
Leonardo da Vinci fills 100 pages of notebooks... with drawings of birds and bats... and designs for strange machines.
His thoughts are consumed with one goal:
How can a man ﬂy?
Traditional history tells us that the Wright brothers... are the first to achieve the dream of powered ﬂight... centuries after da Vinci.
But big history reveals how man's quest to ﬂy... is a riddle that' is written at the beginning of time itself.
Big history connects back... more than 13.7 billion years.
We are traveling through the early universe... just' a fraction of a second after the big bang.
Matter comes into existence... along with gravity.
From the beginning of the universe, gravity will rule matter... and act as an invisible barrier to ﬂight.
On some planets, like Jupiter... gravity is so strong, it would crush us.
On other worlds, like the moon... it's so weak that it takes almost no effort to leap several feet up.
Earths gravity is in the middle.
Strong enough to keep us bound to land... yet weak enough to let some creatures ﬂy.
So how do insects and birds defy gravity?
It turned out that birds were better evolved for ﬂight.
It's not' just the wings.
It's the power behind them.
Flapping their wings gives birds the thrust they need to get airborne.
Ana' a birds chest and shoulder muscles... which work the wings... make up as much as 50% of the bird's weight.
In humans, these same muscles account for less than five percent... of our body weight.
So birds have 10 times the ﬂight power we do.
So no matter what da Vinci designs... people can't ﬂy like birds.
Humans need a different strategy.
This is the age of engines.
Machines with 50 times the power of a man.
Two bicycle mechanics, Orville and Wilbur Wright... believe that an engine running on gasoline... can generate enough thrust to lift an aircraft into the sky.
But the engines of their day are made of iron and steel... metals that are strong but heavy.
Everything about the Wrights' plane has to be strong and light.
If the engine's too heavy, the plane won't get off the ground.
To defy gravity, the Wright brothers need a game-changer.
Big history connects the first ﬂight... to the chemistry of a miracle metal.
It's strong and ﬂexible... and three times lighter than steel.
It's a very light metal, but it's also very, very strong.
That's a great combination.
It's the most common metal on the planet- aluminum.
This unique metal is never found in its pure form.
Aluminum atoms grab on to oxygen and minerals in the Earth's crust... and won't let go.
It's so hard to extract... that in the late 1800s... aluminum is more valuable than gold.
So valuable that France displays a few precious bars... alongside the country's crown jewels.
The metal becomes an international symbol... of wealth and power.
When the Washington Monument was going up in the 1880s... the U.S. put aluminum on the very top of it- a little six-inch pyramid that would kind of announce to the world... just how mighty the United States was.
But aluminum is 26 million times more common than gold.
And it's about to become a household word.
A young chemist in Ohio, Charles Hall... shoots an electric current through a chemical solution.
The electricity separates the atoms that bind aluminum.
That finally unlocks the potential of a metal... with a unique combination of lightness and strength.
Hall creates the Aluminum Company of America, or Alcoa... to bring the miracle meta!
to the masses.
That's good news for Hall's fellow Ohioans... the Wright brothers.
They make the crankcase of their airplane engine out of Alcoa aluminum... and it cuts the engine's weight almost in half.
But gravity hasn't been defeated yet.
The rest of their airplane also has to combine strength with lightness.
Big history has a solution... that's been waiting for Orville and Wilbur... since before the time of the dinosaurs.
Big history uses science to see the world in a new way.
It reveals how birds use muscle power to defy gravity... and that man's quest to conquer the sky is impossible... without the power of engines... and strong materials... that are also light... like aluminum.
But gravity is the eternal enemy of ﬂight.
And the Wright brothers still face the problem of weight.
The Wrights have their plane.
The wings provide lift... and the engine gives it power.
But the structure must be light enough to get airborne... yet strong enough to support the weight of the engine... and the pilot.
What material can do all this?
Once again, the planet supplies what they need.
Big history connects back... to a prehistoric supercontinent.
300 million years ago... most of the land on Earth... clusters into the supercontinent Pangaea.
The vast interior of Pangaea... is hundreds of miles from the cool breezes of the shore.
The land dries out.
Without enough moisture, many trees die... but some adapt.
They develop cones to protect their seeds.
These trees survive- trees like spruce.
After Pangaea breaks apart... spruce trees are carried all over the world.
Their wood has a unique quality.
Heavier, heartier woods like your oaks and all of that-
They're just too heavy.
Lighter woods are too weak.
They're too brittle.
Spruce kind of falls in the middle.
They have just the right amount of high tensile strength.
Makes it ideal for making aircraft out of.
Big history brings together the strength and lightness of spruce... and aluminum... with the power of the gasoline engine... at the ideal moment... to defy gravity-
And lift a man into the air.
Earth gives humanity the Keys to the sky.
One airplane... transforms... into a world of ﬂight.
Now, in a single day... more than 90,000 planes take ﬂight around the world.
If it wasn't for that big history moment... of the Earth drying out, effectively... we wouldn't have that powered ﬂight.
It was the planet drying out and this one tree going...
"Hey, I can live here now."
Big history allows us to piece that all together.
Today, we take ﬂying for granted.
But there was a time on Earth when ﬂight didn't exist at all.
So who were the world's first ﬂiers?
And when did they first take to the sky?
Big history links back to a prehistoric forest... more than 325 million years ago... when the first creature on Earth ever to take wing... isn't a bird.
It's a primitive insect.
Possibly, as it falls from a tree... it vibrates nubs on its back... and glides to safety.
Over generations... the nubs evolve into wings.
Flight is the best way to get around this planet.
You can use it to travel.
You can use it to mate.
You can use it to hunt for food, escape predators.
Flight is a strategy for survival... a strategy that paves the way for humans.
Big history connects forward 260 million years... to a moment of impact.
An asteroid the size of Mount Everest... is on a collision course with Earth.
The dinosaurs are doomed.
Except for one group that manages to escape- the dinosaurs that evolved into today's birds.
One of the reasons that birds survived... the extinction at the end of the Cretaceous... is probably ﬂight.
If you can ﬂy away, get up above the burning forest... try to find small little areas that weren't burning... maybe an island in a great lake type situation... you can survive.
Flight got 'em out of there.
Their survival is linked to ours.
We need birds and ﬂying insects to spread and pollinate... the plants we rely on for food.
One could certainly argue that if there had been no ﬂight... there would be no humans.
So we depend on ﬂight.
But ﬂight depends on something special about the Earth.
There's a clue in a famous catastrophe- a fiery crash... that reveals how the planet makes ﬂight possible.
Big history connects the story of ﬂight... to the birth of the universe... revealing how gravity emerges within an instant of the big bang... and becomes the enemy of ﬂight.
How nature fights back... combining lightness and strength.
And how humanity cracks the code by harnessing elements... millions of years in the making.
But big history reveals there's another player at work in ﬂight.
Big history is not satisfied... by simply looking at the human history of ﬂight.
Does the planet play any role in enabling ﬂight?
Big history looks for answers... in history's most famous ﬂight disaster-
the German zeppelin Hindenburg.
Four diesel engines power an airship filled with seven million cubic feet of gas.
In the final fee!
Of its 4,600-mile journey from Berlin-..
The Hindenburg bursts into ﬂames.
But understanding why the Hindenburg falls... is to reveal what first made it take ﬂight.
Big history links the death of the Hindenburg... to the birth of our atmosphere.
A!
first', ifs a poisonous mix of carbon dioxide and methane.
Then other gases take over... mostly nitrogen... and eventually the gas we will one day breathe.
Oxygen, originally, was put into the atmosphere... by bacteria, as a waste product.
Even though we can't see gases... they're a form of matter made up of atoms... that have weight.
Some gases are lighter than others.
So any gas lighter than Earth's atmosphere... will ﬂoat.
Six gases are lighter than our atmosphere... including the one that fills the Hindenburg- hydrogen, the most common element in the universe.
But it's also highly ﬂammable.
And because gases in the atmosphere can carry electric charges... its a simple spark of static electricity... that' dooms the Hindenburg.
But the atmosphere that carries the Hindenburg's destruction... is also what supports it... and everything else that ﬂies.
Just as water provides an environment for swimming...
Earth is atmosphere, thinner than water. -.
But with many of the same qualities... gives us something to push against... so we can ﬂy.
Let's get a bird and give him a space suit just over his face... and put him in space.
And he's gonna ﬂap like crazy and go nowhere.
Things can't ﬂy in space by ﬂying as we know it.
Why is this?
Because ﬂying requires you to have wings that are pushing against something.
When you do a pushup, you're using the ground to lift yourself up.
When you're ﬂying, you're using your wings... to push against molecules to lift yourself up.
And the force holding this invisible ocean in place?
Gravity... pulling on the atoms of gas to keep them around the planet.
You're trying to strike this delicate balance... between using the atmosphere to support you... and to overcome the, sort of, pull of gravity.
Earth has just the right amount of gravity... just the right density of atmosphere to make ﬂight possible.
The eternal enemy of ﬂight... is also what makes ﬂight on earth possible.
So we must rely on gravity while we defy it.
Big history reveals that the planet... is the Key to cracking the code of ﬂight.
But the story of ﬂight is just the beginning.
There's a much bigger puzzle hidden in big history.
Each episode unlocks a clue.
Everyday things like mountains... silver... and cell phones... hold the key.
Watch them all, and you'll see this grand mystery revealed- the big history of time, of space... the big history of us.

If they're still at large.
WPC Bullivant, how many times have I told you to do up all your buttons?
But I can't, Sergeant.
You said you wanted us to make a big bust this week, Sarge.
Nice to see you've got plenty of lead in your pencil, PC Dawson.
You should see the size of my rubber.
Watch this.
It's the Breen burn.
No one did a slow burn like Richard Breen.
- That's probably true.
- It was fabulous.
Oh, you know which one you'd really like?
You know what, Dad, just before you play another one...
- No, it's called "The Stakeout."
- I just want to show you...
- "Stakeout"'s my favorite.
You know that.
- Yeah, yeah.
Can I show you something first?
Remember I was telling you that I had that photo that I thought was Harry?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Turns out it wasn't Harry.
But I did manage to procure a photograph of Harry.
This is gonna be a little bit of a shock.
This is your grandfather.
That's a Chinaman.
- A Chinese person, yes.
- That's what I said.
- Ah-so.
- Don't do that.
You want firework?
- Five pound!
- Oh...
This explains my aptitude with laundry, doesn't it?
- Yeah.
- No, this doesn't make sense.
Look, my father was no Chinaman.
Yeah, have a look.
Absurd.
Do you think there's any chance that the Chinese gene can skip a generation?
You know, like baldness or blue eyes?
Well, blue eyes...
I mean, that's one thing.
- But Chinesity?
- Ah!
No.
Strange, Tom's obsession with family all of a sudden.
Hmm.
It's probably just a passing phase.
I mean, since Sarah dumped him, he's had a lot of time on his hands.
One hand in particular.
But, you know, genealogy is like any other -ology... best left to the scientists.
- No.
No, no.
- No.
You don't always see your ancestors' characteristics showing up in the present, in you.
My great-grandfather was German, but you don't see me annexing countries.
I'm six-foot-four.
These... it just doesn't seem to make sense.
Nah.
"To the best..."
"To the best..." what?
I think it says, "To the best Nancy Doo in Love."
That's a bit funny.
I think it's a homosexual thing.
But I don't... it might be code.
Gay code.
"To the best..."
Nancy Doo.
It's not...
no, that's Nanki-Poo.
Nanki-Poo is a character in "The Mikado."
So this isn't a Chinese person.
It's a Japanese person.
Well, it's not a Japanese person.
It's an English person playing a Japanese person.
He's an actor.
- You know "The Mikado"?
- I don't.
- It's by Gilbert and Sullivan.
- A musical or something?
Well, it's kind of an operettary thing, I think they call them.
It's Nanki-Poo.
He's just a tea bag.
And he's in love with Yum-Yum.
Yum-Yum is with somebody else...
Ko-Ko, I think.
- Are you drunk right now?
- Oh, it's absolutely bonkers.
Yeah, I couldn't follow it.
It's like a foreign "Teletubbies."
My fingers smell of chicken tikka masala.
Begone, random old man.
Step forward, the real Harry Chadwick.
Who later actually gave up photography and became an actor, which is interesting to me.
Ta-da!
What do you reckon of that?
- What you done there, Pete?
- Good?
I've moved your old tat out of the way and put your lager bottles.
Also, I've got...
you'll note,
I've got the tall ones at the end and then the small one is in the middle.
Thank God.
I couldn't... it was really...
it was racking my head, that.
Well, it's better than that old stuff.
- You know Nigel, who I work with at the zoo?
- Yeah.
Believe it or not, he's got 150 of these and they go right around the top of his picture frame, and they're all different and they're all dirty names.
- So he's got, like, Hair of the Pussy lager.
- Nice.
Old Bummer's Dirty Gold.
- That's good.
- Bishop's Finger Brown.
- Mmm.
- Tim's Brown Trout.
There's a lot of brown ones.
Randy Goat, Fanny's Old Spot,
Old Gobbler's Bumhole.
This is Nigel who's the manager of the zoo?
No, harelip Nigel.
That makes more sense.
That guy is living the dream.
Well, not...
apart from the harelip.
Is he a married man?
- He's not married.
- That's a shocker.
- Doesn't want to be.
- No.
Eh, oh, ah, right.
Talking of marriage...
Not marriage.
Don't worry.
I'm setting a lucky boy up on another date.
- Fuck, no.
- Fuck, yes.
- Don't do it.
- I can do it.
I've done it.
- She's called Tracey.
- Oh.
And she is fit...
as flip.
Wait a second.
Wait, wa... hold on one...
Harry died in Hove.
Did you know that?
I didn't know that.
No.
I've been busy doing something productive.
"To the best Nanki-Poo in Hove."
In Hove.
- He died in Hove!
- He died in Hove.
Not "in love."
That's... okay.
- We're going to Hove.
- Hove!
Lads' road trip.
Boys up north on tour.
Yeah, I'll drive.
- The ticket inspector's come along.
- Yeah.
So we had to go and stay in the toilet all the way from Margate to Paddington.
And we had only been eating fried potato sandwiches all week.
So the smell was... ow!
Well, this is it.
This is the house that my great-granddad lived in.
- Isn't that weird?
- Cool.
Probably tied up his horse here.
- His whores?
- His... don't ruin it.
He would have opened this gate.
He would have walked up these steps.
Excuse me.
Can I help you?
Oh, yeah.
Um... my great-grandfather Harry Chadwick used to live in this house years ago, so I was checking it out.
There are no Chadwicks here now.
Oh.
Chadwick...
I think I remember my mother talking about the Chadwicks.
She's lived here since she was a child.
Oh, do you think it would be possible for me to ask her a couple of questions?
Yes, of course.
I'll see if I can get her to come to.
- Oh, great.
- Would you like to come in for a cup of tea?
How lovely.
Thank you.
- Do you like Jaffa Cakes?
- Do I?
I do, yeah.
Oh, have you got Garibaldis?
- Jaffa Cakes would be great.
- I pref...
I like Jaffa Cakes.
So, Mom, this is Tom.
And he's got one or two questions about his great-grandfather Harry Chadwick.
Do you remember?
The Chadwicks that used to live next door?
I think he was some kind of a performer.
I think he was an actor maybe.
I... yes.
He was.
And did you ever see him in the theater?
Oh, yes, yes.
When I was a little girl, they took me to the... the...
Regent's Theatre to see him in a play.
Oh.
Oh, what was it?
"The Duchess of Malfi."
Ooh.
No, no.
No.
Uh...
Sh...
What was it?
No.
- What...
- Sorry?
What is that thing around her neck?
I invented that.
I'm rather proud of it.
So when she breathes...
so I can see she's still breathing.
I saw him in a play with David Garrick.
Ooh.
Um, Mom, I don't think it could have been David Garrick, because David Garrick, I think, was work... he was working in the 1700s, so I don't think it could have been David Garrick.
Sometimes she's as bright as a tack, others she's completely doolally.
Yeah, he's the same.
I remember.
It was Sir Donald Wolfit...
- Ah.
- ... not Garrick.
I look upon the theater as like a temple or a mosque or a church.
- The chairs are a bit like pews and...
- Right.
...the stage is a bit like an altar.
- I'm not religious myself.
- Yeah.
But, you know, I've been coming for years, and it's very much like we come to worship.
And do you know what these seats have seen?
- Mmm.
- Hmm?
Let alone the star dressing rooms.
- This is something else.
- It's beautiful.
"I have always relied on the kindness of strangers."
- Tennessee Williams.
- Yeah.
I love that film.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Marlon Brando.
- Yeah, he's great, isn't he?
Yes.
Yes, he's...
Have you seen "Superman"?
- Um...
- He played the dad in "Superman."
No.
I just remember his ripped T-shirt in... in... in "Streetcar"...
So weird that Harry stood here.
- Isn't it?
- Yes!
And now I'm standing here.
You're standing...
he stood here.
I just get goose bumps.
Yes, it's very moving, I think.
I was told that he performed here with Donald Wolfit.
No, no.
He did perform here with Laurence Olivier.
- No.
- Yes.
Sir Laurence.
- Oh, my God.
- No, I know.
And earlier today we were going through the records and we actually found a program.
There you go.
He acted opposite Laurence Olivier?
- Yes, he did.
- That's crazy.
It's amazing.
- Laurence Olivier.
- Yes, there he is.
Sir Laurence, aw.
- Harry Chadwick!
- Harry Chadwick.
"Greek Soldiers."
Yes, but on the same stage as Laurence Olivier, so that's... you know, that's wonderful.
And you know what, it was probably just the start of his career.
Uh, no.
No, I think it was sort of towards the end, the peak of his career.
But that's because, actually, Harry was mainly known for his light entertainment work, his comedic work, you see.
- Ah, I see.
He was more of a...
- Yes.
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
Yeah.
Oh, my God!
What... what are you doing?
- I'm...
- Just don't touch anything!
- Leave it!
Leave it!
- It's come off.
It's very dangerous here.
Just back away.
- No, no, please.
- That's not even attached on that side.
I'm sorry.
This theater is something of a labyrinth.
Ah, here we are.
Ta-da!
- Oh, wow.
- Guess.
Oh.
Um...
- There?
- No.
- The guy in the hat?
- No.
Here he is.
And, more specifically, here he is.
He was the back end of a pantomime horse.
- Shut up.
- Yes.
And in theatrical parlance, that's known as the tail end.
- Right.
- And his partner, Sid Balducci, was the front end, the gob-ender.
- The gob-ender.
- Yes, and they were together for about 20 years.
- He did this for 20 years?
- 20 years.
- Wow.
- And they were very, very, very well respected.
Yeah, I'm getting a lot of respect from the photo.
This is a production of "Hamlet"?
I...
I don't think so.
I don't think so either.
I was really joking.
No, but I know someone who does know.
- Yeah.
- Mitch!
Mitch!
Shut up.
Don't.
We need your help.
This is Pete and this is Tom Chadwick, great-grandson of Harry Chadwick.
It's an honor to meet you.
Oh, thank you.
- Hello, Pete.
- Hello.
I'm Pete.
Oh, isn't Harry on this?
Do you know, he is.
This is our centenary DVD.
We're very proud of it.
- Harry made the best-of?
- Yes.
- Oh.
- Harry is indeed on there.
As you can see, there are some other acts to go through.
This is a dog act.
Nobody liked to follow animal acts.
- Oh, the mess.
- Impossible to lift the audience afterwards.
"BeastEnders."
"Beast"...
like "EastEnders."
Yeah, I think they got it.
I think they got it.
Ah, now this is little Tich who was famous for dancing on stilts.
- Up he goes.
- Wow.
Indeed.
Seems to be pretty much all he did.
Ah, yes, and the famous regurgitator, Hadji Ali.
You'd have thought "regurgitator" would put the audience off, but they seemed to...
- Ho!
- ... enjoy it.
- Look at that.
- I can do that.
My favorite act of all... the women throwing the handkerchief.
- Aw.
- You know, a friend of mine told me they rehearsed for eight years to get this act right.
She just dropped it.
I think you can see the result, yes.
She might have needed nine years.
And that's what...
the three of them...
- Yeah.
- They throw the hand... and then...
Yes.
Ah, now, this is Wilson and Keppel without Betty with whom they often appeared.
As you see, they were very close.
We could do that.
And now the piÃƒÂ¨ce de rÃƒÂ©sistance.
- Hey!
- Yes.
Chadwick and Balducci.
Note the billing order, please.
- Oh.
- Alphabetical.
No, no, no, no.
Oh, no, B before C except...
no, B before C.
- You got it, didn't you?
- Got it.
And this, as you see, is their signature curtain call where they came downstage with Harry waving the horse's tail at the audience.
He's walking backwards.
And waving his tail.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
Very fetching.
Brilliant.
Would you say that out of all the rear-enders he would have been one of the better ones?
Do you know, I think I can say he was the best.
- Ooh.
- Aw.
Oh!
Why don't we show them the costume?
- Why not?
- We've got such a treat for you.
- Why don't you follow us?
Come on.
- Follow us.
It's just like an Aladdin's cave for me.
Wow.
All this stuff.
Haven't worn this for years.
Surely.
Here it is.
- Oh, my God.
- Ooh!
And every year they used to enter the annual Pantomime Horse Race.
Really quite historic.
- It's been run for nearly a hundred years.
- Wow.
And they won nine years in a row.
So, were they as close offstage as they were on?
Uh-oh.
Actually, they did have a terrible falling out.
It had been brewing for some time.
And the word is that on this particular day,
Sid ate a very strong curry before the show.
You see, and Harry being the legs and then Sid was the front and he was...
He would have gotten it right in the... yeah.
- Not pleasant.
- Personal hygiene wasn't good then.
- Got it.
- I don't think they worked together again after that.
- He farted.
- Yeah, I know.
We got that, Pete.
- Yes, thank you.
- The one in the front to the one in the back.
Yes, we worked it out.
I guess that's a real faux pas in the horse world.
Well, yes.
It's a sort of strike against you.
Is this something that I could buy off you?
Well, we don't normally sell costumes, but...
I think under the circumstances, as it's a rich piece of your family history,
- in exchange perhaps for a donation to the theater?
- Yeah.
Thanks so much for these.
Oh, no, it's been lovely.
- It's quite exciting for us.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thanks again.
- Thank you.
This is a bit difficult and strictly entre nous, but apparently the real reason Harry and Sid fell out was because Elsie, Harry's wife, had an affair with Sid.
- No.
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.
- I know.
And apparently, after Harry died,
Sid and Elsie got married and then left the area.
I know.
That's so sad.
- But I thought you should know.
- Yeah.
Yes.
Mmm.
- Poor Harry.
- Poor Harry, yes.
- Well, thanks for letting me know.
- No, no, no.
- It's actually really...
- It's a pleasure, you know.
Travel safe and, you know, pop in if you're in the environs.
There's tea all the time, caramel slices, everything.
- Exciting for us.
Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Aw.
- Chip in!
- Go on, there!
I mean, the news about Harry really just hit me for four, you know.
It's weird.
I kind of felt very connected to him in that moment.
And I've decided, as a legacy, as a tribute to Harry, that we are going to run the Costume Horse Derby.
And we're going to take it seriously.
You know, we want to win, because we are stepping...
running in the footstep... the hoof steps of a legend.
I can't hear anything and I have very limited vision.
Let's do this thing!
It's me.
- Did they kn...
- Yeah.
They look a bit vulnerable out there, don't they?
Doing something so outlandish in public?
Hello?
Hello?
Yeah, but this is less conspicuous.
Don't stop too suddenly, Pete.
- I'll go right up you.
- I won't.
Three, two, one.
- Run.
- Ow!
They haven't quite got the movement of the horse down.
- Are they gonna go crawl?
- I'm not sure.
- Right!
- Left!
- Right.
- Why are you saying...?
I just find it interesting that my grandfather was...
my great-grandfather...
- Harry.
- Harry was in the theater.
- Is it giving you ideas?
- Monkey's been telling me we should start to tread the boards ourselves.
Well, I think I've got it in my blood.
- Well, it's my blood.
- My blood.
- My blood.
- She's so weird.
But I think...
I'm not sure if I'm ready to share him with the world.
- She wants to keep me locked up to herself.
- Well...
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Come on.
Hey, look!
It's Tony Evans!
Eeyore!
Eeyore!
Give him the ball.
Yeah!
- Let him have a shot.
- Ow!
- Oh!
- What the fuck was that?
It's funny, because this weekend
I'm going...
I'm going trekking with some friends.
- Oh.
- We go to the countryside, 'cause I've got this thing where I really like bones.
And so do my friends.
We go to the countryside at the weekend and we find little patches and we dig them up.
It's different, isn't it?
It's different.
Some girls are into shoes.
- Yeah.
- Or... "I really like scarves," isn't it?
And I just...
I'm just really into bones.
- That's interesting.
- Yeah.
Once you say you like bones, you will see them everywhere.
- I hadn't thought about that.
- Yeah.
Roadkill.
There's roadkill.
For sure they've got bones in those, don't they?
Yeah, plenty, and that's just like free bones.
It's like they're just on the side.
- Do you buy bones?
- Well, not directly, but sometimes you get them as a by-product.
Like, if I were to offer you a bucket, what would you take out of it?
- What bit of meat?
- Breast.
- It's the breast, isn't it?
- Yeah, it's the tastiest.
Straight to the breast.
Straight, always.
- Right in there.
- You're wrong, though.
You go for the leg, you get the free bone.
Free bone.
- So it's...
- Sometimes you get a bone with the breast.
- No, because...
- It's not as...
- It's not.
If you've got...
- Not in a pure breast.
No, that's why you have to go for the legs.
- Yeah, the legs are good.
- Yeah.
They're quite sexy.
Oh, I hadn't thought of them in a sexual way.
I feel a bit funny
- saying this on a first date.
- Yeah.
I always think no one really talks about how quite sort of sensual a bone... to look at.
- Mm-hmm.
- The curves of it are really quite lovely.
Like a vertebrae, for example.
- It's a great bone.
- It's a great bone.
- Yeah.
- No, but it really is.
- Mm-hmm.
- One of my favorites, I'd say.
What's... what would be your favorite bone?
Oh...
Uh, femur?
Like, a femur bone?
- That's a good one.
- That's a bone, isn't it?
- Yeah, that's a really good one.
- Yeah.
- I like a clavicle as well.
- Yeah?
Mmm.
I've got quite pronounced clavicles.
- You can see.
If I do that...
- Yeah.
If I do that, you can really... you really notice how the clavicles
- are quite...
- They're massive, aren't they?
- ... pronounced, aren't they?
- Yeah, they are.
Yeah.
- You can see, can't you?
- Yeah, they're right...
You could probably...
like, you could put... you could put...
- What are you...?
- If you could...
- Yeah?
- Go on, put some.
Put... go on, have it.
- Put salt in there?
- Yeah, see.
- Just put...
- All right.
See?
- There we go.
There we go.
- Yeah, you see?
It's in there, yeah?
I just put salt in your clavicle.
Just kind of tumbling out there.
Ooh.
Fuckin' salt all over you.
- Still in there as well.
- Yeah.
I'll just keep it.
Put some on my dinner.
Have I gone too far with the...?
You seem a bit upset.
It's... it's fascinating.
It's fascinating, but it's...
- Overwhelming.
- It's fucking so much bone.
Like, it's more bone than...
I don't know if I was ready for it.
Out in the real world just talking about bones and pouring salt on each other.
I don't know if I'm able...
I just don't know if I'm able for it.
I don't just talk about bones.
That's all you've talked about tonight.
I can talk about other things like stones.
Well, there you go.
This year's first-time contender,
Harry's End, owned by Tom Chadwick, is currently at eight to one.
Last year's runner-up, Panda Expression, is at four to one.
And Jim the Giraffe, today's joint favorite, is now at five to three.
The Pantomime Horse Race has been going nearly a hundred years.
The first time it was held was 1919, just after the Great War.
This was an amazing way of cheering everyone up with a wonderful event of happiness and sporting activity.
During the Second World War, there was a scarcity of horses and we had to open the doors to other animals... cows, the odd pig.
I drew the line a couple of years ago when a camel wanted to run.
I thought, "That's a little bit unfair.
The chap behind got to stand up, head in the hump."
And I thought, "No, that's an advantage too far."
- I'm feeling pretty confident.
- I'm feeling strong.
There's a lot of good crews out there.
- There's no doubt about that.
- Yeah.
I can see a little bit through the mouth.
And we did the circuit.
And there's a couple of crews that are looking strong.
Although there's a guy just in a giraffe...
- Jim the Giraffe.
- He's just...
- That's just one guy.
- He's just one guy.
He's got two legs.
We haven't costume raced before, but you don't need to be an expert
- to see the difference between two and four.
- There's a difference.
The going here today is soft to firm.
Jim the Giraffe looks like he could win by a neck.
Uncle Ned is primed to go.
Daisy Cow looks like an udder good contender.
- And Harry's End seems eager to get under way.
- I'm really excited, Keith.
- Remember that when they cross...
- All right, Tom!
- the finish line, the front and the back end...
- Get the gold!
- Showtime!
- ...of the horses must be attached.
They're all in line now and...
- Go, Tom!
- Away they go!
Panda Expression is showing a good early pace in the middle of the pack, but Jim the Giraffe is taking the lead with Kedgeree Breakfast and Uncle Ned bringing up the rear.
- Ooh!
Aw, and Harry's End has fallen badly.
- Foul!
Get up!
It's Jim the Giraffe followed by Panda Expression
- as Harry's End tries in vain to catch up.
- Good recovery.
All right.
Bloody hell.
This fucking cramp.
- This cramp just hit...
- I told you...
- Yeah, I know.
- ... that giraffe would win.
Two legs.
A biped versus "fourpeds."
How is that fair?
And that panda.
It was miles away.
- I couldn't see him.
- Tiny...
- He was like a dot.
- I couldn't see him.
I couldn't see anything.
He was only 55 when he died.
Sad.
He died so young with a broken heart and lungs full of the flatulence of his betrayer.
It wasn't your fault, Harry.
You and me.
What a pair of cuckolds.
This is his...
his mom and dad,
Charles and Rebecca Chadwick.
Died in the '20s.
Weirdly, there's no... there's no date of birth on the tombstones.
I wonder what we'll find out about them.
The way things are going, we'll find out that Rebecca was probably a stripper.
Rest well, Harry, with your tail held high.

- Are you ready to do this?
- Yeah.
Are you scared?
Yeah.
You'll do great.
Just let me know when you're ready.
Five, four, three, two, one.
You' re on.
Are you up?
Of course you are.
Night owls.
Night hawks.
Lovers.
Dreamers.
Girls on the run.
- Would you like me to tell you a story?
- Yes.
A story off sexual addiction of giving up control.
A love affair turned... toxic.
Of how I almost lost my leg and nearly lost my life.
Santa Monica by the sea.
On a lazy...
Sunday afternoon.
I was designing jewelry at the time.
Not doing so great, but... good enough.
Making ends meet.
I was at my friend Matthew's shop on Main street, when a wealthy client of his, appeared in the reflection of the mirror I was standing in front of.
I'll take her.
She's not for sale, Jack.
Too bad.
I was refering the boat.
Victoria Dupre, this is Jack Thornton, one of my oldest and dearest clients.
Nice choice.
This will look great in your house.
He was wearing a dark suit... and a crisp, white shirt.
The woman with him...
Isabel.
Came to find out later was his...
"go-to" girl.
And in that first moment... of eye contact... he made it absolutely clear to me... without even saying a word
that he would not disappoint me.
How long have you lived here?
Awhile.
I'll get around to furnishing it one of these days.
It's so empty.
I've never seen anything like it.
It's so beautiful.
Do not move, stay there.
Beautiful.
Absolutely fuckin' beautiful.
Take off your clothes.
What?
You have a beautiful body.
Show it to me.
It's our first date, Jack.
Don't you think we might be moving... too fast?
No.
But if you want me to stop, tell me... and I will.
That's what you want, Victoria?
Did you want me to stop?
What's it going to be Victoria?
It's up to you.
It will always be up to you.
I'm gonna sit here and watch.
Let me see your breasts.
Perfect body.
Perfect smile.
Talented.
Smart.
You just take my breath away.
Take off your panties, Victoria.
What I'm going to do now, is open the front of my pants... and wait for you to come over here... and slowly sink down onto me.
Will you do that for me, Victoria?
That's what I want.
Slowly.
I want you to take me... inch by inch.
Breathing in... and breathing out.
No kissing.
No touching.
Just the feeling of me inside you.
I'm growing bigger... and more insistent by the moment.
Contract the muscles... of your vagina.
Slowly.
Make love to me like that.
Can you do it without moving?
Tell me I want to know.
Can you feel how much I want you?
Yes.
Breathing in... and breathing out.
No kissing.
No touching.
Truth be told... the first time you touched me...
I came.
A first of many firsts.
Fucked nonstop for a week.
Passion.
Romance.
Love.
The whole nine yards.
Marry me.
Are you crazy?
Marry me.
Why?
So you can turn me into what you want?
You are already exactly what I want.
They say he bought up all the property that he could downtown when he was just a kid.
You know back when downtown was like living in Outer Mongolia and everybody was selling their soul to be on the west side?
Not our Jack.
He was buying Downtown.
I don't know where he got the money, but he got it.
And he has the most beautiful penis.
What?
How do you know?
- I've been told.
- By whom?
Oh my God, don't tell me he's gay.
Sorry, trade secret.
- Flowers for Miss Dupre.
- I'm Victoria Dupre.
Ooo!
Looks like somebody likes what he saw!
He asked me to marry him.
Already?
I'm not surprised.
I was.
What'd you say?
I said he didn't know me well enough.
Wrong answer.
The greatest fuck you've ever had Jack.
Tell me about it.
I want to know.
Where are you taking me?
What's going on?
The greatest fuck I've ever had... that's what you wanted to know right?
Pretend this is an elevator in an office building.
Okay?
I'm just about to step onto it... when a woman comes charging at me carrying a huge bouquet of wild flowers.
begging me to hold the elevator for her, because she forgot something in her office... and she's in a real hurry.
You'll be the woman, I'll be me.
You alright with that?
Good.
Do it.
Oh my God, I completely forgot.
More conviction.
Play the role.
I'm such an idiot.
Can you hold the elevatorfor me please?
I'll be back in just a second.
I swear.
Better... and before I could answer, she hands me the flowers... runs back to her office,
Grabs a box with a birthday cake in it... and comes running back.
We step on the elevator,
I hand her back the flowers.
Low and behold the elevator stops, between floors.
Stuck.
Greatest fuck I ever had.
Do you want to go on?
Yes?
Yeah, just stopped.
Twenty minutes?
Okay.
Yeah we're fine, we're fine.
Thank you.
I'm afraid this is going to take awhile.
I'm dead... completely dead.
My husband is going to kill me.
He reach up under your skirt, slide off your panties... and put them in the right coat pocket.
- You really said that?
- I did.
- And she did it?
- Not right away, but eventually, yes.
Twenty minutes till those doors open again... and all I'm asking you to do, is reach up under yours skirt... slide off your panties... and put them in the right coat pocket.
You asked me to describe the greatest fuck I ever had.
That's what you said?
I'll show you.
I'll take this as far as you want to go.
Never done anything like that when I was a kitten.
but with Jack... a lot of things that I'd never done before.
Things I, fantasized about doing... over and over again in my mind.
It all seemed so easy.
So... natural.
Fuck...
Marry me.
Yes or no?
Please, make me come.
Yes or no?
Yes, I'll marry you.
The answer is yes.
Yes Jack.
We are gathered here for the most holy of ceremonies.
The union of two individuals who truly love one another..
May I ask you to repeat after me,
I, Jack Thorton...
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
I loved today.
Special if my mother and Matthew could have been there.
Then your dad would have had to come... and his new wife who you don't like.
and... her kids and their dog... and his wife's mother, and her sister, And what about my Aunt Rose?
... and her nurse?
And Matthew's lover and his lover's lovers.
Just answer me one question.
How did Matthew... know you had a beautiful penis?
Tell me.
I want to know.
- Someone must have told him.
- Who?
Beats me.
Someone I dated I guess.
Who was she?
... and how many "shes" have there been?
- That's not important.
- It is to me.
I want to know how many hearts I've just broken.
All of a sudden...
I started resenting all of Jack's ex lovers..
Blondes with the fake tits, brunettes, the puffy collagen lips.
Marriage.
The question is, "How do you keep a man like Jack faithful?"
Victoria?
Come on, Victoria, this is our wedding night.
Where the hell are you?
Ow!
What?
What?
Tell me.
All the stories I heard about you...
How every day you'd pick out a different woman.
Take her back to your suite at The Ritz and fuck her brains out.
They are true?
Come on, Victoria, we just got married.
It's true, isn't it?
Victoria.
I bet you didn't even ask them their names.
It had nothing to do with love.
It had nothing to do with you.
Your life growing up Jack, tell me about it.
I want to know every detail.
I liked boxing gyms and the feel of money in my pocket.
I liked coming to this country knowing I could be anything I wanted to be.
I liked reading the real estate ads in the Times,
I liked buying new clothes and having my shoes shined.
I liked being alone, eating alone, and waking up alone.
Until?
Until...
I saw you in Matthew's showroom that day.
You are so full of shit Jack.
I like watching you move.
I like the jewelry you make.
I like your hair, your eyes, the music you listen to, your spirit.
I do, really.
I like your energy, your dreams, your laughter, your rage.
- I like everything about you.
- My rager?
Your rage, yeah.
Right below the surface, ready to explode.
Good, clean, cherry-pink rage.
I don't have any rage.
Everyone has rage.
Just a question of what comes out and what form it takes.
- It's what drives us.
- Really?
Really.
I wish I could protect you from my past... but I can't.
Fuck the past.
Stop!
Stop it!
Stop it!
C'mon!
Jack this is dangerous.
Stop...
Stop it!
What the fuck are you doing?
Stop.
Ow!
Jack!
I hate to think that I was out of control even then, but I was...
I was in love.
... or was it lust?
Had I fallen in love with Jack or... was it just that magnificent dick of his?
I even started to go with him on his dates.
At his hotel suite.
I went to a spa and I got a facial and manicure.
I love European boys and I heard you are Greek.
Hi, Jack.
I came all the way from Valencia, Spain... because I heard that your dick is amazing.
The 100% Greek dick?
And I promised to all my girlfriends that I would take a photo of your dick.
So you gonna let me take a photo of it right?
No.
I've been divorced for about a year now, and I've only been with one man.
One of my friends ways saying what a wonderful lover your are.
I was hoping that you could unlock the passion I know is inside of me.
Would you like to seem make myself squirt, Jack?
- Sure why not?
If you don't let me take a photo of your dick, I'm not gonna fuck you.
But, if you let me, maybe I can fuck you... or maybe I can give a blowjob.
You want me to show you how I do the blowjob?
First I take the balls, and lick them from down, up...
Believe it or not, I actually I paid someone to teach me.
It was the most fun I've ever had in my lfe..
Really.
... and then I take the dick, and I start to suck it.
Until I can feel here.
I love it, and until I can feel the milk all over me... cuz, I love milk.
It can get a little messy.
So I've heard.
I wanted to look good for you.
American boys, they are too controlling.
Sometimes we'd play this game where I'd just show up in the room.
Just to see what the reaction would be.
- Who is she?
- My wife.
- Would you like to meet her?
- Sure.
And most women seemed happy to have me there.
That is how much I sacrifice myself and to fuck you.
So what do you say?
You can take a picture of my dick.
- Who fuck is this?
- My wife.
And then there were the ones that just... freaked out and ran out of the room screaming.
Monica.
Victoria.
Very nice to meet you.
You're very pretty... and tall.
From Slovakia.
So Monica, are you in or out?
I'm in.
You might want to get me a towel.
I brought you your towels Mr. Thorton.
I'm sorry was I interrupting something?
And sometimes I'd dress up as a hotel maid... and come into the room with an armful of fresh towels.
Jack would invited me to stay and play.
Come here, Jack.
Jack, what am I supposed to do?
Anything you want.
And through it all, Jack just kept on smiling
He was happy... and so was I.
Two days later...
Jack left on a business trip.
New Orleans this time.
He asked me to go with him, but I had a big jewelry show to get ready for.
So I stayed home.
Alright guys on three.
Ready?
One two Three.
Hi, I'm Isabel.
We haven't been formally introduced.
Jack asked me to look after you while he was away.
Congratulations on your marriage by the way.
I'm a little jealous that I was't invited to the ceremony, but that's our Jack.
His way or the highway?
I hope you like the dining set I picked out for you.
I like it.
"His Way or the highway."
Thanks for the warning, sister.
Opera gloves and stilettos... in the middle of the day?
Turns out, Isabel had been working for Jack for years.
She was his go-to girl, his assistant... cook, and Chief bottle-washer.
Later, she swore to me that she never fucked him.
Although it was hard for me to believe...
I kinda chose to at the time.
Victoria, this is Rita.
She's going to be helping around the house while Jack's away.
So if there's anything you need or want, don't hesitate to ask.
These are gorgeous.
- Can I try one on?
- Of course.
Turn around and let me see.
It's beautiful.
What do you think?
How about unbutton the rest of your shirt?
Let's see what that looks like.
The bra.
Take off your bra and put it on the floor.
I want to see what this necklace looks like against some skin.
She's a beautiful model.
Perfect for your jewelry.
Don't you think?
You know, I brought my camera with me.
Would you mind if I took a few pictures?
Did Jack put you up to this?
Jack didn't put me up to anything.
He told me to keep you amused.
I assume this is amusing you?
Enormously.
It's beautiful.
Oh yeah... right there.
Victoria, why don't you stand in the frame?
And watch from there.
No, I'm more of a "behind the camera" kinda girl.
I'm not asking you to do anything.
Just watch.
No.
Fine, if you're not going to take any pictures, take a look at these.
That's pretty hot, huh?
Here you try.
Put the camera up to your eye.
Poses for her.
Keep shooting, and I have no idea what's going to happen next.
How unexpected was that... right?
And it didn't turn me off... it... excited me.
Hello?
You've been a bad girl Victoria, haven't you?
This is the first time it's rung since you left?
C'mon Victoria, don't be coy.
Isabel told me about your little photo shoot.
Sounds like a perfect way of selling jewels if you ask me.
And it turned you on didn't it?
Tell me.
- Yes.
- Yes what?
- Yes, it turned me on.
- What did you feel?
Describe it to me, in detail.
- I can't.
- Of course you can.
Tell me exactly how it made you feel.
Wet, as if you were going down on me.
Your tongue on my clit... doing what you do to get me off.
Do I get you off?
Really... get you off?
Or are you just faking it?
Most women fake it.
That's just common knowledge.
Not this woman.
Good to know.
Now I want to wet your fingers... and drop them down between your legs, and make yourself come.
I've got my cock in my hand.
Why doesn't that surprise me.
It shouldn't.
It's the effect you have on me.
It is hard?
Describe it to me.
It's as hard and big as it's ever been.
Just hearing your voice turns it into a monster.
I'm looking at my body in the mirror as I masturbate.
I can see the juice from my pussy running down the inside of my leg.
Good girl.
- If I were there, I would lick it away.
- Of course you would.
With you...
I am always ready to play.
Something that's never happened before you.
I love it.
Fuck.
That's about as hot as it gets.
Everything he did excited me.
No matter what he did... or how he did it... or how uncomfortable... it made me feel, in the end...
I would always end up having a massive orgasm.
And I loved it.
You saw me watching you earlier didn't you?
I'm sorry, I just happened to be there, it was an accident.
Was it really?
Did you find everything satisfactory madame?
My name is Victoria.
Is there anything else you'd like me to get for you, Victoria?
Everything is perfect just the way it is.
- Perfect?
- Yes.
Perfect.
Jack hired Antonio to be your driver.
He'll take you anywhere you'd like to go.
- It's fine, I have my own car.
- Not anymore.
Jack gave me instructions to sell it for you, buy you a new Range Rover.
All you need to do is pick out the color.
It'll be here by the end of the week.
Isabel was put there to pushmy buttons.
I knew that.
And Jack had put her up to it.
No doubt, about it.
Victoria, I'm pleased to see you.
Rita and her friend Adelaide are trying out these new sex toys... for some audition for a sex toy company.
I mean, it's not the movies and I know that, but Adelaide and I really want this job...
I mean, you got to start somewhere, right?
Ask Victoria if she'd like join us.
Victoria, would you like join us?
I do not think she's ever used a sex toy before.
Ask her.
Have you ever masturbated with a toy before?
Would you like to?
I'll pick you a good one.
Here, this one is like the perfect beginer's toy.
Just let me know how it works for you in the morning.
You'd be doing me a huge favor.
If you can sell her a vibrator, you have the job made.
I've masturbated before.
Not as a steady diet but from time to time.
But now... once I started...
It was like I couldn't stop.
- What do you think?
- Nice.
Ever since I was a teenager, every time I saw a car like this... all I wanted to do is get inside where no one could see... slide my panties off... and rub my bare ass all over the nice leather seats.
And you know what?
Every bit as good as I thought it would be.
C'mon Rita try!
Right?
Isn't it amazing?
- C'mon Victoria, it's your turn.
- I think I'll pass.
Why does that not surprise me that Victoria would turn me down?
- What about you Antonio, in or out?
- I'm way ahead of you.
So Victoria, this is your band new car.
You get first dibs on going down on Antonio.
How considerate of you.
I'll take that as a no.
I'll do the honor myself.
Don't tell me.
It's you, and you think I've been a bad girl again?
- Have you been?
- Not this time.
At least, not yet.
Payday.
How did she manage to call you so fast?
I just left her a second ago.
- Who?
- Don't be coy, Jack... doesn't suit you.
Hold on a sec...
Thank you very much.
Just...
Nobody called me, Victoria.
I just wanted to talk to you
Who's in the room with you?
The chambermaid.
I needed some fresh towels.
Of course you did.
I wonder why?
You can talk to her if you want, I don't think she speaks any English.
But you can try, if that will make you feel any better.
Is she pretty?
Very.
I'm having a hard time controlling myself.
You want to talk to her?
I can get her to put her teeth back in.
No really, I've never had a blowjob from a woman with no teeth.
- It could be interesting.
- Could be.
Why do not you go find out?
- I Gotta go.
- No you don't.
Yes I do.
See you when you get home.
Truth be known...
I was beyond excited...
- Hi, Beautiful day huh?
- Yeah.
Beautiful day, beautiful house,
beautiful people.
Not as pretty as you.
You're really really pretty...
"model" pretty.
And you're nice.
I can see why Jack married you.
There's something I need to ask you.
Hope you're not offended by it but I really need to know
Have you ever slept with Jack?
Once.
Maybe twice.
Do not get me wrong, it was fine.
Better than fine.
I do not expect anything else.
I think Jack and I are just too much alike if you know what I mean?
You on the other hand.
Now you're the "marrying" kind.
Which is a good thing...
I guess.
Shit, especially nowadays when everything's disposable.
No doubt about it.
Jack and his team were... forcing me... to find out things about myself, that...
I had no idea were there.
Is this what you want, Jack?
How was your day?
- Interesting.
- Do you like my dress?
It suits you.
Rita's made us the most wonderful dinner.
Chicken.
Just the way you like it.
Thank you.
Don't you feel ridiculous?
I do.
Why?
Look at me.
I think you look marvelous.
Who else has Jack done this with?
That's something you should ask Jack.
How much has he told you about me?
He told us he finally found someone he truly loved.
Doesn't it seem odd to you... that he'd leave me here alone like this?
Nothing Jack does surprises me.
Including marrying me?
Are you asking if I'm jealous?
I'm asking... if you're in love with Jack?
Yes.
I Am.
What about you and Rita?
Are you lovers outside of here?
Yes.
And Antonio?
Yes.
And Jack?
No, wait.
Let me guess.
That's something I should ask him.
Would you like to see a really sexy film Ms.Thorton?
It's wonderful, and old.
A classic.
Aren't they beautiful?
And brave?
We're here for your pleasure, Mrs. Thorton.
Trust.
I can't.
You choose.
Antonio... or me.
I had never experienced such... intense pleasure.
And when it was over... all I wanted was more.
- Will you wait for me, Antonio?
- Of course.
Anonymous sex.
Elegant.
Without guilt... without shame.
Without a seconds hesitation.
Pleasure or pain?
Pain.
Are you sure?
Yes.
She's all yours, mistress.
When the cat's away, the mouse will play.
Pleasure or pain, Mrs. Thorton?
It's your choice.
- Pleasure.
- I can't hear you, Mrs. Thorton.
Pleasure.
Very good.
What brought you here to our little circle tonight?
My husband.
Your husband?
Tell us about him.
He controls me... manipulates me... from afar.
Never knowing what he's going to do next.
The unspoken,
The unspoken?
What's hidden... deep... inside of us... that we never knew was there.
Until someone brings it out.
Tell us why you came here tonight?
We want to know.
We have to know.
I'm so scared.
Of what?
Letting myself go.
There's a man standing behind you, Mrs. Thorton.
What do you want him to do?
Pleasure or pain?
Pleasure.
Who are you?
Does it really matter?
No.
You are so beautiful, Mrs. Thorton.
Does seeing me making love to Antonio make you jealous?
Very.
I know this might sounds strange, sick even... but seeing you with him reminded me of how much I love you.
He said that, as I neared orgasm...
I suddenly became another person.
I wish I was.
An insatiable, sex crazed, orgasm, obsessed, creature.
That night changed me.
But the changed him too.
It got to the point where...
Jack no longer wanted to make love to me.
And it made me crazy.
I became obsessed with... trying to think of things to please him... to turn him on.
As much as we tried... there was nothing I could do.
It was humiliating.
But, I didn't care.
I just wanted him back.
I'd do anything... to get him back.
And every time I did what he wanted...
He just pushed me further away.
You look good in red, Victoria.
Have I ever told you... how I came the first time you touched me?
The question is, why don't you want me anymore?
Have you used me up...
Completely?
Do you want me to move out?
If you do, I will.
Just tell me what you want.
And I'll do it.
Have you met someone else?
Is that it?
Someone pretty... and innocent?
Like I was?
Does it hurt you... to see me desperate like this...
Jack?
Because I... am certainly... in pain.
Victoria.
Eve.
Hello, Victoria.
I've heard so many wonderful things about you.
Eve's from Oklahoma.
She's here in L.A. hoping to become a porn star.
I'm meeting with the people from Vivid next week.
I'm really excited.
You should keep your fingers crossed for me.
Isabel has kindly agreed... to shoot some footage of Eve doing here thing.
Like a screen test.
I'll be the director... and you... will be the movie star.
Eve, if it's okay with Victoria...
I want you to seduce her... in the most provocative wayyou can think of.
Are you okay with that, Victoria?
How long have you two been seeing each other?
About a month, come Saturday night.
Does that offend you?
No.
It might have before I met Jack... but now... not at all.
So it's okay?
Whatever Jack wants,
Jack gets.
I bought into it.
Why shouldn't you?
That, made him feel alive.
Is there anything else that I can get you, Mr. Thornton?
No, Rita.
Thank you very much.
You can go home if you like.
Did you ever love me, Jack?
Truly love me?
I still do.
It's simple really...
If I don't force you to leave, you will come to your senses soon enough and abandon me.
Some day, soon... it will become too much for you.
It's you that's doing this to us.
Not me.
Don't be naive, Victoria.
You're too smart for that.
Look at you.
This is not who you really are.
This whole sex thing is a passing thing for you.
A phase.
A little excitement and then it's done.
For me, it's who I am.
I'm way too far gone.
But you're not.
Not yet.
So what I'm doing is really for your own good.
Go away some place.
Get over this, and go on with your life.
Without me.
You deserve better.
But I want you.
It's over, Victoria.
Leave before I destroy you.
Bullshit.
This is absolute, fucking bullshit!
Stop it.
Fuck off, Jack.
What are you gonna do?
We were on our way home, just Jack and me.
And my new best friend, Eve.
I'm horny as hell.
Every since I started doing porn, I can masturbate at least five times a day... or I get real grumpy.
You should start thinking about doing porn, Victoria.
Sex all day, and you're getting paid?
It's a fucking dream come true.
I need some dick.
Fuck me harder, harder motherfucker!
Eve died.
I injured my leg... badly.
And Jack... poor Jack.
He was in ICU for over a week.
They tried everything.
But there was nothing anyone could do.
In the end, we lost him.
I lost him.
It was too much.
I couldnt...
I just couldn't.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I'm sure that at some point in your lives... all of you women out there... dream of finding the perfect lover.
For great sex.
Constant sex.
Exciting, fabulous, hot sex.
Of giving everything... until there's nothing left.
Like anything else... in excess, it can get a hold of you... and take you over... completely.
Kamikaze love.
Dangerous love.
Drivin to the edge, over and over.
Willing to die for love.
By telling you this... maybe, just maybe, I can... begin to put my life back together again.
- That gives me hope.
- It should.
So, it's adios for now.
Until next time.
If there is a next time.
Above all...
Be brave.

- Are you ready to do this?
- Yeah.
Are you scared?
Yeah.
You'll do great.
Just let me know when you're ready.
Five, four, three, two, one.
You' re on.
Are you up?
Of course you are.
Night owls.
Night hawks.
Lovers.
Dreamers.
Girls on the run.
- Would you like me to tell you a story?
- Yes.
A story off sexual addiction of giving up control.
A love affair turned... toxic.
Of how I almost lost my leg and nearly lost my life.
Santa Monica by the sea.
On a lazy...
Sunday afternoon.
I was designing jewelry at the time.
Not doing so great, but... good enough.
Making ends meet.
I was at my friend Matthew's shop on Main street, when a wealthy client of his, appeared in the reflection of the mirror I was standing in front of.
I'll take her.
She's not for sale, Jack.
Too bad.
I was refering the boat.
Victoria Dupre, this is Jack Thornton, one of my oldest and dearest clients.
Nice choice.
This will look great in your house.
He was wearing a dark suit... and a crisp, white shirt.
The woman with him...
Isabel.
Came to find out later was his...
"go-to" girl.
And in that first moment... of eye contact... he made it absolutely clear to me... without even saying a word
that he would not disappoint me.
How long have you lived here?
Awhile.
I'll get around to furnishing it one of these days.
It's so empty.
I've never seen anything like it.
It's so beautiful.
Do not move, stay there.
Beautiful.
Absolutely fuckin' beautiful.
Take off your clothes.
What?
You have a beautiful body.
Show it to me.
It's our first date, Jack.
Don't you think we might be moving... too fast?
No.
But if you want me to stop, tell me... and I will.
That's what you want, Victoria?
Did you want me to stop?
What's it going to be Victoria?
It's up to you.
It will always be up to you.
I'm gonna sit here and watch.
Let me see your breasts.
Perfect body.
Perfect smile.
Talented.
Smart.
You just take my breath away.
Take off your panties, Victoria.
What I'm going to do now, is open the front of my pants... and wait for you to come over here... and slowly sink down onto me.
Will you do that for me, Victoria?
That's what I want.
Slowly.
I want you to take me... inch by inch.
Breathing in... and breathing out.
No kissing.
No touching.
Just the feeling of me inside you.
I'm growing bigger... and more insistent by the moment.
Contract the muscles... of your vagina.
Slowly.
Make love to me like that.
Can you do it without moving?
Tell me I want to know.
Can you feel how much I want you?
Yes.
Breathing in... and breathing out.
No kissing.
No touching.
Truth be told... the first time you touched me...
I came.
A first of many firsts.
Fucked nonstop for a week.
Passion.
Romance.
Love.
The whole nine yards.
Marry me.
Are you crazy?
Marry me.
Why?
So you can turn me into what you want?
You are already exactly what I want.
They say he bought up all the property that he could downtown when he was just a kid.
You know back when downtown was like living in Outer Mongolia and everybody was selling their soul to be on the west side?
Not our Jack.
He was buying Downtown.
I don't know where he got the money, but he got it.
And he has the most beautiful penis.
What?
How do you know?
- I've been told.
- By whom?
Oh my God, don't tell me he's gay.
Sorry, trade secret.
- Flowers for Miss Dupre.
- I'm Victoria Dupre.
Ooo!
Looks like somebody likes what he saw!
He asked me to marry him.
Already?
I'm not surprised.
I was.
What'd you say?
I said he didn't know me well enough.
Wrong answer.
The greatest fuck you've ever had Jack.
Tell me about it.
I want to know.
Where are you taking me?
What's going on?
The greatest fuck I've ever had... that's what you wanted to know right?
Pretend this is an elevator in an office building.
Okay?
I'm just about to step onto it... when a woman comes charging at me carrying a huge bouquet of wild flowers.
begging me to hold the elevator for her, because she forgot something in her office... and she's in a real hurry.
You'll be the woman, I'll be me.
You alright with that?
Good.
Do it.
Oh my God, I completely forgot.
More conviction.
Play the role.
I'm such an idiot.
Can you hold the elevatorfor me please?
I'll be back in just a second.
I swear.
Better... and before I could answer, she hands me the flowers... runs back to her office,
Grabs a box with a birthday cake in it... and comes running back.
We step on the elevator,
I hand her back the flowers.
Low and behold the elevator stops, between floors.
Stuck.
Greatest fuck I ever had.
Do you want to go on?
Yes?
Yeah, just stopped.
Twenty minutes?
Okay.
Yeah we're fine, we're fine.
Thank you.
I'm afraid this is going to take awhile.
I'm dead... completely dead.
My husband is going to kill me.
He reach up under your skirt, slide off your panties... and put them in the right coat pocket.
- You really said that?
- I did.
- And she did it?
- Not right away, but eventually, yes.
Twenty minutes till those doors open again... and all I'm asking you to do, is reach up under yours skirt... slide off your panties... and put them in the right coat pocket.
You asked me to describe the greatest fuck I ever had.
That's what you said?
I'll show you.
I'll take this as far as you want to go.
Never done anything like that when I was a kitten.
but with Jack... a lot of things that I'd never done before.
Things I, fantasized about doing... over and over again in my mind.
It all seemed so easy.
So... natural.
Fuck...
Marry me.
Yes or no?
Please, make me come.
Yes or no?
Yes, I'll marry you.
The answer is yes.
Yes Jack.
We are gathered here for the most holy of ceremonies.
The union of two individuals who truly love one another..
May I ask you to repeat after me,
I, Jack Thorton...
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
I loved today.
Special if my mother and Matthew could have been there.
Then your dad would have had to come... and his new wife who you don't like.
and... her kids and their dog... and his wife's mother, and her sister, And what about my Aunt Rose?
... and her nurse?
And Matthew's lover and his lover's lovers.
Just answer me one question.
How did Matthew... know you had a beautiful penis?
Tell me.
I want to know.
- Someone must have told him.
- Who?
Beats me.
Someone I dated I guess.
Who was she?
... and how many "shes" have there been?
- That's not important.
- It is to me.
I want to know how many hearts I've just broken.
All of a sudden...
I started resenting all of Jack's ex lovers..
Blondes with the fake tits, brunettes, the puffy collagen lips.
Marriage.
The question is, "How do you keep a man like Jack faithful?"
Victoria?
Come on, Victoria, this is our wedding night.
Where the hell are you?
Ow!
What?
What?
Tell me.
All the stories I heard about you...
How every day you'd pick out a different woman.
Take her back to your suite at The Ritz and fuck her brains out.
They are true?
Come on, Victoria, we just got married.
It's true, isn't it?
Victoria.
I bet you didn't even ask them their names.
It had nothing to do with love.
It had nothing to do with you.
Your life growing up Jack, tell me about it.
I want to know every detail.
I liked boxing gyms and the feel of money in my pocket.
I liked coming to this country knowing I could be anything I wanted to be.
I liked reading the real estate ads in the Times,
I liked buying new clothes and having my shoes shined.
I liked being alone, eating alone, and waking up alone.
Until?
Until...
I saw you in Matthew's showroom that day.
You are so full of shit Jack.
I like watching you move.
I like the jewelry you make.
I like your hair, your eyes, the music you listen to, your spirit.
I do, really.
I like your energy, your dreams, your laughter, your rage.
- I like everything about you.
- My rager?
Your rage, yeah.
Right below the surface, ready to explode.
Good, clean, cherry-pink rage.
I don't have any rage.
Everyone has rage.
Just a question of what comes out and what form it takes.
- It's what drives us.
- Really?
Really.
I wish I could protect you from my past... but I can't.
Fuck the past.
Stop!
Stop it!
Stop it!
C'mon!
Jack this is dangerous.
Stop...
Stop it!
What the fuck are you doing?
Stop.
Ow!
Jack!
I hate to think that I was out of control even then, but I was...
I was in love.
... or was it lust?
Had I fallen in love with Jack or... was it just that magnificent dick of his?
I even started to go with him on his dates.
At his hotel suite.
I went to a spa and I got a facial and manicure.
I love European boys and I heard you are Greek.
Hi, Jack.
I came all the way from Valencia, Spain... because I heard that your dick is amazing.
The 100% Greek dick?
And I promised to all my girlfriends that I would take a photo of your dick.
So you gonna let me take a photo of it right?
No.
I've been divorced for about a year now, and I've only been with one man.
One of my friends ways saying what a wonderful lover your are.
I was hoping that you could unlock the passion I know is inside of me.
Would you like to seem make myself squirt, Jack?
- Sure why not?
If you don't let me take a photo of your dick, I'm not gonna fuck you.
But, if you let me, maybe I can fuck you... or maybe I can give a blowjob.
You want me to show you how I do the blowjob?
First I take the balls, and lick them from down, up...
Believe it or not, I actually I paid someone to teach me.
It was the most fun I've ever had in my lfe..
Really.
... and then I take the dick, and I start to suck it.
Until I can feel here.
I love it, and until I can feel the milk all over me... cuz, I love milk.
It can get a little messy.
So I've heard.
I wanted to look good for you.
American boys, they are too controlling.
Sometimes we'd play this game where I'd just show up in the room.
Just to see what the reaction would be.
- Who is she?
- My wife.
- Would you like to meet her?
- Sure.
And most women seemed happy to have me there.
That is how much I sacrifice myself and to fuck you.
So what do you say?
You can take a picture of my dick.
- Who fuck is this?
- My wife.
And then there were the ones that just... freaked out and ran out of the room screaming.
Monica.
Victoria.
Very nice to meet you.
You're very pretty... and tall.
From Slovakia.
So Monica, are you in or out?
I'm in.
You might want to get me a towel.
I brought you your towels Mr. Thorton.
I'm sorry was I interrupting something?
And sometimes I'd dress up as a hotel maid... and come into the room with an armful of fresh towels.
Jack would invited me to stay and play.
Come here, Jack.
Jack, what am I supposed to do?
Anything you want.
And through it all, Jack just kept on smiling
He was happy... and so was I.
Two days later...
Jack left on a business trip.
New Orleans this time.
He asked me to go with him, but I had a big jewelry show to get ready for.
So I stayed home.
Alright guys on three.
Ready?
One two Three.
Hi, I'm Isabel.
We haven't been formally introduced.
Jack asked me to look after you while he was away.
Congratulations on your marriage by the way.
I'm a little jealous that I was't invited to the ceremony, but that's our Jack.
His way or the highway?
I hope you like the dining set I picked out for you.
I like it.
"His Way or the highway."
Thanks for the warning, sister.
Opera gloves and stilettos... in the middle of the day?
Turns out, Isabel had been working for Jack for years.
She was his go-to girl, his assistant... cook, and Chief bottle-washer.
Later, she swore to me that she never fucked him.
Although it was hard for me to believe...
I kinda chose to at the time.
Victoria, this is Rita.
She's going to be helping around the house while Jack's away.
So if there's anything you need or want, don't hesitate to ask.
These are gorgeous.
- Can I try one on?
- Of course.
Turn around and let me see.
It's beautiful.
What do you think?
How about unbutton the rest of your shirt?
Let's see what that looks like.
The bra.
Take off your bra and put it on the floor.
I want to see what this necklace looks like against some skin.
She's a beautiful model.
Perfect for your jewelry.
Don't you think?
You know, I brought my camera with me.
Would you mind if I took a few pictures?
Did Jack put you up to this?
Jack didn't put me up to anything.
He told me to keep you amused.
I assume this is amusing you?
Enormously.
It's beautiful.
Oh yeah... right there.
Victoria, why don't you stand in the frame?
And watch from there.
No, I'm more of a "behind the camera" kinda girl.
I'm not asking you to do anything.
Just watch.
No.
Fine, if you're not going to take any pictures, take a look at these.
That's pretty hot, huh?
Here you try.
Put the camera up to your eye.
Poses for her.
Keep shooting, and I have no idea what's going to happen next.
How unexpected was that... right?
And it didn't turn me off... it... excited me.
Hello?
You've been a bad girl Victoria, haven't you?
This is the first time it's rung since you left?
C'mon Victoria, don't be coy.
Isabel told me about your little photo shoot.
Sounds like a perfect way of selling jewels if you ask me.
And it turned you on didn't it?
Tell me.
- Yes.
- Yes what?
- Yes, it turned me on.
- What did you feel?
Describe it to me, in detail.
- I can't.
- Of course you can.
Tell me exactly how it made you feel.
Wet, as if you were going down on me.
Your tongue on my clit... doing what you do to get me off.
Do I get you off?
Really... get you off?
Or are you just faking it?
Most women fake it.
That's just common knowledge.
Not this woman.
Good to know.
Now I want to wet your fingers... and drop them down between your legs, and make yourself come.
I've got my cock in my hand.
Why doesn't that surprise me.
It shouldn't.
It's the effect you have on me.
It is hard?
Describe it to me.
It's as hard and big as it's ever been.
Just hearing your voice turns it into a monster.
I'm looking at my body in the mirror as I masturbate.
I can see the juice from my pussy running down the inside of my leg.
Good girl.
- If I were there, I would lick it away.
- Of course you would.
With you...
I am always ready to play.
Something that's never happened before you.
I love it.
Fuck.
That's about as hot as it gets.
Everything he did excited me.
No matter what he did... or how he did it... or how uncomfortable... it made me feel, in the end...
I would always end up having a massive orgasm.
And I loved it.
You saw me watching you earlier didn't you?
I'm sorry, I just happened to be there, it was an accident.
Was it really?
Did you find everything satisfactory madame?
My name is Victoria.
Is there anything else you'd like me to get for you, Victoria?
Everything is perfect just the way it is.
- Perfect?
- Yes.
Perfect.
Jack hired Antonio to be your driver.
He'll take you anywhere you'd like to go.
- It's fine, I have my own car.
- Not anymore.
Jack gave me instructions to sell it for you, buy you a new Range Rover.
All you need to do is pick out the color.
It'll be here by the end of the week.
Isabel was put there to pushmy buttons.
I knew that.
And Jack had put her up to it.
No doubt, about it.
Victoria, I'm pleased to see you.
Rita and her friend Adelaide are trying out these new sex toys... for some audition for a sex toy company.
I mean, it's not the movies and I know that, but Adelaide and I really want this job...
I mean, you got to start somewhere, right?
Ask Victoria if she'd like join us.
Victoria, would you like join us?
I do not think she's ever used a sex toy before.
Ask her.
Have you ever masturbated with a toy before?
Would you like to?
I'll pick you a good one.
Here, this one is like the perfect beginer's toy.
Just let me know how it works for you in the morning.
You'd be doing me a huge favor.
If you can sell her a vibrator, you have the job made.
I've masturbated before.
Not as a steady diet but from time to time.
But now... once I started...
It was like I couldn't stop.
- What do you think?
- Nice.
Ever since I was a teenager, every time I saw a car like this... all I wanted to do is get inside where no one could see... slide my panties off... and rub my bare ass all over the nice leather seats.
And you know what?
Every bit as good as I thought it would be.
C'mon Rita try!
Right?
Isn't it amazing?
- C'mon Victoria, it's your turn.
- I think I'll pass.
Why does that not surprise me that Victoria would turn me down?
- What about you Antonio, in or out?
- I'm way ahead of you.
So Victoria, this is your band new car.
You get first dibs on going down on Antonio.
How considerate of you.
I'll take that as a no.
I'll do the honor myself.
Don't tell me.
It's you, and you think I've been a bad girl again?
- Have you been?
- Not this time.
At least, not yet.
Payday.
How did she manage to call you so fast?
I just left her a second ago.
- Who?
- Don't be coy, Jack... doesn't suit you.
Hold on a sec...
Thank you very much.
Just...
Nobody called me, Victoria.
I just wanted to talk to you
Who's in the room with you?
The chambermaid.
I needed some fresh towels.
Of course you did.
I wonder why?
You can talk to her if you want, I don't think she speaks any English.
But you can try, if that will make you feel any better.
Is she pretty?
Very.
I'm having a hard time controlling myself.
You want to talk to her?
I can get her to put her teeth back in.
No really, I've never had a blowjob from a woman with no teeth.
- It could be interesting.
- Could be.
Why do not you go find out?
- I Gotta go.
- No you don't.
Yes I do.
See you when you get home.
Truth be known...
I was beyond excited...
- Hi, Beautiful day huh?
- Yeah.
Beautiful day, beautiful house,
beautiful people.
Not as pretty as you.
You're really really pretty...
"model" pretty.
And you're nice.
I can see why Jack married you.
There's something I need to ask you.
Hope you're not offended by it but I really need to know
Have you ever slept with Jack?
Once.
Maybe twice.
Do not get me wrong, it was fine.
Better than fine.
I do not expect anything else.
I think Jack and I are just too much alike if you know what I mean?
You on the other hand.
Now you're the "marrying" kind.
Which is a good thing...
I guess.
Shit, especially nowadays when everything's disposable.
No doubt about it.
Jack and his team were... forcing me... to find out things about myself, that...
I had no idea were there.
Is this what you want, Jack?
How was your day?
- Interesting.
- Do you like my dress?
It suits you.
Rita's made us the most wonderful dinner.
Chicken.
Just the way you like it.
Thank you.
Don't you feel ridiculous?
I do.
Why?
Look at me.
I think you look marvelous.
Who else has Jack done this with?
That's something you should ask Jack.
How much has he told you about me?
He told us he finally found someone he truly loved.
Doesn't it seem odd to you... that he'd leave me here alone like this?
Nothing Jack does surprises me.
Including marrying me?
Are you asking if I'm jealous?
I'm asking... if you're in love with Jack?
Yes.
I Am.
What about you and Rita?
Are you lovers outside of here?
Yes.
And Antonio?
Yes.
And Jack?
No, wait.
Let me guess.
That's something I should ask him.
Would you like to see a really sexy film Ms.Thorton?
It's wonderful, and old.
A classic.
Aren't they beautiful?
And brave?
We're here for your pleasure, Mrs. Thorton.
Trust.
I can't.
You choose.
Antonio... or me.
I had never experienced such... intense pleasure.
And when it was over... all I wanted was more.
- Will you wait for me, Antonio?
- Of course.
Anonymous sex.
Elegant.
Without guilt... without shame.
Without a seconds hesitation.
Pleasure or pain?
Pain.
Are you sure?
Yes.
She's all yours, mistress.
When the cat's away, the mouse will play.
Pleasure or pain, Mrs. Thorton?
It's your choice.
- Pleasure.
- I can't hear you, Mrs. Thorton.
Pleasure.
Very good.
What brought you here to our little circle tonight?
My husband.
Your husband?
Tell us about him.
He controls me... manipulates me... from afar.
Never knowing what he's going to do next.
The unspoken,
The unspoken?
What's hidden... deep... inside of us... that we never knew was there.
Until someone brings it out.
Tell us why you came here tonight?
We want to know.
We have to know.
I'm so scared.
Of what?
Letting myself go.
There's a man standing behind you, Mrs. Thorton.
What do you want him to do?
Pleasure or pain?
Pleasure.
Who are you?
Does it really matter?
No.
You are so beautiful, Mrs. Thorton.
Does seeing me making love to Antonio make you jealous?
Very.
I know this might sounds strange, sick even... but seeing you with him reminded me of how much I love you.
He said that, as I neared orgasm...
I suddenly became another person.
I wish I was.
An insatiable, sex crazed, orgasm, obsessed, creature.
That night changed me.
But the changed him too.
It got to the point where...
Jack no longer wanted to make love to me.
And it made me crazy.
I became obsessed with... trying to think of things to please him... to turn him on.
As much as we tried... there was nothing I could do.
It was humiliating.
But, I didn't care.
I just wanted him back.
I'd do anything... to get him back.
And every time I did what he wanted...
He just pushed me further away.
You look good in red, Victoria.
Have I ever told you... how I came the first time you touched me?
The question is, why don't you want me anymore?
Have you used me up...
Completely?
Do you want me to move out?
If you do, I will.
Just tell me what you want.
And I'll do it.
Have you met someone else?
Is that it?
Someone pretty... and innocent?
Like I was?
Does it hurt you... to see me desperate like this...
Jack?
Because I... am certainly... in pain.
Victoria.
Eve.
Hello, Victoria.
I've heard so many wonderful things about you.
Eve's from Oklahoma.
She's here in L.A. hoping to become a porn star.
I'm meeting with the people from Vivid next week.
I'm really excited.
You should keep your fingers crossed for me.
Isabel has kindly agreed... to shoot some footage of Eve doing here thing.
Like a screen test.
I'll be the director... and you... will be the movie star.
Eve, if it's okay with Victoria...
I want you to seduce her... in the most provocative wayyou can think of.
Are you okay with that, Victoria?
How long have you two been seeing each other?
About a month, come Saturday night.
Does that offend you?
No.
It might have before I met Jack... but now... not at all.
So it's okay?
Whatever Jack wants,
Jack gets.
I bought into it.
Why shouldn't you?
That, made him feel alive.
Is there anything else that I can get you, Mr. Thornton?
No, Rita.
Thank you very much.
You can go home if you like.
Did you ever love me, Jack?
Truly love me?
I still do.
It's simple really...
If I don't force you to leave, you will come to your senses soon enough and abandon me.
Some day, soon... it will become too much for you.
It's you that's doing this to us.
Not me.
Don't be naive, Victoria.
You're too smart for that.
Look at you.
This is not who you really are.
This whole sex thing is a passing thing for you.
A phase.
A little excitement and then it's done.
For me, it's who I am.
I'm way too far gone.
But you're not.
Not yet.
So what I'm doing is really for your own good.
Go away some place.
Get over this, and go on with your life.
Without me.
You deserve better.
But I want you.
It's over, Victoria.
Leave before I destroy you.
Bullshit.
This is absolute, fucking bullshit!
Stop it.
Fuck off, Jack.
What are you gonna do?
We were on our way home, just Jack and me.
And my new best friend, Eve.
I'm horny as hell.
Every since I started doing porn, I can masturbate at least five times a day... or I get real grumpy.
You should start thinking about doing porn, Victoria.
Sex all day, and you're getting paid?
It's a fucking dream come true.
I need some dick.
Fuck me harder, harder motherfucker!
Eve died.
I injured my leg... badly.
And Jack... poor Jack.
He was in ICU for over a week.
They tried everything.
But there was nothing anyone could do.
In the end, we lost him.
I lost him.
It was too much.
I couldnt...
I just couldn't.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I'm sure that at some point in your lives... all of you women out there... dream of finding the perfect lover.
For great sex.
Constant sex.
Exciting, fabulous, hot sex.
Of giving everything... until there's nothing left.
Like anything else... in excess, it can get a hold of you... and take you over... completely.
Kamikaze love.
Dangerous love.
Drivin to the edge, over and over.
Willing to die for love.
By telling you this... maybe, just maybe, I can... begin to put my life back together again.
- That gives me hope.
- It should.
So, it's adios for now.
Until next time.
If there is a next time.
Above all...
Be brave.

You're taking a risk, aren't you?
I felt like chilling out.
Anyone could have walked in here.
My parents have gone to work.
People don't usually drop in.
We did.
You forget?
I could always make myself disappear if I had to.
It's much easier to think underwater.
Sure is.
I mean, it must be so peaceful down there.
I can see things very clearly, that's why I am going back to Mako.
I've got to find out how I got this way.
But what if something else happens to you?
It's not a place to be on your own.
You're welcome to come with me.
Uh, yeah, we're going to have to think about that one.
Sure, I understand.
I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I'm going back to Mako today.
If he's going, we have to go with him.
Sure, that's a great idea, Lyla, just lead him right back to the moon pool.
Nixie's right, Lyla.
He's going anyway.
It's better we're with him than not.
Let's work with him.
If we don't find out how he got his powers, how are we going to figure out how to get rid of them?
OK, well that's... ..not only dangerous, but a total waste of time.
The land entrance only opens up at the full moon.
Yeah, so we just need to find another source of moonlight.
And where would we get that?
You mean, use my moon ring?
No way.
Why not?
Are you out of your mind, Lyla?
You have no idea what might happen.
Just forget it.
Come on!
I'm not doing it!
So we just wait until the next full moon to find out what happened to his powers?
Where is this going to end?
Lyla, it's not happening.
Just forget it.
That's final.
Do I detect a little tension in the air?
You all need to be submerged for a while.
It's only because there are things we don't understand yet.
Mermaid things.
Well, that's to be expected.
You don't have your moon rings yet.
You completed your mermaid studies.
You were initiated into the pod.
Top of my class.
So you know how Mako works - how the full moon affects it,
including the entrance to the land tunnel?
I didn't even know there was one.
So, whatever it is, it's not something you should be meddling with either.
Come on, what are you waiting for?
What's taking her so long?
She's sulking, of course.
I'm not waiting around for that.
It's OK.
Shhh.
Get off, Poseidon.
I need to look in there.
Shoo!
Top of her class.
I knew she'd have one.
I'm only borrowing it.
Oh, what is it, Poseidon?
Shh.
Puss, puss.
Zac, are you still here?
I'm just about to leave.
I'm coming with you.
But I thought Nixie said...
I make up my own mind.
Cool.
We can go in Cam's tinny.
We can't, we'll get hit by the spray.
So?
I've got a tail.
It's not like I have to hide it from you anymore.
No, but it'd be way faster if you swam, right?
What's the hurry?
Now that you're coming it's only right that we go together.
It's fine, I can handle a boat by myself, you know?
You have to swim.
Why?
Well, because, um... ..if we figure out what happened to you, then it's the last time you'll have a tail.
Maybe.
Good.
I'll take the boat.
Meet you there in an hour.
Looks pretty spooky, even in daylight.
Why do you camp here, then?
Well, I never thought that before the weird stuff that changed me.
That only happens when there's a full moon.
I hope.
Yeah.
So, it's cool.
We stick together and look after each other, OK?
I can't remember which way I walked from here.
Hey, Zac, we should go this way.
How do you know?
It just looks like someone's been through there.
Really?
I guess.
It's worth a try, right?
Hey, I think this is the spot.
So, where's the cave that you went into?
I don't know.
Maybe it wasn't here.
No, trust your first instincts.
They're usually right.
This is the place.
That's where it happened.
But I don't understand.
There should be an entrance here.
How long have we been waiting for Lyla, now?
Four tops, three skirts, and a jacket's worth.
Face it, she's not coming.
She's so stubborn.
As soon as she gets an idea in her head, that's it, nothing stops her.
You don't actually think she'd try it, do you, to open the land entrance another way?
How?
You're the only one who has a moon ring.
This is Lyla.
Like you said... ..nothing stops her.
Well, we're not getting through that in a hurry.
Why don't you try your powers on it?
Nothing's happening.
Keep trying.
Keep going!
Did... did I do that?
How else could it have happened?
What do we do now?
We enter.
No!
This isn't good.
Well, what if I use my powers again?
Yeah.
It's not working.
We're trapped.
Have you seen Lyla?
She left about an hour ago.
Did she say where she was going, or what she was doing?
She wanted information about Mako.
I told you.
I knew it.
What is this all about?
Lyla wanted to borrow my moon ring... ..and I said no.
My moon ring's gone.
It's OK, we're gonna get it back.
Don't worry.
How did she know you even had one?
She was asking about the land entrance to the moon pool on Mako.
Is that what it's for?
She thought she'd use a moon ring to try and open it.
She's gone there with Zac.
I warned her not to meddle with things she doesn't understand.
She mustn't use that moon ring on Mako.
We have to stop her!
Yeah, well, if we suddenly turn up on Mako, what's Zac gonna think?
How did you get here?
Of course you can borrow my boat, where are you going?
Mako Island.
Oh, cool!
I finish my shift in half an hour.
I'll take you.
You?
Yeah, there's a couple of tricks to starting the outboard motor.
Well, we'll figure it out.
It's no problem, I haven't been there in ages.
We really need to go right now.
Oh, maybe I can get off early.
I'll ask Kylie to cover for me.
No!
You're... you're too responsible for that.
You can't let your customers down.
We'll get the motor started, we'll be fine.
You can come next time.
OK, if you say so.
Here.
Thanks.
We'll be back in a couple of hours.
No.
That's not going to budge.
Sorry.
I guess I got us into a pretty tight spot.
No, it's... it's my fault.
How do you figure that?
I encouraged you, and I chose to come.
Why did you?
You couldn't come by yourself.
What if something happened to you?
You worry about me that much?
There's got to be another way out of here.
Come on.
We're not really getting in this thing, are we?
No way!
We'd both be on the bottom flapping around with tails.
Great, so this is a waste of time?
Sirena, this isn't going to work as a cover story for how we got to Mako.
I've got a plan, alright?
There's no way out.
What is that?
I've seen it before... ..but it was glowing like this bright light was behind it.
When I touched it, the floor must have opened up and I fell.
Just vanished?
What are you doing?
Don't worry.
I've got you, in case it happens again.
Here goes nothing.
You're affecting it.
It's glowing because of you.
I remember it did that when I touched it.
What is it?
I don't know.
Do you remember this?
No.
It's almost like it's alive.
No!
You'll get a tail... ..maybe even something worse.
What if we get sucked into the depths for good?
This is what I came for.
I have to find out what happened to me, Lyla.
Zac!
Come on.
Open up.
Are you sure this is the way Lyla described?
Yes.
No.
I don't know.
Wait, didn't Zac and Cam camp the night that he fell into the moon pool?
Yeah?
Well, this is a campfire.
That could be anyone's.
But... ..Lyla mentioned a rock wall.
And this is the way to the volcano.
Zac.
Zac!
Come back.
This has got to be it.
Well, if this is the land entrance, it can only be opened by full moonlight.
And a moon ring if she's right.
Yeah, well why is it not open now?
I don't know.
But we have to find her.
I don't see anything.
But I hear something.
Zac!
Come back!
Zac!
Come back!
Zac!
Zac!
Can you hear me?
Zac!
Hurry!
We don't have much time!
Zac?
Zac!
I saw something in there, in that sea pool!
We have to get out of here, now!
What are you guys doing here?
We were looking for you.
What was that?
It's the tunnel I told you about.
It's gone!
It's the one I went into the night everything happened to me.
I opened it before.
Why can't I do it now?
Who knows?
Let's just go.
But I want to know what that thing I saw was.
Whatever it was, we can't go back in now.
That was way too close.
But I want to know what it all means.
It means this is a dangerous place and we're lucky.
I'll swim back.
I'll meet you there.
Nice ring.
There was water all around me, high above and deep below.
I can't explain it.
This object was floating in the distance.
I should've kept going.
I should've taken it.
Maybe you weren't meant to.
Why do you say that?
Just a thought.
I'm going to go back, and I'm going to get it this time.
No!
But I have to do it!
Just don't go back there without me.
It's too dangerous.
Promise?
OK, I promise.
Hey, we make a pretty good team.
Can I get you something to drink?
No, I should be going.
You sure?
I could talk about this for hours.
I've got some things I need to do.
Bye.
Got something of mine?
Sorry.
If you ever steal from me again, you won't be welcome here.
I promise I won't.
You were banished for a reason.
There are forces out there no-one understands, me included.
It's bad enough that the boy and the island are connected.
You're just putting yourselves and him in danger.
Thanks, guys.
If you hadn't shown up, we'd still be stuck in there.
For some reason, the moon ring didn't work inside the tunnel.
Well, maybe it only works in a place that can receive full moonlight.
Lyla, we warned you against using it.
That doesn't usually stop me.
Guess I should've known that by now.
But what does all this mean?
Some strange object in a massive pool?
I don't know.
But one thing's for sure, it's pulling at Zac, and it's gonna keep doing that with or without our help.
He's gonna keep getting drawn back to Mako... ..and we can't stop it.

(INSECTS CHIRRING)
- You're staying at your dad's?
- Yeah.
You know, I'm trying to give it some life.
I went to his funeral.
I know.
Thank you.
That was...
important to me.
Thank you.
Are you back at the mill?
Just can't get enough of it, you know?
I hear they're gonna close it.
Yeah, looks like it.
You know, cheaper to... uh, get steel from China.
God, I've missed you so much.
I've missed you so much.
I was hoping that, uh... we could work it out.
You know?
The things that were keeping us apart and... you know, take that next step is something
I want to do with you.
Because, uh...
I can't be without you, Lena.
I can't.
I'm pregnant.
OK.
Wow.
Wow.
You, uh... (SNIFFLES)
That's, uh...
That's wonderful news.
It is?
Yeah.
That's wonderful news.
I'm real happy for you, Lena.
I really am.
That's wonderful news.
You're gonna be a hell of a mom.
(VOICE BREAKING) Wow!
You're gonna be a hell of a mom!
(BOTH CRYING)
I'm so sorry.
- I have to go.
- Yeah.
OK.
(HORN BEEPS TWICE)
Hey, man!
What about it?
Goddamn, Uncle Red.
- Look like they fed you pretty good.
- Yeah.
You're fit as a racehorse.
How you doing?
Still this side of the grass, you know.
Hey, I got something for your daddy.
I had a feeling that was you.
- You're still raising them?
- Isn't that pretty?
Yeah.
Yeah, when the weather permits.
Say, do you want to come over to the cemetery with me?
Shit, yeah.
Rodney here?
Does he want to come?
Ah, I don't know where he is.
Let me get this shit inside... run over with you.
- Hey, grab your rifle.
Maybe we can get a shot off before dark.
I saw a real nice eight-point out there the other night.
RUSSELL:
Yup.
See if I'm still a better shot than you.
(RED CHUCKLES)
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
Well... let's go get us a buck, huh?
We can circle around these.
Seen a feral cat.
DeGroat?
I didn't drive five and a half hours to watch you play fucking cards.
Well, when you owe as much as you owe me, Petty...
I guess I'm the last person you want to see.
Step into the room, fighter man.
Let me get a good look at you.
- And what's your name?
- Rodney.
Is that it?
Just Rodney?
Rodney Baze.
Rodney Baze.
(HARLAN EXHALING)
Well...
Rodney Baze...
I hear you're quite the crazy fucker in the ring.
Makes me want to jump in there with you... and see who walks out.
We're standing so close, I guess we could do it right now.
(CHUCKLES)
You gonna be a good boy and take a dive, like Petty said you would?
Or am I gonna have to teach you a lesson?
No, he's good.
He's good.
- Teach me a lesson?
- I gave you our word.
Yeah, teach you a lesson.
JOHN:
Everything's good.
Let me hear you say it.
Teach me a lesson?
Yeah, isn't that what we talked about?
- Is this boy deaf?
- No, no, it's...
- You been hit too many times?
- (QUIET LAUGH)
Listen, we talked, everything's good.
(LAUGHS)
Hey, yeah.
I like this one.
He's tough.
- And angry.
- JOHN:
Plenty tough.
Four-tours-in-Iraq tough.
Now, why the hell you want to come up here and fight, or, hell, anywhere, when you've been fighting over there for so long?
I just need the money, man.
Mmm...
Yeah.
Well... we all need money... don't we, Petty?
So... why don't me and John discuss this deal while you go put your fight face on.
Didn't we just discuss the deal?
What, you think I was asking?
Hey!
Don't!
Keep your fucking hands off him.
Just checking his reflexes.
You step out.
Step out and we'll...
I'll take care of this.
Step out, Rodney.
(LAUGHING)
I should've popped that motherfucker.
Well, that would be the last motherfucker you ever popped.
Am I supposed to be scared of him 'cause he sucks on a lollipop?
(EXHALES) Look at me.
You gotta make this look good.
You can't embarrass DeGroat in front of these guys that he's got coming up.
Well...
I can't promise to go down for that motherfucker.
Did you hear me?
Did you hear me?
!
- Yeah.
I heard you.
- Good.
Now get your shit and let's get going.
Come on, get ready.
Showtime.
You ain't fighting with that shit on, are you?
It's bare-knuckle up here.
JOHN:
Take 'em off.
Be careful out there.
Keep it going for a little while and then you know what to do.
(GRUNTS)
RUSSELL:
Look at that beauty.
Clean shot?
Yeah, right in the heart.
Inch either way, we'd be tracking the son of a bitch all night, like the last time, you remember?

- You see anything?
Not a goddamn thing.

- Bud, you OK?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Impressive stuff.
All heart and fist.
That boy don't look so good.
(SNIFFLING, COUGHS)
Hey, hey, uh, don't...
Don't blow your nose, your eyes will... swell up.
Hell, mercy, you took a whooping.
You looked angry out there.
I thought maybe... for a second you weren't a good listener.
I was just reacting.
I just lost it a little bit.
Oh, yeah, well, hell, I don't blame you.
I'd done the same thing, guy pounded on me like that.
- Yeah.
- So our slate is clean.
Mmm...
Well, yes, as long as you brought me the rest of my money.
Don't tell me you come all this way and didn't bring me what you owe.
This was it.
Now we're even.
That was the deal.
Oh.
I must've got confused.
(LAUGHS) Whatever.
You need this?
Here.
Wipe your face.
Last time I'm coming up here, I can tell you that.
Sorry as hell you had to go through that, Rodney.
(WEAKLY) It's not your fault.
I asked you to take me up here.
It's both of our faults.
But we're through with those Ramapo fuckers.
That crazy son of a bitch can kiss my ass if he thinks I'm doing business with him again.
Strung out fucking tweaker.
Oh, what the fuck?
What the fuck is this?
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
What's the game?
(INSECTS CHIRRING)
Yeah?
I think your left rear's gone down.
What?
I said...
I think your left rear's gone down.
What shit you talking?
(LAUGHS) I ain't talking shit.
And our slate ain't clean, motherfucker.

Let's go.
Go get him.

RODNEY: "Russ...
I'm sorry about the other day.
I know you're looking out for me.
But you gotta understand that I'm different than I was before I left.
And I think that I always will be.
I can't explain how exactly.
My head is just full of stuff and I can't get it out."
(SIGHS)
Oh, man.
(PANTING)
You should have kept better company.
Don't look at me.
(PANTING)
Look away.
Fuck you.
Oh, fuck you.
You fucking coward.
I don't care.
I don't care.
(GUN FIRES)
Get some shovels.
RODNEY: "But I'm gonna turn things around.
I'm gonna do this one last fight and then I'll be done.
Then I'm gonna shovel asphalt or dig for coal or I'll work with you and Roach at the mill.
I'll do anything.
I'm gonna get things back on track.
I promise.
I love you, man.
I'll see you tomorrow when I get back."
(PAPER RUSTLING)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Morning, Russell.
Glad you're home.
Thanks.
(CLEARS THROAT)
I guess you, uh... heard that, uh...
I stopped by to see Lena.
Yeah, I'm aware.
Not why I'm here.
HARLAN:
I said...
I think your left rear's gone down.
JOHN:
What shit you talking?
HARLAN:
I ain't talking shit.
And our slate ain't clean, motherfucker.
(GUNSHOT)
- Turn it off.
- HARLAN:
Get that other one out.
We don't need to hear it again.
I've spoken to Jersey State, Bergen County, Fish and Game.
All of them have dealt with this Harlan DeGroat before.
The problem is that the people up in those hills, they don't cooperate.
Getting information from these people is like pulling teeth.
It's a whole 'nother world up in there.
Generations upon generations of these people never even come down off that mountain.
Got their own breed of justice and it does not include us.
Even the local police sent in several squad cars, but they haven't been able to get nothing yet.
So you know that I'm stuck here with my hands tied.
What the fuck does that mean?
That they aren't gonna... do anything about this or look for Rodney?
I did not say that, Russell.
I said that they're having a difficult time and I'm having jurisdiction issues.
But I'm gonna be on it until it's done.
What the fuck?
- Bud.
- I mean, you know...
We know John Petty's dead.
I mean, Jesus, you know, damn near hear him dying on Dan's phone.
But Rodney might still be out there.
I know that this is very hard for you, but...
I do have a procedure that I have to follow.
It sounds like there's no procedure at all.
- Bud!
- No, no, no, no, no.
It sounds like they're not doing a goddamn thing.
Now, either you're all afraid to go in there... or, uh... you just don't give a shit.
- You walking down the wrong road.
I said I'm into it, and I said I'll handle it.
Don't make this personal.
- You need to stay out of my business.
- Stay out of your business.
- Knock it off.
- Stay out of your business.
You know what?
While I was away, it seems that all that you was into was my business.
So that's what this is.
You got a problem with me.
Yeah, I got a problem with you.
WESLEY:
I'm not the one who was out drinking and driving.
Got locked up and had to leave his woman alone 'cause of something I did, a mistake I made.
And I don't know nothing about what happened to Rodney.
Nothing at all.
I'm just trying to do my job.
And I'm giving you my word that I'm gonna be on it until it's done.
Until it's done.
Mmm.
Well.
Russell.
Come on.
What is it?
You want me to show you out?
I'll be around.
Dan.
- RED:
Where you going now?
- No, it's good.
- Hey, Russ, listen, I'm sorry.
- Hey.
I know how tough this is, but I'm here to help anyway I can.
Then get me an address for DeGroat.
An address?
How am I gonna get that address?
Don't give me that shit, Dan.
You know as well as I do that John Petty has one.
Well, I don't...
I don't know.
Look, I'll see if I can dig that up.
No, no, no, don't see if you can dig it up.
- Do it.
- Russell, listen to me.
If you're smart, you let these boys handle it.
I know these guys.
This DeGroat is a nasty son of a bitch.
You let me worry about... who's a nasty son of a bitch.
We'll follow you.
(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING IN DISTANCE)
Damn, looks like John still owes money to these people.
A hell of a lot of money.
I know they had this whole deal, but I didn't realize it was this big.
- What deal?
- Well, this bare-knuckle deal up and down the Appalachians.
I don't know that much about it, but my guess is,
Rodney went up there to fight.
Well, why didn't you just say something to Wesley?
Well, I don't...
I don't know.
I mean, I didn't...
I didn't know what to say.
John should've known better.
I think he did, Red, but Rodney forced his hand.
He thought it was the only way to pay off that debt.
I don't see DeGroat's address, but I do know it's up in the Ramapos.
And, Russell, please hear me when I tell you, you'd be way better off letting the authorities deal with him.
They're not doing such a good job, Dan.
Well, I hear you, but John hated dealing with them.
I'm surprised they haven't come down here to get their money.
Money and drugs, that's the only thing that drove that crazy son of a bitch.
Are you ready for this?
I guess so.
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
You watch your ass.
Gotta say, fellas, that is sharp.
'66 or '67?
Man, you don't see that Bolero red much.
You got the tuxedo black and ash gold everywhere, but...
Yeah, this is sweet.
Three-ninety-six big block?
Yep.
That's a true 138 SS right there, man.
Fucking rocket ship.
Well, I don't doubt it with that Muncie four speed.
Hmm!
How long to restore it?
A couple years.
RUSSELL:
A couple years?
Worth it.
You got nitrous?
Nah, nah, just a heavy foot.
Yeah.
(CHUCKLES)
You know who's got any candy here?
- What do you mean, "candy?"
- You know what I mean.
Yeah.
You a fucking cop?
(LAUGHS)
Am I a fucking cop?
Do I look like a fucking cop?
Who's the old man in the truck?
Don't worry about him.
He ain't a cop, either.
- What you looking for, man?
- Whatever you got.
You know...
Crank, 20/20's, blue bellies, crystals or pure.
- It don't matter.
- Wow, he knows his shit.
Yeah, we got some buzzard dust, some critty up at the house.
All right.
We'll get you feelin' shitty, my friend.
Good.
All right, I'll follow you?
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)
Yo, it's Tiny.
- You wait right here, all right?
- All right.
All right.
Brought them boys out here looking for some of the train.
MAN:
Yo, if they got their greenbacks, that's fine.
Come on up.
(DOG BARKING)
Who the fuck are you?
RUSSELL:
I'm just passing through.
I ain't asked you where you were going.
I asked you who you were.
Well, I didn't ask who you were.
We just want to get high, and our money's green.
Well, then you come to the right place.
But I got to say, you got some balls coming up in here, not knowing nobody.
But if your money's green... then it's all good.
That's pure glass.
Fire it up.
Looks good to me.
How much?
Nah, fire that shit up.
It'll blow your balls off, brother.
I told you, I'm good.
How much?
(THROATY GRUNT)
(SNIFFLES)
(GROANS)
RUSSELL:
You don't know, um...
Harlan DeGroat, do you?
Is that a joke?
Why would I joke about that?
'Cause this is his house.
He around?
I wouldn't know.
I ain't his babysitter.
All right.
(WHISPERS) Hey, Red.
Not now.
We'll come by later.
Yo!
You forgot this.
RED:
Oh, Shit.
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)
Put your hands where I can see 'em, gentlemen.
Russell Baze?
That's right.
Chief Barnes from the North Braddock Police alerted us early this evening that you were up here.
You're lucky I got here when I did.
If the locals knew why you were here, they'd zip you up and you'd be leaving in a body bag.
Do I need to ask if you're carrying concealed weapons?
No, sir.
- No, sir.
- All right.
Then, given that you're an ex-con, likely carrying concealed weapons, you have a choice.
Either I arrest you now or I follow you to the state line.
With respect, officer, my brother might be up here, and I ain't leaving without him.
I'll only do Chief Barnes a favor once.
You return and I'll arrest you on the spot.
There's nothing you can do from inside a jail cell.
Am I making myself clear, gentlemen?
Yes, sir, you are.
All right.
Then I'll follow you out.
That boy was always troubled.
Ever since he was a little kid.
You could see it in his eyes.
Especially after your mama died.
(BOYS SHOUTING IN DISTANCE)
(DOORS SHUTTING, ENGINES STARTING)

I just heard from the Jersey police.
They found your brother.
He's dead.
OK.
A hunter's dog dug him up.
(VOICE FADING SLOWLY) Sorry.
They just called me.
The coroner's gonna examine his body.
(FAINT) I suspect that you'll have him back by the weekend.

- Let me go talk to him.

I appreciate you coming over.
- I wanted to.
- Mmm.
We wanted to.
I'm sorry about Rodney.
I'm really sorry.
He was put through a lot, you know?
And so have you.
But please don't do anything.
OK?
You already tried.
You're lucky you got out of there alive.
Let Wesley handle this.
Let him do his job.
He's a good man, Russell.
- You want me to take it?
- No, I got it.
OK.

Uh, no...

What are you doing?
Open your fucking mouth.
- You're making me uncomfortable.
- Open it!
Open your fucking mouth.
Get that fucking thing in there.
Take it.
All of it.
That's it.
Fucking whore.
Everybody all right over here?
Hey, mind your business, pal.
Yeah, when you slap a woman around, it is my business, pal.
Stay out of my shit, motherfucker.
That's Mr. Motherfucker to you.
- Harlan, come on.
No, don't.
- Yeah, come on.
Harlan?
Harlan...
I don't want no trouble.
- Harlan!
- Yeah, you already started...
Harlan, stop!
Come on, don't!
Stop!
Harlan!
Stop it!
Stop!
Stop it!
Stop it!
The fuck out of there!
Fucking whore!
Yeah, you want a problem?
Get back in your fucking car!
Somebody call 911!
I see the world
Feel the chill
Which way to go
Hey, bring it in!
Windowsill
I see the words
On a rocking horse of time
I see the birds
In the rain
Oh, dear dad
Can you see me now?
I am myself
Like you somehow
I'll ride the wave...
Come on, six.
Come on, six.
Come on, six.
Oh, he's pulling up on the fucking reins.
Why is he pulling up on the fucking reins?
!
God fucking...
Are you kidding me?
Hey, man, is this...
That was race eight right there on TV two?
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
- You looking at it?
- Isn't that what I said?
Are you fucking kidding me?
Man, what are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
- Huh?
What are you doing here?
You playing the ponies now?
Well, I don't know.
Just trying to make a little dough.
Son of a bitch.
What, man?
Gonna give me some shit?
I ain't giving you shit.
I'm just wondering where you're getting the money to bet with.
- Borrowed it.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Who from?
- Who from?
- John Petty.
Motherfucker gave me a tip, it didn't pay off.
Well, of course he did.
How much he loan you?
I don't even know.
You don't even know?
You know.
How much?
How much?
Fifteen hundred.
Fuck me, Rodney.
Where you gonna get that money to pay him back with, huh?
And what else you gonna owe him?
You got a check coming in from somewhere or...?
- No.
- You know, 'cause I ain't got that kind of cash lying around to bail you out.
Well, I didn't ask for you to bail me out.
No.
Don't fuck around with John Petty.
I'm not fucking around with him.
He gave me a fucking tip, it didn't pay off.
Come on, man.
Don't give me this shit.
Hey, uh, tell Dad that, huh...
I'll be by before work tomorrow.
All right.
And, you know, just...
Don't go.
If I could stay, I would.
Then stay.
Leaving you ain't easy, girl.
Or I'll stay.
I'll stay until you get back.
What time do you get off?
Working a double.
- Seriously?
- Yeah.
Russell, you work too much.
Got to bring home the bacon to fatten you up.
You, you little Skinny Minnie.
My Skinny Minnie.
Skinny Minnie.
No, I want you to fatten me up with a baby.
Want to run away somewhere?
Don't change the subject.
I want to run away somewhere.
Let's do it.
- Where?
- I don't know.
I've never been east of Scranton, but...
- I'm gonna fatten you up.
- Stop.
Uncle Red.
Hey, buddy, how are you?
Saw your truck.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, how you doing?
- Okay.
- I'm here.
That's why I'm okay.
You're hot.
Your hand's so cold.
- That feel good?
- Yeah.
His fever?
Yeah, it's still high.
Hey, you want to get a drink later?
Yeah.
Where?
John Petty's?
- How's Lena?
- Oh, she's good.
Keeping me in check.
- Big job.
- Yeah.
You know?
Well, give her a hug for me.
You bet, dirty old bastard.
All right, Pops, I got to go to work.
All right.
I'll see you later.
- You'll come back, huh?
- Oh, yeah.
I always come back.
- I love you.
- Me, too.
- Keep your hands warm.
- Okay.
Hey, thanks for coming by.
See you, Russ.
I have come here tonight to stand with you, to change America, to restore its future, to rise to our best ideals and to elect Barack Obama president of the United States.
I'm afraid we're about to lose another Kennedy.
God bless him.
You want another?
No, I'm good.
No, Rodney was supposed to meet me here half hour ago.
Oh, yeah, how is old Rodney?
He seems awfully quiet last few times he was here.
Yeah, he stop-lossed again.
He's going back next month.
Those poor sons of guns.
They're holding them against their will.
They're gonna run them into the ground, they're not careful.
Don't get me started.
Well, if he turns up, you tell him I headed home to see Lena?
- Sure.
- All right.
Oh, hey, I got this one.
Whoa, thanks, Dan.
Is, uh...
Is John in?
I just, you know, need to bend his ear.
Uh, he had someone back there earlier, but, uh, I think they might be gone.
- All right if I...
- Yeah.
If I have to come all the way down here again, I swear to God,
I'll gut your fucking ass, cunt.
You hear me, Petty?
You better start following through on your promises.
Oh, you know I can't control some of those fuckers.
For 25 grand, you'd better control them.
I ought to put a piece of lead in your ass
- and take everything in here.
- John, you back here?
Oh, I'm sorry, should I come back later or...?
No, it's okay.
We're finishing up.
Your mama teach you to barge in like that?
You got a problem with me?
I got a problem with everybody.
Who the fuck are they?
Inbred mountain folk from Jersey.
Church ain't over until the snakes are back in the bag, know what I mean?
What are they doing down here?
Don't ask.
- Here.
- Oh, no, I'm good.
Take it.
What's up?
Oh, here.
It's from Rodney.
I know it's not nearly all there.
I hate that you work your ass off to pay his debt.
Rodney needs to watch it.
I like him, Russell, I really do, but I worry that...
Hell, he might be safer over in Iraq.
Well, do you mind not telling him I brought you that, please, and if he don't bring the rest of it,
I will on my next payday.
Okay.
I won't say a thing.
All right, thanks.
Cubs lead Pirates ten to one in the bottom of the sixth.
Chavez off of first base.
Lilly's still looking strong on the mound, and Lilly delivers.
Swinging, there's a drive, deep...
Hey.
Hey, there.
Can you...
Can you...
Can you hear me?
Hey, there, little fella.
Hey, there. little fella.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Hey.
Help.
Can you come help?
Come...
You know, I just keep my head down.
Studying shit I should've studied in high school, you know?
- Could be worse.
- How could it be worse?
I don't know.
I could be going to Iraq with you.
No shit.
I asked Lena to come down here.
She said some bullshit about not wanting to see you like this.
- You shouldn't have.
- Oh, fuck that.
She don't like this place.
What are you going to do?
She doesn't like this place?
What, is there someone who likes this place?
Come on, just give her a break.
And what about you?
You still seeing the, uh... uh, woof-woof?
Woof-woof!
Down.
Oh, man, I almost forgot about her.
Thanks a lot.
How's, uh...
How's Dad doing?
- Uh, barely hanging on, really.
- Yeah.
Make sure you give him a big hug from me.
You know?
Yeah, but...
You, uh, watch yourself over there.
Okay.
- You, too.
- Yeah.
- Guess I know where to write to you.
- Yeah.
What's up, homey?
You fucking quiet.
You walk the yard, you don't talk to nobody.
Are you a fucking faggot?
Huh, bro?
- Get the fuck away from me.
- You want to suck my dick?
Come here.
Fuck you!
Get him off me, you motherfucker!
Hey!
Break it up!
Get off me, holmes!
Get upstairs!
- Get off me, cabron!
- Shut up!
He was trying to hang on until you got out.
He wanted to see you.
It just ate him up.
You put him next to Mom?
Yeah.
I'm glad you were home.
How was your last tour?
It was hard.
Yeah?
I mean, this...
You know, the whole thing...
Rodney, whatever you did... whatever you did, you had to do.
Yeah.
I got to go.
I love you, bud.
I love you, too, man.
And surely, he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows.
Yet we will esteem him as stricken.
Smitten of God and afflicted.
But he was wounded for our transgressions.
He was bruised for our iniquities.
The chastisement of our peace was upon him.
And with his stripes, we are healed.
Come here!
Man!
How's it feel?
Look, I'm running, I'm gonna run.
- I'm running.
- Get away!
Go!
- You driving?
- You want to drive?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah?
Come on, motherfucker.
Say good-bye.
Hey, Jerry!
He didn't know who the fuck you were.
Well, it is what it is.
I think you're better off.
Why would you say that?
Come on, man, she left you without even telling you.
Now she's with fucking Wesley?
She's a smart woman.
Got her reasons.
You been hanging with, uh...
Billy and them lately?
- Nope.
- No?
What you been doing with yourself?
- Looking for a job.
- Any luck?
- Nope.
- No?
On a liquid dinner?
It's the dinner of champions.
Yeah.
I'll be back.
Oh, Wesley, my lunch.
Bye.
Yeah!
Get your ass up, white boy!
Let's go!
Get your ass up, man!
Come on!
You ain't shit!
Look at you!
Look at you!
Come on, motherfucker!
Come on, man, let's go!
This ain't fucking Iraq.
Let's go, soldier boy.
Get up!
Stop!
Break it up!
Smile, motherfucker!
That's bullshit!
Goddamn it, Rodney.
Did you not hear me?
Did you not hear me?
Motherfucker, I took a hit in there.
I told you I can't really control myself in the middle of a fight, man.
It's all a blur.
And don't fucking poke on me again, either.
No more excuses.
No more Iraqi stories.
You just got to learn how to take a fall because you owe me a lot of fucking money.
Well, I can't pay you back your money by taking a dive in this nickel and dime bullshit.
You'd better figure out something and figure it out quick.
Yeah, let's go fight up in Jersey.
Up in the Ramapos they got fights.
Don't talk to me about that.
It's not for you.
Why?
I heard they're big money.
Look, Rodney, go work in the mill.
Like your father and brother.
This isn't a way for you to make a living.
You're a good kid with a good heart.
You can do a lot worse than living your life like your brother, believe me.
I don't want to work at the fucking mill, man.
I want to be just like you, John.
We'll talk later.
Hey.
Hi.
Where you been?
Out with the boys.
Well, looks like... your boys play rough.
Want a drink?
No.
The place looks nice.
Put it up!
Hey.
Let me see your hands.
What?
Let me see your hands.
Rodney, come here.
Let me see your fucking hands.
- Come on, man.
- Huh?
Don't give me no shit.
Is that the best you can do?
What do you think I should do?
I don't know.
Shovel asphalt for the highway department.
Sell fucking shoes.
Come work at the mill.
Come work at the mill.
I told you Roach would give you a job.
No, man, I'd rather be fucking dead.
Fuck the mill.
Fuck the mill.
I work at the mill, you little fucker.
It's good enough for me.
It was good enough for our dad.
The fucking mill killed our dad!
Just don't be...
Hey.
Just don't be too proud to work for a living.
There's nothing wrong with it.
What'd you say?
Nothing wrong with working for a living.
- Working for a living?
- Yeah.
What do you call this, motherfucker?
Is that working for a living, huh?
Is it working for a living when I carried my best friend's legs under this arm, and the rest of him under this arm?
I saw a fucking baby with his fucking head cut off!
I saw a fucking pile of feet in the middle of the street, and I had to clean it up!
I gave my fucking life for this country.
That's not work?
And what's it done for me, huh?
What's it fucking done for me?
!
Fuck you.
Get me that fight up in Ramapo.
I told you not to bring that up again.
I need one last fucking fight, John.
Just give me one good fight, please.
One good fucking fight, please!
That's all I'm asking you.
Can you please do that for me?
No, you gotta trust me when I tell you, you don't want to set foot in those mountains.
What is the big fucking deal?
The big fucking deal?
The big fucking deal is I've dealt with these guys for a long time, and when they don't get what they want, they get nasty.
They get nasty, do they?
- Yeah.
You don't know.
- Yeah?
Well, John, I don't really have a lot of fucking options, man.
I can't fucking catch up doing this small-town shit!
- Calm the fuck down.
- Come the fuck on, man!
- Come on, please!
I'm sorry!
- I'm trying to protect you!
Just fucking call them up, John.
Please?
I'm not doing it, Rodney.
I'm not gonna call them.
Well, I'm not leaving until you do.
- Call them up.
- Rodney...
Just please call them up.
- John, please call them up.
- Rodney...
Please call them up.
I'm asking you for one fight.
Please call them up.
- Please call them up.
- Fuck, Rodney!
You fuck with these inbreds, you'll come crawling back.
If you're lucky.
I don't really want to be doing this.
This is not fucking around.
Let me talk to them.
Let me talk to them.
Yeah?
What the fuck you want, Petty?
March, march, where are my soldiers?
Where are my soldiers?
No!
Come on.
Hey!
We don't want to wake up the neighbors.
You know what?
Let's wake up the neighbors.
One, two, three!
So funny!
Oh, my gosh!
Wait a minute!
Okay, go, go, go, go, go!
- We're gonna play nice, right?
- Yeah!
What do you want?
You want to race me?
What do you want?
What do you want?
- Racer?
- I want to go on the horsey.
- Where are the horsies?
- Over there.
Over there.
- Race you over there.
- Yeah.
Lily...
Lily, can you just watch them for one second?
- You're staying at your dad's?
- Yeah.
You know, I'm trying to give it some life.
I went to his funeral.
I know.
Thank you.
That was... important to me.
Thank you.
Are you back at the mill?
Just can't get enough of it, you know?
I hear they're gonna close it.
Yeah, looks like it.
You know, cheaper to... uh, get steel from China.
God, I've missed you so much.
I've missed you so much.
I was hoping that, uh... we could work it out.
You know?
The things that were keeping us apart and... you know, take that next step is something
I want to do with you.
Because, uh...
I can't be without you, Lena.
I can't.
I'm pregnant.
Okay.
You, uh...
That's, uh...
That's wonderful news.
It is?
Yeah.
That's wonderful news.
I'm real happy for you, Lena.
I really am.
That's wonderful news.
You're gonna be a hell of a mom.
You're gonna be a hell of a mom!
I'm so sorry.
- I have to go.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Hey, man!
What about it?
Goddamn, Uncle Red.
- Look like they fed you pretty good.
- Yeah.
You're fit as a racehorse.
How you doing?
Still this side of the grass, you know.
Hey, I got something for your daddy.
I had a feeling that was you.
- You're still raising them?
Yeah.
- Isn't that pretty?
Yeah, when the weather permits.
Say, do you want to come over to the cemetery with me?
Shit, yeah.
Rodney here?
Does he want to come?
Ah, I don't know where he is.
Let me get this shit inside...
- run over with you.
- Hey, grab your rifle.
Maybe we can get a shot off before dark.
I saw a real nice eight-point out there the other night.
Yup.
See if I'm still a better shot than you.
Well... let's go get us a buck, huh?
We can circle around these.
Seen a feral cat.
DeGroat?
I didn't drive five and a half hours to watch you play fucking cards.
Well, when you owe as much as you owe me, Petty...
I guess I'm the last person you want to see.
Step into the room, fighter man.
Let me get a good look at you.
- And what's your name?
- Rodney.
Is that it?
Just Rodney?
Rodney Baze.
Rodney Baze.
Well...
Rodney Baze...
I hear you're quite the crazy fucker in the ring.
Makes me want to jump in there with you... and see who walks out.
We're standing so close, I guess we could do it right now.
You gonna be a good boy and take a dive, like Petty said you would?
Or am I gonna have to teach you a lesson?
No, he's good.
He's good.
- Teach me a lesson?
- I gave you our word.
Yeah, teach you a lesson.
Everything's good.
Let me hear you say it.
Teach me a lesson?
Yeah, isn't that what we talked about?
- Is this boy deaf?
- No, no, it's...
You been hit too many times?
Listen, we talked, everything's good.
Hey, yeah.
I like this one.
He's tough.
- And angry.
- Plenty tough.
Four-tours-in-Iraq tough.
Now, why the hell you want to come up here and fight, or, hell, anywhere, when you've been fighting over there for so long?
I just need the money, man.
Yeah.
Well... we all need money... don't we, Petty?
So... why don't me and John discuss this deal while you go put your fight face on.
Didn't we just discuss the deal?
What, you think I was asking?
Hey!
Don't!
Keep your fucking hands off him.
Just checking his reflexes.
You step out.
Step out and we'll...
I'll take care of this.
Step out, Rodney.
I should've popped that motherfucker.
Well, that would be the last motherfucker you ever popped.
Am I supposed to be scared of him 'cause he sucks on a lollipop?
Look at me.
You gotta make this look good.
You can't embarrass DeGroat in front of these guys that he's got coming up.
Well...
I can't promise to go down for that motherfucker.
Did you hear me?
Did you hear me?
!
- Yeah.
I heard you.
- Good.
Now get your shit and let's get going.
Come on, get ready.
Showtime.
You ain't fighting with that shit on, are you?
It's bare-knuckle up here.
Take 'em off.
Be careful out there.
Keep it going for a little while and then you know what to do.
Look at that beauty.
Clean shot?
Yeah, right in the heart.
Inch either way, we'd be tracking the son of a bitch all night, like the last time, you remember?
- Yeah.
- You see anything?
Not a goddamn thing.
Come on, help me.
Give me a hand with this.
Get him!
Come on!
Come on, sucker...
Get off me.
Get up!
Get up!
Rodney!
Rodney!
- Kick his ass!
- Come on, man!
- Just kick his ass!
- Rodney!
Rodney!
Come on, fucker.
Get up.
Get up, motherfucker.
You hear me?
You gotta hit me, make it look real.
Make it look real.
That's it!
That's it!
He's done!
He's done!
I made him stop!
Are you okay?
Hey, you okay?
You done good.
Look at me.
Bud.
Oh, Christ.
You okay?
- Bud, you okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Impressive stuff.
All heart and fist.
That boy don't look so good.
Hey, hey, uh, don't...
Don't blow your nose, your eyes will... swell up.
Hell, mercy, you took a whooping.
You looked angry out there.
I thought maybe... for a second you weren't a good listener.
I was just reacting.
I just lost it a little bit.
Oh, yeah, well, hell, I don't blame you.
I'd done the same thing, guy pounded on me like that.
- Yeah.
- So our slate is clean.
Well, yes, as long as you brought me the rest of my money.
Don't tell me you come all this way and didn't bring me what you owe.
This was it.
Now we're even.
That was the deal.
Oh, I must've got confused.
Whatever.
You need this?
Here.
Wipe your face.
Last time I'm coming up here, I can tell you that.
Sorry as hell you had to go through that, Rodney.
It's not your fault.
I asked you to take me up here.
It's both of our faults.
But we're through with those Ramapo fuckers.
That crazy son of a bitch can kiss my ass if he thinks I'm doing business with him again.
Strung out fucking tweaker.
Oh, what the fuck?
What the fuck is this?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
What's the game?
Yeah?
I think your left rear's gone down.
What?
I said...
I think your left rear's gone down.
What shit you talking?
I ain't talking shit.
And our slate ain't clean, motherfucker.
Get that other one out.
Let's go.
Go get him.
Get the fuck out.
Come on.
Get your fucking ass...
"Russ...
I'm sorry about the other day.
I know you're looking out for me.
But you gotta understand that I'm different than I was before I left.
And I think that I always will be.
I can't explain how exactly.
My head is just full of stuff and I can't get it out."
Oh, man.
You should have kept better company.
Don't look at me.
Look away.
Fuck you.
Oh, fuck you.
You fucking coward.
I don't care.
I don't care.
Get some shovels.
"But I'm gonna turn things around.
I'm gonna do this one last fight and then I'll be done.
Then I'm gonna shovel asphalt or dig for coal or I'll work with you and Roach at the mill.
I'll do anything.
I'm gonna get things back on track.
I promise.
I love you, man.
I'll see you tomorrow when I get back."
Morning, Russell.
Glad you're home.
Thanks.
I guess you, uh... heard that, uh...
I stopped by to see Lena.
Yeah, I'm aware.
Not why I'm here.
I said...
I think your left rear's gone down.
What shit you talking?
I ain't talking shit.
And our slate ain't clean, motherfucker.
- Turn it off.
- Get that other one out.
We don't need to hear it again.
I've spoken to Jersey State, Bergen County, Fish and Game.
All of them have dealt with this Harlan DeGroat before.
The problem is that the people up in those hills, they don't cooperate.
Getting information from these people is like pulling teeth.
It's a whole 'nother world up in there.
Generations upon generations of these people never even come down off that mountain.
Got their own breed of justice and it does not include us.
Even the local police sent in several squad cars, but they haven't been able to get nothing yet.
So you know that I'm stuck here with my hands tied.
What the fuck does that mean?
That they aren't gonna... do anything about this or look for Rodney?
I did not say that, Russell.
I said that they're having a difficult time and I'm having jurisdiction issues.
But I'm gonna be on it until it's done.
What the fuck?
- Bud.
- I mean, you know...
We know John Petty's dead.
I mean, Jesus, you know, damn near hear him dying on Dan's phone.
But Rodney might still be out there.
I know that this is very hard for you, but...
I do have a procedure that I have to follow.
It sounds like there's no procedure at all.
- Bud!
- No, no, no, no, no.
It sounds like they're not doing a goddamn thing.
Now, either you're all afraid to go in there... or, uh...
- you just don't give a shit.
- You walking down the wrong road.
I said I'm into it, and I said I'll handle it.
Don't make this personal.
- You need to stay out of my business.
- Stay out of your business.
- Knock it off.
- Stay out of your business.
You know what?
While I was away, it seems that all that you was into was my business.
So that's what this is.
You got a problem with me.
Yeah, I got a problem with you.
I'm not the one who was out drinking and driving.
Got locked up and had to leave his woman alone 'cause of something I did, a mistake I made.
And I don't know nothing about what happened to Rodney.
Nothing at all.
I'm just trying to do my job.
And I'm giving you my word that I'm gonna be on it until it's done.
Until it's done.
Well.
Russell.
Come on.
What is it?
You want me to show you out?
I'll be around.
Dan.
- Where you going now?
- No, it's good.
- Hey, Russ, listen, I'm sorry.
- Hey.
I know how tough this is, but I'm here to help anyway I can.
Then get me an address for DeGroat.
An address?
How am I gonna get that address?
Don't give me that shit, Dan.
You know as well as I do that John Petty has one.
Well, I don't...
I don't know.
Look, I'll see if I can dig that up.
No, no, no, don't see if you can dig it up.
- Do it.
- Russell, listen to me.
If you're smart, you let these boys handle it.
I know these guys.
This DeGroat is a nasty son of a bitch.
You let me worry about... who's a nasty son of a bitch.
We'll follow you.
Damn, looks like John still owes money to these people.
A hell of a lot of money.
I know they had this whole deal, but I didn't realize it was this big.
- What deal?
- Well, this bare-knuckle deal up and down the Appalachians.
I don't know that much about it, but my guess is,
Rodney went up there to fight.
Well, why didn't you just say something to Wesley?
Well, I don't...
I don't know.
I mean, I didn't...
I didn't know what to say.
John should've known better.
I think he did, Red, but Rodney forced his hand.
He thought it was the only way to pay off that debt.
I don't see DeGroat's address, but I do know it's up in the Ramapos.
And, Russell, please hear me when I tell you, you'd be way better off letting the authorities deal with him.
They're not doing such a good job, Dan.
Well, I hear you, but John hated dealing with them.
I'm surprised they haven't come down here to get their money.
Money and drugs, that's the only thing that drove that crazy son of a bitch.
Are you ready for this?
I guess so.
You watch your ass.
Gotta say, fellas, that is sharp.
'66 or '67?
Man, you don't see that Bolero red much.
You got the tuxedo black and ash gold everywhere, but...
Yeah, this is sweet.
Three-ninety-six big block?
Yep.
That's a true 138 SS right there, man.
Fucking rocket ship.
Well, I don't doubt it with that Muncie four speed.
How long to restore it?
A couple years.
A couple years?
Worth it.
You got nitrous?
Nah, nah, just a heavy foot.
Yeah.
You know who's got any candy here?
- What do you mean, "candy?"
- You know what I mean.
Yeah.
You a fucking cop?
Am I a fucking cop?
Do I look like a fucking cop?
Who's the old man in the truck?
Don't worry about him.
He ain't a cop, either.
- What you looking for, man?
- Whatever you got.
You know...
Crank, 20/20's, blue bellies, crystals or pure.
- It don't matter.
- He knows his shit.
Yeah, we got some buzzard dust, some army up at the house.
All right.
We'll get you feelin' shitty, my friend.
Good.
All right, I'll follow you?
Yo, it's Tiny.
- You wait right here, all right?
- All right.
All right.
Brought them boys out here looking for some of the train.
Yo, if they got their greenbacks, that's fine.
Come on up.
Who the fuck are you?
I'm just passing through.
I ain't asked you where you were going.
I asked you who you were.
Well, I didn't ask who you were.
We just want to get high, and our money's green.
Well, then you come to the right place.
But I got to say, you got some balls coming up in here, not knowing nobody.
But if your money's green... then it's all good.
That's pure glass.
Fire it up.
Looks good to me.
How much?
Nah, fire that shit up.
It'll blow your balls off, brother.
I told you, I'm good.
How much?
You don't know...
Harlan DeGroat, do you?
Is that a joke?
Why would I joke about that?
'Cause this is his house.
He around?
I wouldn't know.
I ain't his babysitter.
All right.
Hey, Red.
Not now.
We'll come by later.
Yo!
You forgot this.
Oh, Shit.
Put your hands where I can see 'em, gentlemen.
Russell Baze?
That's right.
Chief Barnes from the North Braddock Police alerted us early this evening that you were up here.
You're lucky I got here when I did.
If the locals knew why you were here, they'd zip you up and you'd be leaving in a body bag.
Do I need to ask if you're carrying concealed weapons?
No, sir.
- No, sir.
- All right.
Then, given that you're an ex-con, likely carrying concealed weapons, you have a choice.
Either I arrest you now or I follow you to the state line.
With respect, officer, my brother might be up here, and I ain't leaving without him.
I'll only do Chief Barnes a favor once.
You return and I'll arrest you on the spot.
There's nothing you can do from inside a jail cell.
Am I making myself clear, gentlemen?
Yes, sir, you are.
All right.
Then I'll follow you out.
That boy was always troubled.
Ever since he was a little kid.
You could see it in his eyes.
Especially after your mama died.
Hey, Russell.
Wesley.
I just heard from the Jersey police.
They found your brother.
He's dead.
Okay.
A hunter's dog dug him up.
Sorry.
They just called me.
The coroner's gonna examine his body.
I suspect that you'll have him back by the weekend.
Place is really hard to locate.
The roads are all mostly trails.
- Let me go talk to him.
- No, no, no.
I got it.
- It's okay.
- Yeah?
You hardly touched your food.
I ate enough.
I appreciate you coming over.
I wanted to.
We wanted to.
I'm sorry about Rodney.
I'm really sorry.
He was put through a lot, you know?
And so have you.
But please don't do anything.
Okay?
You already tried.
You're lucky you got out of there alive.
Let Wesley handle this.
Let him do his job.
He's a good man, Russell.
- You want me to take it?
- No, I got it.
Okay.
We may not have the... the fire and the flame... but we got something good.
You know?
Can we put this behind us?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thanks for dinner.
You ready?
Let's go.
Police!
On the ground!
Harlan DeGroat!
Police!
Get down on the ground!
Get down!
The guy was expecting us.
Oh, yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Okay.
Every time, it's just...
Forgive me my sins, O Lord.
Forgive me my sins.
The sins of my youth... the sins of my age, the sins of my soul... the sins of my body.
My idle sins... my serious voluntary sins... the sins I know, the sins we have concealed for so long... which are now hidden from my memory.
My Jesus, forget and forgive what we have been.
Amen.
Hey!
Hey, Baze!
Russell!
Come back!
Russell!
What are you doing here, man?
You can't be back here.
Wesley told me not to let anybody back here.
- Give it up, please.
- Dan, where's that ledger?
You can't be here.
Where's that ledger, Dan?
Russell, don't do this.
Let him handle it.
- This it?
- Russell, don't.
- You can stay if you want.
- I don't want any part of it.
What?
Harlan DeGroat?
Who wants to know?
I've taken over John Petty's accounts.
- Who's this?
- Listen to me.
I'm willing to settle his debt.
And we can keep this deal going.
Who the fuck is this?
It don't matter.
You come to Braddock... the money's yours.
How the fuck did you get my number?
Who the fuck is this?
Hey, we're closed.
Why don't you get your fat fucking ass in the kitchen, fix me up a salmon burger?
See what that bitch has in the register.
What do you say, Dan?
- You look fit.
- Well, thanks.
- Staying out of trouble?
- Yeah, trying.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Yeah.
So, uh...
I hear you might have some money for me.
Who, me?
You, somebody.
No, not me.
No.
Well, do you know where Petty keeps his money?
Uh, no...
Petty, you know, he... he keeps everybody at arm's length.
I just tend bar.
Well, you just tend bar from all the way back here?
- Well, I'm just...
- That's a good trick, Dan.
So let me get this straight.
You don't know where that money is?
I don't know, honest to God, I don't.
I swear to God, I don't know.
- You swear to God?
- Yeah.
Well, if you're invoking a deity over this,
I guess I'm mistaken.
Yeah.
A long way to drive, Dan.
Shoot.
- I didn't come five hours...
- I don't know!
to not get my fucking money!
Show me where that safe is.
Okay, okay!
Okay, I'll do it.
Okay, all right.
Get that fucker open right now.
Wait, I gotta remember the combination.
- Julie, call 911.
- Wait a sec, I'm trying.
- I just need another number...
- Three.
- one more number, wait...
- Two.
Just give me a second so I can remember the numbers!
- Time's up, Dan.
- Wait!
- Open it!
- Wait!
One more number.
Oh, God, thank God.
It's empty.
You kidding me?
Where's my fucking money?
Motherfuckers!
No!
Dan!
Oh, God, Dan.
Got a 216, shots fired.
No suspect information at this time.
You know who I am?
Get up.
Get up.
Keep going.
I'm Rodney Baze's brother.
Yeah.
Tough kid.
You hear those birds?
Don't do it, Russell!
Russell!
Drop your weapon!

You got a check coming in from somewhere or...?

Well, I didn't ask for you to bail me out.
No.

(SCREAMING)
Fuck you.
(DOOR OPENS)
(SIGHS)
(ENGINE STARTING, REVVING)
(TIRES SQUEAL)
Get me that fight up in Ramapo.
I told you not to bring that up again.
I need one last fucking fight, John.
Just give me one good fight, please.
One good fucking fight, please!
That's all I'm asking you.
Can you please do that for me?
No, you gotta trust me when I tell you, you don't want to set foot in those mountains.
What is the big fucking deal?
The big fucking deal?
The big fucking deal is I've dealt with these guys for a long time, and when they don't get what they want, they get nasty.
They get nasty, do they?
- Yeah.
You don't know.
- RODNEY:
Yeah?
Well, John, I don't really have a lot of fucking options, man.
I can't fucking catch up doing this small-town shit!
Calm the fuck down.
Come the fuck on, man!
Come on, please!
I'm sorry!
I'm trying to protect you!
Just fucking call them up, John.
Please?
I'm not doing it, Rodney.
I'm not gonna call them.
Well, I'm not leaving until you do.
- Call them up.
- Rodney...
Just please call them up.
- John, please call them up.
- Rodney...
Please call them up.
I'm asking you for one fight.
Please call them up.
- Please call them up.
- Fuck, Rodney!
You fuck with these inbreds, you'll come crawling back.
If you're lucky.
(RODNEY CLAPS HANDS)
I don't really want to be doing this.
This is not fucking around.
Let me talk to them.
Let me talk to them.

I want to go on the horsey.
Where are the horsies?

Lily, can you just watch them for one second?
(INSECTS CHIRRING)
- You're staying at your dad's?
- Yeah.
You know, I'm trying to give it some life.
I went to his funeral.
I know.
Thank you.
That was...
important to me.
Thank you.
Are you back at the mill?
Just can't get enough of it, you know?
I hear they're gonna close it.
Yeah, looks like it.
You know, cheaper to... uh, get steel from China.
God, I've missed you so much.
I've missed you so much.
I was hoping that, uh... we could work it out.
You know?
The things that were keeping us apart and... you know, take that next step is something
I want to do with you.
Because, uh...
I can't be without you, Lena.
I can't.
I'm pregnant.
OK.
Wow.
Wow.
You, uh... (SNIFFLES)
That's, uh...
That's wonderful news.
It is?
Yeah.
That's wonderful news.
I'm real happy for you, Lena.
I really am.
That's wonderful news.
You're gonna be a hell of a mom.
(VOICE BREAKING) Wow!
You're gonna be a hell of a mom!
(BOTH CRYING)
I'm so sorry.
- I have to go.
- Yeah.
OK.
(HORN BEEPS TWICE)
Hey, man!
What about it?
Goddamn, Uncle Red.
- Look like they fed you pretty good.
- Yeah.
You're fit as a racehorse.
How you doing?
Still this side of the grass, you know.
Hey, I got something for your daddy.
I had a feeling that was you.
You're still raising them?
Isn't that pretty?
Yeah.
Yeah, when the weather permits.
Say, do you want to come over to the cemetery with me?
Shit, yeah.
Rodney here?
Does he want to come?
Ah, I don't know where he is.
Let me get this shit inside... run over with you.
- Hey, grab your rifle.
Maybe we can get a shot off before dark.
I saw a real nice eight-point out there the other night.
RUSSELL:
Yup.
See if I'm still a better shot than you.
(RED CHUCKLES)
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
Well... let's go get us a buck, huh?
We can circle around these.
Seen a feral cat.
DeGroat?
I didn't drive five and a half hours to watch you play fucking cards.
Well, when you owe as much as you owe me, Petty...
I guess I'm the last person you want to see.
Step into the room, fighter man.
Let me get a good look at you.
- And what's your name?
- Rodney.
Is that it?
Just Rodney?
Rodney Baze.
Rodney Baze.
(HARLAN EXHALING)
Well...
Rodney Baze...
I hear you're quite the crazy fucker in the ring.
Makes me want to jump in there with you... and see who walks out.
We're standing so close, I guess we could do it right now.
(CHUCKLES)
You gonna be a good boy and take a dive, like Petty said you would?
Or am I gonna have to teach you a lesson?
No, he's good.
He's good.
Teach me a lesson?
I gave you our word.
Yeah, teach you a lesson.
JOHN:
Everything's good.
Let me hear you say it.
Teach me a lesson?
Yeah, isn't that what we talked about?
- Is this boy deaf?
- No, no, it's...
You been hit too many times?
(QUIET LAUGH)
Listen, we talked, everything's good.
(LAUGHS)
Hey, yeah.
I like this one.
He's tough.
- And angry.
- JOHN:
Plenty tough.
Four-tours-in-Iraq tough.
Now, why the hell you want to come up here and fight, or, hell, anywhere, when you've been fighting over there for so long?
I just need the money, man.
Mmm...
Yeah.
Well... we all need money... don't we, Petty?
So... why don't me and John discuss this deal while you go put your fight face on.
Didn't we just discuss the deal?
What, you think I was asking?
Hey!
Don't!
Keep your fucking hands off him.
Just checking his reflexes.
You step out.
Step out and we'll...
I'll take care of this.
Step out, Rodney.
(LAUGHING)
I should've popped that motherfucker.
Well, that would be the last motherfucker you ever popped.
Am I supposed to be scared of him 'cause he sucks on a lollipop?
(EXHALES) Look at me.
You gotta make this look good.
You can't embarrass DeGroat in front of these guys that he's got coming up.
Well...
I can't promise to go down for that motherfucker.
Did you hear me?
- Yeah.
I heard you.
- Good.
Now get your shit and let's get going.
Come on, get ready.
Showtime.
You ain't fighting with that shit on, are you?
It's bare-knuckle up here.
JOHN:
Take 'em off.
Be careful out there.
Keep it going for a little while and then you know what to do.
(GRUNTS)
RUSSELL:
Look at that beauty.
Clean shot?
Yeah, right in the heart.
Inch either way, we'd be tracking the son of a bitch all night, like the last time, you remember?
- Yeah.
- You see anything?
Not a goddamn thing.
Come on, help me.
Give me a hand with this.

Are you OK?
Hey, you OK?
(CROWD CHATTER FADES)
You done good.
Look at me.
Bud.
Oh, Christ.
You OK?
- Bud, you OK?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Impressive stuff.
All heart and fist.
That boy don't look so good.
(SNIFFLING, COUGHS)
Hey, hey, uh, don't...
Don't blow your nose, your eyes will... swell up.
Hell, mercy, you took a whooping.
You looked angry out there.
I thought maybe... for a second you weren't a good listener.
I was just reacting.
I just lost it a little bit.
Oh, yeah, well, hell, I don't blame you.
I'd done the same thing, guy pounded on me like that.
- Yeah.
- So our slate is clean.
Mmm...
Well, yes, as long as you brought me the rest of my money.
Don't tell me you come all this way and didn't bring me what you owe.
This was it.
Now we're even.
That was the deal.
Oh.
I must've got confused.
(LAUGHS) Whatever.
You need this?
Here.
Wipe your face.
Last time I'm coming up here, I can tell you that.
Sorry as hell you had to go through that, Rodney.
(WEAKLY) It's not your fault.
I asked you to take me up here.
It's both of our faults.
But we're through with those Ramapo fuckers.
That crazy son of a bitch can kiss my ass if he thinks I'm doing business with him again.
Strung out fucking tweaker.
Oh, what the fuck?
What the fuck is this?
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
What's the game?
(INSECTS CHIRRING)
Yeah?
I think your left rear's gone down.
What?
I said...
I think your left rear's gone down.
What shit you talking?
(LAUGHS) I ain't talking shit.
And our slate ain't clean, motherfucker.
(GUNSHOT)
Get that other one out.
Let's go.
Go get him.
Get the fuck out.
Come on.

RODNEY: "Russ...
I'm sorry about the other day.
I know you're looking out for me.
But you gotta understand that I'm different than I was before I left.
And I think that I always will be.
I can't explain how exactly.
My head is just full of stuff and I can't get it out."
(SIGHS)
Oh, man.
(PANTING)
You should have kept better company.
Don't look at me.
(PANTING)
Look away.
Fuck you.
Oh, fuck you.
You fucking coward.
I don't care.
I don't care.
(GUN FIRES)
Get some shovels.
RODNEY: "But I'm gonna turn things around.
I'm gonna do this one last fight and then I'll be done.
Then I'm gonna shovel asphalt or dig for coal or I'll work with you and Roach at the mill.
I'll do anything.
I'm gonna get things back on track.
I promise.
I love you, man.
I'll see you tomorrow when I get back."
(PAPER RUSTLING)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Morning, Russell.
Glad you're home.
Thanks.
(CLEARS THROAT)
I guess you, uh... heard that, uh...
I stopped by to see Lena.
Yeah, I'm aware.
Not why I'm here.
HARLAN:
I said...
I think your left rear's gone down.
JOHN:
What shit you talking?
HARLAN:
I ain't talking shit.
And our slate ain't clean, motherfucker.
(GUNSHOT)
- Turn it off.
- HARLAN:
Get that other one out.
We don't need to hear it again.
I've spoken to Jersey State, Bergen County, Fish and Game.
All of them have dealt with this Harlan DeGroat before.
The problem is that the people up in those hills, they don't cooperate.
Getting information from these people is like pulling teeth.
It's a whole 'nother world up in there.
Generations upon generations of these people never even come down off that mountain.
Got their own breed of justice and it does not include us.
Even the local police sent in several squad cars, but they haven't been able to get nothing yet.
So you know that I'm stuck here with my hands tied.
What the fuck does that mean?
That they aren't gonna... do anything about this or look for Rodney?
I did not say that, Russell.
I said that they're having a difficult time and I'm having jurisdiction issues.
But I'm gonna be on it until it's done.
What the fuck?
- Bud.
- I mean, you know...
We know John Petty's dead.
I mean, Jesus, you know, damn near hear him dying on Dan's phone.
But Rodney might still be out there.
I know that this is very hard for you, but...
I do have a procedure that I have to follow.
It sounds like there's no procedure at all.
- Bud!
- No, no, no, no, no.
It sounds like they're not doing a goddamn thing.
Now, either you're all afraid to go in there... or, uh... you just don't give a shit.
- You walking down the wrong road.
I said I'm into it, and I said I'll handle it.
Don't make this personal.
You need to stay out of my business.
Stay out of your business.
- Knock it off.
- Stay out of your business.
You know what?
While I was away, it seems that all that you was into was my business.
So that's what this is.
You got a problem with me.
Yeah, I got a problem with you.
WESLEY:
I'm not the one who was out drinking and driving.
Got locked up and had to leave his woman alone 'cause of something I did, a mistake I made.
And I don't know nothing about what happened to Rodney.
Nothing at all.
I'm just trying to do my job.
And I'm giving you my word that I'm gonna be on it until it's done.
Until it's done.
Mmm.
Well.
Russell.
Come on.
What is it?
You want me to show you out?
I'll be around.
Dan.
RED:
Where you going now?
No, it's good.
- Hey, Russ, listen, I'm sorry.
- Hey.
I know how tough this is, but I'm here to help anyway I can.
Then get me an address for DeGroat.
An address?
How am I gonna get that address?
Don't give me that shit, Dan.
You know as well as I do that John Petty has one.
Well, I don't...
I don't know.
Look, I'll see if I can dig that up.
No, no, no, don't see if you can dig it up.
- Do it.
- Russell, listen to me.
If you're smart, you let these boys handle it.
I know these guys.
This DeGroat is a nasty son of a bitch.
You let me worry about... who's a nasty son of a bitch.
We'll follow you.
(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING IN DISTANCE)
Damn, looks like John still owes money to these people.
A hell of a lot of money.
I know they had this whole deal, but I didn't realize it was this big.
- What deal?
- Well, this bare-knuckle deal up and down the Appalachians.
I don't know that much about it, but my guess is,
Rodney went up there to fight.
Well, why didn't you just say something to Wesley?
Well, I don't...
I don't know.
I mean, I didn't...
I didn't know what to say.
John should've known better.
I think he did, Red, but Rodney forced his hand.
He thought it was the only way to pay off that debt.
I don't see DeGroat's address, but I do know it's up in the Ramapos.
And, Russell, please hear me when I tell you, you'd be way better off letting the authorities deal with him.
They're not doing such a good job, Dan.
Well, I hear you, but John hated dealing with them.
I'm surprised they haven't come down here to get their money.
Money and drugs, that's the only thing that drove that crazy son of a bitch.
Are you ready for this?
I guess so.
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
You watch your ass.
Gotta say, fellas, that is sharp.
'66 or '67?
Man, you don't see that Bolero red much.
You got the tuxedo black and ash gold everywhere, but...
Yeah, this is sweet.
Three-ninety-six big block?
Yep.
That's a true 138 SS right there, man.
Fucking rocket ship.
Well, I don't doubt it with that Muncie four speed.
Hmm!
How long to restore it?
A couple years.
RUSSELL:
A couple years?
Worth it.
You got nitrous?
Nah, nah, just a heavy foot.
Yeah.
(CHUCKLES)
You know who's got any candy here?
- What do you mean, "candy?"
- You know what I mean.
Yeah.
You a fucking cop?
(LAUGHS)
Am I a fucking cop?
Do I look like a fucking cop?
Who's the old man in the truck?
Don't worry about him.
He ain't a cop, either.
What you looking for, man?
Whatever you got.
You know...
Crank, 20/20's, blue bellies, crystals or pure.
It don't matter.
Wow, he knows his shit.
Yeah, we got some buzzard dust, some critty up at the house.
All right.
We'll get you feelin' shitty, my friend.
Good.
All right, I'll follow you?
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)
Yo, it's Tiny.
- You wait right here, all right?
- All right.
All right.
Brought them boys out here looking for some of the train.
MAN:
Yo, if they got their greenbacks, that's fine.
Come on up.
(DOG BARKING)
Who the fuck are you?
RUSSELL:
I'm just passing through.
I ain't asked you where you were going.
I asked you who you were.
Well, I didn't ask who you were.
We just want to get high, and our money's green.
Well, then you come to the right place.
But I got to say, you got some balls coming up in here, not knowing nobody.
But if your money's green... then it's all good.
That's pure glass.
Fire it up.
Looks good to me.
How much?
Nah, fire that shit up.
It'll blow your balls off, brother.
I told you, I'm good.
How much?
(THROATY GRUNT)
(SNIFFLES)
(GROANS)
RUSSELL:
You don't know, um...
Harlan DeGroat, do you?
Is that a joke?
Why would I joke about that?
'Cause this is his house.
He around?
I wouldn't know.
I ain't his babysitter.
All right.
(WHISPERS) Hey, Red.
Not now.
We'll come by later.
Yo!
You forgot this.
RED:
Oh, Shit.
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)
Put your hands where I can see 'em, gentlemen.
Russell Baze?
That's right.
Chief Barnes from the North Braddock Police alerted us early this evening that you were up here.
You're lucky I got here when I did.
If the locals knew why you were here, they'd zip you up and you'd be leaving in a body bag.
Do I need to ask if you're carrying concealed weapons?
No, sir.
- No, sir.
- All right.
Then, given that you're an ex-con, likely carrying concealed weapons, you have a choice.
Either I arrest you now or I follow you to the state line.
With respect, officer, my brother might be up here, and I ain't leaving without him.
I'll only do Chief Barnes a favor once.
You return and I'll arrest you on the spot.
There's nothing you can do from inside a jail cell.
Am I making myself clear, gentlemen?
Yes, sir, you are.
All right.
Then I'll follow you out.
That boy was always troubled.
Ever since he was a little kid.
You could see it in his eyes.
Especially after your mama died.
(BOYS SHOUTING IN DISTANCE)
(DOORS SHUTTING, ENGINES STARTING)
Hey, Russell.
Wesley.
I just heard from the Jersey police.
They found your brother.
He's dead.
OK.
A hunter's dog dug him up.
(VOICE FADING SLOWLY) Sorry.
They just called me.
The coroner's gonna examine his body.
(FAINT) I suspect that you'll have him back by the weekend.
(NO AUDIO)
Place is really hard to locate.
The roads are all mostly trails.
Let me go talk to him.
LENA:
No, no, no.
I got it.
- LENA:
It's OK.
- Yeah?
(FAUCET RUNNING, UTENSILS AND DISHES CLINKING)
You hardly touched your food.
RUSSELL:
I ate enough.
I appreciate you coming over.
- I wanted to.
- Mmm.
We wanted to.
I'm sorry about Rodney.
I'm really sorry.
He was put through a lot, you know?
And so have you.
But please don't do anything.
OK?
You already tried.
You're lucky you got out of there alive.
Let Wesley handle this.
Let him do his job.
He's a good man, Russell.
You want me to take it?
No, I got it.
OK.
(SCRAPING PLATE)
We may not have the... the fire and the flame... but we got something good.
You know?
Can we put this behind us?

My Jesus, forget and forgive what we have been.
Amen.
Hey!
Hey, Baze!

What are you doing here, man?
You can't be back here.

You can't be here.
Where's that ledger, Dan?

I'm willing to settle his debt.
And we can keep this deal going.

You, somebody.
No, not me.

Uh, no...

I just tend bar.
Well, you just tend bar from all the way back here?
- Well, I'm just...
- That's a good trick, Dan.

I just need the money, man.
Mmm...
Yeah.
Well... we all need money don't we, Petty?
So why don't me and John discuss this deal while you go put your fight face on.
Didn't we just discuss the deal?
What, you think I was asking?
Hey!
Don't!
Keep your fucking hands off him.
Just checking his reflexes.
You step out.
Step out and we'll...
I'll take care of this.
Step out, Rodney.
(LAUGHING)
I should've popped that motherfucker.
Well, that would be the last motherfucker you ever popped.
Am I supposed to be scared of him 'cause he sucks on a lollipop?
(EXHALES) Look at me.
You gotta make this look good.
You can't embarrass DeGroat in front of these guys that he's got coming up.
Well I can't promise to go down for that motherfucker.
Did you hear me?
Did you hear me?
!
- Yeah.
I heard you.
- Good.
Now get your shit and let's get going.
Come on, get ready.
Showtime.
You ain't fighting with that shit on, are you?
It's bare-knuckle up here.
JOHN:
Take 'em off.
Be careful out there.
Keep it going for a little while and then you know what to do.
(GRUNTS)
RUSSELL:
Look at that beauty.
Clean shot?
Yeah, right in the heart.
Inch either way, we'd be tracking the son of a bitch all night, like the last time, you remember?
- Yeah.
- You see anything?
Not a goddamn thing.
Come on, help me.
Give me a hand with this.
(MEN CLAMORING)

You gotta hit me, make it look real.
Make it look real.
(BLOWS LANDING)
(CROWD SHOUTING)
That's it!
That's it!
(CROWD SHOUTING ANGRILY)
He's done!

(CROWD SHOUTING ANGRILY)

Are you OK?
He)', you OK?
(CROWD CHATTER FADES)
You done good.
Look at me.
Bud.
Oh, Christ.
You OK?
- Bud, you OK?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Impressive stuff.
All heart and fist.
That boy don't look so good.
(SNIFFLING, COUGHS)
Hey, hey, uh, don't...
Don't blow your nose, your eyes will swell up.
Hell, mercy, you took a whooping.
You looked angry out there.
I thought maybe for a second you weren't a good listener.
I was just reacting.
I just lost it a little bit.
Oh, yeah, well, hell, I don't blame you.
I'd done the same thing, guy pounded on me like that.
- Yeah.
- So our slate is clean.
Mmm...
Well, yes, as long as you brought me the rest of my money.
Don't tell me you come all this way and didn't bring me what you owe.
This was it.
Now we're even.
That was the deal.
Oh.
I must've got confused.
(LAUGHS) Whatever.
You need this?
Here.
Wipe your face.
Last time I'm coming up here, I can tell you that.
Sorry as hell you had to go through that, Rodney.
(WEAKLY) It's not your fault.
I asked you to take me up here.
It's both of our faults.
But we're through with those Ramapo fuckers.
That crazy son of a bitch can kiss my ass if he thinks I'm doing business with him again.
Strung out fucking tweaker.
Oh, what the fuck?
What the fuck is this?
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
What's the game?
(INSECTS CHIRRING)
Yeah?
I think your left rear's gone down.
What?
I said I think your left rear's gone down.
What shit you talking?
(LAUGHS) I ain't talking shit.
And our slate ain't clean, motherfucker.
(GUNSHOT)
Get that other one out.
Let's go.
Go get him.
Get the fuck out.
Come on.
MAN:
Get your fucking ass...
(MEN GRUNTING)
(RODNEY GRUNTING)
(RODNEY CRIES OUT)
RODNEY: "Russ...
I'm sorry about the other day.
I know you're looking out for me.
But you gotta understand that I'm different than I was before I left.
And I think that I always will be.
I can't explain how exactly.
My head is just full of stuff and I can't get it out."
(SIGHS)
Oh, man.
(PANTING)
You should have kept better company.
Don't look at me.
(PANTING)
Look away.
Fuck you.
Oh, fuck you.
You fucking coward.
I don't care.
I don't care.
(GUN FIRES)
Get some shovels.
RODNEY: "But I'm gonna turn things around.
I'm gonna do this one last fight and then I'll be done.
Then I'm gonna shovel asphalt or dig for coal or I'll work with you and Roach at the mill.
I'll do anything.
I'm gonna get things back on track.
I promise.
I love you, man.
I'll see you tomorrow when I get back."
(PAPER RUSTLING)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Morning, Russell.
Glad you're home.
Thanks.
(CLEARS THROAT)
I guess you, uh heard that, uh I stopped by to see Lena.
Yeah, I'm aware.
Not why I'm here.
HARLAN:
I said...
I think your left rear's gone down.
JOHN:
What shit you talking?
HARLAN:
I ain't talking shit.
And our slate ain't clean, motherfucker.
(GUNSHOT)
- Turn it off.
- HARLAN:
Get that other one out.
We don't need to hear it again.
I've spoken to Jersey State, Bergen County, Fish and Game.
All of them have dealt with this Harlan DeGroat before.
The problem is that the people up in those hills, they don't cooperate.
Getting information from these people is like pulling teeth.
It's a whole 'nother world up in there.
Generations upon generations of these people never even come down off that mountain.
Got their own breed of justice and it does not include us.
Even the local police sent in several squad cars, but they haven't been able to get nothing yet.
So you know that I'm stuck here with my hands tied.
What the fuck does that mean?
That they aren't gonna do anything about this or look for Rodney?
I did not say that, Russell.
I said that they're having a difficult time and I'm having jurisdiction issues.
But I'm gonna be on it until it's done.
What the fuck?
- Bud.
- I mean, you know...
We know John Petty's dead.
I mean, Jesus, you know, damn near hear him dying on Dan's phone.
But Rodney might still be out there.
I know that this is very hard for you, but I do have a procedure that I have to follow.
It sounds like there's no procedure at all.
- Bud!
- No, no, no, no, no.
It sounds like they're not doing a goddamn thing.
Now, either you're all afraid to go in there or, uh...
- ...you just don't give a shit.
- You walking down the wrong road.
I said I'm into it, and I said I'll handle it.
Don't make this personal.
- You need to stay out of my business.
- Stay out of your business.
- Knock it off.
- Stay out of your business.
You know what?
While I was away, it seems that all that you was into was my business.
So that's what this is.
You got a problem with me.
Yeah, I got a problem with you.
WESLEY:
I'm not the one who was out drinking and driving.
Got locked up and had to leave his woman alone 'cause of something I did, a mistake I made.
And I don't know nothing about what happened to Rodney.
Nothing at all.
I'm just trying to do my job.
And I'm giving you my word that I'm gonna be on it until it's done.
Until it's done.
Mmm.
Well.
Russell.
Come on.
What is it?
You want me to show you out?
I'll be around.
Dan.
- RED:
Where you going now?
- No, it's good.
- Hey, Russ, listen, I'm sorry.
- Hey.
I know how tough this is, but I'm hereto help anyway I can.
Then get me an address for DeGroat.
An address?
How am I gonna get that address?
Don't give me that shit, Dan.
You know as well as I do that John Petty has one.
Well, I don't...
I don't know.
Look, I'll see if I can dig that up.
No, no, no, don't see if you can dig it up.
- Do it.
- Russell, listen to me.
If you're smart, you let these boys handle it.
I know these guys.
This DeGroat is a nasty son of a bitch.
You let me worry about who's a nasty son of a bitch.
We'll follow you.
(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING IN DISTANCE)
Damn, looks like John still owes money to these people.
A hell of a lot of money.
I know they had this whole deal, but I didn't realize it was this big.
- What deal?
- Well, this bare-knuckle deal up and down the Appalachians.
I don't know that much about it, but my guess is,
Rodney went up there to fight.
Well, why didn't you just say something to Wesley?
Well, I don't...
I don't know.
I mean, I didn't...
I didn't know what to say.
John should've known better.
I think he did, Red, but Rodney forced his hand.
He thought it was the only way to pay off that debt.
I don't see DeGroat's address, but I do know it's up in the Ramapos.
And, Russell, please hear me when I tell you, you'd be way better off letting the authorities deal with him.
They're not doing such a good job, Dan.
Well, I hear you, but John hated dealing with them.
I'm surprised they haven't come down hereto get their money.
Money and drugs, that's the only thing that drove that crazy son of a bitch.
Are you ready for this?
I guess so.
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
You watch your ass.
Gotta say, fellas, that is sharp.
'66 or '67?
Man, you don't see that Bolero red much.
You got the tuxedo black and ash gold everywhere, but...
Yeah, this is sweet.
Three-ninety-six big block?
Yep.
That's a true 138 SS right there, man.
Fucking rocket ship.
Well, I don't doubt it with that Muncie four speed.
Hmm!
How long to restore it?
A couple years.
RUSSELL:
A couple years?
Worth it.
You got nitrous?
Nah, nah, just a heavy foot.
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)
You know who's got any candy here?
- What do you mean, "candy?"
- You know what I mean.
Yeah.
You a fucking cop?
(LAUGHS)
Am I a fucking cop?
Do I look like a fucking cop?
Who's the old man in the truck?
Don't worry about him.
He ain't a cop, either.
- What you looking for, man?
- Whatever you got.
You know...
Crank, 20/20's, blue bellies, crystals or pure.
- It don't matter.
- Wow, he knows his shit.
Yeah, we got some buzzard dust, some mm; up at the house.
All right.
We'll get you feelin' shitty, my friend.
Good.
All right, I'll follow you?
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)
Yo, it's Tiny.
- You wait right here, all right?
- All right.
All right.
Brought them boys out here looking for some of the train.
MAN:
Yo, if they got their greenbacks, that's fine.
Come on up.
(DOG BARKING)
Who the fuck are you?
RUSSELL:
I'm just passing through.
I ain't asked you where you were going.
I asked you who you were.
Well, I didn't ask who you were.
We just want to get high, and our money's green.
Well, then you come to the right place.
But I got to say, you got some balls coming up in here, not knowing nobody.
But if your money's green then it's all good.
That's pure glass.
Fire it up.
Looks good to me.
How much?
Nah, fire that shit up.
It'll blow your balls off, brother.
I told you, I'm good.
How much?
(THROATY GRUNT)
(SNIFFLES)
(GROANS)
RUSSELL:
You don't know, um Harlan DeGroat, do you?
Is that a joke?
Why would I joke about that?
'Cause this is his house.
He around?
I wouldn't know.
I ain't his babysitter.
All right.
(WHISPERS) Hey, Red.
Not now.
We'll come by later.
Yo!
You forgot this.
RED:
Oh, shit.
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)
Put your hands where I can see 'em, gentlemen.
Russell Baze?
That's right.
Chief Barnes from the North Braddock Police alerted us early this evening that you were up here.
You're lucky I got here when I did.
If the locals knew why you were here, they'd zip you up and you'd be leaving in a body bag.
Do I need to ask if you're carrying concealed weapons?
No, sir.
- No, sir.
- All right.
Then, given that you're an ex-con, likely carrying concealed weapons, you have a choice.
Either I arrest you now or I follow you to the state line.
With respect, officer, my brother might be up here, and I ain't leaving without him.
I'll only do Chief Barnes a favor once.
You return and I'll arrest you on the spot.
There's nothing you can do from inside a jail cell.
Am I making myself clear, gentlemen?
Yes, sir, you are.
All right.
Then I'll follow you out.
That boy was always troubled.
Ever since he was a little kid.
You could see it in his eyes.
Especially after your mama died.
(BOYS SHOUTING IN DISTANCE)
(DOORS SHUTTING, ENGINES STARTING)
Hey, Russell.
Wesley.
I just heard from the Jersey police.
They found your brother.
He's dead.
OK.
A hunter's dog dug him up.
(VOICE FADING SLOWLY) Sorry.
They just called me.
The coroner's gonna examine his body.
(FAINT) I suspect that you'll have him back by the weekend.
(NO AUDIO)
Place is really hard to locate.
The roads are all mostly trails.
- Let me go talk to him.
- LENA:
No, no, no.
I got it.
- LENA:
It's OK.
- Yeah?
(FAUCET RUNNING, UTENSILS AND DISHES CLINKING)
You hardly touched your food.
RUSSELL:
I ate enough.
I appreciate you coming over.
- I wanted to.
- Mmm.
We wanted to.
I'm sorry about Rodney.
I'm really sorry.
He was put through a lot, you know?
And so have you.
But please don't do anything.
OK?
You already tried.
You're lucky you got out of there alive.
Let Wesley handle this.
Let him do his job.
He's a good man, Russell.
- You want me to take it?
- No, I got it.
OK.
(SCRAPING PLATE)
We may not have the the fire and the flame but we got something good.
You know?

My Jesus, forget and forgive what we have been.
Amen.
Hey!
Hey, Baze!

Come back!
Russell!
What are you doing here, man?
You can't be back here.
Wesley told me not to let anybody back here.
- Give it up, please.
- Dan, where's that ledger?
Huh?
DAN:
You can't be here.
Where's that ledger, Dan?
Russell, don't do this.

Who, me?
(CLEARS THROAT NERVOUSLY)
You, somebody.
No, not me.
No.
Well, do you know where Petty keeps his money?
Uh, no...
Petty, you know, he he keeps everybody at arm's length.
I just tend bar.
Well, you just tend bar from all the way back here?
- Well, I'm just...
- That's a good trick, Dan.
(GRUNTING WITH EFFORT)
So let me get this straight.
You don't know where that money is?
I don't know, honest to God, I don't.
I swear to God, I don't know.

- Yeah.
Well, if you're invoking a deity over this,
I guess I'm mistaken.

I ain't giving you shit.
I'm just wondering where you're getting the money to bet with.
- Borrowed it.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Who from?
Huh?
- Who from?
- John Petty.
Motherfucker gave me a tip, it didn't pay off.
Well, of course he did.
How much he loan you?
I don't even know.
You don't even know?
You know.
How much?
How much?
Fifteen hundred.
Fuck me, Rodney.
Where you gonna get that money to pay him back with, huh?
And what else you gonna owe him?
You got a check coming in from somewhere or...?
- No.
- You know, 'cause I ain't got that kind of cash lying around to bail you out.
Well, I didn't ask for you to bail me out.
No.
Don't fuck around with John Petty.
I'm not fucking around with him.
He gave me a fucking tip, it didn't pay off.
Come on, man.
Don't give me this shit.
Hey, uh, tell Dad that, um...
I'll be by before work tomorrow.
All right.
And, you know, just...
Don't go.
If I could stay, I would.
Then stay.
Leaving you ain't easy, girl.
Or I'll stay.
I'll stay until you get back.
What time do you get off?
Working a double.
- Seriously?
- Yeah.
Russell, you work too much.
Got to bring home the bacon to fatten you up.
You, you little Skinny Minnie.

No, I want you to fatten me up with a baby.
Want to run away somewhere?
Don't change the subject.
I want to run away somewhere.

- Where?
- I don't know.
I've never been east of Scranton, but...
- I'm gonna fatten you up.
- Stop.

- Big job.

- Oh, yeah.
I always come back.
- I love you.

- Keep your hands warm.
- OK.
Hey, thanks for coming by.
See you, Russ.
I have come here tonight to stand with you, to change America, to restore its future, to rise to our best ideals and to elect Barack Obama president of the United States.
I'm afraid we're about to lose another Kennedy.
God bless him.
You want another?
No, I'm good.
No, Rodney was supposed to meet me here half hour ago.
Oh, yeah, how is old Rodney?
He seems awfully quiet last few times he was here.
Yeah, he stop-lossed again.
- He's going back next month.
- Ahh...
Those poor sons of guns.
They're holding them against their will.
They're gonna run them into the ground, they're not careful.
Don't get me started.
Well, if he turns up, you tell him I headed home to see Lena?
- Sure.
- All right.
Oh, hey, I got this one.
Whoa, thanks, Dan.
Is, uh...
Is John in?
I just, you know, need to bend his ear.
Uh, he had someone back there earlier, but, uh, I think they might be gone.
- All right if I...
- Yeah.
If I have to come all the way down here again, I swear to God,
I'll gut your fucking ass, cunt.
You hear me, Petty?
You better start following through on your promises.
Oh, you know I can't control some of those fuckers.
For 25 grand, you'd better control them.
I ought to put a piece of lead in your ass
- and take everything in here.
- John, you back here?
Oh, I'm sorry, should I come back later or...?
No, it's OK.
We're finishing up.
Your mama teach you to barge in like that?
You got a problem with me?
I got a problem with everybody.
Who the fuck are they?
Inbred mountain folk from Jersey.
Church ain't over until the snakes are back in the bag, know what I mean?
What are they doing down here?
Don't ask.
- Here.
- Oh, no, I'm good.
Take it.
What's up?
Oh, here.
It's from Rodney.
I know it's not nearly all there.
I hate that you work your ass off to pay his debt.
Rodney needs to watch it.
I like him, Russell, I really do, but I worry that...
Hell, he might be safer over in Iraq.
Well, do you mind not telling him I brought you that, please, and if he don't bring the rest of it,
I will on my next payday.
OK.
I won't say a thing.
All right, thanks.
Cubs lead Pirates ten to one in the bottom of the sixth.
Chavez off of first base.
Lilly's still looking strong on the mound, and Lilly delivers.
Swinging, there's a drive, deep...
Hey.
Hey, there.
Can you...
Can you...
Can you hear me?
Hey, there, little fella.
Hey, there. little fella.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Hey.
Help.
Can you come help?
Come...
You know, I just keep my head down.
Studying shit I should've studied in high school, you know?
- Could be worse.
- How could it be worse?
I don't know.
I could be going to Iraq with you.
No shit.
I asked Lena to come down here.
She said some bullshit about not wanting to see you like this.
- You shouldn't have.
- Oh, fuck that.
She don't like this place.
What are you going to do?
She doesn't like this place?
What, is there someone who likes this place?
Come on, just give her a break.
And what about you?
You still seeing the, uh... uh, woof-woof?
Woof-woof!
Down.
Oh, man, I almost forgot about her.
Thanks a lot.
How's, uh...
How's Dad doing?
- Uh, barely hanging on, really.
- Yeah.
Make sure you give him a big hug from me.
You know?
Yeah, but...
You, uh, watch yourself over there.
OK.
- You, too.
- Yeah.
- Guess I know where to write to you.
- Yeah.
What's up, homey?
You fucking quiet.
You walk the yard, you don't talk to nobody.
Are you a fucking faggot?
Huh, bro?
- Get the fuck away from me.
- You want to suck my dick?
Come here.
Fuck you!
Get him off me, you motherfucker!
Hey!
Break it up!
Get off me, holmes!
Get upstairs!
- Get off me, cabron!
- Shut up!
He was trying to hang on until you got out.
He wanted to see you.
It just ate him up.
You put him next to Mom?
Yeah.
Um...
I'm glad you were home.
How was your last tour?
It was hard.
Yeah?
I mean, this...
You know, the whole thing...
Rodney, whatever you did... whatever you did, you had to do.
Yeah.
I got to go.
I love you, bud.
I love you, too, man.
And surely, he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows.
Yet we will esteem him as stricken.
Smitten of God and afflicted.
But he was wounded for our transgressions.
He was bruised for our iniquities.
The chastisement of our peace was upon him.
And with his stripes, we are healed.
Come here!
Man!
Mmm.
How's it feel?
Eh, eh, eh.
Oh!
Look, I'm running, I'm gonna run.
- I'm running.
- Get away!
Go!
- You driving?
- You want to drive?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah?
Come on, motherfucker.
Say good-bye.
Hey, Jerry!
He didn't know who the fuck you were.
Well, it is what it is.
I think you're better off.
Why would you say that?
Come on, man, she left you without even telling you.
Now she's with fucking Wesley?
She's a smart woman.
Got her reasons.
You been hanging with, uh...
Billy and them lately?
- Nope.
- No?
What you been doing with yourself?
- Looking for a job.
- Any luck?
- Nope.
- No?
On a liquid dinner?
It's the dinner of champions.
Yeah.
I'll be back.
Oh, Wesley, my lunch.
Bye.
Yeah!
Get your ass up, white boy!
Let's go!
Get your ass up, man!
Come on!
You ain't shit!
Look at you!
Look at you!
Come on, motherfucker!
Come on, man, let's go!
This ain't fucking Iraq.
Let's go, soldier boy.
Get up!
Stop!
Break it up!
Smile, motherfucker!
That's bullshit!
Goddamn it, Rodney.
Did you not hear me?
Did you not hear me?
Motherfucker, I took a hit in there.
I told you I can't really control myself in the middle of a fight, man.
It's all a blur.
And don't fucking poke on me again, either.
No more excuses.
No more Iraqi stories.
You just got to learn how to take a fall because you owe me a lot of fucking money.
Well, I can't pay you back your money by taking a dive in this nickel and dime bullshit.
You'd better figure out something and figure it out quick.
Yeah, let's go fight up in Jersey.
Up in the Ramapos they got fights.
Don't talk to me about that.
It's not for you.
Why?
I heard they're big money.
Look, Rodney, go work in the mill.
Like your father and brother.
This isn't a way for you to make a living.
You're a good kid with a good heart.
You can do a lot worse than living your life like your brother, believe me.
I don't want to work at the fucking mill, man.
I want to be just like you, John.
We'll talk later.
Hey.
Hi.
Where you been?
Out with the boys.
Well, looks like... your boys play rough.
Want a drink?
No.
The place looks nice.
Put it up!
Hey.
Let me see your hands.
What?
Let me see your hands.
Rodney, come here.
Let me see your fucking hands.
- Come on, man.
- Huh?
Don't give me no shit.
Is that the best you can do?
What do you think I should do?
I don't know.
Shovel asphalt for the highway department.
Sell fucking shoes.
Come work at the mill.
Come work at the mill.
I told you Roach would give you a job.
No, man, I'd rather be fucking dead.
Fuck the mill.
Fuck the mill.
I work at the mill, you little fucker.
It's good enough for me.
It was good enough for our dad.
The fucking mill killed our dad!
Just don't be...
Hey.
Just don't be too proud to work for a living.
There's nothing wrong with it.
What'd you say?
Nothing wrong with working for a living.
- Working for a living?
- Yeah.
What do you call this, motherfucker?
Is that working for a living, huh?
Is it working for a living when I carried my best friend's legs under this arm, and the rest of him under this arm?
I saw a fucking baby with his fucking head cut off!
I saw a fucking pile of feet in the middle of the street, and I had to clean it up!
I gave my fucking life for this country.
That's not work?
And what's it done for me, huh?
What's it fucking done for me?
!
Fuck you.
Get me that fight up in Ramapo.
I told you not to bring that up again.
I need one last fucking fight, John.
Just give me one good fight, please.
One good fucking fight, please!
That's all I'm asking you.
Can you please do that for me?
No, you gotta trust me when I tell you, you don't want to set foot in those mountains.
What is the big fucking deal?
The big fucking deal?
The big fucking deal is I've dealt with these guys for a long time, and when they don't get what they want, they get nasty.
They get nasty, do they?
- Yeah.
You don't know.
- Yeah?
Well, John, I don't really have a lot of fucking options, man.
I can't fucking catch up doing this small-town shit!
- Calm the fuck down.
- Come the fuck on, man!
- Come on, please!
I'm sorry!
- I'm trying to protect you!
Just fucking call them up, John.
Please?
I'm not doing it, Rodney.
I'm not gonna call them.
Well, I'm not leaving until you do.
- Call them up.
- Rodney...
Just please call them up.
- John, please call them up.
- Rodney...
Please call them up.
I'm asking you for one fight.
Please call them up.
- Please call them up.
- Fuck, Rodney!
You fuck with these inbreds, you'll come crawling back.
If you're lucky.
I don't really want to be doing this.
This is not fucking around.
Let me talk to them.
Let me talk to them.
Yeah?
What the fuck you want, Petty?
March, march, where are my soldiers?
Where are my soldiers?
No... uh-uh!
Come on.
Hey!
We don't want to wake up the neighbors.
You know what?
Let's wake up the neighbors.
One, two, three!
So funny!
Oh, my gosh!
Wait a minute!
OK, go, go, go, go, go!
- We're gonna play nice, right?
- Yeah!
What do you want?
You want to race me?
What do you want?
What do you want?
- Racer?
Huh?
- I want to go on the horsey.
- Where are the horsies?
Huh?
- Over there.
Over there.
- Race you over there.
- Yeah.
Lily...
Lily, can you just watch them for one second?
- You're staying at your dad's?
- Yeah.
You know, I'm trying to give it some life.
I went to his funeral.
I know.
Thank you.
That was...
important to me.
Thank you.
Are you back at the mill?
Just can't get enough of it, you know?
I hear they're gonna close it.
Yeah, looks like it.
You know, cheaper to... uh, get steel from China.
God, I've missed you so much.
I've missed you so much.
I was hoping that, uh... we could work it out.
You know?
The things that were keeping us apart and... you know, take that next step is something
I want to do with you.
Because, uh...
I can't be without you, Lena.
I can't.
I'm pregnant.
OK.
Wow.
Wow.
You, uh...
That's, uh...
That's wonderful news.
It is?
Yeah.
That's wonderful news.
I'm real happy for you, Lena.
I really am.
That's wonderful news.
You're gonna be a hell of a mom.
Wow!
You're gonna be a hell of a mom!
I'm so sorry.
- I have to go.
- Yeah.
OK.
Hey, man!
What about it?
Goddamn, Uncle Red.
- Look like they fed you pretty good.
- Yeah.
You're fit as a racehorse.
How you doing?
Still this side of the grass, you know.
Hey, I got something for your daddy.
I had a feeling that was you.
- You're still raising them?
- Isn't that pretty?
Yeah.
Yeah, when the weather permits.
Say, do you want to come over to the cemetery with me?
Shit, yeah.
Rodney here?
Does he want to come?
Ah, I don't know where he is.
Let me get this shit inside... run over with you.
- Hey, grab your rifle.
Maybe we can get a shot off before dark.
I saw a real nice eight-point out there the other night.
Yup.
See if I'm still a better shot than you.
Well... let's go get us a buck, huh?
We can circle around these.
Seen a feral cat.
DeGroat?
I didn't drive five and a half hours to watch you play fucking cards.
Well, when you owe as much as you owe me, Petty...
I guess I'm the last person you want to see.
Step into the room, fighter man.
Let me get a good look at you.
- And what's your name?
- Rodney.
Is that it?
Just Rodney?
Rodney Baze.
Rodney Baze.
Well...
Rodney Baze...
I hear you're quite the crazy fucker in the ring.
Makes me want to jump in there with you... and see who walks out.
We're standing so close, I guess we could do it right now.
You gonna be a good boy and take a dive, like Petty said you would?
Or am I gonna have to teach you a lesson?
No, he's good.
He's good.
- Teach me a lesson?
- I gave you our word.
Yeah, teach you a lesson.
Everything's good.
Let me hear you say it.
Teach me a lesson?
Yeah, isn't that what we talked about?
- Is this boy deaf?
- No, no, it's...
You been hit too many times?
Listen, we talked, everything's good.
Hey, yeah.
I like this one.
He's tough.
- And angry.
- Plenty tough.
Four-tours-in-Iraq tough.
Now, why the hell you want to come up here and fight, or, hell, anywhere, when you've been fighting over there for so long?
I just need the money, man.
Mmm...
Yeah.
Well... we all need money... don't we, Petty?
So... why don't me and John discuss this deal while you go put your fight face on.
Didn't we just discuss the deal?
What, you think I was asking?
Hey!
Don't!
Keep your fucking hands off him.
Just checking his reflexes.
You step out.
Step out and we'll...
I'll take care of this.
Step out, Rodney.
I should've popped that motherfucker.
Well, that would be the last motherfucker you ever popped.
Am I supposed to be scared of him 'cause he sucks on a lollipop?
Look at me.
You gotta make this look good.
You can't embarrass DeGroat in front of these guys that he's got coming up.
Well...
I can't promise to go down for that motherfucker.
Did you hear me?
Did you hear me?
!
- Yeah.
I heard you.
- Good.
Now get your shit and let's get going.
Come on, get ready.
Showtime.
You ain't fighting with that shit on, are you?
It's bare-knuckle up here.
Take 'em off.
Be careful out there.
Keep it going for a little while and then you know what to do.
Look at that beauty.
Clean shot?
Yeah, right in the heart.
Inch either way, we'd be tracking the son of a bitch all night, like the last time, you remember?
- Yeah.
- You see anything?
Not a goddamn thing.
Come on, help me.
Give me a hand with this.
Aah!
Get him!
Come on!
Come on, sucker...
Get off me.
Get up!
Get up!
Rodney!
Rodney!
- Kick his ass!
- Come on, man!
- Just kick his ass!
- Rodney!
Rodney!
Come on, fucker.
Get up.
Get up, motherfucker.
You hear me?
You gotta hit me, make it look real.
Make it look real.
That's it!
That's it!
He's done!
He's done!
I made him stop!
Are you OK?
Hey, you OK?
You done good.
Look at me.
Bud.
Oh, Christ.
You OK?
- Bud, you OK?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Impressive stuff.
All heart and fist.
That boy don't look so good.
Hey, hey, uh, don't...
Don't blow your nose, your eyes will... swell up.
Hell, mercy, you took a whooping.
You looked angry out there.
I thought maybe... for a second you weren't a good listener.
I was just reacting.
I just lost it a little bit.
Oh, yeah, well, hell, I don't blame you.
I'd done the same thing, guy pounded on me like that.
- Yeah.
- So our slate is clean.
Mmm...
Well, yes, as long as you brought me the rest of my money.
Don't tell me you come all this way and didn't bring me what you owe.
This was it.
Now we're even.
That was the deal.
Oh.
I must've got confused.
Whatever.
You need this?
Here.
Wipe your face.
Last time I'm coming up here, I can tell you that.
Sorry as hell you had to go through that, Rodney.
It's not your fault.
I asked you to take me up here.
It's both of our faults.
But we're through with those Ramapo fuckers.
That crazy son of a bitch can kiss my ass if he thinks I'm doing business with him again.
Strung out fucking tweaker.
Oh, what the fuck?
What the fuck is this?
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
What's the game?
Yeah?
I think your left rear's gone down.
What?
I said...
I think your left rear's gone down.
What shit you talking?
I ain't talking shit.
And our slate ain't clean, motherfucker.
Get that other one out.
Let's go.
Go get him.
Get the fuck out.
Come on.
Get your fucking ass...
"Russ...
I'm sorry about the other day.
I know you're looking out for me.
But you gotta understand that I'm different than I was before I left.
And I think that I always will be.
I can't explain how exactly.
My head is just full of stuff and I can't get it out."
Oh, man.
You should have kept better company.
Don't look at me.
Look away.
Fuck you.
Oh, fuck you.
You fucking coward.
I don't care.
I don't care.
Get some shovels.
"But I'm gonna turn things around.
I'm gonna do this one last fight and then I'll be done.
Then I'm gonna shovel asphalt or dig for coal or I'll work with you and Roach at the mill.
I'll do anything.
I'm gonna get things back on track.
I promise.
I love you, man.
I'll see you tomorrow when I get back."
Morning, Russell.
Glad you're home.
Thanks.
I guess you, uh... heard that, uh...
I stopped by to see Lena.
Yeah, I'm aware.
Not why I'm here.
I said...
I think your left rear's gone down.
What shit you talking?
I ain't talking shit.
And our slate ain't clean, motherfucker.
- Turn it off.
- Get that other one out.
We don't need to hear it again.
I've spoken to Jersey State, Bergen County, Fish and Game.
All of them have dealt with this Harlan DeGroat before.
The problem is that the people up in those hills, they don't cooperate.
Getting information from these people is like pulling teeth.
It's a whole 'nother world up in there.
Generations upon generations of these people never even come down off that mountain.
Got their own breed of justice and it does not include us.
Even the local police sent in several squad cars, but they haven't been able to get nothing yet.
So you know that I'm stuck here with my hands tied.
What the fuck does that mean?
That they aren't gonna... do anything about this or look for Rodney?
I did not say that, Russell.
I said that they're having a difficult time and I'm having jurisdiction issues.
But I'm gonna be on it until it's done.
What the fuck?
- Bud.
- I mean, you know...
We know John Petty's dead.
I mean, Jesus, you know, damn near hear him dying on Dan's phone.
But Rodney might still be out there.
I know that this is very hard for you, but...
I do have a procedure that I have to follow.
It sounds like there's no procedure at all.
- Bud!
- No, no, no, no, no.
It sounds like they're not doing a goddamn thing.
Now, either you're all afraid to go in there... or, uh... you just don't give a shit.
- You walking down the wrong road.
I said I'm into it, and I said I'll handle it.
Don't make this personal.
- You need to stay out of my business.
- Stay out of your business.
- Knock it off.
- Stay out of your business.
You know what?
While I was away, it seems that all that you was into was my business.
So that's what this is.
You got a problem with me.
Yeah, I got a problem with you.
I'm not the one who was out drinking and driving.
Got locked up and had to leave his woman alone 'cause of something I did, a mistake I made.
And I don't know nothing about what happened to Rodney.
Nothing at all.
I'm just trying to do my job.
And I'm giving you my word that I'm gonna be on it until it's done.
Until it's done.
Mmm.
Well.
Russell.
Come on.
What is it?
You want me to show you out?
I'll be around.
Dan.
- Where you going now?
- No, it's good.
- Hey, Russ, listen, I'm sorry.
- Hey.
I know how tough this is, but I'm here to help anyway I can.
Then get me an address for DeGroat.
An address?
How am I gonna get that address?
Don't give me that shit, Dan.
You know as well as I do that John Petty has one.
Well, I don't...
I don't know.
Look, I'll see if I can dig that up.
No, no, no, don't see if you can dig it up.
- Do it.
- Russell, listen to me.
If you're smart, you let these boys handle it.
I know these guys.
This DeGroat is a nasty son of a bitch.
You let me worry about... who's a nasty son of a bitch.
We'll follow you.
Damn, looks like John still owes money to these people.
A hell of a lot of money.
I know they had this whole deal, but I didn't realize it was this big.
- What deal?
- Well, this bare-knuckle deal up and down the Appalachians.
I don't know that much about it, but my guess is,
Rodney went up there to fight.
Well, why didn't you just say something to Wesley?
Well, I don't...
I don't know.
I mean, I didn't...
I didn't know what to say.
John should've known better.
I think he did, Red, but Rodney forced his hand.
He thought it was the only way to pay off that debt.
I don't see DeGroat's address, but I do know it's up in the Ramapos.
And, Russell, please hear me when I tell you, you'd be way better off letting the authorities deal with him.
They're not doing such a good job, Dan.
Well, I hear you, but John hated dealing with them.
I'm surprised they haven't come down here to get their money.
Money and drugs, that's the only thing that drove that crazy son of a bitch.
Are you ready for this?
I guess so.
You watch your ass.
Gotta say, fellas, that is sharp.
'66 or '67?
Man, you don't see that Bolero red much.
You got the tuxedo black and ash gold everywhere, but...
Yeah, this is sweet.
Three-ninety-six big block?
Yep.
That's a true 138 SS right there, man.
Fucking rocket ship.
Well, I don't doubt it with that Muncie four speed.
Hmm!
How long to restore it?
A couple years.
A couple years?
Worth it.
You got nitrous?
Nah, nah, just a heavy foot.
Yeah.
You know who's got any candy here?
- What do you mean, "candy?"
- You know what I mean.
Yeah.
You a fucking cop?
Am I a fucking cop?
Do I look like a fucking cop?
Who's the old man in the truck?
Don't worry about him.
He ain't a cop, either.
- What you looking for, man?
- Whatever you got.
You know...
Crank, 20/20's, blue bellies, crystals or pure.
- It don't matter.
- Wow, he knows his shit.
Yeah, we got some buzzard dust, some critty up at the house.
All right.
We'll get you feelin' shitty, my friend.
Good.
All right, I'll follow you?
Yo, it's Tiny.
- You wait right here, all right?
- All right.
All right.
Brought them boys out here looking for some of the train.
Yo, if they got their greenbacks, that's fine.
Come on up.
Who the fuck are you?
I'm just passing through.
I ain't asked you where you were going.
I asked you who you were.
Well, I didn't ask who you were.
We just want to get high, and our money's green.
Well, then you come to the right place.
But I got to say, you got some balls coming up in here, not knowing nobody.
But if your money's green... then it's all good.
That's pure glass.
Fire it up.
Looks good to me.
How much?
Nah, fire that shit up.
It'll blow your balls off, brother.
I told you, I'm good.
How much?
You don't know, um...
Harlan DeGroat, do you?
Is that a joke?
Why would I joke about that?
'Cause this is his house.
He around?
I wouldn't know.
I ain't his babysitter.
All right.
Hey, Red.
Not now.
We'll come by later.
Yo!
You forgot this.
Oh, Shit.
Put your hands where I can see 'em, gentlemen.
Russell Baze?
That's right.
Chief Barnes from the North Braddock Police alerted us early this evening that you were up here.
You're lucky I got here when I did.
If the locals knew why you were here, they'd zip you up and you'd be leaving in a body bag.
Do I need to ask if you're carrying concealed weapons?
No, sir.
- No, sir.
- All right.
Then, given that you're an ex-con, likely carrying concealed weapons, you have a choice.
Either I arrest you now or I follow you to the state line.
With respect, officer, my brother might be up here, and I ain't leaving without him.
I'll only do Chief Barnes a favor once.
You return and I'll arrest you on the spot.
There's nothing you can do from inside a jail cell.
Am I making myself clear, gentlemen?
Yes, sir, you are.
All right.
Then I'll follow you out.
That boy was always troubled.
Ever since he was a little kid.
You could see it in his eyes.
Especially after your mama died.
Hey, Russell.
Wesley.
I just heard from the Jersey police.
They found your brother.
He's dead.
OK.
A hunter's dog dug him up.
Sorry.
They just called me.
The coroner's gonna examine his body.
I suspect that you'll have him back by the weekend.
Place is really hard to locate.
The roads are all mostly trails.
- Let me go talk to him.
- No, no, no.
I got it.
- It's OK.
- Yeah?
You hardly touched your food.
I ate enough.
I appreciate you coming over.
- I wanted to.
- Mmm.
We wanted to.
I'm sorry about Rodney.
I'm really sorry.
He was put through a lot, you know?
And so have you.
But please don't do anything.
OK?
You already tried.
You're lucky you got out of there alive.
Let Wesley handle this.
Let him do his job.
He's a good man, Russell.
- You want me to take it?
- No, I got it.
OK.
We may not have the... the fire and the flame... but we got something good.
You know?
Can we put this behind us?
Yeah.
Yeah.
- Thanks for dinner.
- Mm-hmm.
You ready?
Let's go.
Police!
On the ground!
Harlan DeGroat!
Police!
Get down on the ground!
Get down!
The guy was expecting us.
Ooh, yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
OK.
Every time, it's just...
Forgive me my sins, O Lord.
Forgive me my sins.
The sins of my youth... the sins of my age, the sins of my soul... the sins of my body.
My idle sins... my serious voluntary sins... the sins I know, the sins we have concealed for so long... which are now hidden from my memory.
My Jesus, forget and forgive what we have been.
Amen.
Hey!
Hey, Baze!
Russell!
Come back!
Russell!
What are you doing here, man?
You can't be back here.
Wesley told me not to let anybody back here.
- Give it up, please.
- Dan, where's that ledger?
Huh?
You can't be here.
Where's that ledger, Dan?
Russell, don't do this.
Let him handle it.
- This it?
- Russell, don't.
- You can stay if you want.
- I don't want any part of it.
What?
Harlan DeGroat?
Who wants to know?
I've taken over John Petty's accounts.
- Who's this?
- Listen to me.
I'm willing to settle his debt.
And we can keep this deal going.
Who the fuck is this?
It don't matter.
You come to Braddock... the money's yours.
How the fuck did you get my number?
Who the fuck is this?
Hey, we're closed.
Uh...
Why don't you get your fat fucking ass in the kitchen, fix me up a salmon burger?
See what that bitch has in the register.
What do you say, Dan?
- You look fit.
- Well, thanks.
- Staying out of trouble?
- Yeah, trying.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Yeah.
So, uh...
I hear you might have some money for me.
Who, me?
You, somebody.
No, not me.
No.
Well, do you know where Petty keeps his money?
Uh, no...
Petty, you know, he... he keeps everybody at arm's length.
I just tend bar.
Well, you just tend bar from all the way back here?
- Well, I'm just...
- That's a good trick, Dan.
So let me get this straight.
You don't know where that money is?
I don't know, honest to God, I don't.
I swear to God, I don't know.
- You swear to God?
- Yeah.
Well, if you're invoking a deity over this,
I guess I'm mistaken.
- Yeah.
- Mmm.
A long way to drive, Dan.
Shoot
- I didn't come five hours...
- I don't know!
to not get my fucking money!
Show me where that safe is.
OK, OK!
OK, I'll do it.
OK, all right.
Get that fucker open right now.
Wait, I gotta remember the combination.
- Julie, call 911.
- Wait a sec, I'm trying.
- I just need another number...
- Three.
- ...one more number, wait...
- Two.
Just give me a second so I can remember the numbers!
- Time's up, Dan.
- Wait!
- Open it!
- Wait!
One more number.
Oh, God, thank God.
It's empty.
You kidding me?
Where's my fucking money?
Motherfuckers!
No!
Dan!
Oh, God, Dan.
Got a 216, shots fired.
No suspect information at this time.
You know who I am?
Get up.
Get up.
Keep going.
I'm Rodney Baze's brother.
Yeah.
Tough kid.
You hear those birds?
Don't do it, Russell!
Russell!
Drop your weapon!
Russell!
Drop it!
Walk away!
Drop it, Russell!
Drop it!
Russ!
Just listen to me!
Listen to me, Russell!
Russell!
Let me make this right!
For God's sake.

Oh, he's pulling up on the fucking reins.
Why is he pulling up on the fucking reins?
!
God fucking...
Are you kidding me?
Hey, man, is this...
That was race 8 right there on TV 2?
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
- You looking at it?
- Isn't that what I said?
Are you fucking kidding me?
Man, what are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
- Huh?
What are you doing here?
You playing the ponies now?
Well, I don't know.
Just trying to make a little dough.
Son of a bitch.
What, man?
Gonna give me some shit?
I ain't giving you shit.
I'm just wondering where you're getting the money to bet with.
- Borrowed it.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Who from?
Huh?
- Who from?
- John Petty.
Motherfucker gave me a tip, it didn't pay off.
Well, of course he did.
How much he loan you?
I don't even know.
You don't even know?
You know.
How much?
How much?
1,500.
Fuck me, Rodney.
Where you gonna get that money to pay him back with, huh?
And what else you gonna owe him?
You got a check coming in from somewhere or...?
- No.
- You know, 'cause I ain't got that kind of cash lying around to bail you out.
Well, I didn't ask for you to bail me out.
No.
Don't fuck around with John Petty.
I'm not fucking around with him.
He gave me a fucking tip, it didn't pay off.
Come on, man.
Don't give me this shit.
Hey, uh, tell Dad that, um I'll be by before work tomorrow.
All right.
And, you know, just...
Don't go.
If I could stay, I would.
Then stay.
Leaving you ain't easy, girl.
Or I'll stay.
I'll stay until you get back.
What time do you get off?
Working a double.
- Seriously?
- Yeah.
Russell, you work too much.
Got to bring home the bacon to fatten you up.
You, you little Skinny Minnie.
My Skinny Minnie.
Skinny Minnie.
No, I want you to fatten me up with a baby.
Want to run away somewhere?
Don't change the subject.
I want to run away somewhere.
Let's do it.
- Where?
- I don't know.
I've never been east of Scranton, but...
- I'm gonna fatten you up.
- Stop.
Uncle Red.
Hey, buddy, how are you?
Saw your truck.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, how you doing?
- OK.
- I'm here.
That's why I'm OK.
You're hot.
Your hand's so cold.
- That feel good?
- Yeah.
His fever?
Yeah, it's still high.
Hey, you want to get a drink later?
Yeah.
Where?
John Petty's?
- How's Lena?
- Oh, she's good.
Keeping me in check.
- Big job.
- Yeah.
You know?
Well, give her a hug for me.
You bet, dirty old bastard.
All right, Pops, I got to go to work.
All right.
I'll see you later.
- You'll come back, huh?
- Oh, yeah.
I always come back.
- I love you.
- Me, too.
- Keep your hands warm.
- OK.
Hey, thanks for coming by.
See you, Russ.
I have come here tonight to stand with you, to change America, to restore it's future, to rise to our best ideals and to elect Barack Obama president of the United States.
I'm afraid we're about to lose another Kennedy.
God bless him.
You want another?
No, I'm good.
No, Rodney was supposed to meet me here half hour ago.
Oh, yeah, how is old Rodney?
He seems awfully quiet last few times he was here.
Yeah, he stop-lossed again.
- He's going back next month.
- Ahh...
Those poor sons of guns.
They're holding them against their will.
They're gonna run them into the ground, they're not careful.
Don't get me started.
Well, if he turns up, you tell him I headed home to see Lena?
- Sure.
- All right.
Oh, hey, I got this one.
Whoa, thanks, Dan.
Is, uh...
ls John in?
I just, you know, need to bend his ear.
Uh, he had someone back there earlier, but, uh, I think they might be gone.
- All right if I...
- Yeah.
If I have to come all the way down here again, I swear to God,
I'll gut your fucking ass, cunt.
You hear me, Petty?
You better start following through on your promises.
Oh, you know I can't control some of those fuckers.
For 25 grand, you'd better control them.
I ought to put a piece of lead in your ass
- and take everything in here.
- John, you back here?
Oh, I'm sorry, should I come back later or...?
No, it's OK.
We're finishing up.
Your mama teach you to barge in like that?
You got a problem with me?
I got a problem with everybody.
Who the fuck are they?
Inbred mountain folk from Jersey.
Church ain't over until the snakes are back in the bag,
If you know what I mean?
What are they doing down here?
Don't ask.
- Here.
- Oh, no, I'm good.
Take it.
What's up?
Oh, here.
It's from Rodney.
I know it's not nearly all there.
I hate that you work your ass off to pay his debt.
Rodney needs to watch it.
I like him, Russell, I really do, but I worry that...
Hell, he might be safer over in Iraq.
Well, do you mind not telling him I brought you that, please, and if he don't bring the rest of it,
I will on my next payday.
OK.
I won't say a thing.
All right, thanks.
Cubs lead Pirates 10 to 1 here in the bottom of the 6th.
Chavez off of first base.
Lilly's still looking strong on the mound, and Lilly delivers.
Swinging, there's a drive, deep...
Hey.
Hey, there.
Can you...
Can you...
Can you hear me?
Hey, there, little fella.
Hey, there. ...little fella.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Hey.
Help.
Can you come help?
Come...
You know, I just keep my head down.
Studying shit I should've studied in high school, you know?
- Could be worse.
- How could it be worse?
I don't know.
I could be going to Iraq with you.
No shit.
I asked Lena to come down here.
She said some bullshit about not wanting to see you like this.
- You shouldn't have.
- Oh, fuck that.
She don't like this place.
What are you going to do?
She doesn't like this place?
What, is there someone who likes this place?
Come on, just give her a break.
And what about you?
You still seeing the, uh... uh, woof-woof?
Woof-woof!
Down.
Oh, man, I almost forgot about her.
Thanks a lot.
How's, uh...
How's Dad doing?
- Uh, barely hanging on, really.
- Yeah.
Make sure you give him a big hug from me.
You know?
Yeah, but...
You, uh, watch yourself over there.
OK.
- You, too.
- Yeah.
- Guess I know where to write to you.
- Yeah.
What's up, homey?
You fucking quiet.
You walk the yard, you don't talk to nobody.
Are you a fucking faggot?
Huh, bro?
- Get the fuck away from me.
- You want to suck my dick?
Come here.
Fuck you!
Get him off me, you motherfucker!
Hey!
Break it up!
Get off me, holmes!
Get upstairs!
- Get off me, cabron!
- Shut up!
He was trying to hang on until you got out.
He wanted to see you.
It just ate him up.
You put him next to Mom?
Yeah.
Um...
I'm glad you were home.
How was your last tour?
It was hard.
Yeah?
I mean, this...
You know, the whole thing...
Rodney, whatever you did whatever you did, you had to do.
Yeah.
I got to go-
I love you, bud.
I love you, too, man.
And surely, he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows.
Yet we will esteem him as stricken.
Smitten of God and afflicted.
But he was wounded for our transgressions.
He was bruised for our iniquities.
The chastisement of our peace was upon him.
And with his stripes, we are healed.
Come here!
Man!
Mmm.
How's it feel?
Eh, eh, eh.
Oh!
Look, I'm running, I'm gonna run.
- I'm running.
- Get away!
Go!
- You driving?
- You want to drive?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah?
Come on, motherfucker.
Say goodbye.
Hey, Jerry!
He didn't know who the fuck you were.
Well, it is what it is.
I think you're better off.
Why would you say that?
Come on, man, she left you without even telling you.
Now she's with fucking Wesley?
She's a smart woman.
Got her reasons.
You been hanging with, uh Billy and them lately?
- Nope.
- No?
What you been doing with yourself?
- Looking for a job.
- Any luck?
Nope.
No?
On a liquid dinner?
It's the dinner of champions.
Yeah.
I'll be back.
Oh, Wesley, my lunch.
Bye.
Yeah!
Get your ass up, white boy!
Let's go!
Get your ass up, man!
Come on!
You ain't shit!
Look at you!
Look at you!
Come on, motherfucker!
Come on, man, let's go!
This ain't fucking Iraq.
Let's go, soldier boy.
Get up!
Stop!
Break it up!
Smile, motherfucker!
That's bullshit!
Goddamn it, Rodney.
Did you not hear me?
Did you not hear me?
Motherfucker, I took a hit in there.
I told you I can't really control myself in the middle of a fight, man.
It's all a blur.
And don't fucking poke on me again, either.
No more excuses.
No more Iraqi stories.
You just got to learn how to take a fall because you owe me a lot of fucking money.
Well, I can't pay you back your money by taking a dive in this nickel and dime bullshit.
You'd better figure out something and figure it out quick.
Yeah, let's go fight up in Jersey.
Up in the Ramapos they got fights.
Don't talk to me about that.
It's not for you.
Why?
I heard they're big money.
Look, Rodney, go work in the mill.
Like your father and brother.
This isn't a way for you to make a living.
You're a good kid with a good heart.
You can do a lot worse than living your life like your brother, believe me.
I don't want to work at the fucking mill, man.
I want to be just like you, John.
We'll talk later.
Hey.
Hi.
Where you been?
Out with the boys.
Well, looks like your boys play rough.
Want a drink?
No.
The place looks nice.
Put it up!
Hey.
Let me see your hands.
What?
Let me see your hands.
Rodney, come here.
Let me see your fucking hands.
- Come on, man.
- Huh?
Don't give me no shit.
Is that the best you can do?
What do you think I should do?
What do I think you should do?
I don't know.
Shovel asphalt for the highway department.
Sell fucking shoes.
Come work at the mill.
Come work at the mill.
I told you Roach would give you a job.
No, man, I'd rather be fucking dead.
Fuck the mill.
Fuck the mill.
I work at the mill, you little fucker.
It's good enough for me.
It was good enough for our dad.
The fucking mill killed our dad!
Just don't be...
Hey.
Just don't be too proud to work for a living.
There's nothing wrong with it.
What'd you say?
Nothing wrong with working for a living.
- Working for a living?
- Yeah.
What do you call this, motherfucker?
Is that working for a living, huh?
Is it working for a living when I carried my best friend's legs under this arm, and the rest of him under this arm?
I saw a fucking baby with his fucking head cut off!
I saw a fucking pile of feet in the middle of the street, and I had to clean it up!
I gave my fucking life for this country.
That's not work?
And what's it done for me, huh?
What's it fucking done for me?
!
Fuck you.
Get me that fight up in Ramapo.
I told you not to bring that up again.
I need one last fucking fight, John.
Just give me one good fight, please.
One good fucking fight, please!
That's all I'm asking you.
Can you please do that for me?
No, you gotta trust me when I tell you, you don't want to set foot in those mountains.
What is the big fucking deal?
The big fucking deal?
The big fucking deal is I've dealt with these guys for a long time, and when they don't get what they want, they get nasty.
They get nasty, do they?
- Yeah.
You don't know.
- Yeah?
Well, John, I don't really have a lot of fucking options, man.
I can't fucking catch up doing this small-town shit!
- Calm the fuck down.
- Come the fuck on, man!
- Come on, please!
I'm sorry!
- I'm trying to protect you!
Just fucking call them up, John.
Please?
I'm not doing it, Rodney.
I'm not gonna call them.
Well, I'm not leaving until you do.
- Call them up.
- Rodney...
Just please call them up.
- John, please call them up.
- Rodney...
Please call them up.
I'm asking you for one fight.
Please call them up.
- Please call them up.
- Fuck, Rodney!
You fuck with these inbreds, you'll come crawling back.
If you're lucky.
I don't really want to be doing this.
This is not fucking around.
Let me talk to them.
Let me talk to them.
Yeah?
What the fuck you want, Petty?
March, march, where are my soldiers?
Where are my soldiers?
No... uh-uh!
Come on.
Hey!
We don't want to wake up the neighbors.
You know what?
Let's wake up the neighbors. 1, 2, 3!
So funny!
Oh, my gosh!
Wait a minute!
OK, go, go, go, go, go!
- We're gonna play nice, right?
- Yeah!
What do you want?
You want to race me?
What do you want?
What do you want?
- Racer?
Huh?
- I want to go on the horsey.
- Where are the horsies?
Huh?
- Over there.
Over there.
- Race you over there.
- Yeah.
Lily...
Lily, can you just watch them for one second?
- You're staying at your dad's?
- Yeah.
You know, I'm trying to give it some life.
I went to his funeral.
I know.
Thank you.
That was...
important to me.
Thank you.
Are you back at the mill?
Just can't get enough of it, you know?
I hear they're gonna close it.
Yeah, looks like it.
You know, cheaper to uh, get steel from China.
God, I've missed you so much.
I've missed you so much.
I was hoping that, uh we could work it out.
You know?
The things that were keeping us apart and you know, take that next step is something
I want to do with you.
Because, uh I can't be without you, Lena.
I can't.
I'm pregnant.
OK.
Wow.
Wow.
You, uh...
That's, uh...
That's wonderful news.
It is?
Yeah.
That's wonderful news.
I'm real happy for you, Lena.
I really am.
That's wonderful news.
You're gonna be a hell of a mom.
Wow!
You're gonna be a hell of a mom!
I'm so sorry.
- I have to go.
- Yeah.
OK.
Hey, man!
What about it?
Goddamn, Uncle Red.
- Look like they fed you pretty good.
- Yeah.
You're fit as a racehorse.
How you doing?
Still this side of the grass, you know.
Hey, I got something for your daddy.
I had a feeling that was you.
- You're still raising them?
- Isn't that pretty?
Yeah.
Yeah, when the weather permits.
Say, do you want to come over to the cemetery with me?
Shit, yeah.
Rodney here?
Does he want to come?
Ah, I don't know where he is.
Let me get this shit inside...
- ...run over with you.
- Hey, grab your rifle.
Maybe we can get a shot off before dark.
I saw a real nice 8-point out there the other night.
Yup.
See if I'm still a better shot than you.
Well let's go get us a buck, huh?
We can circle around these.
Seen a feral cat.
DeGroat?
I didn't drive 5 and a half hours to watch you play fucking cards.
Well, when you owe as much as you owe me, Petty...
I guess I'm the last person you want to see.
Step into the room, fighter man.
Let me get a good look at you.
- And what's your name?
- Rodney.
Is that it?
Just Rodney?
Rodney Baze.
Rodney Baze.
Well...
Rodney Baze...
I hear you're quite the crazy fucker in the ring.
Makes me want to jump in there with you and see who walks out.
We're standing so close, I guess we could do it right now.
You gonna be a good boy and take a dive, like Petty said you would?
Or am I gonna have to teach you a lesson?
No, he's good.
He's good.
- Teach me a lesson?
- I gave you our word.
Yeah, teach you a lesson.
Everything's good.
Let me hear you say it.
Teach me a lesson?
Yeah, isn't that what we talked about?
- Is this boy deaf?
- No, no, it's...
You been hit too many times?
Listen, we talked, everything's good.
Hey, yeah.
I like this one.
He's tough.
- And angry.
- Plenty tough.
4-tours-in-Iraq tough.
Now, why the hell you want to come up here and fight, or, hell, anywhere, when you've been fighting over there for so long?
I just need the money, man.
Mmm...
Yeah.
Well... we all need money don't we, Petty?
So why don't me and John discuss this deal while you go put your fight face on.
Didn't we just discuss the deal?
What, you think I was asking?
Hey!
Don't!
Keep your fucking hands off him.
Just checking his reflexes.
You step out.
Step out and we'll...
I'll take care of this.
Step out, Rodney.
I should've popped that motherfucker.
Well, that would be the last motherfucker you ever popped.
Am I supposed to be scared of him 'cause he sucks on a lollipop?
Look at me.
You gotta make this look good.
You can't embarrass DeGroat in front of these guys that he's got coming up.
Well I can't promise to go down for that motherfucker.
Did you hear me?
Did you hear me?
!
- Yeah.
I heard you.
- Good.
Now get your shit and let's get going.
Come on, get ready.
Showtime.
You ain't fighting with that shit on, are you?
It's bare-knuckle up here.
Take 'em off.
Be careful out there.
Keep it going for a little while and then you know what to do.
Look at that beauty.
Clean shot?
Yeah, right in the heart.
Inch either way, we'd be tracking the son of a bitch all night, like the last time, you remember?
- Yeah.
- You see anything?
Not a goddamn thing.
Come on, help me.
Give me a hand with this.
Aah!
Get him!
Come on!
Come on, sucker...
Get off me.
Get up!
Get up!
Rodney!
Rodney!
- Kick his ass!
- Come on, man!
- Just kick his ass!
- Rodney!
Rodney!
Come on, fucker.
Get up.
Get up, motherfucker.
You hear me?
You gotta hit me, make it look real.
Make it look real.
That's it!
That's it!
He's done!
He's done!
I made him stop!
Are you OK?
Hey, you OK?
You done good.
Look at me.
Bud.
Oh, Christ.
You OK?
- Bud, you OK?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Impressive stuff.
All heart and fist.
That boy don't look so good.
Hey, hey, uh, don't...
Don't blow your nose, your eyes will swell up.
Hell, mercy, you took a whooping.
You looked angry out there.
I thought maybe for a second you weren't a good listener.
I was just reacting.
I just lost it a little bit.
Oh, yeah, well, hell, I don't blame you.
I'd done the same thing, guy pounded on me like that.
- Yeah.
- So our slate is clean.
Mmm...
Well, yes, as long as you brought me the rest of my money.
Don't tell me you come all this way and didn't bring me what you owe.
This was it.
Now we're even.
That was the deal.
Oh.
I must've got confused.
Whatever.
You need this?
Here.
Wipe your face.
Last time I'm coming up here, I can tell you that.
Sorry as hell you had to go through that, Rodney.
It's not your fault.
I asked you to take me up here.
It's both of our faults.
But we're through with those Ramapo fuckers.
That crazy son of a bitch can kiss my ass if he thinks I'm doing business with him again.
Strung out fucking tweaker.
Oh, what the fuck?
What the fuck is this?
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
What's the game?
Yeah?
I think your left rear's gone down.
What?
I said I think your left rear's gone down.
What shit you talking?
I ain't talking shit.
And our slate ain't clean, motherfucker.
Get that other one out.
Let's go.
Go get him.
Get the fuck out.
Come on.
Get your fucking ass...
Russ...
I'm sorry about the other day.
I know you're looking out for me.
But you gotta understand that I'm different than I was before I left.
And I think that I always will be.
I can't explain how exactly.
My head is just full of stuff and I can't get it out.
Oh, man.
You should have kept better company.
Don't look at me.
Look away.
Fuck you.
Oh, fuck you.
You fucking coward.
I don't care.
I don't care.
Get some shovels.
But I'm gonna turn things around.
I'm gonna do this one last fight and then I'll be done.
Then I'm gonna shovel asphalt or dig for coal or I'll work with you and Roach at the mill.
I'll do anything.
I'm gonna get things back on track.
I promise.
I love you, man.
I'll see you tomorrow when I get back.
Morning, Russell.
Glad you're home.
Thanks.
I guess you, uh heard that, uh I stopped by to see Lena.
Yeah, I'm aware.
Not why I'm here.
I said...
I think your left rear's gone down.
What shit you talking?
I ain't talking shit.
And our slate ain't clean, motherfucker.
- Turn it off.
- Get that other one out.
We don't need to hear it again.
I've spoken to Jersey State, Bergen County, Fish and Game.
All of them have dealt with this Harlan DeGroat before.
The problem is that the people up in those hills, they don't cooperate.
Getting information from these people is like pulling teeth.
It's a whole another world up in there.
Generations upon generations of these people never even come down off that mountain.
Got their own breed of justice and it does not include us.
Even the local police sent in several squad cars, but they haven't been able to get nothing yet.
So you know that I'm stuck here with my hands tied.
What the fuck does that mean?
That they aren't gonna do anything about this or look for Rodney?
I did not say that, Russell.
I said that they're having a difficult time and I'm having jurisdiction issues.
But I'm gonna be on it until it's done.
What the fuck?
- Bud.
- I mean, you know...
We know John Petty's dead.
I mean, Jesus, you know, damn near hear him dying on Dan's phone.
But Rodney might still be out there.
I know that this is very hard for you, but I do have a procedure that I have to follow.
It sounds like there's no procedure at all.
- Bud!
- No, no, no, no, no.
It sounds like they're not doing a goddamn thing.
Now, either you're all afraid to go in there or, uh...
- ...you just don't give a shit.
- You walking down the wrong road.
I said I'm into it, and I said I'll handle it.
Don't make this personal.
- You need to stay out of my business.
- Stay out of your business.
- Knock it off.
- Stay out of your business.
You know what?
While I was away, it seems that all that you was into was my business.
So that's what this is.
You got a problem with me.
Yeah, I got a problem with you.
I'm not the one who was out drinking and driving.
Got locked up and had to leave his woman alone 'cause of something I did, a mistake I made.
And I don't know nothing about what happened to Rodney.
Nothing at all.
I'm just trying to do my job.
And I'm giving you my word that I'm gonna be on it until it's done.
Until it's done.
Mmm.
Well.
Russell.
Come on.
What is it?
You want me to show you out?
I'll be around.
Dan.
- Where you going now?
- No, it's good.
- Hey, Russ, listen, I'm sorry.
- Hey.
I know how tough this is, but I'm here to help anyway I can.
Then get me an address for DeGroat.
An address?
How am I gonna get that address?
Don't give me that shit, Dan.
You know as well as I do that John Petty has one.
Well, I don't...
I don't know.
Look, I'll see if I can dig that up.
No, no, no, don't see if you can dig it up.
- Do it.
- Russell, listen to me.
If you're smart, you let these boys handle it.
I know these guys.
This DeGroat is a nasty son of a bitch.
You let me worry about who's a nasty son of a bitch.
We'll follow you.
Damn, looks like John still owes money to these people.
A hell of a lot of money.
I know they had this whole deal, but I didn't realize it was this big.
- What deal?
- Well, this bare-knuckle deal up and down the Appalachians.
I don't know that much about it, but my guess is,
Rodney went up there to fight.
Well, why didn't you just say something to Wesley?
Well, I don't...
I don't know.
I mean, I didn't...
I didn't know what to say.
John should've known better.
I think he did, Red, but Rodney forced his hand.
He thought it was the only way to pay off that debt.
I don't see DeGroat's address, but I do know it's up in the Ramapos.
And, Russell, please hear me when I tell you, you'd be way better off letting the authorities deal with him.
They're not doing such a good job, Dan.
Well, I hear you, but John hated dealing with them.
I'm surprised they haven't come down here to get their money.
Money and drugs, that's the only thing that drove that crazy son of a bitch.
Are you ready for this?
I guess so.
You watch your ass.
Gotta say, fellas, that is sharp.
'66 or '67?
Man, you don't see that Bolero red much.
You got the tuxedo black and ash gold everywhere, but...
Yeah, this is sweet.
396 big block?
Yep.
That's a true 138 SS right there, man.
Fucking rocket ship.
Well, I don't doubt it with that Muncie 4 speed.
Hmm!
How long to restore it?
A couple years.
A couple years?
Worth it.
You got nitrous?
Nah, nah, just a heavy foot.
Yeah.
You know who's got any candy here?
- What do you mean, "candy?"
- You know what I mean.
Yeah.
You a fucking cop?
Am I a fucking cop?
Do I look like a fucking cop?
Who's the old man in the truck?
Don't worry about him.
He ain't a cop, either.
- What you looking for, man?
- Whatever you got.
You know...
Crank, 20/20's, blue bellies, crystals or pure.
- It don't matter.
- Wow, he knows his shit.
Yeah, we got some buzzard dust, some cray up at the house.
All right.
We'll get you feelin' shitty, my friend.
Good.
All right, I'll follow you?
Yo, it's Tiny.
- You wait right here, all right?
- All right.
All right.
Brought them boys out here looking for some of the train.
Yo, if they got their greenbacks, that's fine.
Come on up.
Who the fuck are you?
I'm just passing through.
I ain't asked you where you were going.
I asked you who you were.
Well, I didn't ask who you were.
We just want to get high, and our money's green.
Well, then you come to the right place.
But I got to say, you got some balls coming up in here, not knowing nobody.
But if your money's green then it's all good.
That's pure glass.
Fire it up.
Looks good to me.
How much?
Nah, fire that shit up.
It'll blow your balls off, brother.
I told you, I'm good.
How much?
You don't know, um Harlan DeGroat, do you?
Is that a joke?
Why would I joke about that?
'Cause this is his house.
He around?
I wouldn't know.
I ain't his babysitter.
All right.
Hey, Red.
Not now.
We'll come by later.
Yo!
You forgot this.
Oh, shit.
Put your hands where I can see 'em, gentlemen.
Russell Baze?
That's right.
Chief Barnes from the North Braddock Police alerted us early this evening that you were up here.
You're lucky I got here when I did.
If the locals knew why you were here, they'd zip you up and you'd be leaving in a body bag.
Do I need to ask if you're carrying concealed weapons?
No, sir.
- No, sir.
- All right.
Then, given that you're an ex-con, likely carrying concealed weapons, you have a choice.
Either I arrest you now or I follow you to the state line.
With respect, officer, my brother might be up here, and I ain't leaving without him.
I'll only do Chief Barnes a favor once.
You return and I'll arrest you on the spot.
There's nothing you can do from inside a jail cell.
Am I making myself clear, gentlemen?
Yes, sir, you are.
All right.
Then I'll follow you out.
That boy was always troubled.
Ever since he was a little kid.
You could see it in his eyes.
Especially after your mama died.
Hey, Russell.
Wesley.
I just heard from the Jersey police.
They found your brother.
He's dead.
OK.
A hunter's dog dug him up.
Sorry.
They just called me.
The coroner's gonna examine his body.
I suspect that you'll have him back by the weekend.
Place is really hard to locate.
The roads are all mostly trails.
- Let me go talk to him.
- No, no, no.
I got it.
- It's OK.
- Yeah?
You hardly touched your food.
I ate enough.
I appreciate you coming over.
- I wanted to.
- Mmm.
We wanted to.
I'm sorry about Rodney.
I'm really sorry.
He was put through a lot, you know?
And so have you.
But please don't do anything.
OK?
You already tried.
You're lucky you got out of there alive.
Let Wesley handle this.
Let him do his job.
He's a good man, Russell.
- You want me to take it?
- No, I got it.
OK.
We may not have the the fire and the flame but we got something good.
You know?
Can we put this behind us?
Yeah.
Yeah.
- Thanks for dinner.
- Mm-hmm.
You ready?
Let's go.
Police!
On the ground!
Harlan DeGroat!
Police!
Get down on the ground!
Get down!
The guy was expecting us.
Ooh, yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
OK.
Every time, it's just...
Forgive me my sins, O Lord.
Forgive me my sins.
The sins of my youth... the sins of my age, the sins of my soul the sins of my body.
My idle sins my serious voluntary sins the sins I know, the sins we have concealed for so long which are now hidden from my memory.
My Jesus, forget and forgive what we have been.
Amen.
Hey!
Hey, Baze!
Russell!
Come back!
Russell!
What are you doing here, man?
You can't be back here.
Wesley told me not to let anybody back here.
- Give it up, please.
- Dan, where's that ledger?
Huh?
You can't be here.
Where's that ledger, Dan?
Russell, don't do this.
Let him handle it.
- This it?
- Russell, don't.
- You can stay if you want.
- I don't want any part of it.
What?
Harlan DeGroat?
Who wants to know?
I've taken over John Petty's accounts.
- Who's this?
- Listen to me.
I'm willing to settle his debt.
And we can keep this deal going.
Who the fuck is this?
It don't matter.
You come to Braddock the money's yours.
How the fuck did you get my number?
Who the fuck is this?
Hey, we're closed.
Uh...
Why don't you get your fat fucking ass in the kitchen, fix me up a salmon burger?
See what that bitch has in the register.
What do you say, Dan?
- You look fit.
- Well, thanks.
- Staying out of trouble?
- Yeah, trying.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Yeah.
So, uh I hear you might have some money for me.
Who, me?
You, somebody.
No, not me.
No.
Well, do you know where Petty keeps his money?
Uh, no...
Petty, you know, he he keeps everybody at arm's length.
I just tend bar.
Well, you just tend bar from all the way back here?
- Well, I'm just...
- That's a good trick, Dan.
So let me get this straight.
You don't know where that money is?
I don't know, honest to God, I don't.
I swear to God, I don't know.
- You swear to God?
- Yeah.
Well, if you're invoking a deity over this,
I guess I'm mistaken.
- Yeah.
- Mmm.
A long way to drive, Dan.
Shoot
- I didn't come 5 hours...
- I don't know!
...to not get my fucking money!
Show me where that safe is.
OK, OK!
OK, I'll do it.
OK, all right.
Get that fucker open right now.
Wait, I gotta remember the combination.
- Julie, call 911.
- Wait a sec, I'm trying.
- I just need another number...
- Three.
- ...one more number, wait...
- Two.
Just give me a second so I can remember the numbers!
- Time's up, Dan.
- Wait!
- Open it!
- Wait!
One more number.
Oh, God, thank God.
It's empty.
You kidding me?
Where's my fucking money?
Motherfuckers!
No!
Dan!
Oh, God, Dan.
Got a 216, shots fired.
No suspect information at this time.
You know who I am?
Get up.
Get up.
Keep going.
I'm Rodney Baze's brother.
Yeah.
Tough kid.
You hear those birds?
Don't do it, Russell!
Russell!
Drop your weapon!
Russell!
Drop it!
Walk away!
Drop it, Russell!
Drop it!
Russ!
Just listen to me!
Listen to me, Russell!
Russell!
Let me make this right!
For God's sake.

Why is he pulling up on the fucking reins?
!
God fucking...
Are you kidding me?
Hey, man, is this...
That was race eight right there on TV two?
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
- You looking at it?
- Isn't that what I said?
Are you fucking kidding me?
Man, what are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
- Huh?
What are you doing here?
You playing the ponies now?
Well, I don't know.
Just trying to make a little dough.
Son of a bitch.
What, man?
Gonna give me some shit?
I ain't giving you shit.
I'm just wondering where you're getting the money to bet with.
- Borrowed it.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Who from?
Huh?
- Who from?
- John Petty.
Motherfucker gave me a tip, it didn't pay off.
Well, of course he did.
How much he loan you?
I don't even know.
You don't even know?
You know.
How much?
How much?
Fifteen hundred.
Fuck me, Rodney.
Where you gonna get that money to pay him back with, huh?
And what else you gonna owe him?
You got a check coming in from somewhere or...?
- No.
- You know, 'cause I ain't got that kind of cash lying around to bail you out.
Well, I didn't ask for you to bail me out.
No.
Don't fuck around with John Petty.
I'm not fucking around with him.
He gave me a fucking tip, it didn't pay off.
Come on, man.
Don't give me this shit.
Hey, uh, tell Dad that, um...
I'll be by before work tomorrow.
All right.
And, you know, just...
Don't go.
If I could stay, I would.
Then stay.
Leaving you ain't easy, girl.
Or I'll stay.
I'll stay until you get back.
What time do you get off?
Working a double.
- Seriously?
- Yeah.
Russell, you work too much.
Got to bring home the bacon to fatten you up.
You, you little Skinny Minnie.
My Skinny Minnie.
Skinny Minnie.
No, I want you to fatten me up with a baby.
Want to run away somewhere?
Don't change the subject.
I want to run away somewhere.
Let's do it.
- Where?
- I don't know.
I've never been east of Scranton, but...
- I'm gonna fatten you up.
- Stop.
Uncle Red.
Hey, buddy, how are you?
Saw your truck.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, how you doing?
- OK.
- I'm here.
That's why I'm OK.
You're hot.
Your hand's so cold.
- That feel good?
- Yeah.
His fever?
Yeah, it's Still high.
Hey, you want to get a drink later?
Yeah.
Where?
John Petty's?
- How's Lena?
- Oh, she's good.
Keeping me in check.
- Big job.
- Yeah.
You know?
Well, give her a hug for me.
You bet, dirty old bastard.
All right, Pops, I got to go to work.
All right.
I'll see you later.
- You'll come back, huh?
- Oh, yeah.
I always come back.
- I love you.
- Me, too.
- Keep your hands warm.
- OK.
Hey, thanks for coming by.
See you, Russ.
I have come here tonight to stand with you, to change America, to restore its future, to rise to our best ideals and to elect Barack Obama president of the United States.
I'm afraid we're about to lose another Kennedy.
God bless him.
You want another?
No, I'm good.
No, Rodney was supposed to meet me here half hour ago.
Oh, yeah, how is old Rodney?
He seems awfully quiet last few times he was here.
Yeah, he stop-lossed again.
- He's going back next month.
- Ahh...
Those poor sons of guns.
They're holding them against their will.
They're gonna run them into the ground, they're not careful.
Don't get me started.
Well, if he turns up, you tell him I headed home to see Lena?
- Sure.
- All right.
Oh, hey, I got this one.
Whoa, thanks, Dan.
Is, uh...
Is John in?
I just, you know, need to bend his ear.
Uh, he had someone back there earlier, but, uh, I think they might be gone.
- All right if I...
- Yeah.
If I have to come all the way down here again, I swear to God,
I'll gut your fucking ass, cunt.
You hear me, Petty?
You better start following through on your promises.
Oh, you know I can't control some of those fuckers.
For 25 grand, you'd better control them.
I ought to put a piece of lead in your ass
- and take everything in here.
- John, you back here?
Oh, I'm sorry, should I come back later or...?
No, it's OK.
We're finishing up.
Your mama teach you to barge in like that?
You got a problem with me?
I got a problem with everybody.
Who the fuck are they?
Inbred mountain folk from Jersey.
Church ain't over until the snakes are back in the bag, know what I mean?
What are they doing down here?
Don't ask.
- Here.
- Oh, no, I'm good.
Take it.
What's up?
Oh, here.
It's from Rodney.
I know it's not nearly all there.
I hate that you work your ass off to pay his debt.
Rodney needs to watch it.
I like him, Russell, I really do, but I worry that...
Hell, he might be safer over in Iraq.
Well, do you mind not telling him I brought you that, please, and if he don't bring the rest of it,
I will on my next payday.
OK.
I won't say a thing.
All right, thanks.
Cubs lead Pirates ten to one in the bottom of the sixth.
Chavez off of first base.
Lilly's still looking strong on the mound, and Lilly delivers.
Swinging, there's a drive, deep...
Hey.
Hey, there.
Can you...
Can you...
Can you hear me?
Hey, there, little fella.
Hey, there. little fella.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Hey.
Help.
Can you come help?
Come...
You know, I just keep my head down.
Studying shit I should've studied in high school, you know?
- Could be worse.
- How could it be worse?
I don't know.
I could be going to Iraq with you.
No shit.
I asked Lena to come down here.
She said some bullshit about not wanting to see you like this.
- You shouldn't have.
- Oh, fuck that.
She don't like this place.
What are you going to do?
She doesn't like this place?
What, is there someone who likes this place?
Come on, just give her a break.
And what about you?
You still seeing the, uh... uh, woof-woof?
Woof-woof!
Down.
Oh, man, I almost forgot about her.
Thanks a lot.
How's, uh...
How's Dad doing?
- Uh, barely hanging on, really.
- Yeah.
Make sure you give him a big hug from me.
You know?
Yeah, but...
You, uh, watch yourself over there.
OK.
- You, too.
- Yeah.
- Guess I know where to write to you.
- Yeah.
What's up, homey?
You fucking quiet.
You walk the yard, you don't talk to nobody.
Are you a fucking faggot?
Huh, bro?
- Get the fuck away from me.
- You want to suck my dick?
Come here.
Fuck you!
Get him off me, you motherfucker!
Hey!
Break it up!
Get off me, holmes!
Get upstairs!
- Get off me, cabron!
- Shut up!
He was trying to hang on until you got out.
He wanted to see you.
It just ate him up.
You put him next to Mom?
Yeah.
Um...
I'm glad you were home.
How was your last tour?
It was hard.
Yeah?
I mean, this...
You know, the whole thing...
Rodney, whatever you did... whatever you did, you had to do.
Yeah.
I got to go.
I love you, bud.
I love you, too, man.
And surely, he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows.
Yet we will esteem him as stricken.
Smitten of God and afflicted.
But he was wounded for our transgressions.
He was bruised for our iniquities.
The chastisement of our peace was upon him.
And with his stripes, we are healed.
Come here!
Man!
Mmm.
How's it feel?
Eh, eh, eh.
Oh!
Look, I'm running, I'm gonna run.
- I'm running.
- Get away!
Go!
- You driving?
- You want to drive?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah?
Come on, motherfucker.
Say good-bye.
Hey, Jerry!
He didn't know who the fuck you were.
Well, it is what it is.
I think you're better off.
Why would you say that?
Come on, man, she left you without even telling you.
Now she's with fucking Wesley?
She's a smart woman.
Got her reasons.
You been hanging with, uh...
Billy and them lately?
- Nope.
- No?
What you been doing with yourself?
- Looking for a job.
- Any luck?
- Nope.
- No?
On a liquid dinner?
It's the dinner of champions.
Yeah.
I'll be back.
Oh, Wesley, my lunch.
Bye.
Yeah!
Get your ass up, white boy!
Let's go!
Get your ass up, man!
Come on!
You ain't shit!
Look at you!
Look at you!
Come on, motherfucker!
Come on, man, let's go!
This ain't fucking Iraq.
Let's go, soldier boy.
Get up!
Stop!
Break it up!
Smile, motherfucker!
That's bullshit!
Goddamn it, Rodney.
Did you not hear me?
Did you not hear me?
Motherfucker, I took a hit in there.
I told you I can't really control myself in the middle of a fight, man.
It's all a blur.
And don't fucking poke on me again, either.
No more excuses.
No more Iraqi stories.
You just got to learn how to take a fall because you owe me a lot of fucking money.
Well, I can't pay you back your money by taking a dive in this nickel and dime bullshit.
You'd better figure out something and figure it out quick.
Yeah, let's go fight up in Jersey.
Up in the Ramapos they got fights.
Don't talk to me about that.
It's not for you.
Why?
I heard they're big money.
Look, Rodney, go work in the mill.
Like your father and brother.
This isn't a way for you to make a living.
You're a good kid with a good heart.
You can do a lot worse than living your life like your brother, believe me.
I don't want to work at the fucking mill, man.
I want to be just like you, John.
We'll talk later.
Hey.
Hi.
Where you been?
Out with the boys.
Well, looks like... your boys play rough.
Want a drink?
No.
The place looks nice.
Put it up!
Hey.
Let me see your hands.
What?
Let me see your hands.
Rodney, come here.
Let me see your fucking hands.
- Come on, man.
- Huh?
Don't give me no shit.
Is that the best you can do?
What do you think I should do?
I don't know.
Shovel asphalt for the highway department.
Sell fucking shoes.
Come work at the mill.
Come work at the mill.
I told you Roach would give you a job.
No, man, I'd rather be fucking dead.
Fuck the mill.
Fuck the mill.
I work at the mill, you little fucker.
It's good enough for me.
It was good enough for our dad.
The fucking mill killed our dad!
Just don't be...
Hey.
Just don't be too proud to work for a living.
There's nothing wrong with it.
What'd you say?
Nothing wrong with working for a living.
- Working for a living?
- Yeah.
What do you call this, motherfucker?
Is that working for a living, huh?
Is it working for a living when I carried my best friend's legs under this arm, and the rest of him under this arm?
I saw a fucking baby with his fucking head cut off!
I saw a fucking pile of feet in the middle of the street, and I had to clean it up!
I gave my fucking life for this country.
That's not work?
And what's it done for me, huh?
What's it fucking done for me?
!
Fuck you.
Get me that fight up in Ramapo.
I told you not to bring that up again.
I need one last fucking fight, John.
Just give me one good fight, please.
One good fucking fight, please!
That's all I'm asking you.
Can you please do that for me?
No, you gotta trust me when I tell you, you don't want to set foot in those mountains.
What is the big fucking deal?
The big fucking deal?
The big fucking deal is I've dealt with these guys for a long time, and when they don't get what they want, they get nasty.
They get nasty, do they?
- Yeah.
You don't know.
- Yeah?
Well, John, I don't really have a lot of fucking options, man.
I can't fucking catch up doing this small-town shit!
- Calm the fuck down.
- Come the fuck on, man!
- Come on, please!
I'm sorry!
- I'm trying to protect you!
Just fucking call them up, John.
Please?
I'm not doing it, Rodney.
I'm not gonna call them.
Well, I'm not leaving until you do.
- Call them up.
- Rodney...
Just please call them up.
- John, please call them up.
- Rodney...
Please call them up.
I'm asking you for one fight.
Please call them up.
- Please call them up.
- Fuck, Rodney!
You fuck with these inbreds, you'll come crawling back.
If you're lucky.
I don't really want to be doing this.
This is not fucking around.
Let me talk to them.
Let me talk to them.
Yeah?
What the fuck you want, Petty?
March, march, where are my soldiers?
Where are my soldiers?
No... uh-uh!
Come on.
Hey!
We don't want to wake up the neighbors.
You know what?
Let's wake up the neighbors.
One, two, three!
So funny!
Oh, my gosh!
Wait a minute!
OK, go, go, go, go, go!
- We're gonna play nice, right?
- Yeah!
What do you want?
You want to race me?
What do you want?
What do you want?
- Racer?
Huh?
- I want to go on the horsey.
- Where are the horsies?
Huh?
- Over there.
Over there.
- Race you over there.
- Yeah.
Lily...
Lily, can you just watch them for one second?
- You're staying at your dad's?
- Yeah.
You know, I'm trying to give it some life.
I went to his funeral.
I know.
Thank you.
That was...
important to me.
Thank you.
Are you back at the mill?
Just can't get enough of it, you know?
I hear they're gonna close it.
Yeah, looks like it.
You know, cheaper to... uh, get steel from China.
God, I've missed you so much.
I've missed you so much.
I was hoping that, uh... we could work it out.
You know?
The things that were keeping us apart and... you know, take that next step is something
I want to do with you.
Because, uh...
I can't be without you, Lena.
I can't.
I'm pregnant.
OK.
Wow.
Wow.
You, uh...
That's, uh...
That's wonderful news.
It is?
Yeah.
That's wonderful news.
I'm real happy for you, Lena.
I really am.
That's wonderful news.
You're gonna be a hell of a mom.
Wow!
You're gonna be a hell of a mom!
I'm so sorry.
- I have to go.
- Yeah.
OK.
Hey, man!
What about it?
Goddamn, Uncle Red.
- Look like they fed you pretty good.
- Yeah.
You're fit as a racehorse.
How you doing?
Still this side of the grass, you know.
Hey, I got something for your daddy.
I had a feeling that was you.
- You're still raising them?
- Isn't that pretty?
Yeah.
Yeah, when the weather permits.
Say, do you want to come over to the cemetery with me?
Shit, yeah.
Rodney here?
Does he want to come?
Ah, I don't know where he is.
Let me get this shit inside... run over with you.
- Hey, grab your rifle.
Maybe we can get a shot off before dark.
I saw a real nice eight-point out there the other night.
Yup.
See if I'm still a better shot than you.
Well... let's go get us a buck, huh?
We can circle around these.
Seen a feral cat.
DeGroat?
I didn't drive five and a half hours to watch you play fucking cards.
Well, when you owe as much as you owe me, Petty...
I guess I'm the last person you want to see.
Step into the room, fighter man.
Let me get a good look at you.
- And what's your name?
- Rodney.
Is that it?
Just Rodney?
Rodney Baze.
Rodney Baze.
Well...
Rodney Baze...
I hear you're quite the crazy fucker in the ring.
Makes me want to jump in there with you... and see who walks out.
We're standing so close, I guess we could do it right now.
You gonna be a good boy and take a dive, like Petty said you would?
Or am I gonna have to teach you a lesson?
No, he's good.
He's good.
- Teach me a lesson?
- I gave you our word.
Yeah, teach you a lesson.
Everything's good.
Let me hear you say it.
Teach me a lesson?
Yeah, isn't that what we talked about?
- Is this boy deaf?
- No, no, it's...
You been hit too many times?
Listen, we talked, everything's good.
Hey, yeah.
I like this one.
He's tough.
- And angry.
- Plenty tough.
Four-tours-in-Iraq tough.
Now, why the hell you want to come up here and fight, or, hell, anywhere, when you've been fighting over there for so long?
I just need the money, man.
Mmm...
Yeah.
Well... we all need money... don't we, Petty?
So... why don't me and John discuss this deal while you go put your fight face on.
Didn't we just discuss the deal?
What, you think I was asking?
Hey!
Don't!
Keep your fucking hands off him.
Just checking his reflexes.
You step out.
Step out and we'll...
I'll take care of this.
Step out, Rodney.
I should've popped that motherfucker.
Well, that would be the last motherfucker you ever popped.
Am I supposed to be scared of him 'cause he sucks on a lollipop?
Look at me.
You gotta make this look good.
You can't embarrass DeGroat in front of these guys that he's got coming up.
Well...
I can't promise to go down for that motherfucker.
Did you hear me?
Did you hear me?
!
- Yeah.
I heard you.
- Good.
Now get your shit and let's get going.
Come on, get ready.
Showtime.
You ain't fighting with that shit on, are you?
It's bare-knuckle up here.
Take 'em off.
Be careful out there.
Keep it going for a little while and then you know what to do.
Look at that beauty.
Clean shot?
Yeah, right in the heart.
Inch either way, we'd be tracking the son of a bitch all night, like the last time, you remember?
- Yeah.
- You see anything?
Not a goddamn thing.
Come on, help me.
Give me a hand with this.
Aah!
Get him!
Come on!
Come on, sucker...
Get off me.
Get up!
Get up!
Rodney!
Rodney!
- Kick his ass!
- Come on, man!
- Just kick his ass!
- Rodney!
Rodney!
Come on, fucker.
Get up.
Get up, motherfucker.
You hear me?
You gotta hit me, make it look real.
Make it look real.
That's it!
That's it!
He's done!
He's done!
I made him stop!
Are you OK?
Hey, you OK?
You done good.
Look at me.
Bud.
Oh, Christ.
You OK?
- Bud, you OK?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Impressive stuff.
All heart and fist.
That boy don't look so good.
Hey, hey, uh, don't...
Don't blow your nose, your eyes will... swell up.
Hell, mercy, you took a whooping.
You looked angry out there.
I thought maybe... for a second you weren't a good listener.
I was just reacting.
I just lost it a little bit.
Oh, yeah, well, hell, I don't blame you.
I'd done the same thing, guy pounded on me like that.
- Yeah.
- So our slate is clean.
Mmm...
Well, yes, as long as you brought me the rest of my money.
Don't tell me you come all this way and didn't bring me what you owe.
This was it.
Now we're even.
That was the deal.
Oh.
I must've got confused.
Whatever.
You need this?
Here.
Wipe your face.
Last time I'm coming up here, I can tell you that.
Sorry as hell you had to go through that, Rodney.
It's not your fault.
I asked you to take me up here.
It's both of our faults.
But we're through with those Ramapo fuckers.
That crazy son of a bitch can kiss my ass if he thinks I'm doing business with him again.
Strung out fucking tweaker.
Oh, what the fuck?
What the fuck is this?
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
What's the game?
Yeah?
I think your left rear's gone down.
What?
I said...
I think your left rear's gone down.
What shit you talking?
I ain't talking shit.
And our slate ain't clean, motherfucker.
Get that other one out.
Let's go.
Go get him.
Get the fuck out.
Come on.
Get your fucking ass...
"Russ...
I'm sorry about the other day.
I know you're looking out for me.
But you gotta understand that I'm different than I was before I left.
And I think that I always will be.
I can't explain how exactly.
My head is just full of stuff and I can't get it out."
Oh, man.
You should have kept better company.
Don't look at me.
Look away.
Fuck you.
Oh, fuck you.
You fucking coward.
I don't care.
I don't care.
Get some shovels.
"But I'm gonna turn things around.
I'm gonna do this one last fight and then I'll be done.
Then I'm gonna shovel asphalt or dig for coal or I'll work with you and Roach at the mill.
I'll do anything.
I'm gonna get things back on track.
I promise.
I love you, man.
I'll see you tomorrow when I get back."
Morning, Russell.
Glad you're home.
Thanks.
I guess you, uh... heard that, uh...
I stopped by to see Lena.
Yeah, I'm aware.
Not why I'm here.
I said...
I think your left rear's gone down.
What shit you talking?
I ain't talking shit.
And our slate ain't clean, motherfucker.
- Turn it off.
- Get that other one out.
We don't need to hear it again.
I've spoken to Jersey State, Bergen County, Fish and Game.
All of them have dealt with this Harlan DeGroat before.
The problem is that the people up in those hills, they don't cooperate.
Getting information from these people is like pulling teeth.
It's a whole 'nother world up in there.
Generations upon generations of these people never even come down off that mountain.
Got their own breed of justice and it does not include us.
Even the local police sent in several squad cars, but they haven't been able to get nothing yet.
So you know that I'm stuck here with my hands tied.
What the fuck does that mean?
That they aren't gonna... do anything about this or look for Rodney?
I did not say that, Russell.
I said that they're having a difficult time and I'm having jurisdiction issues.
But I'm gonna be on it until it's done.
What the fuck?
- Bud.
- I mean, you know...
We know John Petty's dead.
I mean, Jesus, you know, damn near hear him dying on Dan's phone.
But Rodney might still be out there.
I know that this is very hard for you, but...
I do have a procedure that I have to follow.
It sounds like there's no procedure at all.
- Bud!
- No, no, no, no, no.
It sounds like they're not doing a goddamn thing.
Now, either you're all afraid to go in there... or, uh... you just don't give a shit.
- You walking down the wrong road.
I said I'm into it, and I said I'll handle it.
Don't make this personal.
- You need to stay out of my business.
- Stay out of your business.
- Knock it off.
- Stay out of your business.
You know what?
While I was away, it seems that all that you was into was my business.
So that's what this is.
You got a problem with me.
Yeah, I got a problem with you.
I'm not the one who was out drinking and driving.
Got locked up and had to leave his woman alone 'cause of something I did, a mistake I made.
And I don't know nothing about what happened to Rodney.
Nothing at all.
I'm just trying to do my job.
And I'm giving you my word that I'm gonna be on it until it's done.
Until it's done.
Mmm.
Well.
Russell.
Come on.
What is it?
You want me to show you out?
I'll be around.
Dan.
- Where you going now?
- No, it's good.
- Hey, Russ, listen, I'm sorry.
- Hey.
I know how tough this is, but I'm here to help anyway I can.
Then get me an address for DeGroat.
An address?
How am I gonna get that address?
Don't give me that shit, Dan.
You know as well as I do that John Petty has one.
Well, I don't...
I don't know.
Look, I'll see if I can dig that up.
No, no, no, don't see if you can dig it up.
- Do it.
- Russell, listen to me.
If you're smart, you let these boys handle it.
I know these guys.
This DeGroat is a nasty son of a bitch.
You let me worry about... who's a nasty son of a bitch.
We'll follow you.
Damn, looks like John still owes money to these people.
A hell of a lot of money.
I know they had this whole deal, but I didn't realize it was this big.
- What deal?
- Well, this bare-knuckle deal up and down the Appalachians.
I don't know that much about it, but my guess is,
Rodney went up there to fight.
Well, why didn't you just say something to Wesley?
Well, I don't...
I don't know.
I mean, I didn't...
I didn't know what to say.
John should've known better.
I think he did, Red, but Rodney forced his hand.
He thought it was the only way to pay off that debt.
I don't see DeGroat's address, but I do know it's up in the Ramapos.
And, Russell, please hear me when I tell you, you'd be way better off letting the authorities deal with him.
They're not doing such a good job, Dan.
Well, I hear you, but John hated dealing with them.
I'm surprised they haven't come down here to get their money.
Money and drugs, that's the only thing that drove that crazy son of a bitch.
Are you ready for this?
I guess so.
You watch your ass.
Gotta say, fellas, that is sharp.
'66 or '67?
Man, you don't see that Bolero red much.
You got the tuxedo black and ash gold everywhere, but...
Yeah, this is sweet.
Three-ninety-six big block?
Yep.
That's a true 138 SS right there, man.
Fucking rocket ship.
Well, I don't doubt it with that Muncie four speed.
Hmm!
How long to restore it?
A couple years.
A couple years?
Worth it.
You got nitrous?
Nah, nah, just a heavy foot.
Yeah.
You know who's got any candy here?
- What do you mean, "candy?"
- You know what I mean.
Yeah.
You a fucking cop?
Am I a fucking cop?
Do I look like a fucking cop?
Who's the old man in the truck?
Don't worry about him.
He ain't a cop, either.
- What you looking for, man?
- Whatever you got.
You know...
Crank, 20/20's, blue bellies, crystals or pure.
- It don't matter.
- Wow, he knows his shit.
Yeah, we got some buzzard dust, some critty up at the house.
All right.
We'll get you feelin' shitty, my friend.
Good.
All right, I'll follow you?
Yo, it's Tiny.
- You wait right here, all right?
- All right.
All right.
Brought them boys out here looking for some of the train.
Yo, if they got their greenbacks, that's fine.
Come on up.
Who the fuck are you?
I'm just passing through.
I ain't asked you where you were going.
I asked you who you were.
Well, I didn't ask who you were.
We just want to get high, and our money's green.
Well, then you come to the right place.
But I got to say, you got some balls coming up in here, not knowing nobody.
But if your money's green... then it's all good.
That's pure glass.
Fire it up.
Looks good to me.
How much?
Nah, fire that shit up.
It'll blow your balls off, brother.
I told you, I'm good.
How much?
You don't know, um...
Harlan DeGroat, do you?
Is that a joke?
Why would I joke about that?
'Cause this is his house.
He around?
I wouldn't know.
I ain't his babysitter.
All right.
Hey, Red.
Not now.
We'll come by later.
Yo!
You forgot this.
Oh, Shit.
Put your hands where I can see 'em, gentlemen.
Russell Baze?
That's right.
Chief Barnes from the North Braddock Police alerted us early this evening that you were up here.
You're lucky I got here when I did.
If the locals knew why you were here, they'd zip you up and you'd be leaving in a body bag.
Do I need to ask if you're carrying concealed weapons?
No, sir.
- No, sir.
- All right.
Then, given that you're an ex-con, likely carrying concealed weapons, you have a choice.
Either I arrest you now or I follow you to the state line.
With respect, officer, my brother might be up here, and I ain't leaving without him.
I'll only do Chief Barnes a favor once.
You return and I'll arrest you on the spot.
There's nothing you can do from inside a jail cell.
Am I making myself clear, gentlemen?
Yes, sir, you are.
All right.
Then I'll follow you out.
That boy was always troubled.
Ever since he was a little kid.
You could see it in his eyes.
Especially after your mama died.
Hey, Russell.
Wesley.
I just heard from the Jersey police.
They found your brother.
He's dead.
OK.
A hunter's dog dug him up.
Sorry.
They just called me.
The coroner's gonna examine his body.
I suspect that you'll have him back by the weekend.
Place is really hard to locate.
The roads are all mostly trails.
- Let me go talk to him.
- No, no, no.
I got it.
- It's OK.
- Yeah?
You hardly touched your food.
I ate enough.
I appreciate you coming over.
- I wanted to.
- Mmm.
We wanted to.
I'm sorry about Rodney.
I'm really sorry.
He was put through a lot, you know?
And so have you.
But please don't do anything.
OK?
You already tried.
You're lucky you got out of there alive.
Let Wesley handle this.
Let him do his job.
He's a good man, Russell.
- You want me to take it?
- No, I got it.
OK.
We may not have the... the fire and the flame... but we got something good.
You know?
Can we put this behind us?
Yeah.
Yeah.
- Thanks for dinner.
- Mm-hmm.
You ready?
Let's go.
Police!
On the ground!
Harlan DeGroat!
Police!
Get down on the ground!
Get down!
The guy was expecting us.
Ooh, yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
OK.
Every time, it's just...
Forgive me my sins, O Lord.
Forgive me my sins.
The sins of my youth... the sins of my age, the sins of my soul... the sins of my body.
My idle sins... my serious voluntary sins... the sins I know, the sins we have concealed for so long... which are now hidden from my memory.
My Jesus, forget and forgive what we have been.
Amen.
Hey!
Hey, Baze!
Russell!
Come back!
Russell!
What are you doing here, man?
You can't be back here.
Wesley told me not to let anybody back here.
- Give it up, please.
- Dan, where's that ledger?
Huh?
You can't be here.
Where's that ledger, Dan?
Russell, don't do this.
Let him handle it.
- This it?
- Russell, don't.
- You can stay if you want.
- I don't want any part of it.
What?
Harlan DeGroat?
Who wants to know?
I've taken over John Petty's accounts.
- Who's this?
- Listen to me.
I'm willing to settle his debt.
And we can keep this deal going.
Who the fuck is this?
It don't matter.
You come to Braddock... the money's yours.
How the fuck did you get my number?
Who the fuck is this?
Hey, we're closed.
Uh...
Why don't you get your fat fucking ass in the kitchen, fix me up a salmon burger?
See what that bitch has in the register.
What do you say, Dan?
- You look fit.
- Well, thanks.
- Staying out of trouble?
- Yeah, trying.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Yeah.
So, uh...
I hear you might have some money for me.
Who, me?
You, somebody.
No, not me.
No.
Well, do you know where Petty keeps his money?
Uh, no...
Petty, you know, he... he keeps everybody at arm's length.
I just tend bar.
Well, you just tend bar from all the way back here?
- Well, I'm just...
- That's a good trick, Dan.
So let me get this straight.
You don't know where that money is?
I don't know, honest to God, I don't.
I swear to God, I don't know.
- You swear to God?
- Yeah.
Well, if you're invoking a deity over this,
I guess I'm mistaken.
- Yeah.
- Mmm.
A long way to drive, Dan.
Shoot
- I didn't come five hours...
- I don't know!
to not get my fucking money!
Show me where that safe is.
OK, OK!
OK, I'll do it.
OK, all right.
Get that fucker open right now.
Wait, I gotta remember the combination.
- Julie, call 911.
- Wait a sec, I'm trying.
- I just need another number...
- Three.
- ...one more number, wait...
- Two.
Just give me a second so I can remember the numbers!
- Time's up, Dan.
- Wait!
- Open it!
- Wait!
One more number.
Oh, God, thank God.
It's empty.
You kidding me?
Where's my fucking money?
Motherfuckers!
No!
Dan!
Oh, God, Dan.
Got a 216, shots fired.
No suspect information at this time.
You know who I am?
Get up.
Get up.
Keep going.
I'm Rodney Baze's brother.
Yeah.
Tough kid.
You hear those birds?
Don't do it, Russell!
Russell!
Drop your weapon!
Russell!
Drop it!
Walk away!
Drop it, Russell!
Drop it!
Russ!
Just listen to me!
Listen to me, Russell!
Russell!
Let me make this right!

I tell you about the kid, you had to push me out of the way and take it all for yourself?
That little mission we're planning, it's happening tonight.
This little piggy went "wee wee wee" all the way home.
The access codes to the stolen funds of Barry's 57 million?
We have it.
Get down! They won't hurt him.
How do you know that?
We used to work for the people that have him, until she tried to have us cleaned.
What is it with this kid?
Everyone wants a piece of him.
Without Tyler, there's no money.
I don't think he knows anything.
His brain is like a bank safety deposit box is and you need the right key.
I have that key.
This.
Well, that would seem that I have the bank vault.
So you're suggesting another deal?
Tomorrow morning, 9 a.m., room 111, Sierra Palona.
You screw this up, I will gut you like a pig.
Let's...
Let's do this.
How predictable.
Hang tight while I do a sweep of the room.
Wanna go first? You're up, Poindexter.
Do you mind?
Please.
Come on, kid.
Let's go crack open that beautiful mind of yours.
Hey, son.
Come here!
Dad!
Ha-ha-ha!
Thattaboy!
Oh, how nice.
A Kodak moment.
Can we please get the fuck on with this?
All right, you ready?
Ready for what?
Come one.
come on, let's go.
No.
Come on, let's go.
No!
No, no, no!
Tyler.
One, one, one!
Tyler.
Too many ones!
Too many ones!
Tyler!
One, one, one!
What's going on?
I'd like to know the same thing.
Can you control your child?
He won't go in the room.
I can goddamn see that.
Why?
Shit!
It's the consecutive numbers.
He freaks out in rooms with three consecutive numbers.
Oh, for the love of Christ.
Just relax, relax.
I'll get us another room, all right?
I'll go with you.
Yes.
Make it quick.
You stay with me.
Back in a second, okay?
You stay here.
Hurry up.
Too many ones!
Behave , else I will rip your head off.
I'm not kidding.
Good boy.
Try or say anything apart from "I want another room,"
and I'll snap your neck like a dry twig.
I'd like another room.
Something wrong with the one you got?
Please, just give me another room.
Any one will do.
What's the number of the room you're gonna give me?
One-fifteen, that all right with you, your majesty?
That's fine.
That's fine.
Thanks.
Take a photo, mister.
Can we please just get this over with now?
My thoughts exactly.
What the hell is that?
That's the trigger.
We learned at an early age, that Tyler was able to remember anything, no matter how complicated, especially numbers.
We'd play a certain piece of music while he was scanning.
Once he'd finish we'd stop the music.
But Tyler was never able to remember a thing unless--
You played the right music.
Hmm.
So he really had no idea what we wanted from him.
None at all.
And once I play this, it will all come out, and once it does, that part of his memory will be erased and he'll never be able to recite it again.
That's actually very impressive.
So no one could have access to his mind or the money.
Not without the right song.
Ready, son? Old MacDonald had a farm E-I-E-I-O What the hell? You dirty fucking bitch!
Oh.
Well, that's no way to talk to a lady.
I ought to wash your mouth out with soap.
I'd like to see you try.
Well, I'd like to give it a try.
Come on, handsome.
Ooh! You want some more?
Ah, this is gonna be fun.
Heh.
And a nay-nay there
Here a nay, There a nay Everywhere a nay nay
Moo moo here Moo moo there
Here a moo, there a moo Everywhere a moo moo
Oink oink here
For God's sake, what's going on, Barry?
It's been a nice warm-up, Where's the main act?
Come on.
Come on!
Go!
I don't want to play!
No, this is not how it's meant to work!
Maybe 'cause he's already been activated.
Goddamn it!
Once he's recited it, that part of his memory is erased, isn't that what you said?
We already sung him that song.
You fucking lied to me.
Language, Barry.
There's a kid present.
Hey, Tyler.
Hi, Veronica!
This whole room swap thing was a set-up.
She knew the kid was gonna react that way the whole time.
It's called "bonding," Mother.
Maybe one day, you'll get what that means.
And just where exactly is your other half? Wait, wait, wait!
Aah!
Let's go.
You're a goddamn psycho.
now you're just trying to get in my pants.
Come on, V.
Darling, you know it doesn't have to end like this.
Think of everything we've been through.
Think of every thing I've done for you
Firstly, don't call me V.
Secondly, you kind of lost any goodwill once you tried to have us killed.
By the way, what's up with your faithful little monkey?
You look like you put on some weight.
Oh, shit.
Tyler!
Get down! Mommy!
Oh, Tyler! What the hell is going on out there?
It's a goddamn massacre.
Ha-ha-ha!
But I saved him, baby.
I saved our boy.
Look at us, we're together again.
The family.
The Maddens!
Ha, ha!
They have it, Eileen.
The girls have it.
The codes, the passwords...
to all the money!
We just have to wait till they kill each other, and then we're gonna go grab it! Look, I-I-I-- I know I--
I've been an ass, I know, a horrible ass.
but I-I'll make it up to you, I promise.
I'll make amends, to you and to the boy.
I-I promise.
Hear that?
That's the sound of $57 million.
Ours for the taking.
Ours!
Baby, you see that office over there?
Uh huh.
I want you to go in there.
I want you to shut the door, and cover your ears, okay?
Okay, go on.
Oh, really?
Really?
You want to have this out now?
For God's sakes, woman, clean out your ears!
I-I said I'm sorry.
You did, Barry, and I did hear you.
The thing is...
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I'm just not listening.
Have you lost your mind?
They say "Payback's a bitch."
I guess I'm the bitch, baby.
Jesus!
Eileen!
We can work this out.
I-I promise.
Just like the promises you made on our wedding day?
Do you remember those?
Do you remember our vows, Barry?
I can now only recall one right now... No!
"Till death do us part." Get up.
Okay, ready?
Naughty, naughty, naughty boy! Mother...?
Mother! Retirement... it's not what it's cracked up to be...
[PANTING]
Why'd she wanna kill us?
She's the scorpion... and we're just her frogs.
It was in her nature.
Don't take this personally.
It was just business.
And in this biz, when you're gonna walk away, you can't leave any tracks.
That's all we were to her?
A couple of boot stains in the dirt?
It's all we ever are.
She would have tried to kill me too.
She was a scorpion.
So why do you look so sad?
Because she's all I had.
Now I'm just a...
samurai without a master.
Truce? I guess not.
My whole career, I never got shot.
I meet you girls...
twice.
If you stick around, I can't promise you it will be the last.
Okay, okay, move in.
Okay.
I think the money belongs to you.
I think it belongs to all of us.
Roxie, get the car.
We gotta hightail it out of here.
Eileen, you go with them.
If you stick around, the FBI's gonna give you hell, and you've been through enough.
Thank you, Agent Barnes.
Bye, Tyler.
What are you doing?
Um...
I think I'm dying.
Might seem normal to you, but to me, it's a little premature.
You're not gonna die.
Good, you should know.
You're an expert when it comes to death.
Don't make me say it.
Say what?
I told you not to make me say it.
I literally don't know what you're talking about.
I want you to come with us.
That's what I thought you'd say.
Don't, asshole.
Ow!
I'm dying here, remember?
Listen, someone has to stick around here, clean up this mess.
Why are you doing this?
Maybe 'cause I'm...too noble.
But listen, if I do keep my job, I'll be able to track you down using all the resources of the United States government.
Hmm, yeah?
They have a paranormal division?
Yeah, 'cause you're a ghost.
Well, I'll see you on the other side.
Yeah.
Go! We got a live one here! So, all this is the result of your so-called heroics?
Yeah, I'm a one-man band.
You have a lot of explaining to do, Agent Barnes.
And I will, just as soon as this fine gentleman put this egg back together again.
I'm so fucked.
So you're telling me that the guy in the reception is escaped fugitive Barry Madden.
Yes, sir.
And the dead guy in Room 111 is... still unknown?
Yes, sir.
As is... this one here?
Yes, sir.
Was a body removed from here?
No sir, nothing's been tampered with.
All waiting for you.
So whose blood is that? Subs ripped by = Jorpp3 =
HI-subs removed
Ryuko.
Bite me!
What the hell is going on?
too?
I-I have no idea what you mean.
I dare you!
See?
Here's you and Mohawk Man in the corner of this picture!
T-That's not— I asked Mataro to track him down!
That kid has connections all over this town.
And he found pictures of a guy who looked like him drinking.
It also explains why he brought me to your place.
so tell me what your deal is!
the bond between you and Senketsu has grown stronger.
His name is Tsumugu Kinagase.
he's a member of my organization. you and Senketsu have become true partners! it was necessary to put you through a trial by fire so that you could defeat her.
All that crap was you trying real hard wasn't it?
!
I knew it!
That bastard tried to kill Senketsu!
Who are you people?
!
I thought you were fighting against the Kiryuins!
Didn't you say that you'd need Senketsu to do that?
anyway?
What was my dad researching?
!
Don't get so angry.
I'll tell you everything.
I'm tired of hearing that excuse from you!
Nudist Beach.
Huh?
We're Nudist Beach.
Are you nuts?
It's the name of our organization.
Nudist Beach!
Forget it.
It was stupid of me to try to get a straight answer out of you.
Ryuko?
I get it!
I'll keep fighting and keep growing stronger.
right?
But that really is our name.
it worked out in the end.
EPISODE 6 DON'T TOY ME ON A WHIM
SEWING CLUB RESEARCH LAB UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT
Okay.
Load the Life Fibers into the vault.
SEWING CLUB PRESIDENT SHIRO IORI
I wonder what Lady Satsuki is going to do with so many Life Fibers?
Mass production of Goku Uniforms.
What else could they be for?
LIFE FIBER
But every time we've proposed increasing the number she was the one who shot it down.
Because prioritizing the quantity of club presidents has a very real risk of lowering the overall quality.
Lady Satsuki was worried about that.
she decided that we needed to increase the number of club presidents.
I guess this means that Ryuko Matoi's arrival set things into motion in a big way.
even the Anti-Uniform Guerilla showed up the other day.
And the clincher is the fact that Lady Satsuki has donned a Kamui herself.
There are two people who can wear a uniform that's 100% Life Fibers and make it work...
I can't believe it.
Wow!
There's something that not even Information
Chair Inumuta can believe?
It's one unbelievable thing after another here.
That's what makes this academy so fascinating.
I see.
I came here because I heard that I'd be able to cut loose.
That Matoi is worthy of my full attention.
Sanageyama.
Have you forgotten Lady Satsuki's order that the Elite
Four were to do nothing but watch?
Oh?
Did she really say that?
isn't it?
Milady.
Don't worry.
This is the path I chose.
Soroi.
Milady.
Sanageyama?
Not at all. you could easily kill me with just that teacup.
then?
Let me fight Matoi.
Why?
Need you even ask?
I believe you know perfectly well what happens when I see someone powerful.
then?
SUSUKIGAHARA
eh?
This will make it clear whether or not Satsuki Kiryuin is worthy to lead us.
then.
Northern Kanto Gang Leader Alliance Representative!
NORTHERN KANTO GANG LEADER ALLIANCE REPRESENTATIVE UZU SANAGEYAMA (THIRD YEAR MIDDLE SCHOOL) picking a fight with me!
I have no intention of fighting.

I'm telling you to surrender.
Who do you think you're messing with?
!
huh?
Impressive.
But that won't work on me!
I've seen through your moves!
You're mine!
You think you've snuck up behind me?
Come.
I'll provide you with the ultimate stage where you can unleash your strength the stage called Honnouji Academy.
My bamboo sword is itching to test out the skills of this girl who's infiltrated the stage you've provided for me.
I assume?
Not to worry.
I have these eyes.
I can't possibly lose.
Nicely blocked.
I would manage to win in a fight against your middle-school self now.
That was the way you moved three years ago.
I assume you were holding back.
As you wish.
See what you can do.
I appreciate it.
treat me to tea or something.
Soroi.
though I do find it a shame.
This was your favorite cup.
Make a fresh pot for me.
Milady.
you have reached the
Honnouji Academy Student Council President's Office.
ma'am.
It is Mistress Ragyo.
This is Satsuki.

That wild monkey beat us to the punch.
I would've taken her out first.
Where is Lady Satsuki?
She has stepped out.
She said this battle was not worth watching.
What's that mean?
Matoi.
I was called out by name by one of the Elite Four.
could I?
I like your spirit!
Let's get right to it!

Say what?
!
there is a preparatory motion.
ORBICULARIS OCULI
Of the eyes.
Of the muscles.
DORSAL INTEROSSEOUS / ADDUCTOR POLLICIS
Sanageyama instantly reads all of those preparatory motions
PECTORALIS MAJOR
GLUTEUS MAXIMUS and preempts any move his opponent makes.
That is what the Tengantsu does.
And his Goku Uniform succeeds magnificently in amplifying that ability.
hasn't he?
Is that what Lady Satsuki meant when she said this fight was not worth watching?
But—
I didn't hear it that way at all.
Ryuko!
but it's all I can do to deflect all these strikes!
I'm impressed!
But let's see... how you handle... this!
Shinsoku-Senbonzuki!
too!
Even your Scissor Blade that can slice a Goku
Uniform to pieces is worthless if it can't hit its target!
is it over already?
don't you think?
That's more like it!
Senketsu.
I need you to do me a favor.
eh?
Ryuko!
You're mine!
T-They won't come off!
M-My eyes!
Now!
Finishing Move:
Sen-I-Soshitsu!
SEN-I-SOSHITSU (FIBER LOST)
dear.
He went and lost.
It would appear that this is what Lady Satsuki meant.
Ryuko!
You beat one of the Elite Four already!
You're amazing!
And so fast!
And so awesome!
Yeah!
This isn't over yet!
Matoi!
Sanageyama!
You have disgraced the Elite Four!
One who relies overly on a single skill will huh?
MANKANSHOKU BACK-ALLEY CLINIC
that hits the spot.
That feels good?
irons are wonderful. and my Life Fibers line up one by one.
I'm glad my plan for you to blind Sanageyama worked.
I'll have you know.
Sorry about that.
Don't worry about it.
I wouldn't be enjoying this pleasant ironing.
True.
too.
Be thorough about it.
you know that?
Ryuko's mumbling to her uniform again.
I think it's fine.
Who's there?
!
I have a favor to ask you.
How was your mother's mood?
I explained to her why I took out Junketsu.
Soroi.
Sanageyama.
I was overconfident in my eyesight.
Give me another chance!
I'll defeat Matoi for certain next time!
Pathetic.
I don't need subordinates who lack resolve.
Resolve I have!
Here is the proof!

I've covered up every last eye you've got!
Now you can't use your Tengantsu!
Ryuko!
His eyes are shut!
I want you to sew my eyes shut.
you'd lose your Tengantsu!
That's all right.
It was my overconfidence that made me lose.
I won't be able to beat Matoi!
This is the resolve of a man who has realized the error of his ways and sacrificed everything!
Matoi!
Here I come.
What's this intimidating aura?
Men (Head)!
Dou (Body)!
Kote (Wrist)!
crap!
These aren't the moves of someone with no eyes!
Matoi?
Say what?

Your breathing.
The smell of your sweat.
I can see the inner workings of your mind as clear as day.
far more clearly than I could with my eyes!

It was the result of your power outstripping that of the Goku Uniform's.
ma'am.
you got lucky this time.
That was a close call.
I guess the Honnouji Elite Four aren't all show.
That dude was seriously tough.
But I can't run away from this.
I have to learn the secret behind Dad's death!
I swapped out the Life Fibers in your Goku Uniform and restitched it.
It should be able to keep up with even your movements now.
Sanageyama?
Front and behind mean nothing to me now.
I can now sense the world in its entirety.
I only came to thank you for giving me a fresh start.
Wait.
We had an agreement.
Let's have tea.
but I'll pass.

EPISODE 7 A LOSER I CAN'T HATE
And later today the President will stop by the "Let's Multiply" award ceremony to hand out trophies to the nation's brightest young female mathematicians and scientists.
And that's all I've got for you.
I'd say that was a pretty painless briefing.
Marshall.
- Yeah.
Does the White House have any comment on Skip Gilchrist's podcast?
I'm sorry, I thought you said Skip had a podcast.
Oh, that is what I said.
Skip has a podcast.
Oh.
Oh, Skip's-Skip's podcast.
I forgot about it for a second because it's so not a big deal.
I mean, of course, we know about it.
Otherwise, it might be like a political ticking time bomb.
So, if you'll excuse me.
Welcome back, Skipaholics, to the official podcast of the Gilchrist White House.
Now, what I'm about to say, may sound controversial.
Ah, (Bleep).
It's an honor to have you in my classroom.
Well, it is a parent-teacher conference, and I am a parent.
I know, but the First Lady, right in front of me.
I'm sorry, I promised myself that I would be professional, but O.M.G., I love you, so much.
Like a sister, or brother, not sexual.
How is Marigold doing?
I'm actually very concerned about her.
I'm here.
I'm here, sorry.
What are you doing here?
O.M.G., this is amazing.
The First Lady and America's favorite pregnant teen.
Oh, I'm actually 22, and sorry I'm late.
But somebody forgot to tell me this conference was happening.
'Cause somebody isn't a parent and it's not a sister-teacher conference.
That's what it was before I went off to college.
Then I took over.
And suddenly there's a crisis that requires an emergency meeting with Marigold's teacher.
I bet you banter like this all the time.
The rat-a-tat-tats, the bon mots.
Ooh!
Why don't we talk about Marigold?
Yes, of course.
I am very concerned.
What is it?
Is she underperforming?
Quite the opposite.
Marigold is so bright and she recently qualified to take honors algebra in the fall.
And you're concerned because...
She's choosing to take regular algebra instead.
I know this must be especially troubling to the co-founders of "let's multiply."
Big fan!
Big fan!
Well, I hear you and I am on this.
I also hear you and I am also on this.
To a slightly greater degree that a parent would be.
A step-parent.
- Still hearing "parent."
Do you mind?
Scooch in.
What?
Oh, oh, no, could we not...
Smile.
And... tweet.
Hey.
Becca's at a doctor appointment, so I wanted to talk to you about the parent-teacher conference.
Why does it matter where Becca is?
It doesn't.
Um, Mr. Norgel said you didn't want to take honors algebra, for some reason.
That's what this is about.
Marigold, it is a parent's job to give her child ground to stand on and wings to fly.
Honors algebra is those wings.
Are those wings?
Is?
What are you saying?
What am I saying?
You need to take honors algebra.
You may think you can't handle it, but you definitely can.
You are so smart.
Okay.
Really?
Wow.
I had more, but wings worked.
It's just that I wasn't going to take honors algebra because it's at the same time as photography.
Photography?
Yeah, it just seems so cool and I kind of wanted to try it.
Plus, I'm already taking a bunch of other honors classes.
Marigold, that excuse...
Is totally reasonable.
It's nice to see you explore new interests.
If you really want to take photography, you should take it.
Photography shall be your wings.
Thanks, Emily.
I'm really not getting the wings thing though.
Oh, it's a total dud.
Just, let's finish that hug.
Why would God make forests so big if he wasn't trying to hide something?
The Yeti must exist.
The Yeti must exist.
By the way, I'd like to say Konichiwa to all of my friends in Japan just waking up right now.
It's tomorrow there.
Skip, we've got to talk.
Oh, good news, everybody:
We've got a special guest who's not just me changing my voice a little bit.
It's America's favorite press secretary, Marshall Malloy.
No, no, no, no, Skip, I came here to shut down this podcast.
What?
Why?
Because we can't just have your unfiltered ramblings representing the views of your father's administration.
All right, just sit down here and let's discuss this while I record it.
Skip, I am not coming on your podcast.
Come on, Marshall.
Please, just do it.
Just do it, man.
I'll make it the last one.
I could really use you to goose my ratings.
This could really put me over the top in the urban market.
That means black.
Please, Marshall.
Okay, fine.
I will answer a couple of questions so long as this is your last episode.
Talk into this mic.
And we're back.
My guest is Marshall Malloy.
SKIP (Recording): ♪ Live from the Lincoln bedroom.♪
It's Skip Gilchrist.
Boom.
Oh, boy.
Photography?
What, was finger painting full?
Marigold and I had a really good talk.
And we arrived at the right decision for her.
You got played, Emily.
I most certainly did not.
She explained her newfound passion for photography and her desire to balance it against a challenging course load.
You got played.
We shouldn't force her.
Maybe she doesn't like math.
Nobody likes math.
I don't even like math and I love it.
Well, you sound insane.
Emily, of course Marigold is going to choose the easier thing.
That's what kids do.
And you know all those smart kids she used to hang out with?
Well, they are gone; poof.
But that's okay because the kids in regular algebra will teach her how to smoke.
She wants to take photography.
It's okay to let her follow her bliss.
Bliss...
That's a good stripper name.
Maybe she could use that.
Hey, guys.
Just having a little snack attack.
Dad, you agree that Marigold has to aim high, right?
Yeah, sure.
But you also agree that it's important for her to explore her interests.
How did I get myself surrounded?
I'm a marine.
Look, I don't want to get in the middle of this.
You both love Marigold.
I love Marigold...
Is that Marigold over there?
No, not biting?
Dad, what's it going to be?
Pick a side.
- Why?
You're both making such incredible points.
And whoever loses,
Marigold wins.
I am Dale Gilchrist, and I approve this message.
You know what, Emily, if photography is Marigold's passion, then that's what she should pursue.
I'm fine with it.
I'm so not fine with it.
So, then I opened the briefcase, and it's filled with croissants, but the joke is on me because the French ambassador ate my talking points for breakfast.
Delightful.
If you're just joining us, my guest is Marshall Malloy;
our topic:
Life.
Skip, this is actually really fun.
Man, I-I've been working for your father for 12 years, and this is the first time anybody has ask me a question about me.
Tell us about those early years.
A young person of color, struggling on the gritty streets of...
Lake Tahoe.
- Uh-huh.
Right out of high school I started interning for your dad and he has kept me busy ever since.
Fascinating.
Take us there.
Well, your dad was a congressman, and one of my first tasks was writing letters on his behalf.
You've opened the door, now pull back the curtain.
Well, congressman are extremely busy.
So, they'll often have staffers write their correspondence and then sign their letters with an auto-pen.
Robot pens.
Are they sentient?
Can they be defeated?
As you know, swords are useless against them.
Moving on.
Marshall, I'd love to hear your impressions of a young Skip Gilchrist.
Oh, if I recall, the summer I started interning you were 13 years old and you were having a hard time at summer camp.
Your dad said that you were just miserable.
Oh, my gosh, I'll never forget that summer.
The only thing rougher than the toilet paper was the response to my one-man performance of Oliver!
I did not consider myself at home.
But then my dad wrote me the most amazing letter.
It really made me feel...
A ton better.
Skip, is something wrong?
Oh, right.
Marshall...
Letter...
Dad.
Hold the phone.
- Skip...
Marshall, hold the damn phone.
Did you write personal letters for my dad?
Hey, Skip, you want to talk about area 51?
As a matter of fact, let's just go there.
We'll take the transporter, which, as you suspected, totally exists.
Wait, wait, what's that?
Julie Chen and Lucy Liu both want to go?
I'll never forget the day my dad sent me this letter at camp.
It was like he reached inside my rib cage and gave me a pat on the heart.
And at the end of it he wrote, "Skip, I'm proud of you."
And you kept it, that's great.
- I kept it because that was the only time my dad ever said he was proud of me.
The one time.
Marshall, did you write this letter?
Skip, I can't remember if...
Did you write this letter?
!
- Yes.
We'll be right back.
And we are back with the Marhsall Malloy who's destroyed my childhood.
Skip, I wasn't trying to destroy anything.
I was just doing my job.
"And, so, Skip, no matter how many swirlies you get,
"or how many times they push you off the pier
"into the cold, uncaring water of Lake Minikani, know that you are never truly alone."
Now that is some good stuff that your father should have written you himself.
Again, really sorry.
Sorry isn't enough, Marshall.
My dad entrusted my spiritual well-being...
Nay, the very molding of my character... to an employee.
Well, an intern.
Uh, uh, and we'll be right back with the best of Skip.
Behold, Marigold, an hour from now this room will be filled with the greatest minds in math and science.
They'll receive trophies and accolades and a peanut-free lunch.
You're wasting your time.
Emily already told me I don't have to take honors algebra.
I'm not hear to tell you you have to take it.
I am here to show you that you want to take it.
Now, meet Kayla.
She's who you could be one day.
Take me to your leader.
Who is also your father.
Nope.
- I'm just kidding.
It's nice to meet you.
I thought you two might hang out.
Talk about all the cool stuff you're into and how for Kayla, that's math.
And bugs.
Oh, Kayla, shut up.
Marigold, wait.
If you're trying to bribe me, at least introduce me to somebody cool or famous or something.
- Fine!
Not that I'm trying to bribe you, but who would it take to impress-slash-bribe you?
Or do you maybe want to hang out with Kayla more?
She's pretty cool.
So she said, "there's no e-to-the-pi-I in team."
And I said, "stop being negative."
Yeah, maybe we should just talk cash.
Dark times here at the Gilchrist White House.
My dad never said he was proud of me.
What else is a lie?
Maybe he doesn't think I look like a young Joe Namath.
Maybe that's not a fat mirror in the master bath.
Xander, how do you deal with the fact that dad's never said he's proud of you?
He told me last week.
You tried to bribe her?
I succeeded in bribing her.
All we have to do is get Hope solo.
We need her at the White House by 4:00, after which Marigold will take honors algebra.
Now, Hope is in Mexico City today, so we may need
Air Force One...
You look angry.
I can't believe you went behind my back.
Well, only after you failed...
I waited for you to fail first.
Everything okay?
Hell no.
- Absolutely not.
Great.
Let's hand out some awards.
Today, we are celebrating the achievements of 20 bright, talented young women, who thankfully had parents who pushed them to do their best in math and science...
- Subjects which happen to capture their passion.
The key ingredient to success, whether it's the sciences or...
Let's say photography.
Well, photography probably isn't the best example since it's something you can master by downloading a 99-cent app.
There's no app for Pythagoras, girls.
It's actually called a calculator.
- The point is ask yourself, is my passion worthy of my passion?
And if your passion is photography, then the answer is no.
Your family gives some really weird speeches.
Yeah, they're fighting about me, but they're not exactly fighting about me.
I get it... my mom and dad give me grief all the time.
Really?
- Mm-hmm.
You kind of seem like the perfect kid.
I burn things.
Nobody grows up and ends up saying,
"oh, I'm so glad I took all that math."
I do, every day.
My point is trophies are great, but you can't take them with you when you die.
The Egyptians did.
And now, instead of this, uh, please welcome the President of the United States.
Thank you, Emily.
Thank you, Becca.
Wow.
What do you say after all that?
You girls have done great work on your projects.
I'm so proud of all of you.
Oh, really?
Huh.
You don't say.
You're proud of a bunch of little girls you don't even know.
How neat.
- Is he supposed to speak, too?
That's a mistake.
I'm on it.
- Hey, dad.
Is this a Q and A 'cause boy, do I have a Q for your A.
Ladies and gentlemen, do not believe a word this man says because chances are he didn't make up any of those words himself.
For President Dale Gilchrist is an outsourcer of fatherly love.
Oh!
Let's multiply, huh?
The only thing being multiplied here are lies!
Skip.
It won't rip.
We need to wrap it up now.
Give me this.
Why won't it rip?
- Just give me...
All right, there are a lot of fires to put out.
Let's do this.
Marshall, Skip is upset about that letter situation.
How can we contain it?
Actually, sir, he wants you to apologize on his podcast.
He says you're a "get."
Fine.
- And he's also demanding two bags of potato chips and if the word "baked" appears anywhere on the packaging he will quote, "go bo-nanners."
Moving on.
Emily, Becca, that was a real debacle back there.
You two need to figure this out.
She's letting Marigold squander her future.
She needs to understand who the parent is here.
All right, maybe it's time you two had a third party weigh in.
You know, someone to listen in who cares about both of you.
Yes, I think maybe we're there.
I agreed more quickly but did not verbalize it.
Great.
Marshall is your man.
- What?
You really screwed me with this podcast thing, so good luck, kid.
Hey, Xander.
- You got the stuff?
Yeah, uh, chips, yeah.
Here you go.
These check out.
Bring him in.
Listen, Skip, I'm really sorry...
Bup, bup, bup.
Don't tell it to me.
Tell it to the people.
With me now for the next four hours,
President Dale Gilchrist.
And that is why Marigold should have the freedom to follow her passion.
- Except she needs discipline.
Hey, I didn't interrupt you.
Actually I have a 30-second rebuttal here.
Actually this debate is over.
What?
- I have a life outside of this place...
I'm in a kickball league.
Okay, then who won the debate?
Yup, yup, I'm gonna choose a winner.
Who won, Marshall?
- All right, fine.
Although it was difficult, the winner is...
Hi, guys.
So, remember that algebra thing?
Sure.
- Uh, yeah, rings a bell.
Well, it turns out I can take both that and photography.
I had read the schedule wrong.
So, see you.
So, who would've won?
Me, right?
- Seriously?
You want me to rule on an already-resolved middle school scheduling issue?
Absolutely.
- Yes.
All right, fine...
I'm a little short on time, so you'll have to imagine me saying "with all due respect"
before most of this.
Becca, you are not the parent here.
Although you may have helped raise Marigold in the past, it was petty of you to undercut
Emily's authority.
And you, you are the First Lady of the United States of America, and you just told a group of math students that math sucks.
You both acted like children in front of the children who you were supposed to be inspiring.
So, the point is nobody won.
You both lost.
With all due respect.
You wrote a fake letter to Skip.
Yeah, nice fake letter, Marshall.
I'm going to kickball.
You hungry?
I could eat.
Next question, Mr. President.
Dad, may I call you dad?
-Of course.
Name your favorite movie, and as a follow up, compare and contrast it to Goonies, unless, of course, it is Goonies, in which case you are correct.
Skip, I know why I'm here...
Let's get to it.
Let's.
Name me one time that you were actually proud of me.
Commando...
My favorite movie is Commando.
Marshall.
- He may have a point.
We do fight all the time.
- It's not good.
How about this?
How about we each say something that we could do to make our relationship better.
Yes, good.
- Okay.
Well, for me as a parent,
I could be less threatened by you and more confident about my role in our family.
I'm gonna be a horrible mom.
Oh, I'm not sure you understood the rules.
What are you talking about?
You're gonna be a great mom.
Would a great mom bribe her child to take math while crapping all over her artistic impulses?
I mean, who's a great mom?
Oh, God, my motherly instincts suck.
Come on, this is about us.
We were both trying to do what was best and let's face it, we're both very opinionated.
And ambitious, and assertive, and smart and we don't suffer fools.
So... so you're saying that we fight all the time because we're both...
- Fantastic, yeah.
So don't worry about your mom skills.
You already helped raise Xander and Marigold.
And Skip.
Now I'm gonna help you.
Thanks, Emily.
Yeah.
Or should I say Nana?
No...no, no, no, no.
Dad, just answer the question.
All right, fine.
You want to know some times when I was proud of you?
The t-ball championship when you were eight.
The time you were Kenickie in Grease.
And your set at that open mic last year.
But, dad, my strikeout lost us the t-ball championship,
I fell off the stage in Grease, and I fell off the stage again at that open mic.
How do you strikeout in t-ball?
Xander.
- Those were all failures.
How could be proud of me for those?
You might get knocked down but you get right back up.
So, why don't you ever say it?
I'm sorry, I'm just not one of those dads who goes around saying,
"I'm proud of you" all the time.
But that doesn't mean that I don't believe in you, because
I do.
I guess that makes sense.
You know, this whole letter thing reminded me of something.
A letter that you wrote to me from camp that summer about how you refused to quit even though the camp was tough and those kids were mean.
I can't believe you remember that letter.
I didn't just remember it.
I kept it.
Dad?
This is a podcast, please describe what's happening here.
The President is staring at me as though he's puzzled and slightly impatient which is surely the top note, but underneath that is a new era in our relationship that can only be consummated with a hug.
I'm moving in...
Xander, cue the music.
No, no.
I am now hugging the President.
He is slowly and reluctantly putting his arms around me.
He's patting me one, two, three times.
Oh!
What's that I'm detecting?
A slight stroking of his hand.
He's now pulling away.
He's now trying to get out of the hug.
Uh, good luck with that, dad.
Skip, Skip, please.
Shh!
Don't struggle.
What a moment.
Thank you for listening. sync for WEB-DL by Id0x0
And later today the President will stop by the "Let's Multiply" award ceremony to hand out trophies to the nation's brightest young female mathematicians and scientists.
And that's all I've got for you.
I'd say that was a pretty painless briefing.
- Marshall.
- Yeah.
Does the White House have any comment on Skip Gilchrist's podcast?
I'm sorry, I thought you said Skip had a podcast.
Oh, that is what I said.
Skip has a podcast.
Oh.
Oh, Skip's-Skip's podcast.
I forgot about it for a second because it's so not a big deal.
I mean, of course, we know about it.
Otherwise, it might be like a political ticking time bomb.
So, if you'll excuse me.
(Reporters murmuring)
SKIP:
Welcome back, Skipaholics, to the official podcast of the Gilchrist White House.
Now, what I'm about to say, may sound controversial.
Ah, (Bleep).
It's an honor to have you in my classroom.
Well, it is a parent-teacher conference, and I am a parent.
I know, but the First Lady, right in front of me.
I'm sorry, I promised myself that I would be professional, but O.M.G., I love you, so much.
Like a sister, or brother, not sexual.
How is Marigold doing?
I'm actually very concerned about her.
I'm here.
I'm here, sorry.
What are you doing here?
O.M.G., this is amazing.
The First Lady and America's favorite pregnant teen.
Oh, I'm actually 22, and sorry I'm late.
But somebody forgot to tell me this conference was happening.
'Cause somebody isn't a parent and it's not a sister-teacher conference.
That's what it was before I went off to college.
Then I took over.
And suddenly there's a crisis that requires an emergency meeting with Marigold's teacher.
(Both feign laughing)
I bet you banter like this all the time.
The rat-a-tat-tats, the bon mots.
Ooh!
Why don't we talk about Marigold?
Yes, of course.
I am very concerned.
What is it?
Is she underperforming?
Quite the opposite.
Marigold is so bright and she recently qualified to take honors algebra in the fall.
And you're concerned because...
She's choosing to take regular algebra instead.
(Gasps)
I know this must be especially troubling to the co-founders of "let's multiply."
Big fan!
Big fan!
Well, I hear you and I am on this.
I also hear you and I am also on this.
To a slightly greater degree that a parent would be.
- A step-parent.
- Still hearing "parent."
Do you mind?
Scooch in.
What?
Oh, oh, no, could we not...
Smile.
And... tweet.
(Knocking on door)
Hey.
Becca's at a doctor appointment, so I wanted to talk to you about the parent-teacher conference.
Why does it matter where Becca is?
It doesn't.
Um, Mr. Norgel said you didn't want to take honors algebra, for some reason.
That's what this is about.
Marigold, it is a parent's job to give her child ground to stand on and wings to fly.
Honors algebra is those wings.
Are those wings?
Is?
What are you saying?
What am I saying?
You need to take honors algebra.
You may think you can't handle it, but you definitely can.
You are so smart.
Okay.
Really?
Wow.
I had more, but wings worked.
It's just that I wasn't going to take honors algebra because it's at the same time as photography.
Photography?
Yeah, it just seems so cool and I kind of wanted to try it.
Plus, I'm already taking a bunch of other honors classes.
Marigold, that excuse...
Is totally reasonable.
It's nice to see you explore new interests.
If you really want to take photography, you should take it.
Photography shall be your wings.
Thanks, Emily.
I'm really not getting the wings thing though.
Oh, it's a total dud.
Just, let's finish that hug.
Why would God make forests so big if he wasn't trying to hide something?
The Yeti must exist.
The Yeti must exist.
By the way, I'd like to say Konichiwa to all of my friends in Japan just waking up right now.
It's tomorrow there.
Skip, we've got to talk.
Oh, good news, everybody:
We've got a special guest who's not just me changing my voice a little bit.
It's America's favorite press secretary, Marshall Malloy.
No, no, no, no, Skip, I came here to shut down this podcast.
What?
Why?
Because we can't just have your unfiltered ramblings representing the views of your father's administration.
All right, just sit down here and let's discuss this while I record it.
Skip, I am not coming on your podcast.
Come on, Marshall.
Please, just do it.
Just do it, man.
I'll make it the last one.
I could really use you to goose my ratings.
This could really put me over the top in the urban market.
That means black.
Please, Marshall.
Okay, fine.
I will answer a couple of questions so long as this is your last episode.
(Quietly):
Talk into this mic.
And we're back.
My guest is Marshall Malloy.
(Music playing)
SKIP (Recording): ♪ Live from the Lincoln bedroom.♪
(Mouthing along to recording) It's Skip Gilchrist.
Boom.
(Stomping footsteps approaching)
Oh, boy.
Photography?
What, was finger painting full?
Marigold and I had a really good talk.
And we arrived at the right decision for her.
You got played, Emily.
I most certainly did not.
She explained her newfound passion for photography and her desire to balance it against a challenging course load.
You got played.
We shouldn't force her.
Maybe she doesn't like math.
Nobody likes math.
I don't even like math and I love it.
Well, you sound insane.
Emily, of course Marigold is going to choose the easier thing.
That's what kids do.
And you know all those smart kids she used to hang out with?
Well, they are gone; poof.
But that's okay because the kids in regular algebra will teach her how to smoke.
She wants to take photography.
It's okay to let her follow her bliss.
Bliss...
That's a good stripper name.
Maybe she could use that.
(Bottles rattling)
Hey, guys.
Just having a little snack attack.
Dad, you agree that Marigold has to aim high, right?
Yeah, sure.
But you also agree that it's important for her to explore her interests.
How did I get myself surrounded?
I'm a marine.
Look, I don't want to get in the middle of this.
You both love Marigold.
I love Marigold...
Is that Marigold over there?
No, not biting?
Dad, what's it going to be?
- Pick a side.
- Why?
You're both making such incredible points.
And whoever loses,
Marigold wins.
I am Dale Gilchrist, and I approve this message.
(Sighs) You know what, Emily, if photography is Marigold's passion, then that's what she should pursue.
I'm fine with it.
I'm so not fine with it.
So, then I opened the briefcase, and it's filled with croissants, but the joke is on me because the French ambassador ate my talking points for breakfast.
(Laughing)
Delightful.
If you're just joining us, my guest is Marshall Malloy;
our topic:
Life.
Skip, this is actually really fun.
Man, I-I've been working for your father for 12 years, and this is the first time anybody has ask me a question about me.
Tell us about those early years.
A young person of color, struggling on the gritty streets of...
- Lake Tahoe.
- Uh-huh.
Right out of high school I started interning for your dad and he has kept me busy ever since.
Fascinating.
Take us there.
Well, your dad was a congressman, and one of my first tasks was writing letters on his behalf.
You've opened the door, now pull back the curtain.
Well, congressman are extremely busy.
So, they'll often have staffers write their correspondence and then sign their letters with an auto-pen.
Robot pens.
Are they sentient?
Can they be defeated?
As you know, swords are useless against them.
Moving on.
Marshall, I'd love to hear your impressions of a young Skip Gilchrist.
Oh, if I recall, the summer I started interning you were 13 years old and you were having a hard time at summer camp.
Your dad said that you were just miserable.
Oh, my gosh, I'll never forget that summer.
The only thing rougher than the toilet paper was the response to my one-man performance of Oliver!
I did not consider myself at home.
But then my dad wrote me the most amazing letter.
It really made me feel...
A ton better.
Skip, is something wrong?
Oh, right.
Marshall...
Letter...
Dad.
- Hold the phone.
- Skip...
Marshall, hold the damn phone.
Did you write personal letters for my dad?
Hey, Skip, you want to talk about area 51?
As a matter of fact, let's just go there.
We'll take the transporter, which, as you suspected, totally exists.
Wait, wait, what's that?
Julie Chen and Lucy Liu both want to go?
I'll never forget the day my dad sent me this letter at camp.
It was like he reached inside my rib cage and gave me a pat on the heart.
And at the end of it he wrote, "Skip, I'm proud of you."
- And you kept it, that's great.
- I kept it because that was the only time my dad ever said he was proud of me.
The one time.
Marshall, did you write this letter?
Skip, I can't remember if...
- Did you write this letter?
!
- Yes.
(Dramatic music plays)
(Music stops)
We'll be right back.
And we are back with the Marhsall Malloy who's destroyed my childhood.
Skip, I wasn't trying to destroy anything.
I was just doing my job.
"And, so, Skip, no matter how many swirlies you get,
"or how many times they push you off the pier
"into the cold, uncaring water of Lake Minikani, know that you are never truly alone."
Now that is some good stuff that your father should have written you himself.
Again, really sorry.
Sorry isn't enough, Marshall.
My dad entrusted my spiritual well-being...
Nay, the very molding of my character... to an employee.
Well, an intern.
Uh, uh, and we'll be right back with the best of Skip.
BECCA:
Behold, Marigold, an hour from now this room will be filled with the greatest minds in math and science.
They'll receive trophies and accolades and a peanut-free lunch.
You're wasting your time.
Emily already told me I don't have to take honors algebra.
I'm not hear to tell you you have to take it.
I am here to show you that you want to take it.
Now, meet Kayla.
She's who you could be one day.
(Robot voice):
Take me to your leader.
Who is also your father.
(Laughs)
- Nope.
- I'm just kidding.
It's nice to meet you.
I thought you two might hang out.
Talk about all the cool stuff you're into and how for Kayla, that's math.

Oh, Kayla, shut up.

- Fine!
Not that I'm trying to bribe you, but who would it take to impress-slash-bribe you?

She's pretty cool.
So she said, "there's no e-to-the-pi-I in team."
And I said, "stop being negative."

Yeah, maybe we should just talk cash.

I'm a little short on time, so you'll have to imagine me saying "with all due respect"
before most of this.
Becca, you are not the parent here.
Although you may have helped raise Marigold in the past, it was petty of you to undercut
Emily's authority.
And you, you are the First Lady of the United States of America, and you just told a group of math students that math sucks.
You both acted like children in front of the children who you were supposed to be inspiring.
So, the point is nobody won. (Laughs)
You both lost.
With all due respect.
You wrote a fake letter to Skip.
Yeah, nice fake letter, Marshall.
I'm going to kickball.
You hungry?
I could eat.
SKIP:
Next question, Mr. President.
- Dad, may I call you dad?
-Of course.
Name your favorite movie, and as a follow up, compare and contrast it to Goonies, unless, of course, it is Goonies, in which case you are correct.
Skip, I know why I'm here...
Let's get to it.
Let's.
Name me one time that you were actually proud of me.
Commando...
My favorite movie is Commando.
- Marshall.
- He may have a point.
- We do fight all the time.
- It's not good.
How about this?
How about we each say something that we could do to make our relationship better.
- Yes, good.
- Okay.
Well, for me as a parent,
I could be less threatened by you and more confident about my role in our family.
(Sighs)
I'm gonna be a horrible mom.
Oh, I'm not sure you understood the rules.
What are you talking about?
You're gonna be a great mom.
Would a great mom bribe her child to take math while crapping all over her artistic impulses?
I mean, who's a great mom?
Oh, God, my motherly instincts suck.
Come on, this is about us.
We were both trying to do what was best and let's face it, we're both very opinionated.
And ambitious, and assertive, and smart and we don't suffer fools.
So... so you're saying that we fight all the time because
- we're both...
- Fantastic, yeah.
So don't worry about your mom skills.
You already helped raise Xander and Marigold.
And Skip.
Now I'm gonna help you.
Thanks, Emily.
Yeah.
Or should I say Nana?
No...no, no, no, no.
Dad, just answer the question.
All right, fine.
You want to know some times when I was proud of you?
The t-ball championship when you were eight.
The time you were Kenickie in Grease.
And your set at that open mic last year.
But, dad, my strikeout lost us the t-ball championship,
I fell off the stage in Grease, and I fell off the stage again at that open mic.
How do you strikeout in t-ball?
- Xander.
- Those were all failures.
How could be proud of me for those?
You might get knocked down but you get right back up.
So, why don't you ever say it?
I'm sorry, I'm just not one of those dads who goes around saying,
"I'm proud of you" all the time.
But that doesn't mean that I don't believe in you, because
I do.
I guess that makes sense.
You know, this whole letter thing reminded me of something.
A letter that you wrote to me from camp that summer about how you refused to quit even though the camp was tough and those kids were mean.
I can't believe you remember that letter.
I didn't just remember it.
I kept it.
Dad?
This is a podcast, please describe what's happening here.
The President is staring at me as though he's puzzled and slightly impatient which is surely the top note, but underneath that is a new era in our relationship that can only be consummated with a hug.
I'm moving in...
Xander, cue the music.
No, no.
I am now hugging the President.
He is slowly and reluctantly putting his arms around me.
He's patting me one, two, three times.
Oh!
What's that I'm detecting?
A slight stroking of his hand.
He's now pulling away.
He's now trying to get out of the hug.
Uh, good luck with that, dad.
DALE:
Skip, Skip, please.
SKIP:
Shh!
Don't struggle.
What a moment.
Thank you for listening.
It's not my blood.
Don't worry.
We took the hit for you.
Michael.
Where in the world is Nikita Mears?
Today marks the first hundred days since the assassination of President Kathleen Spencer, and still the search drags on for her assailant, who bears the notorious label of the most wanted woman in the world.
But like most things we desperately want,
Ms. Mears continues to elude our grasp.
With me today is Deputy Director Matthew Graham, head of the FBI's task force on Mears.
Matt.
Dale.
Where the heck is she?
Come on, it's been a few months.
You can't blame us if we start to worry about our safety.
Your viewers have nothing to worry about.
Not my viewers, the American public, and they beg to differ.
Because if it's really that easy to kill the most protected person in the world, then none of us are safe.
Your viewers have nothing to worry about.
First of all, rest easy in the knowledge that wherever Nikita Mears is hiding, she is nowhere near the United States.
And today, the Bureau is reinforcing its commitment to capturing Nikita with an increase in the reward to $30 million for any information assisting in that capture.
30 million, okay.
So that's 5 million more than Osama bin Laden's bounty, and it only took ten years to find him.
So what, seven, eight years?
Well, Osama bin Laden had help.
He was being sheltered.
And you're saying she's not?
I can neither confirm nor deny any information that would jeopardize our investigation.
Okay then, let's speculate.
What would your guess be?
Because it's really hard to imagine how anyone could evade capture and survive all on their own.
If she has help, maybe it's the same people who helped her escape the White House after shooting President Spencer inside the Oval Office.
Perhaps they're also members of the President's death squad.
There is no death squad.
So you're saying Senator Coto misspoke when he ordered an investigation of the executive death squad that Spencer was running with the late Commander Danforth, of which Nikita was alleged to be a member.
Explains how she got into the White House at least.
That is a separate investigation.
Can we at least agree that the word "squad" suggests--
If you want to talk about that investigation--
Can we at least agree that the word "squad"
suggests more than one person?
Hands in the air, right now!
Walk towards me.
It is her.
Okay, on the ground, facedown, now!
Because here's what I speculate.
You don't want her to be found, because that means exposing what every American has grown to fear more than any foreign enemy, and that, sir, is the parallel state.
Hey, hey.
Can I take that as confirmation or denial?
It's her.
Boston field office is closest.
They're scrambling a chopper.
Yeah?
No, officer, I understand.
You did the right thing.
Just keep her pinned down until our tactical team arrives.
And under no circumstances should you try and approach her.
Sir, she's unarmed on the ground.
We got her.
Do not approach.
The feds want the collar.
Cuff her ass.
Put your hands behind your back.
I've just been informed that Deputy Director Graham has been called away on urgent business.
Urgent, convenient, whatever.
It won't stop me from asking the important questions
I promised you I'd ask.
For example, how is Nikita Mears alive in the first place?
According to the state of New Jersey, she was executed ten years ago for killing a Newark police officer.
Who the hell has the kind of juice to fake an execution?
As incredible as it sounds, the death of the President is just the tip of the iceberg.
We demand to know the whole truth.
And I promise you, I won't rest until I--
Has new material arrived ahead of schedule?
No.
Nikita has arrived.
Our drones spotted her crossing the border into the United States.
We've sent an anonymous tip to the local authorities.
Hmm.
Interactive television.
You don't seem surprised.
I knew she couldn't stay away forever.
But why now?
Why take the risk?
What's she after?
You.
And me.
We ruined her life.
Nikita's not the type to let something like that go.
But don't worry about her.
There are more disturbing things on television.
We rescued last night from these containers, much like the one I was in when I was taken--
Ms. Udinov has been considerably easier to track.
Yes, but who is tracking whom?
She's shut down three of our supply centers for human subjects in the last two months.
Cosmetic damage.
We only need to tolerate her for a little while longer.
I do this to help others like me.
It's Nikita who's alive past schedule.
What happened to us was terrible, but it does not have to define us.
Victim, survivor, meddling bitch.
That last one was bestowed on me from a slaver in Burundi last week.
But it doesn't matter what they call me.
What matters is my message to those who are engaged in the buying and selling of human beings.
No matter how powerful or unstoppable you think you are, we will find you, we will expose you, and we will stop you.
That was a very powerful speech, Miss Udinov.
Thank you for coming and sharing with us.
I only hope it inspires others to join your fight.
I know how hard you've been working to stop trafficking in Mumbai.
I just wish there was more that I could do to help.
You could stop taking over their territory after you put them out of business.
That'd be helpful.
Okay, tracker's on her.
How's the signal?
Signal's strong, but...
Sonya, trust me.
She will lead us to the shop.
She's their favorite kind of trafficker, corrupt government official.
I just got a call from the guys.
Nikita has come out of hiding.
Seems she's back in the states.
What?
Where's Michael?
Where do you think?
Should we head back?
Finding the shop is the best way to find Amanda and clear Nikita's name.
But if she gets herself caught it could be too late.
No, she must have a plan.
And she'd want us to stick to ours.
You're gonna need a bigger coffee before we dive into your call sheet.
Everyone wants to find out what you know about Nikita's return.
Still no leads on her?
Just the car she left behind, courtesy of Barney Fife and his merry band of idiots.
Then everyone can wait.
I wanna keep my day clear.
If anything breaks, I wanna be ready to go on the air.
Okay.
New LCD TV just got in.
Thank you, Paula.
Dale Gordon.
Big fan.

Put your hands down.
Have a seat.
How did you get in here?
This is a secure building.
There's cameras everywhere.
Just like the White House, Dale.
Feel safer now?
Do you?
You were a ghost.
No one could find you.
Now you're inside of a building filled with journalists desperate for a lead on you in the largest city of the most powerful nation on the planet who calls for your blood.
Stop writing copy, Dale, okay?
You're better at asking questions.
Why don't we just stick to that?
You--you want me to-- to interview you?
While the FBI is conducting the largest manhunt--
I'm not worried about the FBI.
There's only one man who can track me, and I doubt he's interested in trying.
You can't keep moving trays around.
This is the fourth time I've had to renumber everything.
Excuse me, are you the commander on duty?
No, I'm just the one doing his job for him.
Well, I need a signature on this chain of custody form.
Who's transporting evidence now?
I haven't even had the chance-- it's the car.
Form needs to be signed before we can move it.
I'll go find Wilson.
Wait here.
She left a lot behind.
She had to make an escape plan on the fly.
No time to scrub the car.
What's this?
Uniform policy for Kips Bay Creative Technology.
Looks like they do electronic sales and services.
Like repairs?
Repairs, new installations, but not for the general public.
They're contractors.
They work with local businesses in Midtown Manhattan.
Nikita stole the car in Vermont.
Any chance the owner works in Manhattan?
Lives and works in Shelburne, Vermont.
She's single and a pediatrician.
So no need for a uniform.
Service call.
Just like I taught her.
She's going undercover as the cable guy.
Whose cable guy?
Can you break into their systems?
I wanna take a look at today's orders.
That one.
Payment type is cash upon pickup.
Who's that for?
Equinox News Network.
A new LCD TV for Dale Gordon.
Conspiracy guy.
E.N.N. is a huge corporation.
They don't pay cash.
They'd ask to be billed.
Nikita doesn't have time to fake that.
There's too much heat.
Whoa.
Guess who reported a break-in last night.
Kips Bay Creative Technology.
That's her.
All she needs to get through that door is an order form with Gordon's name on it and that uniform.
Dale Gordon's been asking a lot of questions about the President's death.
You think Nikita's looking for an ally?
Well, she had five allies, and she ditched us.
What?
Mikey's not the only one who gets to have resentment.
Nikita left to keep the spotlight and the danger away from us.
She was-- being Nikki, I know.
Act first, think later.
First degree martyr.
Birkhoff, I need you to get me into the E.N.N. building.
Think we should land close in case they need a pickup?
Yep.
The President of the United States committed suicide?
I know it sounds crazy.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, Big Foot, the Loch Ness monster, UFOs-- that sounds crazy.
What you're talking about--
Is the truth.
That's what you seek to find, right?
You know, you ask good questions, Dale, but you don't ask the right questions.
Like what, what would make the President pick up a gun and shoot herself in the head?
Sure has me curious.
So you don't know why?
That's--that's great.
I know that the President was not the only one acting out of character that day.
The lead Secret Service man, he gave me the gun.
He's working with the people who are setting me up.
Single shot to the head.
Make it count.
John Stirling?
He was a 20-year veteran.
He protected three presidents.
Someone like that wouldn't-- wouldn't what?
Do what he did?
Like Kathleen Spencer?
Or Karl Jaeger?
Karl who?
German intelligence officer.
Shot his own men at the G20 summit in Toronto.
You covered it.
He's the only person I can think of who's also acting out of character.
But unlike Stirling and the President,
I was able to investigate Jaeger.
I found this.
Yeah, I can't read German.
The B.N.D. officer claims that the Toronto police corrupted the blood samples.
He chalks it up to sloppy forensics, but I think it's actually a clue.
What if there was something in his blood that made him act differently that day?
What if there was something in the President's blood that did the same?
Nobody would think to look-- What kind of something?
And how do we even find out?
Your source at the FBI can get us a copy of her autopsy results.
What FBI source?
- You've always said--
- I never said.
I never said.
I implied and let the people assume.
"Sources familiar with the investigation"
sounds a lot more credible than "anonymous person who texts me."
Anonymous?
I got sent an envelope with a phone inside, and then I started getting the text messages.
At first, I thought it might be you, but then, I don't know, it just got weird.
"I see you found her arrest record.
"Such an unfortunate mug shot.
"That Nikita wouldn't have made it within 100 yards of the White House--"
It's a trap.
You were the bait she needed.
Who?
Someone you never want to meet.
Welcome home, Nikita.
Priya's here.
She brought some hired guns to watch her back.
This has gotta be it.
I'm not seeing any trucks though.
You think the shipment's inside the warehouse?
I've got two vehicles approaching.
That's our buyer.
Sending images now.
Who do you think he is?
Another sales rep for the Shop, like Heidecker?
Only one way to find out.
Have Birkhoff run him through facial recognition.
This guy shows up nowhere, we'll know he's Shop.
Just sent you a photo of the Mumbai buyer.
Can you run it through Shadownet's facial recog?
Hey, babe.
Nice to hear your voice too.
I'm a little busy at the moment.
We think this man might work for the Shop and may be our best hope of clearing Nikita's name.
What's more important than that?
Uh, keeping her from getting shot in the next ten minutes.
Lock it down.
Six-block perimeter.
I think we're good to go.
Remember, if someone talks to you, you answer them but you keep moving.
Sorry it took so long.
The elevators aren't working.
Uh, you're the one who delivered the TV.
Why are you still here?
Don't worry about it, Paula.
Mr. Gordon, FBI is looking for you.
Oh, my God, you're Nikita.
It's Nikita!
Let us walk outta here, and he'll be fine.
Got her!
Sixth floor.
She's with Dale, not too far from the elevators.
How do you know?
The entire newsroom just announced it online.
Blue wolf, this is Red wolf.
I'm on site.
It's a party down here.
Patch me through to lone wolf.
We're trying.
Does Dale have a phone on him?
Nikita must have made him dump it.
Try an extension in the room.
Feds can listen in.
Room full of phones and no way to reach her.
That's real smart.
Yes.
Yes, I am.
Those Nikita posts-- most of them are being posted from smart phones.
Um...
It says it's for you.
Pick it up, Dale.
This is Dale Gordon.
Nikita can't talk right now.
Is that the FBI?
Do you know someone named Michael?
So who's Michael, another member of the President's death squad?
Michael?
I'm downstairs, here to help you exfil.
On site?
Damn it.
Michael, I left because you couldn't be involved in this.
Yeah, you left.
So you don't get a vote anymore.
Nerd?
And, you know, we're not cocker spaniels.
You can't tell us to sit and just expect us to obey your command.
Okay.
Okay, fine.
You're here, you wanna help?
Can you hack into the building?
We're already in.
Now if we can get you to the north side...
No, this is good.
Thermal scanners won't be able to get a good read in here.
This is the perfect place to be surrounded.
What are you talking about?
We make the FBI think that I'm in here with Dale, that he's my hostage.
While they're trying to breach, find me a way out of the building.
Michael, you clear an exfil point.
Birkhoff, you clear the cameras.
Oh, my God, she does expect us to obey her.
So I stay here?
I like this plan.
I need you to do something else for me.
Take this, give it to the FBI, along with the cell phone in your office.
I'm talking about the very top, not some random guy in a windbreaker, okay?
This is all the evidence we have.
The FBI has its sights set on you.
How can you trust them?
I trust them to be the FBI.
We give them evidence, they'll investigate.
Look, even if you don't believe me--
I don't know what to believe, but I don't think you killed the President.
I'll be in touch.
Remember, I get the exclusive.
I can't have the press filming from the surrounding buildings.
Get them out of those windows.
Boss, we have no one to send.
Our cupboard's bare.
The loading dock--we already secured that tightly.
Send those guys.
Birkhoff, make the call.
- Nikita?
- She's calling from the roof.
You wanna take this?
No, you start.
You pass her up to me if she escalates.
Hi, Nikita.
My name is Kramer.
Can we talk?
What would you like to talk about, Kramer?
I'd like to talk about Dale.
Is he okay?
Tell him how you are, Dale.
Oh, my God, you gotta get me outta here.
Just give her what she wants.
I don't wanna die.
I wanna live.
Amateurs.
They always oversell.
You got what you wanted.
Here's what I want.
Nikita, do you realize your situation?
The building is locked down.
Our tactical team is moving into position.
There is no way off that roof.
Yes, but I've got Dale Gordon.
If you come in, he dies.
So what do you want?
I'm on a rooftop, idiot.
What do you think I want?
She wants a helicopter.
It's gonna take some time.
Let me know when you have it.
She was last spotted on the sixth floor.
The building is 14 stories.
She went up eight floors to get to the roof?
That doesn't make any kind of tactical sense.
Why go up?
Why call?
All it did was tell us where she was.
Or where she wanted us to think she was.
But to do that...
Someone is helping her.
All right, straight ahead, there's a large exhaust vent.
Take off the access panel.
You should be able to crawl through.
So what's the plan once you escape the building?
You coming back or are you gonna run away again?
The heat hasn't died down yet.
I don't want you guys in that kinda danger, even though you seem determined to keep putting yourselves there.
Huh.
What did you expect us to do?
I thought that if I wasn't around, you could move on with your lives.
Move on?
Yeah, nobody's moving on.
Mikey's gone for weeks at a time trying to pick up on your trail.
Ryan's created a whole new wall of crazy conspiracy theories.
Alex thinks she's Batman, which I guess makes my girlfriend Robin.
All this to help clear your name.
I didn't ask for that.
Yeah, well, we didn't ask for you to leave, but you did that anyway.
Look, Nikki, you're gonna wind up in an alley somewhere, alone and dying, unless you stop running and let us help you.
You know what would help me right now?
Turn off the spinning blades of decapitation, would you?
Almost there.
I only have a short window of time before the system sends out an alert that it's malfunctioning.
Wouldn't want the FBI to--
They dumped me.
Nikki, I'm locked out of the system.
Guess that means I'm locked in.
Can you get back in?
No, they must have figured out we were in the system.
We're toast.
So who's running the show here?
Deputy Director Matthew Graham.
Graham, okay.
Listen, I need--
Birkhoff.
Hang on, Mikey.
She's trying to call me.
Do not answer her.
We already played it her way.
We don't have time.
Now get me everything you can find on Graham.
Guys, I'm trapped in a building full of FBI agents here.
Somebody please talk to me.
Hey, would you please talk to her before she loses patience and decides to try and shoot her way through the side of the building?
What happens if I shoot the fan out?
Uh, Birkhoff says do not shoot the fan.
Ryan.
All right, what's the plan to get me outta here then?
Uh, in progress.
I'm kinda curious about the plan that got you in there.
Dale Gordon?
Karl Jaeger.
The B.N.D. guy?
You found a connection.
The police took evidence from the scene where Jaeger was shot, and the blood samples showed abnormal "B" and "T" cells.
But then when they did the autopsy, the blood work was fine.
Germans just assumed that the samples were contaminated.
But I don't know, Ryan, what if there was something else?
Something in the blood?
Like a drug.
The blood on the scene would have traces of it.
It could've skewed the results.
But by the time they did the autopsy, the drug would be out of his system, so the blood seemed clear.
Amanda does like drugs, especially ones that modify behavior.
Yeah, I ran that, but there's some snags, mostly with time line.
How'd you figure this Jaeger thing out?
I see the shipment.
It's only four men.
Did you say four?
Traffickers usually pay less than $200 a head for men, and Priya's supposed to earn--
10 million.
So unless these guys can spin straw into gold, something else is going on here.
I'm going in for a closer look.
Hmm.
I find the shipment to be acceptable.
Authorize the transfer of funds.
Let's go.
Get in the car.
I don't know when I'll be able to get you the others.
Don't bother.
We'll take your partial shipment, but we won't be doing business with you again.
This is not my fault.
It's this-- this Udinov girl.
I couldn't risk taking--
What does that say, hmm?
Without risk, there is no reward.
The buyer's little friend is headed my way.
Looks like he's on a comm device.
If he has remote support, they may have picked up your heat signature.
- So I've been made?
- Yes.
The buyer escaped.
Looks like he took one of the men with him.
- Did you find anything?
- I'm not sure yet.
Miss Udinov just blew up our operation in Mumbai.
We've moved beyond cosmetics now.
And your tolerance level.
At an all-time low.
We lost three subjects during the transfer.
That means we still have one.
And one is all I need.
We locked them out of the system, but it cost us any chance of tracing the signal back.
We have no idea who she's working with.
Right now, I'm more concerned with what's happening on the roof.
Team's in position.
All right, let me make a call first in case this goes bad.
Sir.
Didn't I already look at this?
That's my wife.
What is this, some kind of a joke?
No, Matthew, it's a choice.
What do you want?
Where's your car?
I can't believe that worked.
Don't doubt my mad photoshopping skills again.
Nikita, you ready?
For what?
Ready on your order.
How do you wanna play it?
Go dark, cut the power.
Tactical's storming the roof right now.
We need to get you outta here.
What's he doing here?
He'll get you out of Manhattan.
Head north.
I'll meet you there.
We'll switch cars.
Where?
At the staging area near the zoo.
Keep your head down.
I'll see you at the rendezvous point.
Thank you.
They all look the same.
Not like twins.
More like cousins.
Who were these men?
And why were they worth so much money?
Wait, I think I found something.
I saw the buyer using this weird piece of tech.
Looks like he left it behind.
What is it?
Some sort of handheld scanner.
He was waving it on them.
They were chipped.
Like a tracker.
Like livestock.
Let's give Ryan a call.
I don't know what the hell this is, but he's gonna want to see it.
Have they found Nikita yet?
Yes, I believe they know just where she is.
Yeah, we got somebody coming up through here right now.
You leaving already?
Yeah.
Mayor wants to have a chat down at Center Street.
Yeah, the mayor wants to make sure this doesn't stick to him.
But, hey, dispatch said that that reporter's okay.
Might finally get some good press outta that guy.
Yeah, I'm not that lucky.
Dale Gordon's alive.
Maybe that means the FBI will let me keep my pension after they force me out for this mess.
Was that a tactical decision?
I wouldn't have hurt Dale.
An assassin with a heart of gold.
Too bad you didn't feel the same way about Spencer.
I didn't kill her.
I tried to warn her.
You kidnapped the President's aide to get yourself put on her schedule.
You used the tunnels to infiltrate yourself into the White House, somehow conning your way into the blue sector, all to try and warn her?
I did warn the President.
And then she shot herself in the head?
Autopsy report says the gun was fired at close range, possibly pressed up against her temple.
There were only two people in that room.
So if you didn't pull the trigger, that only leaves me with one other possible culprit.
Only if you have an open mind.
Let's say that I do.
You went there to warn her.
Still one problem with your story:
Why did you bring the gun?
Innocent people don't smuggle a gun into the Oval Office.
Out, let's go.
You and your friends haven't scared me off, you know.
I'll go home tonight and make sure that my wife is safe, but tomorrow, I'll start hunting you again.
Thought you were afraid of losing your job.
They could force me to retire, but that'll just give me more free time to dedicate to you.
I'll catch you.
And I will find out exactly what happened that day.
I want that too.
Talk to Dale Gordon.
Yeah, this kinda tech, it's gotta be the Shop.
They wanted a very specific type.
Four men is too small a sample to be useful as test subjects.
Wait.
That fits with what Nikita found.
Alex, I think you may have found the puzzle piece we were looking for.
That's great.
So what does it mean?
It can't be.
Yeah, I think we're gonna have to wait on that.
He's doing the thing.
Okay, well, when he's done reconstructing his big board of crazy, give me a call.
Sonya, I'm gonna clean up the scene.
I'll bring back the scanner to the hotel with me.
See you soon.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take that from you.
Owen?
How many times do I have to tell you?
It's Sam.
Authorities aren't releasing any new details, but they are searching for a black SUV with federal plates.
The vehicle was last seen heading north near the cruise ship terminus at 51st street.
If you spot--
About a dozen downtown businesses were boarded up...
Can we finally agree that a squad is more than one person?
I'm ready to listen to you now.
Now?
Oh.
Nikita says you have some truth to tell me.
What is this?
Evidence.
Yeah, you're welcome.
I can't read German.
She's not here.
Can you track her?
I'm not getting an answer on that cell phone she was using.
Signal's a few blocks from your position, but it's not moving.
Be advised, FBI vehicle has been recovered.
Suspect is likely on foot.
She is wounded and probably in need of medical attention.
Birkhoff, give me that address.
It's been confirmed that Dale is safe and uninjured.
He's speaking with authorities right now in the command tent behind me.
He should be released shortly.
And we're being told that he plans on making a statement about the events that transpired here--
It's done.
Dale Gordon won't be an issue anymore.
Are you ready to implement the next phase?
We're on schedule.
We now have confirmation that Dale Gordon was inside the mobile command center at the time of the explosion.
Authorities believe that Nikita Mears may have planted the bomb on Gordon while she was holding him hostage.
Details are still coming in, but it is believed that Gordon, along with many fine men and women in the law enforcement community, are dead.
At this time, the suspect is still at large.
Authorities are asking citizens who live in the five boroughs to stay inside your homes.
Do not congregate on the streets.
If you notice anything suspicious, please call 911.
Do not attempt to investigate or approach on your own.
As today's events have shown,
Nikita Mears is highly dangerous and willing to kill perhaps anyone who gets in her way.
No one is safe as long as she's out there.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
It's not my blood.
Don't worry.
We took the hit for you.
Where in the world is Nikita Mears?
Today marks the first hundred days since the assassination of President Kathleen Spencer, and still the search drags on for her assailant, who bears the notorious label of the most wanted woman in the world.
But like most things we desperately want,
Ms. Mears continues to elude our grasp.
With me today is Deputy Director Matthew Graham, head of the FBI's task force on Mears.
Matt.
Dale.
Where the heck is she?
Come on, it's been a few months.
You can't blame us if we start to worry about our safety.
Your viewers have nothing to worry about.
Not my viewers, the American public, and they beg to differ.
Because if it's really that easy to kill the most protected person in the world, then none of us are safe.
Your viewers have nothing to worry about.
First of all, rest easy in the knowledge that wherever Nikita Mears is hiding, she is nowhere near the United States.
And today, the Bureau is reinforcing its commitment to capturing Nikita with an increase in the reward to $30 million for any information assisting in that capture.
30 million, okay.
So that's 5 million more than Osama bin Laden's bounty, and it only took ten years to find him.
So what, seven, eight years?
Well, Osama bin Laden had help.
- He was being sheltered.
- And you're saying she's not?
I can neither confirm nor deny any information that would jeopardize our investigation.
Okay then, let's speculate.
What would your guess be?
Because it's really hard to imagine how anyone could evade capture and survive all on their own.
If she has help, maybe it's the same people who helped her escape the White House after shooting President Spencer inside the Oval Office.
Perhaps they're also members of the President's death squad.
There is no death squad.
So you're saying Senator Coto misspoke when he ordered an investigation of the Executive Death Squad that Spencer was running with the late Commander Danforth, of which Nikita was alleged to be a member.
Explains how she got into the White House at least.
That is a separate investigation.
Can we at least agree that the word "squad" suggests...
If you want to talk about that investigation...
Can we at least agree that the word "squad"
suggests more than one person?
Hands in the air, right now!
Walk towards me.
It is her.
Okay, on the ground, face down, now!
Because here's what I speculate.
You don't want her to be found, because that means exposing what every American has grown to fear more than any foreign enemy, and that, sir, is the Parallel State.
Hey, hey.
Can I take that as confirmation or denial?
It's her.
Boston field office is closest.
They're scrambling a chopper.
Yeah?
No, officer, I understand.
You did the right thing.
Just keep her pinned down until our tactical team arrives.
And under no circumstances should you try and approach her.
Sir, she's unarmed on the ground.
- We got her.
- Do not approach.
The feds want the collar.
Cuff her ass.
Put your hands behind your back.
I've just been informed that Deputy Director Graham has been called away on urgent business.
Urgent, convenient, whatever.
It won't stop me from asking the important questions
I promised you I'd ask.
For example, how is Nikita Mears alive in the first place?
According to the state of New Jersey, she was executed ten years ago for killing a Newark police officer.
Who the hell has the kind of juice to fake an execution?
As incredible as it sounds, the death of the President is just the tip of the iceberg.
We demand to know the whole truth.
And I promise you, I won't rest until I...
Has new material arrived ahead of schedule?
No.
Nikita has arrived.
Our drones spotted her crossing the border into the United States.
We've sent an anonymous tip to the local authorities.
Hmm.
Interactive television.
You don't seem surprised.
I knew she couldn't stay away forever.
But why now?
Why take the risk?
What's she after?
You.
And me.
We ruined her life.
Nikita's not the type to let something like that go.
But don't worry about her.
There are more disturbing things on television.
...we rescued last night from these containers, much like the one I was in when I was taken...
Ms. Udinov has been considerably easier to track.
Yes, but who is tracking whom?
She's shut down three of our supply centers for human subjects in the last two months.
Cosmetic damage.
We only need to tolerate her for a little while longer.
I do this to help others like me.
It's Nikita who's alive past schedule.
What happened to us was terrible, but it does not have to define us.
Victim, survivor meddling bitch.
That last one was bestowed on me from a slaver in Burundi last week.
But it doesn't matter what they call me.
What matters is my message to those who are engaged in the buying and selling of human beings.
No matter how powerful or unstoppable you think you are, we will find you,
we will expose you, and we will stop you.
That was a very powerful speech, Miss Udinov.
Thank you for coming and sharing with us.
I only hope it inspires others to join your fight.
I know how hard you've been working to stop trafficking in Mumbai.
I just wish there was more that I could do to help.
You could stop taking over their territory after you put them out of business.
That'd be helpful.
Okay, tracker's on her.
How's the signal?
Signal's strong, but...
Sonya, trust me.
She will lead us to the shop.
She's their favorite kind of trafficker, corrupt government official.
I just got a call from the guys.
Nikita has come out of hiding.
Seems she's back in the states.
What?
Where's Michael?
Where do you think?
Should we head back?
Finding the shop is the best way to find Amanda and clear Nikita's name.
But if she gets herself caught it could be too late.
No, she must have a plan.
And she'd want us to stick to ours.
You're gonna need a bigger coffee before we dive into your call sheet.
Everyone wants to find out what you know about Nikita's return.
Still no leads on her?
Just the car she left behind, courtesy of Barney Fife and his merry band of idiots.
Then everyone can wait.
I wanna keep my day clear.
If anything breaks, I wanna be ready to go on the air.
Okay.
New LCD TV just got in.
Thanks.
Dale Gordon.
Big fan.
Put your hands down.
Have a seat.
How did you get in here?
This is a secure building.
There's cameras everywhere.
Just like the White House, Dale.
Feel safer now?
Do you?
You were a ghost.
No one could find you.
Now you're inside of a building filled with journalists desperate for a lead on you in the largest city of the most powerful nation on the planet who calls for your blood.
Stop writing copy, Dale, okay?
You're better at asking questions.
Why don't we just stick to that?
You... you want me to... to interview you?
While the FBI is conducting the largest manhunt...
I'm not worried about the FBI.
There's only one man who can track me, and I doubt he's interested in trying.
You can't keep moving trays around.
This is the fourth time I've had to renumber everything.
Excuse me, are you the commander on duty?
No, I'm just the one doing his job for him.
Well, I need a signature on this chain of custody form.
Who's transporting evidence now?
- I haven't even had the chance...
- It's the car.
Form needs to be signed before we can move it.
I'll go find Wilson.
Wait here.
She left a lot behind.
She had to make an escape plan on the fly.
No time to scrub the car.
What's this?
Uniform policy for Kips Bay Creative Technology.
Looks like they do electronic sales and services.
Like repairs?
Repairs, new installations, but not for the general public.
They're contractors.
They work with local businesses in Midtown Manhattan.
Nikita stole the car in Vermont.
Any chance the owner works in Manhattan?
Lives and works in Shelburne, Vermont.
She's single and a pediatrician.
So no need for a uniform.
Service call.
Just like I taught her.
She's going undercover as the cable guy.
Whose cable guy?
Can you break into their systems?
I wanna take a look at today's orders.
That one.
Payment type is cash upon pickup.
Who's that for?
Equinox News Network.
A new LCD TV for Dale Gordon.
Conspiracy guy-
E.N.N. is a huge corporation.
They don't pay cash.
They'd ask to be billed.
Nikita doesn't have time to fake that.
It's too much heat.
Whoa.
Guess who reported a break-in last night.
- Kips Bay Creative Technology.
- That's her.
All she needs to get through that door is an order form with Gordon's name on it and that uniform.
Dale Gordon's been asking a lot of questions about the President's death.
You think Nikita's looking for an ally?
Well, she had five allies, and she ditched us.
What?
Mikey's not the only one who gets to have resentment.
Nikita left to keep the spotlight and the danger away from us.
- She was...
- Being Nikki, I know.
Act first, think later.
First degree martyr.
Birkhoff, I need you to get me into the E.N.N. building.
Think we should land close in case they need a pickup?
Yep.
The President of the United States committed suicide?
I know it sounds crazy.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, Big Foot, the Loch Ness monster, UFOs... that sounds crazy.
What you're talking about... ls the truth.
That's what you seek to find, right?
You know, you ask good questions, Dale, but you don't ask the right questions.
Like what, what would make the President pick up a gun and shoot herself in the head?
Sure has me curious.
So you don't know why?
That's... that's great.
I know that the President was not the only one acting out of character that day.
The lead Secret Service man, he gave me the gun.
He's working with the people who are setting me up.
Single shot to the head.
Make it count.
John Stirling?
He was a 20-year veteran.
He protected three presidents.
- Someone like that wouldn't...
- Wouldn't what?
Do what he did?
Like Kathleen Spencer?
Or Karl Jaeger?
Karl who?
German intelligence officer.
Shot his own men at the G20 summit in Toronto.
You covered it.
He's the only person I can think of who's also acting out of character.
But unlike Stirling and the President,
I was able to investigate Jaeger.
I found this.
Yeah, I can't read German.
The B.N.D. officer claims that the Toronto police corrupted the blood samples.
He chalks it up to sloppy forensics, but I think it's actually a clue.
What if there was something in his blood that made him act differently that day?
What if there was something in the President's blood that did the same?
Nobody would think to look...
What kind of something?
And how do we even find out?
Your source at the FBI can get us a copy of her autopsy results.
What FBI source?
- You've always said...
- I never said.
I never said.
I implied and let the people assume.
"Sources familiar with the investigation"
sounds a lot more credible than "anonymous person who texts me."
Anonymous?
I got sent an envelope with a phone inside, and then I started getting the text messages.
At first, I thought it might be you, but then, I don't know, it just got weird.
"I see you found her arrest record.
"Such an unfortunate mug shot.
"That Nikita wouldn't have made it within 100 yards of the White House..."
It's a trap.
Evacuate this area.
All civilians are to coope...
You were the bait she needed.
Who?
Someone you never want to meet.
Welcome home, Nikita.
Priya's here.
She brought some hired guns to watch her back.
This has gotta be it.
I'm not seeing any trucks though.
You think the shipment's inside the warehouse?
I've got two vehicles approaching.
That's our buyer.
Sending images now.
Who do you think he is?
Another sales rep for the Shop, like Heidecker?
Only one way to find out.
Have Birkhoff run him through facial recognition.
This guy shows up nowhere, we'll know he's Shop.
Just sent you a photo of the Mumbai buyer.
Can you run it through Shadownet's facial recog?
Hey, babe.
Nice to hear your voice too.
I'm a little busy at the moment.
We think this man might work for the Shop and may be our best hope of clearing Nikita's name.
What's more important than that?
Uh, keeping her from getting shot in the next ten minutes.
... will direct you to a safe area.
Move completely across the street.
Follow their direction.
It's for your own safety.
Lock it down.
Six-block perimeter.
I think we're good to go.
Remember, if someone talks to you, you answer them but you keep moving.
Sorry it took so long.
The elevators aren't working.
Uh, you're the one who delivered the TV.
Why are you still here?
Don't worry about it, Paula.
Mr. Gordon, FBI is looking for you.
Oh, my God, you're Nikita.
It's Nikita!
Let us walk outta here, and he'll be fine.
Got her!
Sixth floor.
She's with Dale, not too far from the elevators.
How do you know?
The entire newsroom just announced it online.
Blue wolf, this is Red wolf.
I'm on site.
It's a party down here.
Patch me through to lone wolf.
We're trying.
Does Dale have a phone on him?
Nikita must have made him dump it.
Try an extension in the room.
Feds can listen in.
Room full of phones and no way to reach her.
That's real smart.
Yes.
Yes, I am.
Those Nikita posts... most of them are being posted from smart phones.
Um...
It says it's for you.
Pick it up, Dale.
This is Dale Gordon.
Nikita can't talk right now.
Is that the FBI?
Do you know someone named Michael?
So who's Michael, another member of the President's death squad?
Michael?
I'm downstairs, here to help you exfil.
On site?
Damn it.
Michael, I left because you couldn't be involved in this.
Yeah, you left.
So you don't get a vote anymore.
Nerd?
And, you know, we're not cooker spaniels.
You can't tell us to sit and just expect us to obey your command.
Okay.
Okay, fine.
You're here, you wanna help?
Can you hack into the building?
We're already in.
Now if we can get you to the north side...
No, this is good.
Thermal scanners won't be able to get a good read in here.
This is the perfect place to be surrounded.
What are you talking about?
We make the FBI think that I'm in here with Dale, that he's my hostage.
While they're trying to breach, find me a way out of the building.
Michael, you clear an exfil point.
Birkhoff, you clear the cameras.
Oh, my God, she does expect us to obey her.
So I stay here?
I like this plan.
I need you to do something else for me.
Take this, give it to the FBI, along with the cell phone in your office.
I'm talking about the very top, not some random guy in a Windbreaker, okay?
This is all the evidence we have.
The FBI has its sights set on you.
How can you trust them?
I trust them to be the FBI.
We give them evidence, they'll investigate.
Look, even if you don't believe me...
I don't know what to believe, but I don't think you killed the President.
I'll be in touch.
Remember, I get the exclusive.
I can't have the press filming from the surrounding buildings.
Get them out of those windows.
Boss, we have no one to send.
Our cupboard's bare.
The loading dock... we already secured that tightly.
Send those guys.
Birkhoff, make the call.
- Nikita?
- She's calling from the roof.
- You wanna take this?
- No, you start.
You pass her up to me if she escalates.
Hi, Nikita.
My name is Kramer.
Can we talk?
What would you like to talk about, Kramer?
I 'd like to talk about Dale.
Is he okay?
Tell him how you are, Dale.
Oh, my God, you gotta get me outta here.
Just give her what she wants.
I don't wanna die.
I wanna live.
Amateurs.
They always oversell.
You got what you wanted.
Here's what I want.
Nikita, do you realize your situation?
The building is locked down.
Our tactical team is moving into position.
There is no way off that roof.
Yes, but I've got Dale Gordon.
If you come in, he dies.
So what do you want?
I'm on a rooftop, idiot.
What do you think I want?
She wants a helicopter.
It's gonna take some time.
Let me know when you have it.
She was last spotted on the sixth floor.
The building is 14 stories.
She went up eight floors to get to the roof?
That doesn't make any kind of tactical sense.
Why go up?
Why call?
All it did was tell us where she was.
Or where she wanted us to think she was.
But to do that...
Someone is helping her.
All right, straight ahead, there's a large exhaust vent.
Take off the access panel.
You should be able to crawl through.
So what's the plan once you escape the building?
You coming back or are you gonna run away again?
The heat hasn't died down yet.
I don't want you guys in that kinda danger, even though you seem determined to keep putting yourselves there.
Huh.
What did you expect us to do?
I thought that if I wasn't around, you could move on with your lives.
Move on?
Yeah, nobody's moving on.
You may have given up on us, but we didn't give up on you.
Mikey's gone for weeks at a time trying to pick up on your trail.
Ryan's created a whole new wall of crazy conspiracy theories.
Alex thinks she's Batman, which I guess makes my girlfriend Robin.
All this to help clear your name.
I didn't ask for that.
Yeah, well, we didn't ask for you to leave, but you did that anyway.
Look, Nikki, you're gonna wind up in an alley somewhere,
alone and dying, unless you stop running and let us help you.
You know what would help me right now?
Turn off the spinning blades of decapitation, would you?
Almost there.
I only have a short window of time before the system sends out an alert that it's malfunctioning.
Wouldn't want the FBI to...
What?
They dumped me.
Nikki, I'm locked out of the system.
Guess that means I'm locked in.
Can you get back in?
No, they must have figured out we were in the system.
We're toast.
So who's running the show here?
Deputy Director Matthew Graham.
Graham, okay.
Listen, I need...
Birkhoff.
Hang on, Mikey.
She's trying to call me.
Do not answer her.
We already played it her way.
We don't have time.
Now get me everything you can find on Graham.
Guys, I'm trapped in a building full of FBI agents here.
Somebody please talk to me.
Hey, would you please talk to her before she loses patience and decides to try and shoot her way through the side of the building?
What happens if I shoot the fan out?
Uh, Birkhoff says do not shoot the fan.
Ryan.
All right, what's the plan to get me outta here then?
Uh, in progress.
I'm kinda curious about the plan that got you in there.
Dale Gordon?
Karl Jaeger.
The B.N.D. guy?
You found a connection.
The police took evidence from the scene where Jaeger was shot, and the blood samples showed abnormal "B" and "T" cells.
But then when they did the autopsy, the blood work was fine.
Germans just assumed that the samples were contaminated.
But I don't know, Ryan, what if there was something else?
Something in the blood?
Like a drug.
The blood on the scene would have traces of it.
It could've skewed the results.
But by the time they did the autopsy, the drug would be out of his system, so the blood seemed clear.
Amanda does like drugs, especially ones that modify behavior.
Yeah, I ran that, but there's some snags, mostly with time line.
How'd you figure this Jaeger thing out?
I see the shipment.
- It's only four men.
- Did you say four?
Traffickers usually pay less than $200 a head for men, and Priya's supposed to earn... 10 million.
So unless these guys can spin straw into gold, something else is going on here.
I'm going in for a closer look.
I find the shipment to be acceptable.
Authorize the transfer of funds.
Let's go.
Get in the car.
I don't know when I'll be able to get you the others.
Don't bother.
We'll take your partial shipment, but we won't be doing business with you again.
This is not my fault.
It's this...
this Udinov girl.
I couldn't risk taking...
What does that say, hmm?
Without risk, there is no reward.
The buyer's little friend is headed my way.
Looks like he's on a comm device.
If he has remote support, they may have picked up your heat signature.
- So I've been made?
- Yes.
The buyer escaped.
Looks like he took one of the men with him.
- Did you find anything?
- I'm not sure yet.
Miss Udinov just blew up our operation in Mumbai.
We've moved beyond cosmetics now.
And your tolerance level.
At an all-time low.
We lost three subjects during the transfer.
That means we still have one.
And one is all I need.
We locked them out of the system, but it cost us any chance of tracing the signal back.
We have no idea who she's working with.
Right now, I'm more concerned with what's happening on the roof.
Team's in position.
All right, let me make a call first in case this goes bad.
Sir.
Didn't I already look at this?
That's my wife.
What is this, some kind of a joke?
No, Matthew, it's a choice.
What do you want?
Where's your car?
I can't believe that worked.
Don't doubt my mad photoshopping skills again.
- Nikita, you ready?
- For what?
Ready on your order.
How do you wanna play it?
Go dark, cut the power.
Tactical is storming the roof right now.
We need to get you outta here.
What's he doing here?
He'll get you out of Manhattan.
Head north.
I'll meet you there.
We'll switch cars.
Where?
At the staging area near the zoo.
Keep your head down.
I'll see you at the rendezvous point.
Thank you.
They all look the same.
Not like twins.
More like cousins.
Who were these men?
And why were they worth so much money?
Wait, I think I found something.
I saw the buyer using this weird piece of tech.
Looks like he left it behind.
What is it?
Some sort of handheld scanner.
He was waving it on them.
They were chipped.
Like a tracker.
Like livestock.
Let's give Ryan a call.
I don't know what the hell this is, but he's gonna want to see it.
Have they found Nikita yet?
Yes, I believe they know just where she is.
Yeah, we got somebody coming up through here right now.
- You leaving already?
- Yeah.
Mayor wants to have a chat down at Center Street.
Yeah, the mayor wants to make sure this doesn't stick to him.
But, hey, dispatch said that that reporter's okay.
Might finally get some good press outta that guy.
Yeah, I'm not that lucky.
People coming through.
They are cleared.
Dale Gordon's alive.
Maybe that means the FBI will let me keep my pension after they force me out for this mess.
Was that a tactical decision?
I wouldn't have hurt Dale.
An assassin with a heart of gold.
Too bad you didn't feel the same way about Spencer.
I didn't kill her.
I tried to warn her.
You kidnapped the President's aide to get yourself put on her schedule.
You used the tunnels to infiltrate yourself into the White House, somehow conning your way into the blue sector, all to try and warn her?
I did warn the President.
And then she shot herself in the head?
Autopsy report says the gun was fired at close range, possibly pressed up against her temple.
There were only two people in that room.
So if you didn't pull the trigger, that only leaves me with one other possible culprit.
Only if you have an open mind.
Let's say that I do.
You went there to warn her.
Still one problem with your story:
Why did you bring the gun?
Innocent people don't smuggle a gun into the Oval Office.
Out, let's go.
You and your friends haven't scared me off, you know.
I'll go home tonight and make sure that my wife is safe, but tomorrow, I'll start hunting you again.
Thought you were afraid of losing your job.
They could force me to retire, but that'll just give me more free time to dedicate to you.
I'll catch you.
And I will find out exactly what happened that day.
I want that too.
Talk to Dale Gordon.
Yeah, this kinda tech, it's gotta be the Shop.
They wanted a very specific type.
Four men is too small a sample to be useful as test subjects.
Wait.
That fits with what Nikita found.
Alex, I think you may have found the puzzle piece we were looking for.
That's great.
So what does it mean?
It can't be.
Yeah, I think we're gonna have to wait on that.
He's doing the thing.
Okay, well, when he's done reconstructing his big board of crazy, give me a call.
Sonya, I'm gonna clean up the scene.
I'll bring back the scanner to the hotel with me.
See you soon.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take that from you.
Owen?
How many times do I have to tell you?
It's Sam.
Authorities aren't releasing any new details, but they are searching for a black SUV with federal plates.
Can we finally agree that a squad is more than one person?
I'm ready to listen to you now.
Now?
Oh.
Nikita says you have some truth to tell me.
What is this?
Evidence.
Yeah, you're welcome.
I can't read German.
She's not here.
Can you track her?
I'm not getting an answer on that cell phone she was using.
Signal's a few blocks from your position, but it's not moving.
Be advised, FBI vehicle has been recovered.
Suspect is likely on foot.
She is wounded and probably in need of medical attention.
Birkhoff, give me that address.
It's been confirmed that Dale is safe and uninjured.
He's speaking with authorities right now in the command tent behind me.
He should be released shortly.
And we're being told that he plans on making a statement about the events that transpired here...
It's done.
Dale Gordon won't be an issue anymore.
Are you ready to implement the next phase?
We're on schedule.
We now have confirmation that Dale Gordon was inside the mobile command center at the time of the explosion.
Authorities believe that Nikita Mears may have planted the bomb on Gordon while she was holding him hostage.
Details are still coming in, but it is believed that Gordon, along with many fine men and women in the law enforcement community, are dead.
At this time, the suspect is still at large.
Authorities are asking citizens who live in the five boroughs to stay inside your homes.
Do not congregate on the streets.
If you notice anything suspicious, please call 911.
Do not attempt to investigate or approach on your own.
As today's events have shown,
Nikita Mears is highly dangerous and willing to kill perhaps anyone who gets in her way.
No one is safe as long as she's out there.

It's not my blood.
Don't worry.
We took the hit for you.
Michael.

[Birds chirping]
[Wolf panting]
Where in the world is Nikita Mears?
Today marks the first hundred days since the assassination of President Kathleen Spencer, and still the search drags on for her assailant, who bears the notorious label of the most wanted woman in the world.
But like most things we desperately want,
Ms. Mears continues to elude our grasp.
With me today is Deputy Director Matthew Graham, head of the FBI's task force on Mears.
Matt.
Dale.
Where the heck is she?
Come on, it's been a few months.
You can't blame us if we start to worry about our safety.
Your viewers have nothing to worry about.
Not my viewers, the American public, and they beg to differ.
Because if it's really that easy to kill the most protected person in the world, then none of us are safe.
Your viewers have nothing to worry about.
First of all, rest easy in the knowledge that wherever Nikita Mears is hiding, she is nowhere near the United States.
And today, the Bureau is reinforcing its commitment to capturing Nikita with an increase in the reward to $30 million for any information assisting in that capture.
30 million, okay.
So that's 5 million more than Osama bin Laden's bounty, and it only took ten years to find him.
So what, seven, eight years?
Well, Osama bin Laden had help.
He was being sheltered.
And you're saying she's not?
I can neither confirm nor deny any information that would jeopardize our investigation.
Okay then, let's speculate.
What would your guess be?
Because it's really hard to imagine how anyone could evade capture and survive all on their own.
[Sparks crackle, engine starts]
If she has help, maybe it's the same people who helped her escape the White House after shooting President Spencer inside the Oval Office.
Perhaps they're also members of the President's death squad.
There is no death squad.
So you're saying Senator Coto misspoke when he ordered an investigation of the executive death squad that Spencer was running with the late Commander Danforth, of which Nikita was alleged to be a member.
Explains how she got into the White House at least.
That is a separate investigation.
Can we at least agree that the word "squad" suggests--
If you want to talk about that investigation--
Can we at least agree that the word "squad"
suggests more than one person?
[Car approaches]
Hands in the air, right now!
Walk towards me.
[Siren whoops]
It is her.
Okay, on the ground, facedown, now!
Because here's what I speculate.
You don't want her to be found, because that means exposing what every American has grown to fear more than any foreign enemy, and that, sir, is the parallel state.
Hey, hey.
Can I take that as confirmation or denial?
It's her.
Boston field office is closest.
They're scrambling a chopper.
Yeah?
No, officer, I understand.
You did the right thing.
Just keep her pinned down until our tactical team arrives.
And under no circumstances should you try and approach her.
Sir, she's unarmed on the ground.
We got her.
Do not approach.
The feds want the collar.
Cuff her ass.
Put your hands behind your back.
[Grunts]

[Grunts]
I've just been informed that Deputy Director Graham has been called away on urgent business.
Urgent, convenient, whatever.
It won't stop me from asking the important questions
I promised you I'd ask.
For example, how is Nikita Mears alive in the first place?
According to the state of New Jersey, she was executed ten years ago for killing a Newark police officer.
Who the hell has the kind of juice to fake an execution?
As incredible as it sounds, the death of the President is just the tip of the iceberg.
We demand to know the whole truth.
And I promise you, I won't rest until I--
[TV mutes]
Has new material arrived ahead of schedule?
No.
Nikita has arrived.
Our drones spotted her crossing the border into the United States.
We've sent an anonymous tip to the local authorities.
Hmm.
Interactive television.
You don't seem surprised.
I knew she couldn't stay away forever.
But why now?
Why take the risk?
What's she after?
You.
And me.
We ruined her life.
Nikita's not the type to let something like that go.
But don't worry about her.
There are more disturbing things on television.
We rescued last night from these containers, much like the one I was in when I was taken--
Ms. Udinov has been considerably easier to track.
Yes, but who is tracking whom?
She's shut down three of our supply centers for human subjects in the last two months.
Cosmetic damage.
We only need to tolerate her for a little while longer.
I do this to help others like me.
It's Nikita who's alive past schedule.
What happened to us was terrible, but it does not have to define us.
Victim, survivor, meddling bitch.
That last one was bestowed on me from a slaver in Burundi last week.
[Laughter]
But it doesn't matter what they call me.
What matters is my message to those who are engaged in the buying and selling of human beings.
No matter how powerful or unstoppable you think you are, we will find you, we will expose you, and we will stop you.
[Applause]
That was a very powerful speech, Miss Udinov.
Thank you for coming and sharing with us.
I only hope it inspires others to join your fight.
I know how hard you've been working to stop trafficking in Mumbai.
I just wish there was more that I could do to help.
You could stop taking over their territory after you put them out of business.
That'd be helpful.
Okay, tracker's on her.
How's the signal?
Signal's strong, but...
Sonya, trust me.
She will lead us to the shop.
She's their favorite kind of trafficker, corrupt government official.
I just got a call from the guys.
Nikita has come out of hiding.
Seems she's back in the states.
What?
Where's Michael?
Where do you think?
Should we head back?
Finding the shop is the best way to find Amanda and clear Nikita's name.
But if she gets herself caught it could be too late.
No, she must have a plan.
And she'd want us to stick to ours.
You're gonna need a bigger coffee before we dive into your call sheet.
Everyone wants to find out what you know about Nikita's return.
Still no leads on her?
Just the car she left behind, courtesy of Barney Fife and his merry band of idiots.
Then everyone can wait.
I wanna keep my day clear.
If anything breaks, I wanna be ready to go on the air.
Okay.
New LCD TV just got in.
Thank you, Paula.

Put your hands down.
Have a seat.
How did you get in here?
This is a secure building.
There's cameras everywhere.
Just like the White House, Dale.
Feel safer now?
Do you?
You were a ghost.
No one could find you.
Now you're inside of a building filled with journalists desperate for a lead on you in the largest city of the most powerful nation on the planet who calls for your blood.
Stop writing copy, Dale, okay?
You're better at asking questions.
Why don't we just stick to that?
You--you want me to-- to interview you?
While the FBI is conducting the largest manhunt--
I'm not worried about the FBI.
There's only one man who can track me, and I doubt he's interested in trying.
[Radio chatter]
You can't keep moving trays around.
This is the fourth time I've had to renumber everything.
Excuse me, are you the commander on duty?
No, I'm just the one doing his job for him.
Well, I need a signature on this chain of custody form.
Who's transporting evidence now?
I haven't even had the chance-- it's the car.
Form needs to be signed before we can move it.
I'll go find Wilson.
Wait here.
[Camera shutter snapping]
She left a lot behind.
She had to make an escape plan on the fly.
No time to scrub the car.
What's this?
[Beeping]
Uniform policy for Kips Bay Creative Technology.
Looks like they do electronic sales and services.
Like repairs?
Repairs, new installations, but not for the general public.
They're contractors.
They work with local businesses in Midtown Manhattan.
Nikita stole the car in Vermont.
Any chance the owner works in Manhattan?
Lives and works in Shelburne, Vermont.
She's single and a pediatrician.
So no need for a uniform.
Service call.
Just like I taught her.
She's going undercover as the cable guy.
Whose cable guy?
Can you break into their systems?
I wanna take a look at today's orders.
[Beeping]
That one.
Payment type is cash upon pickup.
Who's that for?
Equinox News Network.
A new LCD TV for Dale Gordon.
Conspiracy guy.
E.N.N. is a huge corporation.
They don't pay cash.
They'd ask to be billed.
Nikita doesn't have time to fake that.
There's too much heat.
Whoa.
Guess who reported a break-in last night.
Kips Bay Creative Technology.
That's her.
All she needs to get through that door is an order form with Gordon's name on it and that uniform.
Dale Gordon's been asking a lot of questions about the President's death.
You think Nikita's looking for an ally?
Well, she had five allies, and she ditched us.
[Smack]
What?
Mikey's not the only one who gets to have resentment.
Nikita left to keep the spotlight and the danger away from us.
She was-- being Nikki, I know.
Act first, think later.
First degree martyr.
Birkhoff, I need you to get me into the E.N.N. building.
Think we should land close in case they need a pickup?
Yep.
The President of the United States committed suicide?
I know it sounds crazy.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, Big Foot, the Loch Ness monster, UFOs-- that sounds crazy.
What you're talking about--
Is the truth.
That's what you seek to find, right?
You know, you ask good questions, Dale, but you don't ask the right questions.
Like what, what would make the President pick up a gun and shoot herself in the head?
Sure has me curious.
So you don't know why?
That's--that's great.
I know that the President was not the only one acting out of character that day.
The lead Secret Service man, he gave me the gun.
He's working with the people who are setting me up.
Single shot to the head.
Make it count.
John Stirling?
He was a 20-year veteran.
He protected three presidents.
Someone like that wouldn't-- wouldn't what?
Do what he did?
Like Kathleen Spencer?
Or Karl Jaeger?
Karl who?
German intelligence officer.
Shot his own men at the G20 summit in Toronto.
You covered it.
He's the only person I can think of who's also acting out of character.
But unlike Stirling and the President,
I was able to investigate Jaeger.
I found this.
Yeah, I can't read German.
The B.N.D. officer claims that the Toronto police corrupted the blood samples.
He chalks it up to sloppy forensics, but I think it's actually a clue.
What if there was something in his blood that made him act differently that day?
What if there was something in the President's blood that did the same?
Nobody would think to look-- What kind of something?
And how do we even find out?
Your source at the FBI can get us a copy of her autopsy results.
What FBI source?
- You've always said--
- I never said.
I never said.
I implied and let the people assume.
"Sources familiar with the investigation"
sounds a lot more credible than "anonymous person who texts me."
Anonymous?
I got sent an envelope with a phone inside, and then I started getting the text messages.
At first, I thought it might be you, but then, I don't know, it just got weird.
"I see you found her arrest record.
"Such an unfortunate mug shot.
"That Nikita wouldn't have made it within 100 yards of the White House--"
[sirens blare]
It's a trap.
You were the bait she needed.
Who?
Someone you never want to meet.
Welcome home, Nikita.
Priya's here.
She brought some hired guns to watch her back.
This has gotta be it.
I'm not seeing any trucks though.
You think the shipment's inside the warehouse?
I've got two vehicles approaching.
That's our buyer.
Sending images now.
Who do you think he is?
Another sales rep for the Shop, like Heidecker?
Only one way to find out.
Have Birkhoff run him through facial recognition.
This guy shows up nowhere, we'll know he's Shop.
Just sent you a photo of the Mumbai buyer.
Can you run it through Shadownet's facial recog?
Hey, babe.
Nice to hear your voice too.
I'm a little busy at the moment.
We think this man might work for the Shop and may be our best hope of clearing Nikita's name.
What's more important than that?
[Beeping]
Uh, keeping her from getting shot in the next ten minutes.
[Sirens blaring]
Lock it down.
Six-block perimeter.
I think we're good to go.
Remember, if someone talks to you, you answer them but you keep moving.
Sorry it took so long.
The elevators aren't working.
Uh, you're the one who delivered the TV.
Why are you still here?
Don't worry about it, Paula.
Mr. Gordon, FBI is looking for you.
Oh, my God, you're Nikita.
It's Nikita!
[Gasping]
Let us walk outta here, and he'll be fine.
[Excited chatter]
Got her!
Sixth floor.
She's with Dale, not too far from the elevators.
How do you know?
The entire newsroom just announced it online.
Blue wolf, this is Red wolf.
I'm on site.
It's a party down here.
Patch me through to lone wolf.
We're trying.
Does Dale have a phone on him?
Nikita must have made him dump it.
Try an extension in the room.
Feds can listen in.
Room full of phones and no way to reach her.
That's real smart.
Yes.
Yes, I am.
Those Nikita posts-- most of them are being posted from smart phones.
[Cell phones ringing]
Um...
It says it's for you.
Pick it up, Dale.
This is Dale Gordon.
Nikita can't talk right now.
Is that the FBI?
Do you know someone named Michael?
So who's Michael, another member of the President's death squad?
Michael?
I'm downstairs, here to help you exfil.
On site?
Damn it.
Michael, I left because you couldn't be involved in this.
Yeah, you left.
So you don't get a vote anymore.
Nerd?
And, you know, we're not cocker spaniels.
You can't tell us to sit and just expect us to obey your command.
Okay.
Okay, fine.
You're here, you wanna help?
Can you hack into the building?
We're already in.
Now if we can get you to the north side...
[Lock clicks] No, this is good.
Thermal scanners won't be able to get a good read in here.
This is the perfect place to be surrounded.
What are you talking about?
We make the FBI think that I'm in here with Dale, that he's my hostage.
While they're trying to breach, find me a way out of the building.
Michael, you clear an exfil point.
Birkhoff, you clear the cameras.
Oh, my God, she does expect us to obey her.
So I stay here?
I like this plan.
I need you to do something else for me.
Take this, give it to the FBI, along with the cell phone in your office.
I'm talking about the very top, not some random guy in a windbreaker, okay?
This is all the evidence we have.
The FBI has its sights set on you.
How can you trust them?
I trust them to be the FBI.
We give them evidence, they'll investigate.
Look, even if you don't believe me--
I don't know what to believe, but I don't think you killed the President.
I'll be in touch.
Remember, I get the exclusive.
[Dial tone trills]
I can't have the press filming from the surrounding buildings.
Get them out of those windows.
Boss, we have no one to send.
Our cupboard's bare.
The loading dock--we already secured that tightly.
Send those guys.
Birkhoff, make the call.
[Phone rings]
- Nikita?
- She's calling from the roof.
You wanna take this?
No, you start.
You pass her up to me if she escalates.
Hi, Nikita.
My name is Kramer.
Can we talk?
What would you like to talk about, Kramer?
I'd like to talk about Dale.
Is he okay?
Tell him how you are, Dale.
Oh, my God, you gotta get me outta here.
Just give her what she wants.
I don't wanna die.
I wanna live.
Amateurs.
They always oversell.
You got what you wanted.
Here's what I want.
Nikita, do you realize your situation?
The building is locked down.
Our tactical team is moving into position.
There is no way off that roof.
Yes, but I've got Dale Gordon.
If you come in, he dies.
So what do you want?
I'm on a rooftop, idiot.
What do you think I want?
She wants a helicopter.
[Mouths words]
It's gonna take some time.
Let me know when you have it.
She was last spotted on the sixth floor.
The building is 14 stories.
She went up eight floors to get to the roof?
That doesn't make any kind of tactical sense.
Why go up?
Why call?
All it did was tell us where she was.
Or where she wanted us to think she was.
But to do that...
Someone is helping her.
All right, straight ahead, there's a large exhaust vent.
Take off the access panel.
You should be able to crawl through.
So what's the plan once you escape the building?
You coming back or are you gonna run away again?
The heat hasn't died down yet.
I don't want you guys in that kinda danger, even though you seem determined to keep putting yourselves there.
Huh.
What did you expect us to do?
I thought that if I wasn't around, you could move on with your lives.
Move on?
[Chuckles]
Yeah, nobody's moving on.
Mikey's gone for weeks at a time trying to pick up on your trail.
Ryan's created a whole new wall of crazy conspiracy theories.
Alex thinks she's Batman, which I guess makes my girlfriend Robin.
All this to help clear your name.
I didn't ask for that.
Yeah, well, we didn't ask for you to leave, but you did that anyway.
Look, Nikki, you're gonna wind up in an alley somewhere, alone and dying, unless you stop running and let us help you.
You know what would help me right now?
Turn off the spinning blades of decapitation, would you?
Almost there.
I only have a short window of time before the system sends out an alert that it's malfunctioning.
Wouldn't want the FBI to-- [beeping]
They dumped me.
Nikki, I'm locked out of the system.
Guess that means I'm locked in.
[Radio chatter]
Can you get back in?
No, they must have figured out we were in the system.
We're toast.
So who's running the show here?
Deputy Director Matthew Graham.
Graham, okay.
Listen, I need--
Birkhoff.
Hang on, Mikey.
She's trying to call me.
Do not answer her.
We already played it her way.
We don't have time.
Now get me everything you can find on Graham.
Guys, I'm trapped in a building full of FBI agents here.
Somebody please talk to me.
Hey, would you please talk to her before she loses patience and decides to try and shoot her way through the side of the building?
What happens if I shoot the fan out?
Uh, Birkhoff says do not shoot the fan.
Ryan.
All right, what's the plan to get me outta here then?
Uh, in progress.
I'm kinda curious about the plan that got you in there.
Dale Gordon?
Karl Jaeger.
The B.N.D. guy?
You found a connection.
The police took evidence from the scene where Jaeger was shot, and the blood samples showed abnormal "B" and "T" cells.
But then when they did the autopsy, the blood work was fine.
Germans just assumed that the samples were contaminated.
But I don't know, Ryan, what if there was something else?
Something in the blood?
Like a drug.
The blood on the scene would have traces of it.
It could've skewed the results.
But by the time they did the autopsy, the drug would be out of his system, so the blood seemed clear.
Amanda does like drugs, especially ones that modify behavior.
Yeah, I ran that, but there's some snags, mostly with time line.
How'd you figure this Jaeger thing out?
I see the shipment.
It's only four men.
Did you say four?
Traffickers usually pay less than $200 a head for men, and Priya's supposed to earn--
10 million.
So unless these guys can spin straw into gold, something else is going on here.
I'm going in for a closer look.
Hmm.
I find the shipment to be acceptable.
Authorize the transfer of funds.
[Beeping]
Let's go.
Get in the car.
I don't know when I'll be able to get you the others.
Don't bother.
We'll take your partial shipment, but we won't be doing business with you again.
This is not my fault.
It's this-- this Udinov girl.
I couldn't risk taking--
What does that say, hmm?
Without risk, there is no reward.
The buyer's little friend is headed my way.
Looks like he's on a comm device.
If he has remote support, they may have picked up your heat signature.
- So I've been made?
- Yes.
[Groans]
[Gunfire]
[Groaning]
[Gunfire]
[Gunfire]
[Gunfire]

[Tires squeal]
The buyer escaped.
Looks like he took one of the men with him.
- Did you find anything?
- I'm not sure yet.
[Heavy breathing]
Miss Udinov just blew up our operation in Mumbai.
We've moved beyond cosmetics now.
And your tolerance level.
At an all-time low.
We lost three subjects during the transfer.
That means we still have one.
And one is all I need.
We locked them out of the system, but it cost us any chance of tracing the signal back.
We have no idea who she's working with.
Right now, I'm more concerned with what's happening on the roof.
Team's in position.
All right, let me make a call first in case this goes bad.
Sir.
Didn't I already look at this?
That's my wife.
What is this, some kind of a joke?
No, Matthew, it's a choice.
What do you want?
Where's your car?
I can't believe that worked.
Don't doubt my mad photoshopping skills again.
Nikita, you ready?
For what?
Ready on your order.
How do you wanna play it?
Go dark, cut the power.
Tactical's storming the roof right now.
We need to get you outta here.
What's he doing here?
He'll get you out of Manhattan.
Head north.
I'll meet you there.
We'll switch cars.
Where?
At the staging area near the zoo.
Keep your head down.
I'll see you at the rendezvous point.
Thank you.
They all look the same.
Not like twins.
More like cousins.
Who were these men?
And why were they worth so much money?
Wait, I think I found something.
I saw the buyer using this weird piece of tech.
Looks like he left it behind.
What is it?
Some sort of handheld scanner.
He was waving it on them.
[Beeping]
They were chipped.
Like a tracker.
Like livestock.
Let's give Ryan a call.
I don't know what the hell this is, but he's gonna want to see it.
Have they found Nikita yet?
[TV announcer in background]
Yes, I believe they know just where she is.
[Radio chatter]
Yeah, we got somebody coming up through here right now.
You leaving already?
Yeah.
Mayor wants to have a chat down at Center Street.
Yeah, the mayor wants to make sure this doesn't stick to him.
But, hey, dispatch said that that reporter's okay.
Might finally get some good press outta that guy.
Yeah, I'm not that lucky.
Dale Gordon's alive.
Maybe that means the FBI will let me keep my pension after they force me out for this mess.
Was that a tactical decision?
I wouldn't have hurt Dale.
An assassin with a heart of gold.
Too bad you didn't feel the same way about Spencer.
I didn't kill her.
I tried to warn her.
You kidnapped the President's aide to get yourself put on her schedule.
You used the tunnels to infiltrate yourself into the White House, somehow conning your way into the blue sector, all to try and warn her?
I did warn the President.
And then she shot herself in the head?
Autopsy report says the gun was fired at close range, possibly pressed up against her temple.
There were only two people in that room.
So if you didn't pull the trigger, that only leaves me with one other possible culprit.
Only if you have an open mind.
Let's say that I do.
You went there to warn her.
Still one problem with your story:
Why did you bring the gun?
Innocent people don't smuggle a gun into the Oval Office.
Out, let's go.
You and your friends haven't scared me off, you know.
I'll go home tonight and make sure that my wife is safe, but tomorrow, I'll start hunting you again.
Thought you were afraid of losing your job.
They could force me to retire, but that'll just give me more free time to dedicate to you.
I'll catch you.
And I will find out exactly what happened that day.
I want that too.
Talk to Dale Gordon.
[Gunshots]
[Tires squeal]
Yeah, this kinda tech, it's gotta be the Shop.
They wanted a very specific type.
Four men is too small a sample to be useful as test subjects.
Wait.
That fits with what Nikita found.
Alex, I think you may have found the puzzle piece we were looking for.
That's great.
So what does it mean?
It can't be.
Yeah, I think we're gonna have to wait on that.
He's doing the thing.
Okay, well, when he's done reconstructing his big board of crazy, give me a call.
Sonya, I'm gonna clean up the scene.
I'll bring back the scanner to the hotel with me.
See you soon.
[Gun clicks]
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take that from you.
Owen?
How many times do I have to tell you?
It's Sam.
Authorities aren't releasing any new details, but they are searching for a black SUV with federal plates.
The vehicle was last seen heading north near the cruise ship terminus at 51st street.
If you spot-- [car alarm blares]
[Groaning]
About a dozen downtown businesses were boarded up...
Can we finally agree that a squad is more than one person?
I'm ready to listen to you now.
Now?
Oh.
Nikita says you have some truth to tell me.
What is this?
Evidence.
Yeah, you're welcome.
I can't read German.
She's not here.
Can you track her?
I'm not getting an answer on that cell phone she was using.
Signal's a few blocks from your position, but it's not moving.
Be advised, FBI vehicle has been recovered.
Suspect is likely on foot.
She is wounded and probably in need of medical attention.
Birkhoff, give me that address.
It's been confirmed that Dale is safe and uninjured.
He's speaking with authorities right now in the command tent behind me.
He should be released shortly.
And we're being told that he plans on making a statement about the events that transpired here--
[screaming and clamor over TV]
[Line rings]
It's done.
Dale Gordon won't be an issue anymore.
Are you ready to implement the next phase?
We're on schedule.
♪
We now have confirmation that Dale Gordon was inside the mobile command center at the time of the explosion.
Authorities believe that Nikita Mears may have planted the bomb on Gordon while she was holding him hostage.
Details are still coming in, but it is believed that Gordon, along with many fine men and women in the law enforcement community, are dead.
At this time, the suspect is still at large.
Authorities are asking citizens who live in the five boroughs to stay inside your homes.
Do not congregate on the streets.
If you notice anything suspicious, please call 911.
Do not attempt to investigate or approach on your own.
As today's events have shown,
Nikita Mears is highly dangerous and willing to kill perhaps anyone who gets in her way.
No one is safe as long as she's out there.

It's not my blood.
Don't worry.
We took the hit for you.
Michael.

[Birds chirping]
[Wolf panting]
Where in the world is Nikita Mears?
Today marks the first hundred days since the assassination of President Kathleen Spencer, and still the search drags on for her assailant, who bears the notorious label of the most wanted woman in the world.
But like most things we desperately want,
Ms. Mears continues to elude our grasp.
With me today is Deputy Director Matthew Graham, head of the FBI's task force on Mears.
Matt.
Dale.
Where the heck is she?
Come on, it's been a few months.
You can't blame us if we start to worry about our safety.
Your viewers have nothing to worry about.
Not my viewers, the American public, and they beg to differ.
Because if it's really that easy to kill the most protected person in the world, then none of us are safe.
Your viewers have nothing to worry about.
First of all, rest easy in the knowledge that wherever Nikita Mears is hiding, she is nowhere near the United States.
And today, the Bureau is reinforcing its commitment to capturing Nikita with an increase in the reward to $30 million for any information assisting in that capture.
30 million, okay.
So that's 5 million more than Osama bin Laden's bounty, and it only took ten years to find him.
So what, seven, eight years?
Well, Osama bin Laden had help.
He was being sheltered.
And you're saying she's not?
I can neither confirm nor deny any information that would jeopardize our investigation.
Okay then, let's speculate.
What would your guess be?
Because it's really hard to imagine how anyone could evade capture and survive all on their own.
[Sparks crackle, engine starts]
If she has help, maybe it's the same people who helped her escape the White House after shooting President Spencer inside the Oval Office.
Perhaps they're also members of the President's death squad.
There is no death squad.
So you're saying Senator Coto misspoke when he ordered an investigation of the executive death squad that Spencer was running with the late Commander Danforth, of which Nikita was alleged to be a member.
Explains how she got into the White House at least.
That is a separate investigation.
Can we at least agree that the word "squad" suggests--
If you want to talk about that investigation--
Can we at least agree that the word "squad"
suggests more than one person?
[Car approaches]
Hands in the air, right now!
Walk towards me.
[Siren whoops]
It is her.
Okay, on the ground, facedown, now!
Because here's what I speculate.
You don't want her to be found, because that means exposing what every American has grown to fear more than any foreign enemy, and that, sir, is the parallel state.
Hey, hey.
Can I take that as confirmation or denial?
It's her.
Boston field office is closest.
They're scrambling a chopper.
Yeah?
No, officer, I understand.
You did the right thing.
Just keep her pinned down until our tactical team arrives.
And under no circumstances should you try and approach her.
Sir, she's unarmed on the ground.
We got her.
Do not approach.
The feds want the collar.
Cuff her ass.
Put your hands behind your back.

I've just been informed that Deputy Director Graham has been called away on urgent business.
Urgent, convenient, whatever.
It won't stop me from asking the important questions
I promised you I'd ask.
For example, how is Nikita Mears alive in the first place?
According to the state of New Jersey, she was executed ten years ago for killing a Newark police officer.
Who the hell has the kind of juice to fake an execution?
As incredible as it sounds, the death of the President is just the tip of the iceberg.
We demand to know the whole truth.
And I promise you, I won't rest until I--
[TV mutes]
Has new material arrived ahead of schedule?
No.
Nikita has arrived.
Our drones spotted her crossing the border into the United States.
We've sent an anonymous tip to the local authorities.
Hmm.
Interactive television.
You don't seem surprised.
I knew she couldn't stay away forever.
But why now?
Why take the risk?
What's she after?
You.
And me.
We ruined her life.
Nikita's not the type to let something like that go.
But don't worry about her.
There are more disturbing things on television.
We rescued last night from these containers, much like the one I was in when I was taken--
Ms. Udinov has been considerably easier to track.
Yes, but who is tracking whom?
She's shut down three of our supply centers for human subjects in the last two months.
Cosmetic damage.
We only need to tolerate her for a little while longer.
I do this to help others like me.
It's Nikita who's alive past schedule.
What happened to us was terrible, but it does not have to define us.
Victim, survivor, meddling bitch.
That last one was bestowed on me from a slaver in Burundi last week.
[Laughter]
But it doesn't matter what they call me.
What matters is my message to those who are engaged in the buying and selling of human beings.
No matter how powerful or unstoppable you think you are, we will find you, we will expose you, and we will stop you.
[Applause]
That was a very powerful speech, Miss Udinov.
Thank you for coming and sharing with us.
I only hope it inspires others to join your fight.
I know how hard you've been working to stop trafficking in Mumbai.
I just wish there was more that I could do to help.
You could stop taking over their territory after you put them out of business.
That'd be helpful.
Okay, tracker's on her.
How's the signal?
Signal's strong, but...
Sonya, trust me.
She will lead us to the shop.
She's their favorite kind of trafficker, corrupt government official.
I just got a call from the guys.
Nikita has come out of hiding.
Seems she's back in the states.
What?
Where's Michael?
Where do you think?
Should we head back?
Finding the shop is the best way to find Amanda and clear Nikita's name.
But if she gets herself caught it could be too late.
No, she must have a plan.
And she'd want us to stick to ours.
You're gonna need a bigger coffee before we dive into your call sheet.
Everyone wants to find out what you know about Nikita's return.
Still no leads on her?
Just the car she left behind, courtesy of Barney Fife and his merry band of idiots.
Then everyone can wait.
I wanna keep my day clear.
If anything breaks, I wanna be ready to go on the air.
Okay.
New LCD TV just got in.
Thank you, Paula.

Put your hands down.
Have a seat.
How did you get in here?
This is a secure building.
There's cameras everywhere.
Just like the White House, Dale.
Feel safer now?
Do you?
You were a ghost.
No one could find you.
Now you're inside of a building filled with journalists desperate for a lead on you in the largest city of the most powerful nation on the planet who calls for your blood.
Stop writing copy, Dale, okay?
You're better at asking questions.
Why don't we just stick to that?
You--you want me to-- to interview you?
While the FBI is conducting the largest manhunt--
I'm not worried about the FBI.
There's only one man who can track me, and I doubt he's interested in trying.
[Radio chatter]
You can't keep moving trays around.
This is the fourth time I've had to renumber everything.
Excuse me, are you the commander on duty?
No, I'm just the one doing his job for him.
Well, I need a signature on this chain of custody form.
Who's transporting evidence now?
I haven't even had the chance-- it's the car.
Form needs to be signed before we can move it.
I'll go find Wilson.
Wait here.
[Camera shutter snapping]
She left a lot behind.
She had to make an escape plan on the fly.
No time to scrub the car.
What's this?
[Beeping]
Uniform policy for Kips Bay Creative Technology.
Looks like they do electronic sales and services.
Like repairs?
Repairs, new installations, but not for the general public.
They're contractors.
They work with local businesses in Midtown Manhattan.
Nikita stole the car in Vermont.
Any chance the owner works in Manhattan?
Lives and works in Shelburne, Vermont.
She's single and a pediatrician.
So no need for a uniform.
Service call.
Just like I taught her.
She's going undercover as the cable guy.
Whose cable guy?
Can you break into their systems?
I wanna take a look at today's orders.
[Beeping]
That one.
Payment type is cash upon pickup.
Who's that for?
Equinox News Network.
A new LCD TV for Dale Gordon.
Conspiracy guy.
E.N.N. is a huge corporation.
They don't pay cash.
They'd ask to be billed.
Nikita doesn't have time to fake that.
There's too much heat.
Whoa.
Guess who reported a break-in last night.
Kips Bay Creative Technology.
That's her.
All she needs to get through that door is an order form with Gordon's name on it and that uniform.
Dale Gordon's been asking a lot of questions about the President's death.
You think Nikita's looking for an ally?
Well, she had five allies, and she ditched us.
[Smack]
What?
Mikey's not the only one who gets to have resentment.
Nikita left to keep the spotlight and the danger away from us.
She was-- being Nikki, I know.
Act first, think later.
First degree martyr.
Birkhoff, I need you to get me into the E.N.N. building.
Think we should land close in case they need a pickup?
Yep.
The President of the United States committed suicide?
I know it sounds crazy.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, Big Foot, the Loch Ness monster, UFOs-- that sounds crazy.
What you're talking about--
Is the truth.
That's what you seek to find, right?
You know, you ask good questions, Dale, but you don't ask the right questions.
Like what, what would make the President pick up a gun and shoot herself in the head?
Sure has me curious.
So you don't know why?
That's--that's great.
I know that the President was not the only one acting out of character that day.
The lead Secret Service man, he gave me the gun.
He's working with the people who are setting me up.
Single shot to the head.
Make it count.
John Stirling?
He was a 20-year veteran.
He protected three presidents.
Someone like that wouldn't-- wouldn't what?
Do what he did?
Like Kathleen Spencer?
Or Karl Jaeger?
Karl who?
German intelligence officer.
Shot his own men at the G20 summit in Toronto.
You covered it.
He's the only person I can think of who's also acting out of character.
But unlike Stirling and the President,
I was able to investigate Jaeger.
I found this.
Yeah, I can't read German.
The B.N.D. officer claims that the Toronto police corrupted the blood samples.
He chalks it up to sloppy forensics, but I think it's actually a clue.
What if there was something in his blood that made him act differently that day?
What if there was something in the President's blood that did the same?
Nobody would think to look-- What kind of something?
And how do we even find out?
Your source at the FBI can get us a copy of her autopsy results.
What FBI source?
- You've always said--
- I never said.
I never said.
I implied and let the people assume.
"Sources familiar with the investigation"
sounds a lot more credible than "anonymous person who texts me."
Anonymous?
I got sent an envelope with a phone inside, and then I started getting the text messages.
At first, I thought it might be you, but then, I don't know, it just got weird.
"I see you found her arrest record.
"Such an unfortunate mug shot.
"That Nikita wouldn't have made it within 100 yards of the White House--"
[sirens blare]
It's a trap.
You were the bait she needed.
Who?
Someone you never want to meet.
Welcome home, Nikita.
Priya's here.
She brought some hired guns to watch her back.
This has gotta be it.
I'm not seeing any trucks though.
You think the shipment's inside the warehouse?
I've got two vehicles approaching.
That's our buyer.
Sending images now.
Who do you think he is?
Another sales rep for the Shop, like Heidecker?
Only one way to find out.
Have Birkhoff run him through facial recognition.
This guy shows up nowhere, we'll know he's Shop.
Just sent you a photo of the Mumbai buyer.
Can you run it through Shadownet's facial recog?
Hey, babe.
Nice to hear your voice too.
I'm a little busy at the moment.
We think this man might work for the Shop and may be our best hope of clearing Nikita's name.
What's more important than that?
[Beeping]
Uh, keeping her from getting shot in the next ten minutes.
[Sirens blaring]
Lock it down.
Six-block perimeter.
I think we're good to go.
Remember, if someone talks to you, you answer them but you keep moving.
Sorry it took so long.
The elevators aren't working.
Uh, you're the one who delivered the TV.
Why are you still here?
Don't worry about it, Paula.
Mr. Gordon, FBI is looking for you.
Oh, my God, you're Nikita.
It's Nikita!
[Gasping]
Let us walk outta here, and he'll be fine.
[Excited chatter]
Got her!
Sixth floor.
She's with Dale, not too far from the elevators.
How do you know?
The entire newsroom just announced it online.
Blue wolf, this is Red wolf.
I'm on site.
It's a party down here.
Patch me through to lone wolf.
We're trying.
Does Dale have a phone on him?
Nikita must have made him dump it.
Try an extension in the room.
Feds can listen in.
Room full of phones and no way to reach her.
That's real smart.
Yes.
Yes, I am.
Those Nikita posts-- most of them are being posted from smart phones.
[Cell phones ringing]
Um...
It says it's for you.
Pick it up, Dale.
This is Dale Gordon.
Nikita can't talk right now.
Is that the FBI?
Do you know someone named Michael?
So who's Michael, another member of the President's death squad?
Michael?
I'm downstairs, here to help you exfil.
On site?
Damn it.
Michael, I left because you couldn't be involved in this.
Yeah, you left.
So you don't get a vote anymore.
Nerd?
And, you know, we're not cocker spaniels.
You can't tell us to sit and just expect us to obey your command.
Okay.
Okay, fine.
You're here, you wanna help?
Can you hack into the building?
We're already in.
Now if we can get you to the north side...
[Lock clicks] No, this is good.
Thermal scanners won't be able to get a good read in here.
This is the perfect place to be surrounded.
What are you talking about?
We make the FBI think that I'm in here with Dale, that he's my hostage.
While they're trying to breach, find me a way out of the building.
Michael, you clear an exfil point.
Birkhoff, you clear the cameras.
Oh, my God, she does expect us to obey her.
So I stay here?
I like this plan.
I need you to do something else for me.
Take this, give it to the FBI, along with the cell phone in your office.
I'm talking about the very top, not some random guy in a windbreaker, okay?
This is all the evidence we have.
The FBI has its sights set on you.
How can you trust them?
I trust them to be the FBI.
We give them evidence, they'll investigate.
Look, even if you don't believe me--
I don't know what to believe, but I don't think you killed the President.
I'll be in touch.
Remember, I get the exclusive.
[Dial tone trills]
I can't have the press filming from the surrounding buildings.
Get them out of those windows.
Boss, we have no one to send.
Our cupboard's bare.
The loading dock--we already secured that tightly.
Send those guys.
Birkhoff, make the call.
[Phone rings]
- Nikita?
- She's calling from the roof.
You wanna take this?
No, you start.
You pass her up to me if she escalates.
Hi, Nikita.
My name is Kramer.
Can we talk?
What would you like to talk about, Kramer?
I'd like to talk about Dale.
Is he okay?
Tell him how you are, Dale.
Oh, my God, you gotta get me outta here.
Just give her what she wants.
I don't wanna die.
I wanna live.
Amateurs.
They always oversell.
You got what you wanted.
Here's what I want.
Nikita, do you realize your situation?
The building is locked down.
Our tactical team is moving into position.
There is no way off that roof.
Yes, but I've got Dale Gordon.
If you come in, he dies.
So what do you want?
I'm on a rooftop, idiot.
What do you think I want?
She wants a helicopter.
[Mouths words]
It's gonna take some time.
Let me know when you have it.
She was last spotted on the sixth floor.
The building is 14 stories.
She went up eight floors to get to the roof?
That doesn't make any kind of tactical sense.
Why go up?
Why call?
All it did was tell us where she was.
Or where she wanted us to think she was.
But to do that...
Someone is helping her.
All right, straight ahead, there's a large exhaust vent.
Take off the access panel.
You should be able to crawl through.
So what's the plan once you escape the building?
You coming back or are you gonna run away again?
The heat hasn't died down yet.
I don't want you guys in that kinda danger, even though you seem determined to keep putting yourselves there.
Huh.
What did you expect us to do?
I thought that if I wasn't around, you could move on with your lives.
Move on?
[Chuckles]
Yeah, nobody's moving on.
Mikey's gone for weeks at a time trying to pick up on your trail.
Ryan's created a whole new wall of crazy conspiracy theories.
Alex thinks she's Batman, which I guess makes my girlfriend Robin.
All this to help clear your name.
I didn't ask for that.
Yeah, well, we didn't ask for you to leave, but you did that anyway.
Look, Nikki, you're gonna wind up in an alley somewhere, alone and dying, unless you stop running and let us help you.
You know what would help me right now?
Turn off the spinning blades of decapitation, would you?
Almost there.
I only have a short window of time before the system sends out an alert that it's malfunctioning.
Wouldn't want the FBI to-- [beeping]
They dumped me.
Nikki, I'm locked out of the system.
Guess that means I'm locked in.
[Radio chatter]
Can you get back in?
No, they must have figured out we were in the system.
We're toast.
So who's running the show here?
Deputy Director Matthew Graham.
Graham, okay.
Listen, I need--
Birkhoff.
Hang on, Mikey.
She's trying to call me.
Do not answer her.
We already played it her way.
We don't have time.
Now get me everything you can find on Graham.
Guys, I'm trapped in a building full of FBI agents here.
Somebody please talk to me.
Hey, would you please talk to her before she loses patience and decides to try and shoot her way through the side of the building?
What happens if I shoot the fan out?
Uh, Birkhoff says do not shoot the fan.
Ryan.
All right, what's the plan to get me outta here then?
Uh, in progress.
I'm kinda curious about the plan that got you in there.
Dale Gordon?
Karl Jaeger.
The B.N.D. guy?
You found a connection.
The police took evidence from the scene where Jaeger was shot, and the blood samples showed abnormal "B" and "T" cells.
But then when they did the autopsy, the blood work was fine.
Germans just assumed that the samples were contaminated.
But I don't know, Ryan, what if there was something else?
Something in the blood?
Like a drug.
The blood on the scene would have traces of it.
It could've skewed the results.
But by the time they did the autopsy, the drug would be out of his system, so the blood seemed clear.
Amanda does like drugs, especially ones that modify behavior.
Yeah, I ran that, but there's some snags, mostly with time line.
How'd you figure this Jaeger thing out?
I see the shipment.
It's only four men.
Did you say four?
Traffickers usually pay less than $200 a head for men, and Priya's supposed to earn--
10 million.
So unless these guys can spin straw into gold, something else is going on here.
I'm going in for a closer look.
Hmm.
I find the shipment to be acceptable.
Authorize the transfer of funds.
[Beeping]
Let's go.
Get in the car.
I don't know when I'll be able to get you the others.
Don't bother.
We'll take your partial shipment, but we won't be doing business with you again.
This is not my fault.
It's this-- this Udinov girl.
I couldn't risk taking--
What does that say, hmm?
Without risk, there is no reward.
The buyer's little friend is headed my way.
Looks like he's on a comm device.
If he has remote support, they may have picked up your heat signature.
- So I've been made?
- Yes.
[Groans]
[Gunfire]
[Groaning]
[Gunfire]
[Gunfire]
[Gunfire]
[Gunfire]
[Tires squeal]
The buyer escaped.
Looks like he took one of the men with him.
- Did you find anything?
- I'm not sure yet.
[Heavy breathing]
Miss Udinov just blew up our operation in Mumbai.
We've moved beyond cosmetics now.
And your tolerance level.
At an all-time low.
We lost three subjects during the transfer.
That means we still have one.
And one is all I need.
We locked them out of the system, but it cost us any chance of tracing the signal back.
We have no idea who she's working with.
Right now, I'm more concerned with what's happening on the roof.
Team's in position.
All right, let me make a call first in case this goes bad.
Sir.
Didn't I already look at this?
That's my wife.
What is this, some kind of a joke?
No, Matthew, it's a choice.
What do you want?
Where's your car?
I can't believe that worked.
Don't doubt my mad photoshopping skills again.
Nikita, you ready?
For what?
Ready on your order.
How do you wanna play it?
Go dark, cut the power.
Tactical's storming the roof right now.
We need to get you outta here.
What's he doing here?
He'll get you out of Manhattan.
Head north.
I'll meet you there.
We'll switch cars.
Where?
At the staging area near the zoo.
Keep your head down.
I'll see you at the rendezvous point.
Thank you.
They all look the same.
Not like twins.
More like cousins.
Who were these men?
And why were they worth so much money?
Wait, I think I found something.
I saw the buyer using this weird piece of tech.
Looks like he left it behind.
What is it?
Some sort of handheld scanner.
He was waving it on them.
[Beeping]
They were chipped.
Like a tracker.
Like livestock.
Let's give Ryan a call.
I don't know what the hell this is, but he's gonna want to see it.
Have they found Nikita yet?
[TV announcer in background]
Yes, I believe they know just where she is.
[Radio chatter]
Yeah, we got somebody coming up through here right now.
You leaving already?
Yeah.
Mayor wants to have a chat down at Center Street.
Yeah, the mayor wants to make sure this doesn't stick to him.
But, hey, dispatch said that that reporter's okay.
Might finally get some good press outta that guy.
Yeah, I'm not that lucky.
Dale Gordon's alive.
Maybe that means the FBI will let me keep my pension after they force me out for this mess.
Was that a tactical decision?
I wouldn't have hurt Dale.
An assassin with a heart of gold.
Too bad you didn't feel the same way about Spencer.
I didn't kill her.
I tried to warn her.
You kidnapped the President's aide to get yourself put on her schedule.
You used the tunnels to infiltrate yourself into the White House, somehow conning your way into the blue sector, all to try and warn her?
I did warn the President.
And then she shot herself in the head?
Autopsy report says the gun was fired at close range, possibly pressed up against her temple.
There were only two people in that room.
So if you didn't pull the trigger, that only leaves me with one other possible culprit.
Only if you have an open mind.
Let's say that I do.
You went there to warn her.
Still one problem with your story:
Why did you bring the gun?
Innocent people don't smuggle a gun into the Oval Office.
Out, let's go.
You and your friends haven't scared me off, you know.
I'll go home tonight and make sure that my wife is safe, but tomorrow, I'll start hunting you again.
Thought you were afraid of losing your job.
They could force me to retire, but that'll just give me more free time to dedicate to you.
I'll catch you.
And I will find out exactly what happened that day.
I want that too.
Talk to Dale Gordon.
[Gunshots]
[Tires squeal]
Yeah, this kinda tech, it's gotta be the Shop.
They wanted a very specific type.
Four men is too small a sample to be useful as test subjects.
Wait.
That fits with what Nikita found.
Alex, I think you may have found the puzzle piece we were looking for.
That's great.
So what does it mean?
It can't be.
Yeah, I think we're gonna have to wait on that.
He's doing the thing.
Okay, well, when he's done reconstructing his big board of crazy, give me a call.
Sonya, I'm gonna clean up the scene.
I'll bring back the scanner to the hotel with me.
See you soon.
[Gun clicks]
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take that from you.
Owen?
How many times do I have to tell you?
It's Sam.
Authorities aren't releasing any new details, but they are searching for a black SUV with federal plates.
The vehicle was last seen heading north near the cruise ship terminus at 51st street.
If you spot-- [car alarm blares]
[Groaning]
About a dozen downtown businesses were boarded up...
Can we finally agree that a squad is more than one person?
I'm ready to listen to you now.
Now?
Oh.
Nikita says you have some truth to tell me.
What is this?
Evidence.
Yeah, you're welcome.
I can't read German.
She's not here.
Can you track her?
I'm not getting an answer on that cell phone she was using.
Signal's a few blocks from your position, but it's not moving.
Be advised, FBI vehicle has been recovered.
Suspect is likely on foot.
She is wounded and probably in need of medical attention.
Birkhoff, give me that address.
It's been confirmed that Dale is safe and uninjured.
He's speaking with authorities right now in the command tent behind me.
He should be released shortly.
And we're being told that he plans on making a statement about the events that transpired here--
[screaming and clamor over TV]
[Line rings]
It's done.
Dale Gordon won't be an issue anymore.
Are you ready to implement the next phase?
We're on schedule.
♪
We now have confirmation that Dale Gordon was inside the mobile command center at the time of the explosion.
Authorities believe that Nikita Mears may have planted the bomb on Gordon while she was holding him hostage.
Details are still coming in, but it is believed that Gordon, along with many fine men and women in the law enforcement community, are dead.
At this time, the suspect is still at large.
Authorities are asking citizens who live in the five boroughs to stay inside your homes.
Do not congregate on the streets.
If you notice anything suspicious, please call 911.
Do not attempt to investigate or approach on your own.
As today's events have shown,
Nikita Mears is highly dangerous and willing to kill perhaps anyone who gets in her way.
No one is safe as long as she's out there.

But you have to choose.
I can't decide for you.
So the question is, who will you be?
Aah!
(BEEP)
(TIRES SCREECH )
Get down!
Get down now!
Get down!
(SILENCED GUNSHOTS )
- Hello, Phillip.
- Hey, wait, wait, wait!
We can discuss this.
No more deals, no more illusions!
Ryan sacrificed himself for the truth.
Now it's your turn.
There were others.
It wasn't just me, there were others.
I know that.
Why do you think I'm here?
(BEEP)
Their names.
This is the contact file.
It's all of them, the entire group.
You can't let it get back to me.
They'll retaliate, no matter where you hide me.
Oh, trust me.
No one will ever find you.
(BEEPING )
- One down.
- Seven to go.
(WHIRRING)
Woman:
Federal authorities have yet to comment on what caused the explosion, but marshals have confirmed that this was the convoy transporting Phillip Jones, the former CFO of MDK.
( DOOR OPENS )
- What the hell is she doing?
- Don't you people knock?
Exactly what she told you needs to be done.
She's taking out the group.
And I told her there's a process, investigate, collect evidence, ferret them out.
We can't just go around killing these people, even if they're dirty.
Why not?
Sounds like a plan to me.
Hard to believe, but there are ways of getting things done that don't involve illegal activities.
And now Ryan's dead.
You're saying you agree with this?
No.
What I'm saying is, she's just getting started.
So we've given her the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
She's a national hero.
Now she's out there assassinating charter members of the Fortune 500.
Be sure to get my neck, would you?
Of course.
Our government forbids the assassination...
Don't make me laugh.
Our government trained her to be an assassin.
And she never misses her target.
So what?
Nikki's wiping out the elites that killed Ryan and tried to start World War Ill?
Oh, no.
We don't want that.
Let's say Ryan Fletcher's intel is correct, and this group has planted 54 doubles in key positions of power around the world.
What happens after, when Nikita kills the puppet masters?
There would be sleeper agents operating off book, military officers, executives, politicians.
This is why you need to get us off the base.
We're the only ones who can rein her in.
- I don't think that's...
- You are not gonna find her.
Sonya's already looking for her through Shadownet, but there's only so much we can do from a desk.
We need to be on the ground, that's how we'll find her.
Yeah, but why should we?
Look, Nikita wants to reduce the 1% of the 1% to 0.
I say pull up a chair and pass the popcorn.
You really want innocent people to die?
Because that is what is going to happen.
Come on, Mikey, she wouldn't let that happen.
You really think you know her that well?
But you weren't there in the very beginning.
You didn't see her when she first came in.
This is her fourth incident in her first week, and now Damon's missing half his ear.
Everyone knows Damon likes to knock the girls around.
It was inevitable one of them decided to knock back.
Well, it's one thing to go after a guard, it's another to attack someone who's trying to help her.
She needs training like any recruit.
No, this is different.
She doesn't fight for a purpose.
She fights as if something's trying to get out of her.
She's...
- Special.
- Dangerous.
I'm going to recommend to Percy that we cut our losses and cancel her.
You know, the entire time we were talking, she was trying to figure out a way to kill me.
Her tactical sense is intuitive.
If we could just harness that talent, she could be the greatest agent Division's ever known.
But if we can't control it, she could be the weapon that destroys us all.
What does that prove?
She did destroy Division.
What's wrong with that?
It's not about Division or training or even Amanda.
It's about Nikita and what is deep inside of her.
It's... a darkness.
Look, Amanda showed her happiness, the finish line, and she stole it all away.
I mean, that's enough to turn anybody upside down.
Look, 10 years ago, when I said she could end up destroying us all, I was talking about Division.
But now, I'm talking about the world.
As much as I love her, I can't let that happen.
Stop her.
Do whatever you have to do.
Yeah, but you said she wouldn't come after us.
I underestimated her desperation.
Great.
Can you make sure to let Howorth,
Wells, and Kwon know that?
Oh, wait, you can't.
They're dead.
The priority at the moment is to make sure you and the rest of the group remain safe.
Look, Nikita works best when she can divide and conquer.
I suggest you deny her that approach, and fortify to a single location.
No, this place is totally off the grid.
I ran it through a dozen shell companies, so it wouldn't show up under my name.
Perfect.
I'll come prepared with some recommendations on how to deal with Nikita.
No.
I'll call the others, and we'll figure out Nikita.
And then we'll discuss you.
Me?
Yeah, this group has enjoyed success from a position of absolute secrecy for generations.
All that started to change once we brought you on board.
I hardly think I can be blamed.
Look, I'll bottom-line it for you, this meeting is for decision-makers only, all right?
Your history shows you're not someone who can be in charge.
It's just something you're not capable of.
Hey, but I'll put in a good word for you.
You have no idea what I'm capable of.
( FOOTSTEP APPROACHING )
From our last victim.
Same as the one that Sam and I found from a shoperative in Zurich.
Great.
Let's hope they're on the same friends and family plan.
(COMPUTER BEEPS )
I got something.
A message.
Looks like Trevor Adrian called a meeting.
These are GPS coordinates.
Somewhere near Binghamton.
It's a few hours away.
We can be there soon.
Nikita, you sure about this?
It's perfect.
They'll all be in the same place.
Right, which means a frontal assault.
Not picking them off one by one from the shadows anymore.
So far we've managed to keep your name out of the news.
But this?
This will get loud.
Let it get loud.
You know that I'm with you no matter what.
You want to invade the moon, and I will find the next rocket ship.
But please, think about the line that you're about to cross.
You fought so hard to clear your name, and you're finally being recognized for who you really are, a hero.
Alex, you've always said that you've learned so much from me.
And you know what?
I've learned a lot from you too.
I've learned to stop running from who I am, embrace my identity the way you have.
That is how I know I'm not a hero.
(THUD)
Birkhoff, get Shadownet up and running.
All right, might take a minute.
Sonya's getting us an uplink to the NSA's sat servers, give us an eye in the sky.
NSA?
Yeah.
Dad gave me access.
We're official now, remember?
- Give me a gun.
- What?
Give me a gun.
We've got company.
Give me a gun.
Whoa.
Easy.
Stand down.
Colonel Slocum?
- Who?
- From the JAG office.
He interrogated us back at the base.
That was a debrief.
An interrogation would feel a bit different.
You're here to interrogate?
Supervise.
Per Senator Chappell's request.
We're fine on our own.
It's not an option.
This isn't a field trip to find a lost camper.
It's a matter of national security.
You know what, JAG officer, we've had enough of you soldier types.
Why don't you take your army of two and go clean each other's gun somewhere?
You don't get it.
You haven't been released.
You're out on a temporary pass, which means you are still our responsibility.
You may be used to breaking laws all over the planet, but not anymore.
This is a military operation now.
That's the last of them.
They're all here.
What the hell is that?
Come on.
You two stay here.
(FIGHTING OUTSIDE)
Away from the windows now!
Hi.
We haven't officially met.
(BEEP)
I need access to the security cameras at Mr. Adrian's house.
Yes, the one upstate.
Of course he knows I'm doing this.
(RINGING)
(BEEPING )
Hello?
Lionel.
Amanda.
Why can't you stay dead?
It wasn't a good color on me.
What do you want?
To pass along a tip.
Nikita and Alex have just infiltrated Trevor Adrian's compound in upstate New York.
Gathered there with him are the three remaining members of their group.
And you're telling us this because?
Well, we both have a common goal.
We both want them out of commission.
You mean your bosses.
Not anymore.
For a while, I thought they could be useful partners.
But it turns out they're just another group of self-involved, over-privileged men who think they know how best to control other people's destinies.
Well, if that's the way you feel, why don't you let Nikita finish the job?
Because she won't stop with them.
Once she's through, I'll be her next target.
Obviously, I don't want that.
I don't think you want her going down that path either.
She's murdered three people in cold blood.
What happens if she turns Adrian's place into a slaughterhouse?
Do you really think there'll be anything left of her soul then?
(BEEP)
(BEEPING )
Got him.
Trevor Adrian, heir to the Adrian industrial fortune.
Six residences listed,
None of them in upstate New York.
Hang on, maybe there's something off the books.
All right, there's a few properties that fit the bill.
Yeah, I think I got it.
You got thermal?
Thanks to Sonya, I do.
Six heat signatures inside.
Cluster pattern suggests four are hostages.
Get us there, now.
You have to understand, alright?
We... we don't know what goes on in our operations at a day-to-day level.
Alright?
It's really Amanda that you're after.
I'll get to her soon enough.
Yeah, but she won't be easy to find.
What if we give her to you?
You know, maybe we could work out a deal.
Yeah?
You want to make me an offer?
Give me Ryan Fletcher back.
Can you do that?
(RINGING)
Hello?
Nikita, you don't have to do this.
There is another way.
We tried the other way, and now Ryan's dead.
Ryan wouldn't have wanted...
Ryan wanted to get the group.
He's why I'm doing this.
Amanda wants you to do it, too.
How do you think we found you?
She wants you to do her dirty work for her.
You do this, and she wins.
Nikita, we've got company.
You sent troops?
What?
No, we didn't send anyone.
I did.
I made it very clear.
This is a military operation.
(PHONE RINGING)
You need to come out before anyone gets hurt.
Who else is still out there?
Force Recon.
And they're on a hair trigger.
Okay, just hold them off for me for a little bit longer.
Nikita, I am not here to run interference for you.
I know.
And I know that they asked you to do this.
They put you up to being my personal connection, and...
No one asked me to do anything.
I'm here on my own, and I am telling you...
Stop this before it goes too far.
Michael, you don't understand.
I'm about to get the list of doubles.
And then what?
What are you gonna do with it?
I don't really have many options, but I'm gonna get this out to the world today.
Then it won't matter what they do to me, because the whole world will know the truth.
Nikita, more than anyone, you know how dangerous the truth can be.
This is how we destroy them.
But what about the collateral damage?
- I don't care!
- Yes, you do.
Remember that you do... (CLICK)
I need you to do something.
This is an experimental neurotoxin.
Odorless, tasteless.
It's designed to be in a person's system and be undetectable, until it turns their organs into blood pudding.
Probably recognize it, since MDK designed it.
Give me the list of doubles, or you'll get to see how good your scientists really are.
Who wants a shot?
If you're gonna kill us, get on with it.
For God's sake, Carl.
Carl:
Don't you see she's playing with us?
This is just cheap theatrics.
No, no, no.
Ugh.
(GAGGING )
The bar, uh, top drawer.
There's a false bottom.
Call it up.
That's it.
Every political official, diplomat, and military officer in the world we've replaced.
Under no circumstances can she be allowed to get that list out of the house.
I don't care what you have to do.
Break cover if you must.
Are we clear?
What are you doing?
Sending it to the news outlets.
- Which ones?
- All of them.
It's gonna go so far and wide, no one's gonna be able to cover it up.
She's searching for a wireless signal.
She's getting ready to transmit.
Major, do your snipers have a shot?
No, no, no, not yet.
Birkhoff, are you ready?
Almost there.
Jamming field active.
(BEEPING )
(TYPING )
Birkhoff.
(PHONE RINGING)
Keep her on that line.
Why, what are you gonna do?
Plan B.
Michael, stop the jamming shield.
This isn't Michael.
Sam.
Look, I get it, okay?
I know these bastards deserve to pay.
But as much as I hate to admit it, Michael's right.
This ain't the way.
What do you care?
There's no profit in it for you.
Okay.
All right.
I deserve that.
But now you got to listen to me.
You remember London?
I had a black box in my hand, and I was gonna release the secrets to the world.
You stopped me before I made the same mistake you're about to make right now.
You were suffering from regimen psychosis, I'm not.
My head is clearer than it's ever been.
It's not about where your head's at.
If Owen was here, he'd say you're hurting and that now's the time to trust the people that care about you.
He'd tell you it's not about your head, it's about your heart and your soul.
That's what Owen would say.
Patch me in to Alex's comm, and only Alex's comm.
(BEEP)
Alex, it's Michael.
Don't let Nikita know you can hear me.
What are you doing?
You need to stop her from making this mistake.
These are the people that killed Ryan.
Why are you protecting them?
It's not about them.
It's about that list she's trying to send out to the world.
Do you know what'll happen if she succeeds?
No, Sam.
I know what I'm doing.
Tell Michael to stop the jamming field, or I kill them.
All!
Hey, she's gonna shoot 'em.
(BEEP)
Nikita, if you start shooting, the Marines will attack.
Then it's your job to make sure I don't die in vain, isn't it?
Man:
Snipers have a shot.
Do we have a green light?
Nikita, please.
I have nothing left.
If you die, I die.
All right.
You're right.
We'll do it your way.
Thank you.
Stand the snipers down.
Repeat, stand down.
Need to access a secure server.
Okay.
Birkhoff will open a data channel, transfer the file through it.
Once we receive the file, the Marines will back off, and then you can come out peacefully.
(BEEP)
Michael:
Birkhoff, did you get it?
Did you get the file?
I did, and I sent it someplace safe.
What are you talking about, someplace safe?
Nikki, remember operation Red Harvest?
If you do, then you'll know where I sent the file.
SGITIG SGFVGI', SHITIG pass COdG.
What the hell are you doing?
Nikki's right.
Too many secrets, too many lies.
- Turn that file over now!
- Whoa.
- Relax.
- Put it down!
Not until he turns over that file.
I will put all of you down!
Easy-
Nikita, what are you doing?
Birkhoff's giving me a second chance.
I'm not gonna waste it.
Don't do this.
Alex!
Get out of my way.
The person who trained me would want me to stop you.
You saved me once.
Now I'm trying to save you.
We can't release that file.
This is Slocum.
Raid!
Raid!
Raid!
Get down, get down, get down!
She's down!
- I surrender!
- Down on the floor!
(INDISTINCT VOICES ECHOING )
She's being processed right now.
And we brought in the Udinov woman as well.
She's in D-block.
I also arrested and booked that hacker.
That list is still out there.
If we're to have any hope of recovering it...
What about Amanda?
No sign of her at the house.
Senator, I requested your approval to isolate F-block.
Relax.
It's done.
Doesn't mean I like it.
Sir, I need the entire wing to be isolated.
We all know how dangerous she is.
Cut the crap.
I know why you want it.
And it's not supposed to happen on American soil.
Now what about the rest of the team?
I didn't see the need to bring them into custody.
Rest assured, they are no longer part of the process.
Think there's gonna be a lot of security?
Take a wild guess.
Got enough firepower?
I just hope it's all worth it.
Nikita's in a real bad spot right now, and we kind of put her there.
She knew what she was getting into.
I'm not giving you that list.
This is the most secure wing in one of the most secure prisons on the planet.
Solitary cells with steel-reinforced doors, and of course, constant surveillance.
Although that's been shut off.
And the entire Wing's been emptied.
For what?
Torture?
Good luck.
No, not torture.
I just needed to make sure no one would ever hear or see what's gonna happen here.
All clear!
You just had to twist the knife, didn't you?
No, Nikita, I'm here to thank you.
I control this wing of the prison, and thanks to you,
I control 54 agents all over the world.
Highly placed, powerful, and completely loyal to me.
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE )
If I use the Sarin gas, the casualties will be greater.
Woman:
Impressive work.
And they all seem to respond well.
Well, they all went through the same adjustment you went through.
And now they all know who's in charge.
I still have that master list on an encrypted cloud server.
No, you don't.
Birkhoff isn't the only one who remembers
Operation Red Harvest.
The list wasn't that hard to find.
You erased it?
I bought the company that owns the server, and then I shut down the entire server farm.
This is it, Nikita.
This is the end.
I'm a new woman because of you.
I'm transformed.
Your face is transformed.
Is that a gift from Ryan?
Oh, no, this is nothing compared to what you've endured.
All that killing.
I know how it must have torn you apart, resurrecting the monster inside.
I know because I understand where that darkness was formed.
The abuse you endured growing up.
I know because I was formed in the same place.
But today, I rose above it all.
It wasn't easy.
You were always a natural leader.
I didn't encourage it, of course, not inside Division.
But after you left me, this team you put together, they followed you...
They looked to you.
Ryan gave his life for you.
I had to claw my way to the top, past Percy, past Oversight, the Group.
A long time ago, I gave you a choice, brutality or deception.
You should have listened to me.
And to Michael... to Alex.
I'm going to leave you here... where no one will ever see or hear from you again.
But you can take comfort in knowing that you will never be forgotten.
I have doctors who can take this scar away.
But I'm going to leave it as a reminder.
Not only for what you did today, but for every wound you ever inflicted on me.
But, Amanda...
I'm not done.
Slocum!
I'm not a monster.
I just wanted you to think I was.
Show her, Nerd.
I didn't kill anyone.
And I did listen to Michael and Alex and, yes, even you.
Didn't I, Alex?
Brute force will never be as powerful as deception.
We had to scare the crap out of some top-shelf dirtbags.
They actually thought they were going to die.
From the last victim, the plan was to work our way through the group, all the way to you.
But you called a meeting, which made it that much easier.
Adrian's house was the big show, and we made him the star.
It was all about getting that list.
The neurotoxin was a modified form of tetrodotoxin.
Death-like symptoms, but without the lasting side effects.
But that gun.
Well, that was Nikita's idea.
Non-lethal tranq rounds.
Look and sound like the real thing, but all they do is put you to bed.
After we got the list, Nerd went to work.
Nikki gave me full access to Adrian's laptop.
I tracked down all the Shop facilities he'd been talking to.
Turns out, it was just one.
Western Pennsylvania, right?
Converted coal mine?
Your roster listed it as Replication Center.
Fancy name for toy factory, where you make your little wind-up dolls.
But you like to keep the originals, don't you?
Nobody knows that better than me.
But none of this could have happened without Slocum.
He was our audience, and through him, you.
How did you know he was a double?
Ryan told me on his deathbed.
Slocum is a double.
And trust me, I wanted to kill Slocum and every single member of the group just to get to you.
I was gonna rip your guts out and wipe the walls with them.
But my friends, my family, they reminded me that I'm better than that and that the right thing to do would be to lure you in, not kill you.
Under no circumstances can she be allowed to get that list out of the house.
I don't care what you have to do.
And in order to do that, I needed you to feel that I'd lost my way.
I needed to become the destroyer that you met all those years ago.
Remember her?
I do.
She is a part of me.
And she always will be, but she's not everything.
You asked me to choose, who will I be?
This is my choice.
There are people out there loyal to me.
They will find me.
No one will ever find you.
Welcome back to the basement...
Helen.
Nikita!
That was a risky move, letting the Marines take you down.
Right up till then, I thought you had really gone off the rails.
I'm sorry we couldn't bring you into the loop sooner.
The only way this was going to work was if everyone bought into it.
Don't apologize.
Unlike the people I usually work with, you guys actually get things done.
The coordinated sting started 38 minutes ago.
CIA, FBI, Interpol all working in concert to bring in the doubles around the world, quietly.
Thank you, Senator.
No.
Thank you.
Your pardons have all been signed.
This chapter of history is over, and a new one's begun, for all of you.
All but one of us.
Ryan Fletcher's service has been recognized.
He'll be remembered.
You saw the lies.
You knew there'd always be someone who would abuse their power.
That's why you looked to us.
You made us better heroes.
Now Ryan has given us a gift, freedom.
We're here tonight to honor an extraordinary...
There will be a car outside the west entrance after the speech.
Stationed two men there.
Is that really necessary?
It's a human rights conference.
They don't get that rowdy.
Hey, I'm trying to be responsible.
Isn't that what people with jobs do?
Hey, you need the money.
The company's not so bad either.
Dinner later?
Why, you need someone to open the wine?
No, I don't drink, which you should know about me.
Any other surprises?
Man:
Alexandra Udinov.
Nikita:
Now we can find our place in the world, wherever that might be.
So, Shadowwalker is coming out of the shadows.
That's one way of putting it, yeah.
Does this mean you're going legit?
Legit?
Yeah, I don't know.
I've never really done lockstep.
I've got a girl waiting for me in London.
She convinced me sharing the code was the right thing to do.
Yes.
Shadownet.
You claim this will protect regular folks against government agencies that spy on them?
So this is what?
Digital freedom for the masses?
I'd say more like open-source anarchy.
Yeah, I like that.
Write that down.
- Open-source anarchy.
- Okay.
Hyphen in between open and source.
You know, this is gonna freak some people out.
Good.
That's good.
Nikita:
Freedom's a scary thing, though.
We've got no one to answer to but ourselves.
We used to answer to them.
The stepchild nobody wanted but the world needed.
(SPEAKING SPANISH )
You think they'll be mad we eloped?
Well, it's not like we planned it.
I have an idea for the honeymoon.
Nikita:
Now that we're finally free,
I get why we fought so hard.
The real gift isn't freedom.
It's what we get to do with it.
I don't know about you, but I could never just sit on a beach anyway.
(English US
- SDH)
It's not my blood.
Don't worry.
We took the hit for you.
Michael.
Where in the world is Nikita Mears?
Today marks the first hundred days since the assassination of President Kathleen Spencer, and still the search drags on for her assailant, who bears the notorious label of the most wanted woman in the world.
But like most things we desperately want,
Ms. Mears continues to elude our grasp.
With me today is Deputy Director Matthew Graham, head of the FBI's task force on Mears.
Matt.
Dale.
Where the heck is she?
Come on, it's been a few months.
You can't blame us if we start to worry about our safety.
Your viewers have nothing to worry about.
Not my viewers, the American public, and they beg to differ.
Because if it's really that easy to kill the most protected person in the world, then none of us are safe.
Your viewers have nothing to worry about.
First of all, rest easy in the knowledge that wherever Nikita Mears is hiding, she is nowhere near the United States.
And today, the Bureau is reinforcing its commitment to capturing Nikita with an increase in the reward to $30 million for any information assisting in that capture.
30 million, okay.
So that's 5 million more than Osama bin Laden's bounty, and it only took ten years to find him.
So what, seven, eight years?
Well, Osama bin Laden had help.
He was being sheltered.
And you're saying she's not?
I can neither confirm nor deny any information that would jeopardize our investigation.
Okay then, let's speculate.
What would your guess be?
Because it's really hard to imagine how anyone could evade capture and survive all on their own.
If she has help, maybe it's the same people who helped her escape the White House after shooting President Spencer inside the Oval Office.
Perhaps they're also members of the President's death squad.
There is no death squad.
So you're saying Senator Coto misspoke when he ordered an investigation of the executive death squad that Spencer was running with the late Commander Danforth, of which Nikita was alleged to be a member.
Explains how she got into the White House at least.
That is a separate investigation.
Can we at least agree that the word "squad" suggests--
If you want to talk about that investigation--
Can we at least agree that the word "squad"
suggests more than one person?
Hands in the air, right now!
Walk towards me.
It is her.
Okay, on the ground, facedown, now!
Because here's what I speculate.
You don't want her to be found, because that means exposing what every American has grown to fear more than any foreign enemy, and that, sir, is the parallel state.
Hey, hey.
Can I take that as confirmation or denial?
It's her.
Boston field office is closest.
They're scrambling a chopper.
Yeah?
No, officer, I understand.
You did the right thing.
Just keep her pinned down until our tactical team arrives.
And under no circumstances should you try and approach her.
Sir, she's unarmed on the ground.
We got her.
Do not approach.
The feds want the collar.
Cuff her ass.
Put your hands behind your back.
I've just been informed that Deputy Director Graham has been called away on urgent business.
Urgent, convenient, whatever.
It won't stop me from asking the important questions
I promised you I'd ask.
For example, how is Nikita Mears alive in the first place?
According to the state of New Jersey, she was executed ten years ago for killing a Newark police officer.
Who the hell has the kind of juice to fake an execution?
As incredible as it sounds, the death of the President is just the tip of the iceberg.
We demand to know the whole truth.
And I promise you, I won't rest until I--
Has new material arrived ahead of schedule?
No.
Nikita has arrived.
Our drones spotted her crossing the border into the United States.
We've sent an anonymous tip to the local authorities.
Hmm.
Interactive television.
You don't seem surprised.
I knew she couldn't stay away forever.
But why now?
Why take the risk?
What's she after?
You.
And me.
We ruined her life.
Nikita's not the type to let something like that go.
But don't worry about her.
There are more disturbing things on television.
We rescued last night from these containers, much like the one I was in when I was taken--
Ms. Udinov has been considerably easier to track.
Yes, but who is tracking whom?
She's shut down three of our supply centers for human subjects in the last two months.
Cosmetic damage.
We only need to tolerate her for a little while longer.
I do this to help others like me.
It's Nikita who's alive past schedule.
What happened to us was terrible, but it does not have to define us.
Victim, survivor, meddling bitch.
That last one was bestowed on me from a slaver in Burundi last week.
But it doesn't matter what they call me.
What matters is my message to those who are engaged in the buying and selling of human beings.
No matter how powerful or unstoppable you think you are, we will find you, we will expose you, and we will stop you.
That was a very powerful speech, Miss Udinov.
Thank you for coming and sharing with us.
I only hope it inspires others to join your fight.
I know how hard you've been working to stop trafficking in Mumbai.
I just wish there was more that I could do to help.
You could stop taking over their territory after you put them out of business.
That'd be helpful.
Okay, tracker's on her.
How's the signal?
Signal's strong, but...
Sonya, trust me.
She will lead us to the shop.
She's their favorite kind of trafficker, corrupt government official.
I just got a call from the guys.
Nikita has come out of hiding.
Seems she's back in the states.
What?
Where's Michael?
Where do you think?
Should we head back?
Finding the shop is the best way to find Amanda and clear Nikita's name.
But if she gets herself caught it could be too late.
No, she must have a plan.
And she'd want us to stick to ours.
You're gonna need a bigger coffee before we dive into your call sheet.
Everyone wants to find out what you know about Nikita's return.
Still no leads on her?
Just the car she left behind, courtesy of Barney Fife and his merry band of idiots.
Then everyone can wait.
I wanna keep my day clear.
If anything breaks, I wanna be ready to go on the air.
Okay.
New LCD TV just got in.
Thank you, Paula.
Dale Gordon.
Big fan.

Put your hands down.
Have a seat.
How did you get in here?
This is a secure building.
There's cameras everywhere.
Just like the White House, Dale.
Feel safer now?
Do you?
You were a ghost.
No one could find you.
Now you're inside of a building filled with journalists desperate for a lead on you in the largest city of the most powerful nation on the planet who calls for your blood.
Stop writing copy, Dale, okay?
You're better at asking questions.
Why don't we just stick to that?
You--you want me to-- to interview you?
While the FBI is conducting the largest manhunt--
I'm not worried about the FBI.
There's only one man who can track me, and I doubt he's interested in trying.
You can't keep moving trays around.
This is the fourth time I've had to renumber everything.
Excuse me, are you the commander on duty?
No, I'm just the one doing his job for him.
Well, I need a signature on this chain of custody form.
Who's transporting evidence now?
I haven't even had the chance-- it's the car.
Form needs to be signed before we can move it.
I'll go find Wilson.
Wait here.
She left a lot behind.
She had to make an escape plan on the fly.
No time to scrub the car.
What's this?
Uniform policy for Kips Bay Creative Technology.
Looks like they do electronic sales and services.
Like repairs?
Repairs, new installations, but not for the general public.
They're contractors.
They work with local businesses in Midtown Manhattan.
Nikita stole the car in Vermont.
Any chance the owner works in Manhattan?
Lives and works in Shelburne, Vermont.
She's single and a pediatrician.
So no need for a uniform.
Service call.
Just like I taught her.
She's going undercover as the cable guy.
Whose cable guy?
Can you break into their systems?
I wanna take a look at today's orders.
That one.
Payment type is cash upon pickup.
Who's that for?
Equinox News Network.
A new LCD TV for Dale Gordon.
Conspiracy guy.
E.N.N. is a huge corporation.
They don't pay cash.
They'd ask to be billed.
Nikita doesn't have time to fake that.
There's too much heat.
Whoa.
Guess who reported a break-in last night.
Kips Bay Creative Technology.
That's her.
All she needs to get through that door is an order form with Gordon's name on it and that uniform.
Dale Gordon's been asking a lot of questions about the President's death.
You think Nikita's looking for an ally?
Well, she had five allies, and she ditched us.
What?
Mikey's not the only one who gets to have resentment.
Nikita left to keep the spotlight and the danger away from us.
She was-- being Nikki, I know.
Act first, think later.
First degree martyr.
Birkhoff, I need you to get me into the E.N.N. building.
Think we should land close in case they need a pickup?
Yep.
The President of the United States committed suicide?
I know it sounds crazy.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, Big Foot, the Loch Ness monster, UFOs-- that sounds crazy.
What you're talking about--
Is the truth.
That's what you seek to find, right?
You know, you ask good questions, Dale, but you don't ask the right questions.
Like what, what would make the President pick up a gun and shoot herself in the head?
Sure has me curious.
So you don't know why?
That's--that's great.
I know that the President was not the only one acting out of character that day.
The lead Secret Service man, he gave me the gun.
He's working with the people who are setting me up.
Single shot to the head.
Make it count.
John Stirling?
He was a 20-year veteran.
He protected three presidents.
Someone like that wouldn't-- wouldn't what?
Do what he did?
Like Kathleen Spencer?
Or Karl Jaeger?
Karl who?
German intelligence officer.
Shot his own men at the G20 summit in Toronto.
You covered it.
He's the only person I can think of who's also acting out of character.
But unlike Stirling and the President,
I was able to investigate Jaeger.
I found this.
Yeah, I can't read German.
The B.N.D. officer claims that the Toronto police corrupted the blood samples.
He chalks it up to sloppy forensics, but I think it's actually a clue.
What if there was something in his blood that made him act differently that day?
What if there was something in the President's blood that did the same?
Nobody would think to look-- What kind of something?
And how do we even find out?
Your source at the FBI can get us a copy of her autopsy results.
What FBI source?
- You've always said--
- I never said.
I never said.
I implied and let the people assume.
"Sources familiar with the investigation"
sounds a lot more credible than "anonymous person who texts me."
Anonymous?
I got sent an envelope with a phone inside, and then I started getting the text messages.
At first, I thought it might be you, but then, I don't know, it just got weird.
"I see you found her arrest record.
"Such an unfortunate mug shot.
"That Nikita wouldn't have made it within 100 yards of the White House--"
It's a trap.
You were the bait she needed.
Who?
Someone you never want to meet.
Welcome home, Nikita.
Priya's here.
She brought some hired guns to watch her back.
This has gotta be it.
I'm not seeing any trucks though.
You think the shipment's inside the warehouse?
I've got two vehicles approaching.
That's our buyer.
Sending images now.
Who do you think he is?
Another sales rep for the Shop, like Heidecker?
Only one way to find out.
Have Birkhoff run him through facial recognition.
This guy shows up nowhere, we'll know he's Shop.
Just sent you a photo of the Mumbai buyer.
Can you run it through Shadownet's facial recog?
Hey, babe.
Nice to hear your voice too.
I'm a little busy at the moment.
We think this man might work for the Shop and may be our best hope of clearing Nikita's name.
What's more important than that?
Uh, keeping her from getting shot in the next ten minutes.
Lock it down.
Six-block perimeter.
I think we're good to go.
Remember, if someone talks to you, you answer them but you keep moving.
Sorry it took so long.
The elevators aren't working.
Uh, you're the one who delivered the TV.
Why are you still here?
Don't worry about it, Paula.
Mr. Gordon, FBI is looking for you.
Oh, my God, you're Nikita.
It's Nikita!
Let us walk outta here, and he'll be fine.
Got her!
Sixth floor.
She's with Dale, not too far from the elevators.
How do you know?
The entire newsroom just announced it online.
Blue wolf, this is Red wolf.
I'm on site.
It's a party down here.
Patch me through to lone wolf.
We're trying.
Does Dale have a phone on him?
Nikita must have made him dump it.
Try an extension in the room.
Feds can listen in.
Room full of phones and no way to reach her.
That's real smart.
Yes.
Yes, I am.
Those Nikita posts-- most of them are being posted from smart phones.
Um...
It says it's for you.
Pick it up, Dale.
This is Dale Gordon.
Nikita can't talk right now.
Is that the FBI?
Do you know someone named Michael?
So who's Michael, another member of the President's death squad?
Michael?
I'm downstairs, here to help you exfil.
On site?
Damn it.
Michael, I left because you couldn't be involved in this.
Yeah, you left.
So you don't get a vote anymore.
Nerd?
And, you know, we're not cocker spaniels.
You can't tell us to sit and just expect us to obey your command.
Okay.
Okay, fine.
You're here, you wanna help?
Can you hack into the building?
We're already in.
Now if we can get you to the north side...
No, this is good.
Thermal scanners won't be able to get a good read in here.
This is the perfect place to be surrounded.
What are you talking about?
We make the FBI think that I'm in here with Dale, that he's my hostage.
While they're trying to breach, find me a way out of the building.
Michael, you clear an exfil point.
Birkhoff, you clear the cameras.
Oh, my God, she does expect us to obey her.
So I stay here?
I like this plan.
I need you to do something else for me.
Take this, give it to the FBI, along with the cell phone in your office.
I'm talking about the very top, not some random guy in a windbreaker, okay?
This is all the evidence we have.
The FBI has its sights set on you.
How can you trust them?
I trust them to be the FBI.
We give them evidence, they'll investigate.
Look, even if you don't believe me--
I don't know what to believe, but I don't think you killed the President.
I'll be in touch.
Remember, I get the exclusive.
I can't have the press filming from the surrounding buildings.
Get them out of those windows.
Boss, we have no one to send.
Our cupboard's bare.
The loading dock--we already secured that tightly.
Send those guys.
Birkhoff, make the call.
- Nikita?
- She's calling from the roof.
You wanna take this?
No, you start.
You pass her up to me if she escalates.
Hi, Nikita.
My name is Kramer.
Can we talk?
What would you like to talk about, Kramer?
I'd like to talk about Dale.
Is he okay?
Tell him how you are, Dale.
Oh, my God, you gotta get me outta here.
Just give her what she wants.
I don't wanna die.
I wanna live.
Amateurs.
They always oversell.
You got what you wanted.
Here's what I want.
Nikita, do you realize your situation?
The building is locked down.
Our tactical team is moving into position.
There is no way off that roof.
Yes, but I've got Dale Gordon.
If you come in, he dies.
So what do you want?
I'm on a rooftop, idiot.
What do you think I want?
She wants a helicopter.
It's gonna take some time.
Let me know when you have it.
She was last spotted on the sixth floor.
The building is 14 stories.
She went up eight floors to get to the roof?
That doesn't make any kind of tactical sense.
Why go up?
Why call?
All it did was tell us where she was.
Or where she wanted us to think she was.
But to do that...
Someone is helping her.
All right, straight ahead, there's a large exhaust vent.
Take off the access panel.
You should be able to crawl through.
So what's the plan once you escape the building?
You coming back or are you gonna run away again?
The heat hasn't died down yet.
I don't want you guys in that kinda danger, even though you seem determined to keep putting yourselves there.
Huh.
What did you expect us to do?
I thought that if I wasn't around, you could move on with your lives.
Move on?
Yeah, nobody's moving on.
Mikey's gone for weeks at a time trying to pick up on your trail.
Ryan's created a whole new wall of crazy conspiracy theories.
Alex thinks she's Batman, which I guess makes my girlfriend Robin.
All this to help clear your name.
I didn't ask for that.
Yeah, well, we didn't ask for you to leave, but you did that anyway.
Look, Nikki, you're gonna wind up in an alley somewhere, alone and dying, unless you stop running and let us help you.
You know what would help me right now?
Turn off the spinning blades of decapitation, would you?
Almost there.
I only have a short window of time before the system sends out an alert that it's malfunctioning.
Wouldn't want the FBI to--
They dumped me.
Nikki, I'm locked out of the system.
Guess that means I'm locked in.
Can you get back in?
No, they must have figured out we were in the system.
We're toast.
So who's running the show here?
Deputy Director Matthew Graham.
Graham, okay.
Listen, I need--
Birkhoff.
Hang on, Mikey.
She's trying to call me.
Do not answer her.
We already played it her way.
We don't have time.
Now get me everything you can find on Graham.
Guys, I'm trapped in a building full of FBI agents here.
Somebody please talk to me.
Hey, would you please talk to her before she loses patience and decides to try and shoot her way through the side of the building?
What happens if I shoot the fan out?
Uh, Birkhoff says do not shoot the fan.
Ryan.
All right, what's the plan to get me outta here then?
Uh, in progress.
I'm kinda curious about the plan that got you in there.
Dale Gordon?
Karl Jaeger.
The B.N.D. guy?
You found a connection.
The police took evidence from the scene where Jaeger was shot, and the blood samples showed abnormal "B" and "T" cells.
But then when they did the autopsy, the blood work was fine.
Germans just assumed that the samples were contaminated.
But I don't know, Ryan, what if there was something else?
Something in the blood?
Like a drug.
The blood on the scene would have traces of it.
It could've skewed the results.
But by the time they did the autopsy, the drug would be out of his system, so the blood seemed clear.
Amanda does like drugs, especially ones that modify behavior.
Yeah, I ran that, but there's some snags, mostly with time line.
How'd you figure this Jaeger thing out?
I see the shipment.
It's only four men.
Did you say four?
Traffickers usually pay less than $200 a head for men, and Priya's supposed to earn--
10 million.
So unless these guys can spin straw into gold, something else is going on here.
I'm going in for a closer look.
Hmm.
I find the shipment to be acceptable.
Authorize the transfer of funds.
Let's go.
Get in the car.
I don't know when I'll be able to get you the others.
Don't bother.
We'll take your partial shipment, but we won't be doing business with you again.
This is not my fault.
It's this-- this Udinov girl.
I couldn't risk taking--
What does that say, hmm?
Without risk, there is no reward.
The buyer's little friend is headed my way.
Looks like he's on a comm device.
If he has remote support, they may have picked up your heat signature.
- So I've been made?
- Yes.
The buyer escaped.
Looks like he took one of the men with him.
- Did you find anything?
- I'm not sure yet.
Miss Udinov just blew up our operation in Mumbai.
We've moved beyond cosmetics now.
And your tolerance level.
At an all-time low.
We lost three subjects during the transfer.
That means we still have one.
And one is all I need.
We locked them out of the system, but it cost us any chance of tracing the signal back.
We have no idea who she's working with.
Right now, I'm more concerned with what's happening on the roof.
Team's in position.
All right, let me make a call first in case this goes bad.
Sir.
Didn't I already look at this?
That's my wife.
What is this, some kind of a joke?
No, Matthew, it's a choice.
What do you want?
Where's your car?
I can't believe that worked.
Don't doubt my mad photoshopping skills again.
Nikita, you ready?
For what?
Ready on your order.
How do you wanna play it?
Go dark, cut the power.
Tactical's storming the roof right now.
We need to get you outta here.
What's he doing here?
He'll get you out of Manhattan.
Head north.
I'll meet you there.
We'll switch cars.
Where?
At the staging area near the zoo.
Keep your head down.
I'll see you at the rendezvous point.
Thank you.
They all look the same.
Not like twins.
More like cousins.
Who were these men?
And why were they worth so much money?
Wait, I think I found something.
I saw the buyer using this weird piece of tech.
Looks like he left it behind.
What is it?
Some sort of handheld scanner.
He was waving it on them.
They were chipped.
Like a tracker.
Like livestock.
Let's give Ryan a call.
I don't know what the hell this is, but he's gonna want to see it.
Have they found Nikita yet?
Yes, I believe they know just where she is.
Yeah, we got somebody coming up through here right now.
You leaving already?
Yeah.
Mayor wants to have a chat down at Center Street.
Yeah, the mayor wants to make sure this doesn't stick to him.
But, hey, dispatch said that that reporter's okay.
Might finally get some good press outta that guy.
Yeah, I'm not that lucky.
Dale Gordon's alive.
Maybe that means the FBI will let me keep my pension after they force me out for this mess.
Was that a tactical decision?
I wouldn't have hurt Dale.
An assassin with a heart of gold.
Too bad you didn't feel the same way about Spencer.
I didn't kill her.
I tried to warn her.
You kidnapped the President's aide to get yourself put on her schedule.
You used the tunnels to infiltrate yourself into the White House, somehow conning your way into the blue sector, all to try and warn her?
I did warn the President.
And then she shot herself in the head?
Autopsy report says the gun was fired at close range, possibly pressed up against her temple.
There were only two people in that room.
So if you didn't pull the trigger, that only leaves me with one other possible culprit.
Only if you have an open mind.
Let's say that I do.
You went there to warn her.
Still one problem with your story:
Why did you bring the gun?
Innocent people don't smuggle a gun into the Oval Office.
Out, let's go.
You and your friends haven't scared me off, you know.
I'll go home tonight and make sure that my wife is safe, but tomorrow, I'll start hunting you again.
Thought you were afraid of losing your job.
They could force me to retire, but that'll just give me more free time to dedicate to you.
I'll catch you.
And I will find out exactly what happened that day.
I want that too.
Talk to Dale Gordon.
Yeah, this kinda tech, it's gotta be the Shop.
They wanted a very specific type.
Four men is too small a sample to be useful as test subjects.
Wait.
That fits with what Nikita found.
Alex, I think you may have found the puzzle piece we were looking for.
That's great.
So what does it mean?
It can't be.
Yeah, I think we're gonna have to wait on that.
He's doing the thing.
Okay, well, when he's done reconstructing his big board of crazy, give me a call.
Sonya, I'm gonna clean up the scene.
I'll bring back the scanner to the hotel with me.
See you soon.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take that from you.
Owen?
How many times do I have to tell you?
It's Sam.
Authorities aren't releasing any new details, but they are searching for a black SUV with federal plates.
The vehicle was last seen heading north near the cruise ship terminus at 51st street.
If you spot--
About a dozen downtown businesses were boarded up...
Can we finally agree that a squad is more than one person?
I'm ready to listen to you now.
Now?
Oh.
Nikita says you have some truth to tell me.
What is this?
Evidence.
Yeah, you're welcome.
I can't read German.
She's not here.
Can you track her?
I'm not getting an answer on that cell phone she was using.
Signal's a few blocks from your position, but it's not moving.
Be advised, FBI vehicle has been recovered.
Suspect is likely on foot.
She is wounded and probably in need of medical attention.
Birkhoff, give me that address.
It's been confirmed that Dale is safe and uninjured.
He's speaking with authorities right now in the command tent behind me.
He should be released shortly.
And we're being told that he plans on making a statement about the events that transpired here--
It's done.
Dale Gordon won't be an issue anymore.
Are you ready to implement the next phase?
We're on schedule.
We now have confirmation that Dale Gordon was inside the mobile command center at the time of the explosion.
Authorities believe that Nikita Mears may have planted the bomb on Gordon while she was holding him hostage.
Details are still coming in, but it is believed that Gordon, along with many fine men and women in the law enforcement community, are dead.
At this time, the suspect is still at large.
Authorities are asking citizens who live in the five boroughs to stay inside your homes.
Do not congregate on the streets.
If you notice anything suspicious, please call 911.
Do not attempt to investigate or approach on your own.
As today's events have shown,
Nikita Mears is highly dangerous and willing to kill perhaps anyone who gets in her way.
No one is safe as long as she's out there.

At the same time, it's making
The money.
I just have to put my pride to
The side and just do it, because

Were very young.

Now, eat your heart out, simon.
aah!
I hate you so much right now!
hahat's great about
The x factor is that it gives
People over the age of 25 the
Opportunity to fulfill their
Dream of a record contract, but
For some, that's bittersweet.
oh,boy,I'mnervous.
Most of the people here are
Young, you know, like, 14, 16.
I'mgettingto be tooold for
This.
andournextcontestantisno
Exception.
I'mrachelpotter.
I'm 29 years old, and I live in
Nashville, tennessee.
I've always been afraid, I
Guess, of going after my dreams
Of being a country singer, and
As I got older, it finally came
To the point where I just didn't
Feel like I had much time left.
I'm in the over-25 group.
noway.
so,youknow,Ijust felt
Like it's now or never, you
Know?
You know, I want to do what
Millions of young people want to
Do, and it can get discouraging.
Sometimes I feel like I'll never
Make it, but I don't want to be
A person that lives with regret.
everythinghappensfora
Reason.
yeah.
yeah.
The x factor provides that
Kind of opportunity for me,
Where I can prove that my age
Isn't an issue.

Loveyou ,guys.

Lot of that, the ah-ah-ah-ah-ah,
And less is more, in that.

You, but it did actually sound
Like you were drowning when
You-literally, I've never heard
Anyone sing while they drown,
But I think that's what I would
Sound like.
Um, but look, you're a trier,
And, you know, you're a nice
Guy.
I just don't think this is quite
What we were looking for.
Demi.

Different things.

Estate, and I'm going to school
To be an artist.

Yet.
Weour dad allowed us two weeks

Together or we gotta go to
College.

New York right now.
parents-they don't even know
We're here.
they don't know that you're
Here?

Just each other?

Straw.

Parents.

In case y'all say no.
I love that.

Right now.
ok, so simon has a girl
Group, and these girls are
Singing their faces off, and I'm
Hearing y'all sing y'all's faces
Off, and it's been a long time
Since we've had girl groups who
Sing their faces off.
I hear what simon is saying.
You know, of course, every
Group, like we said, has a lead
Singer.
I feel like, of course, the
Vocals, of course, could be-
Could be better with you guys,
But when y'all come together,
It is something so special.
I love y'all, hands down.
thank you.
wow!
You guys blow us away.
I mean, you guys are family,
I mean, for sure.
simon.
you're-you're really, really
Good together, but...
You've got a secret weapon here.
* in this Califórnia* * king bed* with this one on the right,
I'm telling you, ok?
And that's what every band
Needs.
What I think you've got to work
Out, which is where I think we
Could help, is how we work the
Vocals, how we do the harmonies,
Who sings what part, because
It's not about democracy, it's
About sounding amazing.
And I'm glad I said what I said, 'cause it did actually kind of
Fire the other two up a little
Bit, and I've got to tell you
Something.
Apart from the groups I've put
Together, this is potentially
The best group we've ever had on
X factor.
I mean, I am super, super,
Super- are you serious right now?
I'm 100% serious.
do you understand how nervous
We were?
it doesn't matter.
it's just crazy-no, it's
Crazy to hear that.
We've been doing it for so long,
And to hear that from you- but you're how old?
20, 21, and 22.
we started-we started at 14.
so, let's vote.
it's gonna be an absolute
Hell yeah!
I'm just amazed.
It's a yes.
I'm gonna say, absolutely
Yes, because you're awesome.
I'm gonna say four big, fat
Yeses.
Congratulations.
* in this Califórnia* * king bed* * we're 10,000 miles apart*

Your thing.
my name is denise weeks.
I'm a subway singer in New York.
On the "r" train, I sing for
Tips.
Sometimes when I'm on the train,
There's people that don't want
To hear me sing, but, you know,
At the same time, it's making
The money.
I just have to put my pride to
The side and just do it, because
I need to be able to provide for
My children.
I lost my kids' father when they
Were very young.
It was just very devastating,
You know, at the time, so I had
No choice but to... youworkedso hardtoraise
Me and matthew, and to do what
She has to do as a single mom,
She did it.

Children, but now that they're
Grown, I guess it's time for me
To live out my dream.

That?
simon, wake up!
aah!
if this was a movie, this
Would be like nightmare on elm
Street or something.
oh!
not everything comes to us
Overnight.
This is just one step.
guess what?
There's a place in the market
For you.
I'm going to say yes.
this is my time.
?
oh, for your... one of the worst voices I've
Ever heard.
he is wrong!
what are you doing?
please?
please.
I know you're very well
Mark my words down.
Like, I think we're looking at the potential winner of this competition.
Let's do it.
Why are you doing this?
You're going to kill the President of the United States, Ellen.
Otherwise, we will kill your family.
What's going to happen to us?
Beginning tomorrow, you are going to return to your normal lives.
For the next two weeks you will carry on as if nothing is wrong.
We'll be watching you.
Listening to you.
Every move you make, even when we're not with you, we'll be with you.
What's that?
You're going to implant a GPS chip into everyone.
Think of it as an invisible leash.
No one touches Dr. Sanders.
As long as I have your family, you're not going anywhere.
The President was mistakenly given a blood thinner only hours before his scheduled surgery.
I'm here to find out exactly what happened.
We need to end this investigation tonight.
And how are we supposed to do that?
We give them somebody to blame.
It's about Angela.
The President's nurse apparently committed suicide.
You son of a bitch.
You killed her.
- No, you did.
- What?
You failed to convince your friend to confess.
Angela's death is on you.
This guy Nico...
We sold his weed, but never paid him because my father found all the money.
Let's stop pretending, Ryan.
We both know you're not the loving husband you pretend to be.
When is Mommy coming home?
Mommy needs to rest, honey.
So she can get better.
Everything is gonna back just the way it was.
My partners have a very low tolerance for failure.
Mr. President, the internet's buzzing with rumors about that nurse's suicide.
Conspiracy theories, links to terrorist groups...
No mention of aliens?
Sir, choosing a civilian doctor was supposed to be a public relations win.
It's not.
We should cut our losses and get the hell out.
Well, I like Dr. Sanders...
But this whole thing is becoming more complex than I'd hoped.
Quentin, start exploring the best way for us move on.
Without damaging Sanders' reputation.
Or mine.
I'll try to make it today, but I don't think I can...
Like I told you, I'm working on a special assignment.
Well, Daddy loves you too, Sawyer.
More than anything.
Well, you have fun today at the art fair, okay princess?
Make sure you send me a few pictures.
I'll call you later, okay?
- Hey, better eat your breakfast.
- I gotta get ready for school.
- Are you all right?
- No.
I can't stop thinking about Angela.
Come here.
We need to talk.
We need to find out which school is having an art fair today.
What?
An art fair?
Why?
He has a daughter.
Her name is Sawyer.
Her school is having an art fair.
I'll try and track it down at work.
Use someone else's computer in case they're tapping.
I'll call you at 11:15.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I didn't hear back from you last night.
Everything go okay with the nurse?
Yeah.
Yeah, we're good.
Duncan?
I'm at the meeting spot.
Where are you?
Meeting spot?
You just sent me an urgent message.
I didn't send you a message.
Duncan?
- Who ordered the hit?
- Calm down.
It was that bootlicking Chief of Staff, Creasy.
I'll bury that son of a bitch.
Duncan.
Stop.
You need to stay focused.
Think about your daughter.
Your wife.
Remember why we're doing this.
You're right.
It doesn't matter who gave the order.
It only matters why...
The President must be moving on...
Changing surgeons.
- Without Sanders...
- The deal's off.
Which makes us all liabilities.
You, me, Sanders...
Unless we change the President's mind.
Yes, I'd like to speak to Chief of Staff Quentin Creasy.
Tell him it's Rob Halsey.
Mr. Creasy?
I have a Mr. Halsey for you on line two.
Tell him I'm out of the office.
I'm sorry, Mr. Halsey.
The Chief of Staff is unavailable.
I thought Carlisle was supposed to be dead.
- Dr. Sanders.
- Agent Hoffman.
- Can I have a word?
- Sure.
I know you and Angela were close.
Yeah, I just...
I can't believe it.
It's horrible.
Until we find a body there's still hope.
Yeah, you're right, I...
Why were you at her house last night?
We were supposed to meet for a drink and she didn't show up to the bar.
I went to her home because I was concerned.
- About what?
- About Angela.
She was distressed.
We had coffee yesterday and she was just so upset about everything that's happened with the President.
Especially since she was the nurse administering the medication.
She didn't know whether she'd made a mistake or not.
I told her if she thought she was at fault, she should just admit it.
But she...
What?
She didn't know if she could live with the consequences.
I feel terrible.
I should have done more.
Been a better friend.
- I just, I had no idea...
- Don't blame yourself, Doctor.
Something like this?
How could you possibly know?
Let's go!
Hurry up, you're gonna be late.
Hey.
Did you look in my father's bathroom for the money?
No.
Oh, my God.
Nico is gonna kill me.
Give me a break.
The guy sells schwag weed to high school kids, how tough can he be?
- I'm not going to school today.
- Sure you are.
Come on.
Move it.
Have you talked to the boss yet?
- Haven't had a chance.
- I don't do charity work.
Yeah, neither do I.
With this kind of risk...
The President?
Keeping a family under wraps for two weeks?
- We need to get paid.
- I said, I'll take care of it.
Who the hell is this guy, anyway?
His name is Duncan Carlisle.
He's a good man.
You keep saying that, but so far I haven't seen any evidence.
I have. 13 years ago I was working security for a US petrol outfit near the Colombian border.
Got attacked by FARC guerillas.
Held for two months.
FBI sent a team to get us out.
Duncan was the lead negotiator.
So he negotiated a release?
It was a commando raid.
It got ugly.
Freed all the oil men.
Now they're in choppers, ready to go.
When Duncan found out I was being held separately, he came back.
Shot his way in one more time.
Saved my life.
Impressive.
But I still need to get paid.
Morgan.
Morgan.
What are you doing here?
You wouldn't answer my texts or my calls last night.
I need to talk to you.
You really shouldn't be here, okay?
Just go before somebody...
- Boyd, please don't do this right now.
- What's going on?
Why are you acting like this?
Is there somebody else?
No, no there's...
God, no, there's nobody else.
Then just tell me the truth, because I love you.
I think about you every minute of every day.
- So if there's someone else...
- I'm pregnant.
I understand, but, $55 a square foot is a steal.
Comps are at 60.
Oh, okay.
All right.
No, no, I get it.
If you change your mind, give me a call.
Since you won't take my calls
I had to find another way to get your attention.
What the hell are you doing?
That bullet missed my head by five inches.
What are you talking about?
Bad idea to play dumb with me right now, Quentin.
I'm not in the mood.
I have no idea why you're acting this way.
None.
Please, just tell me what happened.
I don't care if you knew, if you gave the order...
It doesn't matter.
- All I care about is what happens next.
- Next?
We're gonna find a way out of this, you and me, so you need to do exactly as I say.
If not, my friends will kill you.
And then...
They're gonna kill your beautiful wife.
It's me.
Something's come up.
I think we should reconsider the decision to terminate the operation.
Because I've just learned that the President is going to remain with Dr. Sanders, so the original plan is still viable.
Yes, I'm positive.
You're safe.
For now.
Good.
That means you're safe, too.
For now.
You realize we're both out on a limb here.
I've just lied to some very powerful, very unforgiving people.
If you do as I say, it won't be a lie for long.
- I found a great hotel in Miami.
- Miami?
For the real estate conference we're going to in a few weeks?
Hey, Brian?
It's Ellen, she's been trying to reach you.
Oh, yeah, right.
I dropped my phone yesterday.
Nightmare.
I told her she could reach me through you.
Yeah, sure.
Oh, go ahead.
You should take that.
Hey, can I borrow your office for two minutes?
- Yeah.
- Thanks.
- Ellen?
- What'd you find?
There's an art fair at a private school called Holly Oak in Bethesda.
Okay, good.
Holly Oak.
What time?
1:30.
Why?
You're not planning on going?
Well, we need to figure out who this man is.
- They're watching us at all times.
- I'll find a way.
- No, Ellen, don't, it's too dangerous.
- I gotta go.
Ellen!
This is strictly off the record.
- Can I say unnamed White House source?
- Unnamed government source.
There's no negotiation, you understand?
- Coffee?
- No.
Thank you.
The President is changing doctors.
His upcoming surgery will take place at Walter Reed Naval Hospital.
That's official?
He's not worried about the political fallout?
He's worried about his health.
After all those sanctimonious speeches about health care reform, the impeccable quality of our nation's public hospitals?
One glitch and out the door.
- You owe me one, Tom.
- Yeah.
- What's your upside on this?
- I'm trying to protect the President.
Make sure his decision's in the best interest of the American people.
I'll be seeing you.
Ellen.
Didn't expect to see you, thought you might take some time off.
Especially after Angela.
Very sad.
I'd rather stay busy, you know?
- How's your schedule?
- Crazy.
Five surgeries, back to back.
Good luck.
Do you know where you get your parking validated?
All right, switch ends.
Pick it up!
Hey.
I need the money back.
The cash you found hidden in the equipment locker?
The beer money?
Are you kidding me?
It wasn't mine, okay?
- I owe a bunch of kids money.
- Well, tough.
- But, Dad...
- Everything that's going on right now?
I don't wanna hear another word.
All right, let's bring it in.
I'm so excited to see the kids' art!
So what's your name, anyway?
Kramer.
Sandrine.
What's up, Jake?
Where you been, on vacation or something?
Hey, Nico, I'm really, really sorry.
I've been super busy with family stuff.
Oh, totally get it.
Yeah, family always comes first.
Absolutely.
Unless, of course, you owe somebody money.
Then, that person comes first.
Make sense?
- Yeah.
Like I said, I'm really sorry.
- I need my money, Jake.
I'll have it soon, I promise.
It's just...
Someone stole it?
So I'm just gonna need a few more days, if that's okay.
Oh, sure.
Totally cool.
Take your time.
- How long you need?
A week?
A month?
- A week would be awesome.
No worries.
What the hell are you doing?
He's getting his ass kicked.
Not our problem.
We stay put, you understand?
- Can I help you?
- Oh.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
I'm fine, I...
I was just staring at these class photos, they're so cute!
- Are you a Holly Oak parent?
- Uh, no, I'm a Holly Oak aunt.
I'm actually looking for my niece, Sawyer?
Sawyer Carlisle?
- She used to do ballet with my youngest.
- Oh, great!
- Have you seen her?
- I did, uh, just a moment ago...
There she is.
Over there.
I hope you and Sawyer have a terrific day.
Thank you.
Sawyer?
Sawyer, is that you?
Who are you?
My name is Jane.
I'm a friend of your father's.
You've grown so much.
I hardly recognized you.
How do you know my dad?
We used to work together.
Jane is a funny name.
Really?
When I was growing up, it was considered very boring.
There were five Janes in my class.
It was like having the name Emma today.
But you want to hear the funniest name of anyone I know?
Marsley.
Marsley?
Yeah.
It's like "parsley", except with an "M."
That is a funny name.
Is your mother here?
Attention, everybody.
It's time for the main event.
So kids, grab your parents, grandparents or special friends, and take them to your classrooms to show them what you've done.
- Want to see my art?
- Yes.
I would love to.
Mr. Sanders!
It's Jake.
You gotta come quick!
Hey!
Jake!
Jake!
Buddy?
Come here.
Oh, my God, look at you.
Too little too late, pops.
Forget lacrosse.
Your kid needs boxing lessons.
I mean, he didn't even get one punch in.
He just stood there like a dumbass.
What was he expecting?
A kiss?
Well, he got up, didn't he?
Sometimes, that's good enough.
Was that good enough for you?
Excuse me?
You seem to relate to this kid.
That mean you're a preppy, suburban punk who used to get his ass kicked, too?
Why are you here?
None of your business.
Look, Kramer, you seem like a nice guy.
But this job we're doing here is not the kind of thing nice guys do.
Which one did you draw?
That is beautiful.
You're such a good artist, Sawyer.
Your mother must be so proud.
What's the matter, honey?
Are you sad because your mother isn't here?
Mommy is sick.
Well, I'm sure the doctor is gonna help make her feel better.
How do you know?
Because that's what doctors do, they help sick people get better.
They've been trying, but...
Do you know what's wrong with her?
Is she in the hospital?
Do you know which hospital?
She's going to be just fine, Sawyer.
I promise.
Hey, I have an idea.
Why don't you draw me a picture?
Would you do that for me?
Okay.
What should I draw?
How about a picture of your family?
- How the hell did this get leaked?
- I'll find out.
Son of a bitch.
"The President's self-serving hypocrisy
"is only surpassed by his shameless cowardice."
Unbelievable, sir.
How about if we turn all this nonsense into a victory?
How do you suggest we do that?
We announce that changing doctors or changing hospitals was never even a consideration, given my unbreakable faith in the public health care system and Dr. Ellen Sanders.
I think you're dead on, sir.
That would completely discredit this journalist and his source, and, most importantly, silence your critics.
Might even make a few new fans.
American people do love bravery.
- Yeah?
- Good news.
The President is livid over the press coverage.
That mean he's sticking with Sanders?
Correct.
When this is over, Duncan, you should consider getting into politics.
You're actually quite good at this.
Mr. Sanders.
Hi.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize anybody was home.
I was looking for Morgan.
My name is Boyd.
I'd like to, um...
If I may...
Can I talk to you about your daughter, sir?
Hi, can I help you?
Yes, I'm looking for someone.
Morgan and I have been dating for three months.
And I wasn't planning on meeting you like this.
But it's time I introduced myself anyway.
Right.
Well.
Nice to meet you.
Sir, I love your daughter.
I dropped out of high school, but I've been working hard to get my career back on track.
I'm working for a construction company, so...
I can definitely support Morgan if we were to get more serious at some point.
Look, what I'm trying to say, Mr. Sanders...
Let me stop you there, son.
Morgan is in high school.
On her way to college.
So the answer is no.
She's too young for marriage.
She's got her whole life in front of her.
- But I love her.
- I'm sure you do.
But it's time to move on.
What if I don't?
You got guts, kid.
I respect that.
But stay away from my daughter.
Never come back to this house again.
Understand?
There.
All done.
That's amazing.
You really are a terrific artist.
That's your mommy, that's you, and that's your daddy?
Mmm-hmm.
What is that?
His heart?
No.
That's his badge.
His badge?
My daddy works for the FBI.
Almost done.
Be there in a few minutes.
If what I've just heard is true, don't bother coming up at all.
Uh-oh.
What did I do now?
I'm not amused, Paul.
Mary, I don't understand, what?
I've just spoken with the White House Physician.
He tells me you're sticking with Dr. Sanders.
Well, she's a terrific surgeon.
The more I thought about it, the more I came to believe this is the right move.
The right move?
For your approval rating or your health?
Madam First Lady, it's a bit more complicated than that.
How about we talk about this later on?
In private?
How about now?
Now sounds even better, darling.
Give us a few moments.
So good to see you, Quentin.
- I...
I just...
- In five minutes, you're gonna get a call from the White House saying the President wants to meet to discuss his upcoming surgery.
He's going to fire you.
Are you sure?
What do I do?
Convince him to change his mind.
More importantly, convince his wife.
The President will be here shortly.
On behalf of the American people, I'd like to thank you.
For what?
For saving the President's life.
If it weren't for you, he might be dead right now.
Thank you.
But I was just doing my job.
- Beautiful painting, isn't it?
- Hello.
It's nice to see you again.
President Garfield.
Served only two hundred days.
Second shortest term ever.
Oh, I didn't know that.
I'm not much of an historian, I'm afraid.
He was assassinated.
In 1881.
Do you know who he was with on the day he was shot?
President Lincoln's son, Robert.
What are the odds?
You aren't talking about the Garfield-Lincoln thing again, are you?
I find the historical coincidence absolutely fascinating.
Dr. Sanders.
Thank you for coming over on such short notice.
- Of course.
- Please.
Have a seat.
You okay, buddy?
Just tell me what happened.
How did it start?
I don't want to talk about it.
Jake.
It's just some kid.
Okay?
It doesn't matter.
Well, fights don't happen out of nowhere.
Was it something you said?
Over a girl?
No.
It was over money.
The beer money?
Yes!
I needed that money.
That's what I was trying to tell you!
Jake, Jake.
I'm sorry.
Jake!
You got a minute?
What's the deal with this guy Kramer?
He's someone I trust.
Someone we can count on.
He's an amateur.
He'll crack under pressure.
He'll do a good job.
I have nothing but respect for you, Dr. Sanders, not only for your skill as a surgeon, but also for the way you have conducted yourself throughout this entire circus.
However, in light of recent events,
I have decided to switch to a surgeon at Walter Reed Naval Hospital.
It would be best if this announcement came from you.
We'll arrange a press conference and you will announce that this is your decision.
That you believe it's in the best interest of your patient, and the hospital, to make this move.
Of course, Mr. President.
If that's what you think is best.
But you are making a mistake.
The reason you want to change doctors is the exact reason you should remain with me.
I caught the error that could have killed you.
I've never lost a patient in surgery.
Ever.
And I don't intend to.
I don't know much about politics, Mr. President.
Or art, Madam First Lady.
But I do know medicine.
What I'm saying is,
I am the best thoracic surgeon you're going to find.
If this were my husband's life, I would want a surgeon who has the confidence in her abilities to say to the most powerful man in the world that he'd be a fool to choose someone else.
Your girl delivered.
Kincaid is staying put.
- So we're back on track?
- Yes.
We're back on track.
I want you to know, it was not my idea to take you out.
That order came from someone else higher up the chain.
I didn't even know about it.
You believe me?
No.
Not for a second.
Why do you have to be such a jerk?
What did you just say?
Okay, look, I know why you told him to stay away, but you didn't have to treat him like dirt, you know.
What the hell are you talking about?
- Boyd.
- Who's Boyd?
Really?
Oh, my God.
Thanks for going by the school today.
Was she happy to see her favorite uncle?
Yeah, she was good.
She was happy, she was smiling.
Kid can draw.
Takes after her mom, no doubt.
Oh, Jake...
Are you okay?
Oh, let me look at you.
Sweetheart.
Can I help you, brother?
Hey, yeah, hope so.
I was hoping to buy some weed.
Weed?
Why you think we have any weed?
A friend told me to check you out.
He said you got the good stuff.
Are you a cop?
No.
What's your friend's name?
Oh, it's uh, Jake.
You want some?
Huh?
Well, it's not really your problem, is it?
Aah!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop, stop.
You stay away from Jake.
You understand?
He works for me now.
Oh, Brian.
I can't take much more of this.
I met his daughter.
Did you find out who he is?
His name is Carlisle.
He's an FBI Agent.
What?
She drew a picture of his badge.
I can't believe you even went there.
How'd you get out of the hospital?
Aren't they watching you?
I slipped away.
Made them think I was in surgery.
Can you do it again?
I think so.
Why?
'Cause, um...
Because, uh...
We're going to escape.
- What?
- Yeah.
I mean, you think he's really going to let us go when this is over?
You do everything he wants, he's still going to kill us.
We can do this.
We can get away.
But we just have to do it soon.
They can't watch everybody, all the time.
They're not perfect, right?
But how do we...
It's not that simple to just run away.
I'll stay behind, I'll act as a decoy.
No.
I'm not leaving you here.
- Listen to me.
Ellen.
- It's dangerous, forget it.
I won't do it.
You know I love you, right?
Of course.
I'm having an affair.
With Samantha.
Samantha?
The woman you work with?
Look...
Why are you telling me this?
Because I want to do the right thing.
For you and for the kids.
Please.
Ellen.
Let me do this.
Previously on Hostages...
Let's do it.
Why are you doing this?
You're going to kill the President of the United States, Ellen.
Otherwise, we will kill your family.
What's going to happen to us?
Beginning tomorrow, you are going to return to your normal lives.
For the next two weeks you will carry on as if nothing is wrong.
We'll be watching you.
Listening to you.
Every move you make, even when we're not with you, we'll be with you.
What's that?
You're going to implant a GPS chip into everyone.
Think of it as an invisible leash.
No one touches Dr. Sanders.
As long as I have your family, you're not going anywhere.
The President was mistakenly given a blood thinner only hours before his scheduled surgery.
I'm here to find out exactly what happened.
We need to end this investigation tonight.
And how are we supposed to do that?
We give them somebody to blame.
It's about Angela.
The President's nurse apparently committed suicide.
You son of a bitch.
You killed her.
- No, you did.
- What?
You failed to convince your friend to confess.
Angela's death is on you.
This guy Nico...
We sold his weed, but never paid him because my father found all the money.
Let's stop pretending, Ryan.
We both know you're not the loving husband you pretend to be.
When is Mommy coming home?
Mommy needs to rest, honey.
So she can get better.
Everything is gonna back just the way it was.
My partners have a very low tolerance for failure.
Mr. President, the internet's buzzing with rumors about that nurse's suicide.
Conspiracy theories, links to terrorist groups...
No mention of aliens?
Sir, choosing a civilian doctor was supposed to be a public relations win.
It's not.
We should cut our losses and get the hell out.
Well, I like Dr. Sanders...
But this whole thing is becoming more complex than I'd hoped.
Quentin, start exploring the best way for us move on.
Without damaging Sanders' reputation.
Or mine.
I'll try to make it today, but I don't think I can...
Like I told you, I'm working on a special assignment.
Well, Daddy loves you too, Sawyer.
More than anything.
Well, you have fun today at the art fair, okay princess?
Make sure you send me a few pictures.
I'll call you later, okay?
- Hey, better eat your breakfast.
- I gotta get ready for school.
- Are you all right?
- No.
I can't stop thinking about Angela.
Come here.
We need to talk.
We need to find out which school is having an art fair today.
What?
An art fair?
Why?
He has a daughter.
Her name is Sawyer.
Her school is having an art fair.
I'll try and track it down at work.
Use someone else's computer in case they're tapping.
I'll call you at 11:15.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I didn't hear back from you last night.
Everything go okay with the nurse?
Yeah.
Yeah, we're good.
Duncan?
I'm at the meeting spot.
Where are you?
Meeting spot?
You just sent me an urgent message.
I didn't send you a message.
Duncan?
- Who ordered the hit?
- Calm down.
It was that bootlicking Chief of Staff, Creasy.
I'll bury that son of a bitch.
Duncan.
Stop.
You need to stay focused.
Think about your daughter.
Your wife.
Remember why we're doing this.
You're right.
It doesn't matter who gave the order.
It only matters why...
The President must be moving on...
Changing surgeons.
- Without Sanders...
- The deal's off.
Which makes us all liabilities.
You, me, Sanders...
Unless we change the President's mind.
Yes, I'd like to speak to Chief of Staff Quentin Creasy.
Tell him it's Rob Halsey.
Mr. Creasy?
I have a Mr. Halsey for you on line two.
Tell him I'm out of the office.
I'm sorry, Mr. Halsey.
The Chief of Staff is unavailable.
I thought Carlisle was supposed to be dead.
- Dr. Sanders.
- Agent Hoffman.
- Can I have a word?
- Sure.
I know you and Angela were close.
Yeah, I just...
I can't believe it.
It's horrible.
Until we find a body there's still hope.
Yeah, you're right, I...
Why were you at her house last night?
We were supposed to meet for a drink and she didn't show up to the bar.
I went to her home because I was concerned.
- About what?
- About Angela.
She was distressed.
We had coffee yesterday and she was just so upset about everything that's happened with the President.
Especially since she was the nurse administering the medication.
She didn't know whether she'd made a mistake or not.
I told her if she thought she was at fault, she should just admit it.
But she...
What?
She didn't know if she could live with the consequences.
I feel terrible.
I should have done more.
Been a better friend.
- I just, I had no idea...
- Don't blame yourself, Doctor.
Something like this?
How could you possibly know?
Let's go!
Hurry up, you're gonna be late.
Hey.
Did you look in my father's bathroom for the money?
No.
Oh, my God.
Nico is gonna kill me.
Give me a break.
The guy sells schwag weed to high school kids, how tough can he be?
- I'm not going to school today.
- Sure you are.
Come on.
Move it.
Have you talked to the boss yet?
- Haven't had a chance.
- I don't do charity work.
Yeah, neither do I.
With this kind of risk...
The President?
Keeping a family under wraps for two weeks?
- We need to get paid.
- I said, I'll take care of it.
Who the hell is this guy, anyway?
His name is Duncan Carlisle.
He's a good man.
You keep saying that, but so far I haven't seen any evidence.
I have. 13 years ago I was working security for a US petrol outfit near the Colombian border.
Got attacked by FARC guerillas.
Held for two months.
FBI sent a team to get us out.
Duncan was the lead negotiator.
So he negotiated a release?
It was a commando raid.
It got ugly.
Freed all the oil men.
Now they're in choppers, ready to go.
When Duncan found out I was being held separately, he came back.
Shot his way in one more time.
Saved my life.
Impressive.
But I still need to get paid.
Morgan.
Morgan.
What are you doing here?
You wouldn't answer my texts or my calls last night.
I need to talk to you.
You really shouldn't be here, okay?
Just go before somebody...
- Boyd, please don't do this right now.
- What's going on?
Why are you acting like this?
Is there somebody else?
No, no there's...
God, no, there's nobody else.
Then just tell me the truth, because I love you.
I think about you every minute of every day.
- So if there's someone else...
- I'm pregnant.
I understand, but, $55 a square foot is a steal.
Comps are at 60.
Oh, okay.
All right.
No, no, I get it.
If you change your mind, give me a call.
Since you won't take my calls
I had to find another way to get your attention.
What the hell are you doing?
That bullet missed my head by five inches.
What are you talking about?
Bad idea to play dumb with me right now, Quentin.
I'm not in the mood.
I have no idea why you're acting this way.
None.
Please, just tell me what happened.
I don't care if you knew, if you gave the order...
It doesn't matter.
- All I care about is what happens next.
- Next?
We're gonna find a way out of this, you and me, so you need to do exactly as I say.
If not, my friends will kill you.
And then...
They're gonna kill your beautiful wife.
It's me.
Something's come up.
I think we should reconsider the decision to terminate the operation.
Because I've just learned that the President is going to remain with Dr. Sanders, so the original plan is still viable.
Yes, I'm positive.
You're safe.
For now.
Good.
That means you're safe, too.
For now.
You realize we're both out on a limb here.
I've just lied to some very powerful, very unforgiving people.
If you do as I say, it won't be a lie for long.
- I found a great hotel in Miami.
- Miami?
For the real estate conference we're going to in a few weeks?
Hey, Brian?
It's Ellen, she's been trying to reach you.
Oh, yeah, right.
I dropped my phone yesterday.
Nightmare.
I told her she could reach me through you.
Yeah, sure.
Oh, go ahead.
You should take that.
Hey, can I borrow your office for two minutes?
- Yeah.
- Thanks.
- Ellen?
- What'd you find?
There's an art fair at a private school called Holly Oak in Bethesda.
Okay, good.
Holly Oak.
What time?
1:30.
Why?
You're not planning on going?
Well, we need to figure out who this man is.
- They're watching us at all times.
- I'll find a way.
- No, Ellen, don't, it's too dangerous.
- I gotta go.
Ellen!
This is strictly off the record.
- Can I say unnamed White House source?
- Unnamed government source.
There's no negotiation, you understand?
- Coffee?
- No.
Thank you.
The President is changing doctors.

Five surgeries, back to back.

Pick it up!
Hey.
I need the money back.
The cash you found hidden in the equipment locker?
The beer money?
Are you kidding me?
It wasn't mine, okay?
- I owe a bunch of kids money.
- Well, tough.
- But, Dad...
- Everything that's going on right now?
I don't wanna hear another word.
All right, let's bring it in.
I'm so excited to see the kids' art!
So what's your name, anyway?
Kramer.
Sandrine.
What's up, Jake?
Where you been, on vacation or something?
Hey, Nico, I'm really, really sorry.
I've been super busy with family stuff.
Oh, totally get it.
Yeah, family always comes first.
Absolutely.
Unless, of course, you owe somebody money.
Then, that person comes first.
Make sense?
- Yeah.
Like I said, I'm really sorry.
- I need my money, Jake.
I'll have it soon, I promise.
It's just...
Someone stole it?
So I'm just gonna need a few more days, if that's okay.
Oh, sure.
Totally cool.
Take your time.
- How long you need?
A week?
A month?
- A week would be awesome.
No worries.
What the hell are you doing?
He's getting his ass kicked.
Not our problem.
We stay put, you understand?
- Can I help you?
- Oh.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
I'm fine, I...
I was just staring at these class photos, they're so cute!
- Are you a Holly Oak parent?
- Uh, no, I'm a Holly Oak aunt.
I'm actually looking for my niece, Sawyer?
Sawyer Carlisle?
- She used to do ballet with my youngest.
- Oh, great!
- Have you seen her?
- I did, uh, just a moment ago...
There she is.
Over there.
I hope you and Sawyer have a terrific day.
Thank you.
Sawyer?
Sawyer, is that you?
Who are you?
My name is Jane.
I'm a friend of your father's.
You've grown so much.
I hardly recognized you.
How do you know my dad?
We used to work together.
Jane is a funny name.
Really?
When I was growing up, it was considered very boring.
There were five Janes in my class.
It was like having the name Emma today.
But you want to hear the funniest name of anyone I know?
Marsley.
Marsley?
Yeah.
It's like "parsley", except with an "M."
That is a funny name.
Is your mother here?
Attention, everybody.
It's time for the main event.
So kids, grab your parents, grandparents or special friends, and take them to your classrooms to show them what you've done.
- Want to see my art?
- Yes.
I would love to.
Mr. Sanders!
It's Jake.
You gotta come quick!
Hey!
Jake!
Jake!
Buddy?
Come here.
Oh, my God, look at you.
Too little too late, pops.
Forget lacrosse.
Your kid needs boxing lessons.
I mean, he didn't even get one punch in.
He just stood there like a dumbass.
What was he expecting?
A kiss?
Well, he got up, didn't he?
Sometimes, that's good enough.
Was that good enough for you?
Excuse me?
You seem to relate to this kid.
That mean you're a preppy, suburban punk who used to get his ass kicked, too?
Why are you here?
None of your business.
Look, Kramer, you seem like a nice guy.
But this job we're doing here is not the kind of thing nice guys do.
Which one did you draw?
That is beautiful.
You're such a good artist, Sawyer.
Your mother must be so proud.
What's the matter, honey?
Are you sad because your mother isn't here?
Mommy is sick.
Well, I'm sure the doctor is gonna help make her feel better.
How do you know?
Because that's what doctors do, they help sick people get better.
They've been trying, but...
Do you know what's wrong with her?
Is she in the hospital?
Do you know which hospital?
She's going to be just fine, Sawyer.
I promise.
Hey, I have an idea.
Why don't you draw me a picture?
Would you do that for me?
Okay.
What should I draw?
How about a picture of your family?
- How the hell did this get leaked?
- I'll find out.
Son of a bitch.
"The President's self-serving hypocrisy
"is only surpassed by his shameless cowardice."
Unbelievable, sir.
How about if we turn all this nonsense into a victory?
How do you suggest we do that?
We announce that changing doctors or changing hospitals was never even a consideration, given my unbreakable faith in the public health care system and Dr. Ellen Sanders.
I think you're dead on, sir.
That would completely discredit this journalist and his source, and, most importantly, silence your critics.
Might even make a few new fans.
American people do love bravery.
- Yeah?
- Good news.
The President is livid over the press coverage.
That mean he's sticking with Sanders?
Correct.
When this is over, Duncan, you should consider getting into politics.
You're actually quite good at this.
Mr. Sanders.
Hi.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize anybody was home.
I was looking for Morgan.
My name is Boyd.
I'd like to, um...
If I may...
Can I talk to you about your daughter, sir?
Hi, can I help you?
Yes, I'm looking for someone.
Morgan and I have been dating for three months.
And I wasn't planning on meeting you like this.
But it's time I introduced myself anyway.
Right.
Well.
Nice to meet you.
Sir, I love your daughter.
I dropped out of high school, but I've been working hard to get my career back on track.
I'm working for a construction company, so...
I can definitely support Morgan if we were to get more serious at some point.
Look, what I'm trying to say, Mr. Sanders...
Let me stop you there, son.
Morgan is in high school.
On her way to college.
So the answer is no.
She's too young for marriage.
She's got her whole life in front of her.
- But I love her.
- I'm sure you do.
But it's time to move on.
What if I don't?
You got guts, kid.
I respect that.
But stay away from my daughter.
Never come back to this house again.
Understand?
There.
All done.
That's amazing.
You really are a terrific artist.
That's your mommy, that's you, and that's your daddy?
Mmm-hmm.
What is that?
His heart?
No.
That's his badge.
His badge?
My daddy works for the FBI.
Almost done.
Be there in a few minutes.
If what I've just heard is true, don't bother coming up at all.
Uh-oh.
What did I do now?
I'm not amused, Paul.
Mary, I don't understand, what?
I've just spoken with the White House Physician.
He tells me you're sticking with Dr. Sanders.
Well, she's a terrific surgeon.
The more I thought about it, the more I came to believe this is the right move.
The right move?
For your approval rating or your health?
Madam First Lady, it's a bit more complicated than that.
How about we talk about this later on?
In private?
How about now?
Now sounds even better, darling.
Give us a few moments.
So good to see you, Quentin.
- I...
I just...
- In five minutes, you're gonna get a call from the White House saying the President wants to meet to discuss his upcoming surgery.
He's going to fire you.
Are you sure?
What do I do?
Convince him to change his mind.
More importantly, convince his wife.
The President will be here shortly.
On behalf of the American people, I'd like to thank you.
For what?
For saving the President's life.
If it weren't for you, he might be dead right now.
Thank you.
But I was just doing my job.
- Beautiful painting, isn't it?
- Hello.
It's nice to see you again.
President Garfield.
Served only two hundred days.
Second shortest term ever.
Oh, I didn't know that.
I'm not much of an historian, I'm afraid.
He was assassinated.
In 1881.
Do you know who he was with on the day he was shot?
President Lincoln's son, Robert.
What are the odds?
You aren't talking about the Garfield-Lincoln thing again, are you?
I find the historical coincidence absolutely fascinating.
Dr. Sanders.
Thank you for coming over on such short notice.
- Of course.
- Please.
Have a seat.
You okay, buddy?
Just tell me what happened.
How did it start?
I don't want to talk about it.
Jake.
It's just some kid.
Okay?
It doesn't matter.
Well, fights don't happen out of nowhere.
Was it something you said?
Over a girl?
No.
It was over money.
The beer money?
Yes!
I needed that money.
That's what I was trying to tell you!
Jake, Jake.
I'm sorry.
Jake!
You got a minute?
What's the deal with this guy Kramer?
He's someone I trust.
Someone we can count on.
He's an amateur.
He'll crack under pressure.
He'll do a good job.
I have nothing but respect for you, Dr. Sanders, not only for your skill as a surgeon, but also for the way you have conducted yourself throughout this entire circus.
However, in light of recent events,
I have decided to switch to a surgeon at Walter Reed Naval Hospital.
It would be best if this announcement came from you.
We'll arrange a press conference and you will announce that this is your decision.
That you believe it's in the best interest of your patient, and the hospital, to make this move.
Of course, Mr. President.
If that's what you think is best.
But you are making a mistake.
The reason you want to change doctors is the exact reason you should remain with me.
I caught the error that could have killed you.
I've never lost a patient in surgery.
Ever.
And I don't intend to.
I don't know much about politics, Mr. President.
Or art, Madam First Lady.
But I do know medicine.
What I'm saying is,
I am the best thoracic surgeon you're going to find.
If this were my husband's life, I would want a surgeon who has the confidence in her abilities to say to the most powerful man in the world that he'd be a fool to choose someone else.
Your girl delivered.
Kincaid is staying put.
- So we're back on track?
- Yes.
We're back on track.
I want you to know, it was not my idea to take you out.
That order came from someone else higher up the chain.
I didn't even know about it.
You believe me?
No.
Not for a second.
Why do you have to be such a jerk?
What did you just say?
Okay, look, I know why you told him to stay away, but you didn't have to treat him like dirt, you know.
What the hell are you talking about?
- Boyd.
- Who's Boyd?
Really?
Oh, my God.
Thanks for going by the school today.
Was she happy to see her favorite uncle?
Yeah, she was good.
She was happy, she was smiling.
Kid can draw.
Takes after her mom, no doubt.
Oh, Jake...
Are you okay?
Oh, let me look at you.
Sweetheart.
Can I help you, brother?
Hey, yeah, hope so.
I was hoping to buy some weed.
Weed?
Why you think we have any weed?
A friend told me to check you out.
He said you got the good stuff.
Are you a cop?
No.
What's your friend's name?
Oh, it's uh, Jake.
You want some?
Huh?
Well, it's not really your problem, is it?
Aah!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop, stop.
You stay away from Jake.
You understand?
He works for me now.
Oh, Brian.
I can't take much more of this.
I met his daughter.
Did you find out who he is?
His name is Carlisle.
He's an FBI Agent.
What?
She drew a picture of his badge.
I can't believe you even went there.
How'd you get out of the hospital?
Aren't they watching you?
I slipped away.
Made them think I was in surgery.
Can you do it again?
I think so.
Why?
'Cause, um...
Because, uh...
We're going to escape.
- What?
- Yeah.
I mean, you think he's really going to let us go when this is over?
You do everything he wants, he's still going to kill us.
We can do this.
We can get away.
But we just have to do it soon.
They can't watch everybody, all the time.
They're not perfect, right?
But how do we...
It's not that simple to just run away.
I'll stay behind, I'll act as a decoy.
No.
I'm not leaving you here.
- Listen to me.
Ellen.
- It's dangerous, forget it.
I won't do it.
You know I love you, right?
Of course.
I'm having an affair.
With Samantha.
Samantha?
The woman you work with?
Look...
Why are you telling me this?
Because I want to do the right thing.
For you and for the kids.
Please.
Ellen.
Let me do this.
Previously on Hostages...
Let's do it.
Why are you doing this?
You're going to kill the President of the United States, Ellen.
Otherwise, we will kill your family.
What's going to happen to us?
Beginning tomorrow, you are going to return to your normal lives.
For the next two weeks you will carry on as if nothing is wrong.
We'll be watching you.
Listening to you.
Every move you make, even when we're not with you, we'll be with you.
What's that?
You're going to implant a GPS chip into everyone.
Think of it as an invisible leash.
No one touches Dr. Sanders.
As long as I have your family, you're not going anywhere.
The President was mistakenly given a blood thinner only hours before his scheduled surgery.
I'm here to find out exactly what happened.
We need to end this investigation tonight.
And how are we supposed to do that?
We give them somebody to blame.
It's about Angela.
The President's nurse apparently committed suicide.
You son of a bitch.
You killed her.
- No, you did.
- What?
You failed to convince your friend to confess.
Angela's death is on you.
This guy Nico...
We sold his weed, but never paid him because my father found all the money.
Let's stop pretending, Ryan.
We both know you're not the loving husband you pretend to be.
When is Mommy coming home?
Mommy needs to rest, honey.
So she can get better.
Everything is gonna back just the way it was.
My partners have a very low tolerance for failure.
Mr. President, the internet's buzzing with rumors about that nurse's suicide.
Conspiracy theories, links to terrorist groups...
No mention of aliens?
Sir, choosing a civilian doctor was supposed to be a public relations win.
It's not.
We should cut our losses and get the hell out.
Well, I like Dr. Sanders...
But this whole thing is becoming more complex than I'd hoped.
Quentin, start exploring the best way for us move on.
Without damaging Sanders' reputation.
Or mine.
I'll try to make it today, but I don't think I can...
Like I told you, I'm working on a special assignment.
Well, Daddy loves you too, Sawyer.
More than anything.
Well, you have fun today at the art fair, okay princess?
Make sure you send me a few pictures.
I'll call you later, okay?
- Hey, better eat your breakfast.
- I gotta get ready for school.
- Are you all right?
- No.
I can't stop thinking about Angela.
Come here.
We need to talk.
We need to find out which school is having an art fair today.
What?
An art fair?
Why?
He has a daughter.
Her name is Sawyer.
Her school is having an art fair.
I'll try and track it down at work.
Use someone else's computer in case they're tapping.
I'll call you at 11:15.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I didn't hear back from you last night.
Everything go okay with the nurse?
Yeah.
Yeah, we're good.
Duncan?
I'm at the meeting spot.
Where are you?
Meeting spot?
You just sent me an urgent message.
I didn't send you a message.
Duncan?
- Who ordered the hit?
- Calm down.
It was that bootlicking Chief of Staff, Creasy.
I'll bury that son of a bitch.
Duncan.
Stop.
You need to stay focused.
Think about your daughter.
Your wife.
Remember why we're doing this.
You're right.
It doesn't matter who gave the order.
It only matters why...
The President must be moving on...
Changing surgeons.
- Without Sanders...
- The deal's off.
Which makes us all liabilities.
You, me, Sanders...
Unless we change the President's mind.
Yes, I'd like to speak to Chief of Staff Quentin Creasy.
Tell him it's Rob Halsey.
Mr. Creasy?
I have a Mr. Halsey for you on line two.
Tell him I'm out of the office.
I'm sorry, Mr. Halsey.
The Chief of Staff is unavailable.
I thought Carlisle was supposed to be dead.
- Dr. Sanders.
- Agent Hoffman.
- Can I have a word?
- Sure.
I know you and Angela were close.
Yeah, I just...
I can't believe it.
It's horrible.
Until we find a body there's still hope.
Yeah, you're right, I...
Why were you at her house last night?
We were supposed to meet for a drink and she didn't show up to the bar.
I went to her home because I was concerned.
- About what?
- About Angela.
She was distressed.
We had coffee yesterday and she was just so upset about everything that's happened with the President.
Especially since she was the nurse administering the medication.
She didn't know whether she'd made a mistake or not.
I told her if she thought she was at fault, she should just admit it.
But she...
What?
She didn't know if she could live with the consequences.
I feel terrible.
I should have done more.
Been a better friend.
- I just, I had no idea...
- Don't blame yourself, Doctor.
Something like this?
How could you possibly know?
Let's go!
Hurry up, you're gonna be late.
Hey.
Did you look in my father's bathroom for the money?
No.
Oh, my God.
Nico is gonna kill me.
Give me a break.
The guy sells schwag weed to high school kids, how tough can he be?
- I'm not going to school today.
- Sure you are.
Come on.
Move it.
Have you talked to the boss yet?
- Haven't had a chance.
- I don't do charity work.
Yeah, neither do I.
With this kind of risk...
The President?
Keeping a family under wraps for two weeks?
- We need to get paid.
- I said, I'll take care of it.
Who the hell is this guy, anyway?
His name is Duncan Carlisle.
He's a good man.
You keep saying that, but so far I haven't seen any evidence.
I have. 13 years ago I was working security for a US petrol outfit near the Colombian border.
Got attacked by FARC guerillas.
Held for two months.
FBI sent a team to get us out.
Duncan was the lead negotiator.
So he negotiated a release?
It was a commando raid.
It got ugly.
Freed all the oil men.
Now they're in choppers, ready to go.
When Duncan found out I was being held separately, he came back.
Shot his way in one more time.
Saved my life.
Impressive.
But I still need to get paid.
Morgan.
Morgan.
What are you doing here?
You wouldn't answer my texts or my calls last night.
I need to talk to you.
You really shouldn't be here, okay?
Just go before somebody...
- Boyd, please don't do this right now.
- What's going on?
Why are you acting like this?
Is there somebody else?
No, no there's...
God, no, there's nobody else.
Then just tell me the truth, because I love you.
I think about you every minute of every day.
- So if there's someone else...
- I'm pregnant.
I understand, but, $55 a square foot is a steal.
Comps are at 60.
Oh, okay.
All right.
No, no, I get it.
If you change your mind, give me a call.
Since you won't take my calls
I had to find another way to get your attention.
What the hell are you doing?
That bullet missed my head by five inches.
What are you talking about?
Bad idea to play dumb with me right now, Quentin.
I'm not in the mood.
I have no idea why you're acting this way.
None.
Please, just tell me what happened.
I don't care if you knew, if you gave the order...
It doesn't matter.
- All I care about is what happens next.
- Next?
We're gonna find a way out of this, you and me, so you need to do exactly as I say.
If not, my friends will kill you.
And then...
They're gonna kill your beautiful wife.
It's me.
Something's come up.
I think we should reconsider the decision to terminate the operation.
Because I've just learned that the President is going to remain with Dr. Sanders, so the original plan is still viable.
Yes, I'm positive.
You're safe.
For now.
Good.
That means you're safe, too.
For now.
You realize we're both out on a limb here.
I've just lied to some very powerful, very unforgiving people.
If you do as I say, it won't be a lie for long.
- I found a great hotel in Miami.
- Miami?
For the real estate conference we're going to in a few weeks?
Hey, Brian?
It's Ellen, she's been trying to reach you.
Oh, yeah, right.
I dropped my phone yesterday.
Nightmare.
I told her she could reach me through you.
Yeah, sure.
Oh, go ahead.
You should take that.
Hey, can I borrow your office for two minutes?
- Yeah.
- Thanks.
- Ellen?
- What'd you find?
There's an art fair at a private school called Holly Oak in Bethesda.
Okay, good.
Holly Oak.
What time?
1:30.
Why?
You're not planning on going?
Well, we need to figure out who this man is.
- They're watching us at all times.
- I'll find a way.
- No, Ellen, don't, it's too dangerous.
- I gotta go.
Ellen!
This is strictly off the record.
- Can I say unnamed White House source?
- Unnamed government source.
There's no negotiation, you understand?
- Coffee?
- No.
Thank you.
The President is changing doctors.
His upcoming surgery will take place at Walter Reed Naval Hospital.
That's official?
He's not worried about the political fallout?
He's worried about his health.
After all those sanctimonious speeches about health care reform, the impeccable quality of our nation's public hospitals?
One glitch and out the door.
- You owe me one, Tom.
- Yeah.
- What's your upside on this?
- I'm trying to protect the President.
Make sure his decision's in the best interest of the American people.
I'll be seeing you.
Ellen.
Didn't expect to see you, thought you might take some time off.
Especially after Angela.
Very sad.
I'd rather stay busy, you know?
- How's your schedule?
- Crazy.
Five surgeries, back to back.
Good luck.
Do you know where you get your parking validated?
All right, switch ends.
Pick it up!
Hey.
I need the money back.
The cash you found hidden in the equipment locker?
The beer money?
Are you kidding me?
It wasn't mine, okay?
- I owe a bunch of kids money.
- Well, tough.
- But, Dad...
- Everything that's going on right now?
I don't wanna hear another word.
All right, let's bring it in.
I'm so excited to see the kids' art!
So what's your name, anyway?
Kramer.
Sandrine.
What's up, Jake?
Where you been, on vacation or something?
Hey, Nico, I'm really, really sorry.
I've been super busy with family stuff.
Oh, totally get it.
Yeah, family always comes first.
Absolutely.
Unless, of course, you owe somebody money.
Then, that person comes first.
Make sense?
- Yeah.
Like I said, I'm really sorry.
- I need my money, Jake.
I'll have it soon, I promise.
It's just...
Someone stole it?
So I'm just gonna need a few more days, if that's okay.
Oh, sure.
Totally cool.
Take your time.
- How long you need?
A week?
A month?
- A week would be awesome.
No worries.
What the hell are you doing?
He's getting his ass kicked.
Not our problem.
We stay put, you understand?
- Can I help you?
- Oh.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
I'm fine, I...
I was just staring at these class photos, they're so cute!
- Are you a Holly Oak parent?
- Uh, no, I'm a Holly Oak aunt.
I'm actually looking for my niece, Sawyer?
Sawyer Carlisle?
- She used to do ballet with my youngest.
- Oh, great!
- Have you seen her?
- I did, uh, just a moment ago...
There she is.
Over there.
I hope you and Sawyer have a terrific day.
Thank you.
Sawyer?
Sawyer, is that you?
Who are you?
My name is Jane.
I'm a friend of your father's.
You've grown so much.
I hardly recognized you.
How do you know my dad?
We used to work together.
Jane is a funny name.
Really?
When I was growing up, it was considered very boring.

It was like having the name Emma today.
But you want to hear the funniest name of anyone I know?
Marsley.
Marsley?
Yeah.
It's like "parsley", except with an "M."
That is a funny name.
Is your mother here?
Attention, everybody.
It's time for the main event.
So kids, grab your parents, grandparents or special friends, and take them to your classrooms to show them what you've done.
- Want to see my art?
- Yes.
I would love to.
Mr. Sanders!
It's Jake.
You gotta come quick!
Hey!
Jake!
Jake!
Buddy?
Come here.
Oh, my God, look at you.
Too little too late, pops.
Forget lacrosse.
Your kid needs boxing lessons.
I mean, he didn't even get one punch in.
He just stood there like a dumbass.
What was he expecting?
A kiss?
Well, he got up, didn't he?
Sometimes, that's good enough.
Was that good enough for you?

Look, Kramer, you seem like a nice guy.
But this job we're doing here is not the kind of thing nice guys do.
Which one did you draw?
That is beautiful.
You're such a good artist, Sawyer.
Your mother must be so proud.
What's the matter, honey?
Are you sad because your mother isn't here?
Mommy is sick.
Well, I'm sure the doctor is gonna help make her feel better.
How do you know?
Because that's what doctors do, they help sick people get better.
They've been trying, but...
Do you know what's wrong with her?
Is she in the hospital?
Do you know which hospital?
She's going to be just fine, Sawyer.
I promise.
Hey, I have an idea.
Why don't you draw me a picture?
Would you do that for me?
Okay.
What should I draw?
How about a picture of your family?
- How the hell did this get leaked?
- I'll find out.
Son of a bitch.
"The President's self-serving hypocrisy

You're actually quite good at this.
Mr. Sanders.
Hi.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize anybody was home.
I was looking for Morgan.
My name is Boyd.
I'd like to, um...
If I may...
Can I talk to you about your daughter, sir?
Hi, can I help you?
Yes, I'm looking for someone.
Morgan and I have been dating for three months.
And I wasn't planning on meeting you like this.
But it's time I introduced myself anyway.
Right.
Well.
Nice to meet you.
Sir, I love your daughter.
I dropped out of high school, but I've been working hard to get my career back on track.
I'm working for a construction company, so...
I can definitely support Morgan if we were to get more serious at some point.
Look, what I'm trying to say, Mr. Sanders...
Let me stop you there, son.
Morgan is in high school.
On her way to college.
So the answer is no.
She's too young for marriage.
She's got her whole life in front of her.
- But I love her.
- I'm sure you do.
But it's time to move on.
What if I don't?
You got guts, kid.
I respect that.
But stay away from my daughter.
Never come back to this house again.
Understand?
There.
All done.
That's amazing.
You really are a terrific artist.
That's your mommy, that's you, and that's your daddy?
Mmm-hmm.
What is that?
His heart?
No.
That's his badge.
His badge?
My daddy works for the FBI.
Almost done.
Be there in a few minutes.
If what I've just heard is true, don't bother coming up at all.
Uh-oh.
What did I do now?
I'm not amused, Paul.
Mary, I don't understand, what?
I've just spoken with the White House Physician.
He tells me you're sticking with Dr. Sanders.
Well, she's a terrific surgeon.
The more I thought about it, the more I came to believe this is the right move.
The right move?
For your approval rating or your health?
Madam First Lady, it's a bit more complicated than that.
How about we talk about this later on?
In private?
How about now?
Now sounds even better, darling.
Give us a few moments.
So good to see you, Quentin.
- I...
I just...
- In five minutes, you're gonna get a call from the White House saying the President wants to meet to discuss his upcoming surgery.
He's going to fire you.
Are you sure?
What do I do?
Convince him to change his mind.
More importantly, convince his wife.
The President will be here shortly.
On behalf of the American people, I'd like to thank you.
For what?
For saving the President's life.
If it weren't for you, he might be dead right now.
Thank you.
But I was just doing my job.
- Beautiful painting, isn't it?
- Hello.
It's nice to see you again.
President Garfield.
Served only two hundred days.
Second shortest term ever.
Oh, I didn't know that.
I'm not much of an historian, I'm afraid.
He was assassinated.
In 1881.
Do you know who he was with on the day he was shot?
President Lincoln's son, Robert.
What are the odds?
You aren't talking about the Garfield-Lincoln thing again, are you?
I find the historical coincidence absolutely fascinating.
Dr. Sanders.
Thank you for coming over on such short notice.
- Of course.
- Please.
Have a seat.
You okay, buddy?
Just tell me what happened.
How did it start?
I don't want to talk about it.
Jake.
It's just some kid.
Okay?
It doesn't matter.
Well, fights don't happen out of nowhere.
Was it something you said?
Over a girl?
No.
It was over money.
The beer money?
Yes!
I needed that money.
That's what I was trying to tell you!
Jake, Jake.
I'm sorry.
Jake!
You got a minute?
What's the deal with this guy Kramer?
He's someone I trust.
Someone we can count on.
He's an amateur.
He'll crack under pressure.
He'll do a good job.
I have nothing but respect for you, Dr. Sanders, not only for your skill as a surgeon, but also for the way you have conducted yourself throughout this entire circus.
However, in light of recent events,
I have decided to switch to a surgeon at Walter Reed Naval Hospital.
It would be best if this announcement came from you.
We'll arrange a press conference and you will announce that this is your decision.
That you believe it's in the best interest of your patient, and the hospital, to make this move.
Of course, Mr. President.
If that's what you think is best.
But you are making a mistake.
The reason you want to change doctors is the exact reason you should remain with me.
I caught the error that could have killed you.
I've never lost a patient in surgery.
Ever.
And I don't intend to.
I don't know much about politics, Mr. President.
Or art, Madam First Lady.
But I do know medicine.
What I'm saying is,
I am the best thoracic surgeon you're going to find.
If this were my husband's life, I would want a surgeon who has the confidence in her abilities to say to the most powerful man in the world that he'd be a fool to choose someone else.
Your girl delivered.
Kincaid is staying put.
- So we're back on track?
- Yes.
We're back on track.
I want you to know, it was not my idea to take you out.
That order came from someone else higher up the chain.
I didn't even know about it.
You believe me?
No.
Not for a second.
Why do you have to be such a jerk?
What did you just say?
Okay, look, I know why you told him to stay away, but you didn't have to treat him like dirt, you know.
What the hell are you talking about?
- Boyd.
- Who's Boyd?
Really?
Oh, my God.
Thanks for going by the school today.
Was she happy to see her favorite uncle?
Yeah, she was good.
She was happy, she was smiling.
Kid can draw.
Takes after her mom, no doubt.
Oh, Jake...
Are you okay?
Oh, let me look at you.
Sweetheart.
Can I help you, brother?
Hey, yeah, hope so.
I was hoping to buy some weed.
Weed?
Why you think we have any weed?
A friend told me to check you out.
He said you got the good stuff.
Are you a cop?
No.
What's your friend's name?
Oh, it's uh, Jake.
You want some?
Huh?
Well, it's not really your problem, is it?
Aah!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop, stop.
You stay away from Jake.
You understand?
He works for me now.
Oh, Brian.
I can't take much more of this.
I met his daughter.
Did you find out who he is?
His name is Carlisle.
He's an FBI Agent.
What?
She drew a picture of his badge.
I can't believe you even went there.
How'd you get out of the hospital?
Aren't they watching you?
I slipped away.
Made them think I was in surgery.
Can you do it again?
I think so.
Why?
'Cause, um...
Because, uh...
We're going to escape.
- What?
- Yeah.
I mean, you think he's really going to let us go when this is over?
You do everything he wants, he's still going to kill us.
We can do this.
We can get away.
But we just have to do it soon.
They can't watch everybody, all the time.
They're not perfect, right?
But how do we...
It's not that simple to just run away.
I'll stay behind, I'll act as a decoy.
No.
I'm not leaving you here.
- Listen to me.
Ellen.
- It's dangerous, forget it.
I won't do it.
You know I love you, right?
Of course.
I'm having an affair.
With Samantha.
Samantha?
The woman you work with?
Look...
Why are you telling me this?
Because I want to do the right thing.
For you and for the kids.
Please.
Ellen.
Let me do this.
Previously on Hostages...
Let's do it.
(SCREAMING)
ELLEN:
Why are you doing this?
You're going to kill the President of the United States, Ellen.
Otherwise, we will kill your family.
What's going to happen to us?
Beginning tomorrow, you are going to return to your normal lives.
For the next two weeks you will carry on as if nothing is wrong.
We'll be watching you.
Listening to you.
Every move you make, even when we're not with you, we'll be with you.
WOMAN:
What's that?
You're going to implant a GPS chip into everyone.
Think of it as an invisible leash.
No one touches Dr. Sanders.
As long as I have your family, you're not going anywhere.
The President was mistakenly given a blood thinner only hours before his scheduled surgery.
I'm here to find out exactly what happened.
We need to end this investigation tonight.
And how are we supposed to do that?
We give them somebody to blame.
It's about Angela.
REPORTER:
The President's nurse apparently committed suicide.
You son of a bitch.
You killed her.
- No, you did.
- What?
You failed to convince your friend to confess.
Angela's death is on you.
This guy Nico...
We sold his weed, but never paid him because my father found all the money.
Let's stop pretending, Ryan.
We both know you're not the loving husband you pretend to be.
When is Mommy coming home?
Mommy needs to rest, honey.
So she can get better.
Everything is gonna back just the way it was.
My partners have a very low tolerance for failure.
Mr. President, the internet's buzzing with rumors about that nurse's suicide.
Conspiracy theories, links to terrorist groups...
No mention of aliens?
Sir, choosing a civilian doctor was supposed to be a public relations win.
It's not.
We should cut our losses and get the hell out.
Well, I like Dr. Sanders...
But this whole thing is becoming more complex than I'd hoped.
Quentin, start exploring the best way for us move on.
Without damaging Sanders' reputation.
Or mine.
I'll try to make it today, but I don't think I can...
Like I told you, I'm working on a special assignment.
Well, Daddy loves you too, Sawyer.
More than anything.
Well, you have fun today at the art fair, okay princess?
Make sure you send me a few pictures.
I'll call you later, okay?
- Hey, better eat your breakfast.
- I gotta get ready for school.
- Are you all right?
- No.
I can't stop thinking about Angela.
DUNCAN:
Come here.
We need to talk.
We need to find out which school is having an art fair today.
What?
An art fair?
Why?
He has a daughter.
Her name is Sawyer.
Her school is having an art fair.
I'll try and track it down at work.
Use someone else's computer in case they're tapping.
I'll call you at 11:15.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I didn't hear back from you last night.
Everything go okay with the nurse?
Yeah.
Yeah, we're good.
Duncan?
I'm at the meeting spot.
Where are you?
Meeting spot?
You just sent me an urgent message.
I didn't send you a message.
Duncan?
- Who ordered the hit?
- Calm down.
It was that bootlicking Chief of Staff, Creasy.
I'll bury that son of a bitch.
Duncan.
Stop.
You need to stay focused.
Think about your daughter.
Your wife.
Remember why we're doing this.
(SIGHING)
You're right.
It doesn't matter who gave the order.
It only matters why...
The President must be moving on...
Changing surgeons.
- Without Sanders...
- The deal's off.
Which makes us all liabilities.
You, me, Sanders...
Unless we change the President's mind.
Yes, I'd like to speak to Chief of Staff Quentin Creasy.
Tell him it's Rob Halsey.
Mr. Creasy?
I have a Mr. Halsey for you on line two.
Tell him I'm out of the office.
I'm sorry, Mr. Halsey.
The Chief of Staff is unavailable.
I thought Carlisle was supposed to be dead.
- Dr. Sanders.
- Agent Hoffman.
- Can I have a word?
- Sure.
I know you and Angela were close.
Yeah, I just...
I can't believe it.
It's horrible.
Until we find a body there's still hope.
Yeah, you're right, I...
Why were you at her house last night?
We were supposed to meet for a drink and she didn't show up to the bar.
I went to her home because I was concerned.
- About what?
- About Angela.
She was distressed.
We had coffee yesterday and she was just so upset about everything that's happened with the President.
Especially since she was the nurse administering the medication.
She didn't know whether she'd made a mistake or not.
I told her if she thought she was at fault, she should just admit it.
But she...
What?
She didn't know if she could live with the consequences.
I feel terrible.
I should have done more.
Been a better friend.
- I just, I had no idea...
- Don't blame yourself, Doctor.
Something like this?
How could you possibly know?
Let's go!
Hurry up, you're gonna be late.
Hey.
Did you look in my father's bathroom for the money?
No.
Oh, my God.
Nico is gonna kill me.
Give me a break.
The guy sells schwag weed to high school kids, how tough can he be?
- I'm not going to school today.
- Sure you are.
Come on.
Move it.
(GRUNTS)
Have you talked to the boss yet?
- Haven't had a chance.
- I don't do charity work.
Yeah, neither do I.
With this kind of risk...
The President?
Keeping a family under wraps for two weeks?
- We need to get paid.
- I said, I'll take care of it.
Who the hell is this guy, anyway?
His name is Duncan Carlisle.
He's a good man.
You keep saying that, but so far I haven't seen any evidence.
I have. 13 years ago I was working security for a US petrol outfit near the Colombian border.
Got attacked by FARC guerillas.
Held for two months.
FBI sent a team to get us out.
Duncan was the lead negotiator.
So he negotiated a release?
It was a commando raid.
It got ugly.
Freed all the oil men.
Now they're in choppers, ready to go.
When Duncan found out I was being held separately, he came back.
Shot his way in one more time.
Saved my life.
Impressive.
But I still need to get paid.
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
BOYD:
Morgan.
Morgan.
What are you doing here?
You wouldn't answer my texts or my calls last night.
I need to talk to you.
You really shouldn't be here, okay?
Just go before somebody...
- Boyd, please don't do this right now.
- What's going on?
Why are you acting like this?
Is there somebody else?
No, no there's...
God, no, there's nobody else.
Then just tell me the truth, because I love you.
I think about you every minute of every day.
- So if there's someone else...
- I'm pregnant.
I understand, but, $55 a square foot is a steal.
Comps are at 60.
Oh, okay.
All right.
No, no, I get it.
If you change your mind, give me a call.
(CAR ALARM BEEPING)
Since you won't take my calls
I had to find another way to get your attention.
What the hell are you doing?
